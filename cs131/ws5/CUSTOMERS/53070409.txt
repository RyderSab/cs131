Patty's husband is involved in murdering a blind old lady in a home invasion, and receives a prison sentence of 25 years to life. Patty is just an ordinary person who scrapes by holding a series of menial jobs, yet she doggedly and devotedly maintains her loyalty to her husband.<br /><br />Is this woman a saint, or is she throwing her life away? Pregnant at the time of his incarceration she raises a boy who shows little affection toward her, and resists trips to see his father. Yet she drives long distances every week to visit her husband; visits which end up in moments of long silence when topics of conversation dry up. Her life goes by with almost no rewards.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the author never tells us how Patty feels about the crime that her husband has committed. Patty simply slogs on prepared to stand by him for however long it takes for him to gain his freedom. The book covers this entire period, detailing day after day of her very ordinary life.<br /><br />Is this waiting worth the effort? All through the book I kept putting myself in her situation. If my wife committed a serious crime and was locked up possibly for the rest of her life would I show such fortitude? At some point would I not feel that my life was being wasted? Would I not succumb to the temptation to seek comfort with other women, eventually to fall in love with one of them, and divorce my wife?<br /><br />You will have to read the book to see if Patty's wait was worth her extraordinary effort.<br /><br />This is a most unusual story. Although devoid of any excitement, plot twists or turns, it is yet a compelling tale.	2005-05-08
US	53070409	R2JSR7KKW5CB63	1400043085	468189384	Cast of Shadows	Books	5	12	16	N	Y	Fascinating Near Future Novel	The only thing disappointing about this book is that it is Guilfoile's first novel, and I can't rush out and buy any previous novels that he has written.<br /><br />The tale occurs in the near future when human cloning has become legal, and the protagonist is Dr. Moore, a fertility doctor, whose daughter has been raped and murdered. While grieving over the loss he inadvertently comes across a semen sample of the murderer, and impulsively clones a baby from this sample. He wants to follow the child's development so that he can see what his daughter's murderer looks like.<br /><br />Some reviewers have deemed the plot of this book to be preposterous, but seem to not realize that the book takes place some years from now, and continues for another 17 years, and thus essentially qualifies as science fiction. Essential to the plot is a highly sophisticated virtual reality computer program, which  seems to be quite possible given the novel's time frame. After all, I purchased my first computer game in 1984 for my IBM XT, and it was all text, no graphics. Today's games would seem impossible back in those days.<br /><br />When Dr. Moore clones the child named Jason, he has no idea how his life and those around him will be changed. Startling new developments and plot twists kept me glued to the book. It's an exciting thriller with a truly unexpected ending. I have no interest in stories that pass over the edge of credibility, and believe me this book doesn't do that at all. Very highly recommended.	2005-05-06

I own three other good books of international poetry, but none of them has the special features that this one has.<br /><br />The book is divided up into five sections representing the major continents: English speaking world (U.S., Canada, England, and New Zealand (sorry Australia, but you aren't here), Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. At the beginning of each section there is a helpful 10 or 15 page interesting introduction to the poetry of that part of the world. In addition to that there is a brief biography that precedes almost every poet's poems. There is also an interesting introduction to the book itself.<br /><br />Yes, the selection is limited. There are just two U.S. poets - Elizabeth Bishop, and Robert Lowell. Then again I don't buy an international book of poetry to read U.S. poets, as there are plenty of American anthologies. Philip Larkin is it for England; the usual suspects of Borges, Neruda, Paz for Latin America; Akhmatova, Celan, Herbert, Montale, and Seferis are the choices for Europe.<br /><br />But, it is, indeed, an interesting book. Is it accessible -meaning are these poems designed to be read by you and I, and not just other professors in MFA creative writing programs? It certainly is.	2004-09-24

The author, Hilary Mantel, lived there herself for five years, so the reader can place some trust in her description of life there. Frances stay home in their little apartment, and cleans, and watches the giant cockroaches who also live there. A cartographer by profession, she really has no hope of working while living in the Kingdom. The heat is oppressive, and the air is full of blowing dust. All the expatriates make beer and wine in their bathtub because liquor is a big no-no. You never call the police about anything because you might end up in jail yourself. Traffic is horrible, and if you are in an accident you better have enough cash on hand to bribe your way out trouble with the police. When in the store with your husband the clerks will only speak with him, as you, the wife, don't exist. Frances is not timid, and sometimes walks the streets alone, which causes every male driver to shout obscenities at her as he drives by.<br /><br />So far it's an interesting sort of travelogue story, but something sinister seems to be developing in a supposedly unused apartment  directly above the Shore's flat. Then there are her new neighbor friends, a Saudi couple, and a Pakistani family. Are they somehow involved in the strange goings on? A  tale that so far has been about women and their adaptation to the rigors of Saudi life now turns into a thriller.<br /><br />Hilary Mantel writes intelligent novels, and is known for her sometimes black humor. This novel is particularly interesting because of the locale. On finishing it you will probably immediately cross Saudi Arabia off your list of places to visit.	2004-09-24

Charlie, a modestly talented British actress goes to work for Israeli intelligence to try and locate a secretive Palestinian agent. Indoctrinated with a false background of  having a romantic affair with the agent's brother, she plays the role with such determination that she begins to believe this fictional experience. At various points in the novel the reader begins to wonder if Charlie will remain an Israeli spy or begin to identify with the Palestinians.<br /><br />Le Carre skillfully develops the philosophy of the opposing sides. The Palestinian and Israeli characters all feel the righteousness of their cause. Each feels that they are on the side of justice, and even human love, to oppose those whom they feel are motivated by purely evil intent. There is never a consideration of whether the end should justify the means. Anything goes when justice is on your side. You are left with the feeling that there is no resolution to this conflict.<br /><br />JLC is known for his slow, detailed exposition of plot and character. You read over 100 pages before you get a glimmering of what is probably going to happen. There are some thrills in this novel, but don't expect this to be an edge of your seat ride. The first part of the book involves a bombing in Berlin, and the author, in an updated introduction to the book, admits that maybe he should have shortened this section somewhat. I rather like the book's pace, seeing the development of the characters, and the gelling of the Byzantine plot. He's a skilful, intelligent writer, and that's just fine. One outstanding section of the book involves the chief Israeli agent, an expert manipulator, jousting with a British intelligence officer. The description of the pompous, controlling Brit is priceless, and the two characters' verbal fencing is immensely funny.<br /><br />This almost 500 page book could have been written in 200 pages by the typical mystery hack, but I enjoyed every word of this fine novel.n 200 pages by the typical mystery hack, but I enjoyed every word of this fine novel.	2004-09-24

Montefiore has had access to Russian libraries and their vast collections of documents and letters, and has had the good fortune of being able to interview the descendants of some of the principals of the communist government. In reading the book we are privy to letters going forth from Stalin to family members such as daughter Svetlana, and to members of his inner circle: Molotov, Beria, Mikoyan, etc.<br /><br />Here's what I found fascinating about this particular volume of history. We learn about people who have deep affection for family and friends, yet have no difficulty in seeing to the murder of millions of their citizens. It's another example of Hannah Arendt's concept of the banality of evil. Killing people becomes part of one's job, and one often solicits sympathy from the leader for the heavy workday burden of torturing and killing.<br /><br />Extreme paranoia develops during the mid thirties, and people are tortured to confess their supposed plots against the government. When you are tortured for names of accomplices how do you get them to stop hurting you despite the fact that you really have no names to give them? Why you just start giving the names of other innocent people. Those people are then tortured for more names, and you have a sort of chain letter going, that presumably could eliminate everyone in the country if time and manpower were not restricting factors. You read about this and marvel at the horrible silliness of it all.<br /><br />Stalin has often been pictured as a boorish, simple minded thug. Thug yes, but Montefiore informs us that he was actually quite the intellectual possessing a massive library. He constantly read history and the classics, and delighted in conversing with others on the merits of literature, music, and history. And, he had an excellent singing voice.<br /><br />My only small complaint is that Montefiore doesn't find the gross murdering, drinking, and womanizing behavior of Stalin's minions to be enough to tarnish their reputation. He constantly has to apply pejorative adjectives to his references to them: fat, obese, ugly, etc. Anyone 5' tall or less is unremittingly referred to as a midget. We get the physical impression the first time they are described; why keep it up?<br /><br />It doesn't matter how many books you might have read on this era of Russian history, this book is different from them all, and has to be read. And if 800 plus pages seems too long, I should point out that the actual text is only 650 pages.he had an excellent singing voice. <br /> <br />My only small complaint is that Montefiore doesn't find the gross murdering, drinking, and womanizing behavior of Stalin's minions to be enough to tarnish their reputation.

Stella is an amazingly durable lady when you consider the mental and physical pummeling she takes during the course of the story.<br /><br />First of all she finds four people sitting cozily in a circle in an apartment living room. Problem is that they are all dead. Three of the victims are cult suicide victims, but the fourth has a just slightly detectable stab wound to the heart, something that smacks of the work of a professional assassin. Stella's search for the killer takes her into the London underworld, and a mafia type family that the word evil really doesn't begin to describe.<br /><br />In one scene one of the brothers arrives at a warehouse in a limousine to whack someone who is skimming from the business. He trots in complaining that it is too hot and humid for this sort of thing, shoots the guy in the head, and walks out still complaining about the weather.<br /><br />It's a grim world of drugs and prostitution, and Stella cruises through it, getting beaten up periodically even when she is minding her own business. It isn't enough that she gets slugged by humans, she also has a turn with a jungle animal that leaves her quite shaken. Stella doesn't need these sorts of troubles as she is also seeing a shrink for the nightmares she is having about one of her previous cases. And in her love life she is torn between two decent guys.<br /><br />People get whacked, and Stella continues her precarious chase for the murderer. People from Eastern Europe get involved, and matters get darker. Stella drinks a bit too much, but, hey, what would you do if you had her problems? Author Lawrence is also a poet, and he injects many a clever phrase into the narrative. A second book about Stella is out, but to date is only sold in England.

Well she might drink a tad too much sometimes, but, hey, she is my kind of gal. Author Perez-Reverte's talent lies in getting you to root for a woman who is hugely into the drug transportation business, and by that I don't mean driving trucks full of Bayer aspirin. She moves vast amounts of illicit merchandise, by boat, around the Mediterranean coast. Slipping abroad to northern Africa after her drug transporting boy friend is murdered in Mexico by the Mexican drug lords, she works her way up into the business by her exceptional wits and physical capabilities.<br /><br />Teresa Mendoza becomes a corporate executive model,  buying off politicians, and the police while making friends with a Russian drug leader in the area. Soon she is eliminating people she considers offensive by sending them to the local cemetery. And all this time we are saying \\"go, Teresa, go!!\\" What is the matter with us readers? She is a very nasty person. Well I tell you, I finally saw the light when one day she was down on the seashore, and tossed an empty liquor bottle into the surf. Who would do such a thing? Certainly no-one I would emulate.<br /><br />There is one annoying flaw to this otherwise interesting tale. Some never identified reporter is going around getting background information on Teresa, and brief sections of his endeavors keep being inserted into the story. Why? The book could have been written without his tedious interruptions. He is not only nameless, but is totally undeveloped as a character. We learn nothing about him.<br /><br />It's a fun story if you don't mind identifying with drug runners and murderers. And does she live happily ever after? Read and see.	2004-09-04

So how can we come up with a new and unique expert crime investigator? Well, why hasn't anyone ever thought of it before, a police department employee who solves serial killer crimes, and is himself a serial killer? As the eminent Thomas Henry Huxley said after reading Darwin's new book on evolution in 1859,  \\"Why didn't I think of that.?\\"<br /><br /> Our hero (?) is Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter specialist with the Miami police department. Dexter murders people in his free time, and happily admits that he is a sociopath, and, in his own terms, is really not quite human. Though he has a girlfriend, for the sake of appearances, he has no sexual desires, and is incapable of love. He does care for his sister who is a cop, and decides to help her find a serial killer. It's really difficult for him to do this, as he greatly admires the technique of the man he sets out to apprehend.<br /><br />How on earth can we God fearing readers identify with a sociopathic killer, and wish him well? Well, for one thing, he is often quite witty, and that goes a long way with me. And he isn't a boozer or a womanizer -in fact he rejects the advances of a female detective-, and those are kind of good traits I guess. He is also a pretty good sleuth as well he should be, having the same hobby as the man he is chasing.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in how things worked out, as the author injects a bit of farfetchedness into the final part, but this is the first of a series, and I am looking forward to the next book. I am also booking a special appointment with my psychiatrist in an effort to find out why I would actually like this sort of story.	2004-09-04

Author Cheever has his doubts.<br /><br />Meet the Cross family. Husband and father Stuart is a passive soul who likes fine things and has long held his job editing books for a publishing firm. Wife Andie reviews movies, and is positioned somewhat on the edge of a nicely blooming paranoia. They hire a good nanny, well actually a superlative nanny, whom Andie immediately worries about. Why? Well she seems too good, and she is black, and there is the matter of her also black boy friend who may have been in prison, and is he cruising by the place, sort of casing it for some nefarious crime?<br /><br />Andie becomes a  hysteric who insists either she or Stuart should be at home at all times when Nanny Louise is taking care of the children. Stuart is a wimp. In an amusing adventure in a Best Buy type store he proves incompetent in making a choice of a DVD player, and is overwhelmed with worry when either of his daughters is not in his immediate line of vision. Stuart's job is also suddenly jeopardized, and he now has the opportunity to fulfill his lifetime wish to write the All American Novel. His efforts in this regard are humorous if not overly productive.<br /><br />There is a not too happy ending to this story that follows a tragic serious of errors, and we are left wondering if there is any hope for our seemingly effete WASP community as depicted by Cheever. The author portrays two less then well grounded individuals who have difficulty coping with a fairly easy life. Mr. Cheever also uses themes of fate and contingency throughout the book. If small events had not happened when they did, would outcomes be vastly different then they actually were?  Does the movement of Science Fiction writer Ray Bradbury's jungle butterfly really affect the outcome of world events?<br /><br />This was an interesting and different sort of novel, but after finishing it I wondered if it was worth it all.

But, hey, that's the way things work there. People pay the police, things get done, and everybody is happy. Sonchai is not cheered by his present situation, however. His best friend and partner has just been killed in a bizarre event following a murder. His prostitute mother is going to open a bar, and an assertive blonde lady FBI agent has been assigned to help him solve his case. Her American personality and flirtatious manner is somewhat unsettling to his placid Buddhist nature, but they work together somewhat efficiently.<br /><br />Gems, snakes, and an American evildoer make up the plot. The murdered man was a marine who was living with a statuesque Thai woman, and seems to have been involved in the jade trade. Sonchai has some difficulty in pursuing the case because he begins to bump into some of those police payoff areas. The unlikely investigating couple continue their work, however, and it leads to a few choice surprises.<br /><br />This book flows smoothly, and is well written. The characters are well developed, and the reader is happily immersed in Thai culture. Well, Thai culture as it applies to the police, prostitution and drugs that is.

Or maybe it's \\"ridiculous\\", or \\"just plain silly\\".  No question about it,the book does move along swiftly , and provides a lot of thrills and chills, but is all of this really necessary. Author Deaver seems overcome with the idea of \\"things are not as they seem\\",  and tosses away plot reversals as if they were rotten tomatoes.<br /><br />The  bad guy is a magician, err, illusionist, who plays  a whole basketful of tricks on the NYPD. He is out there killing people, and  misdirecting our quadriplegic hero and his staff so that they have a really really hard time figuring out what his intent really is.  His quick change artistry, and magic allow him to escape repeatedly from the clutches of the police, but after awhile the situations become so ridiculous that you want to toss the book across the room and hope it will disappear. Hiding lock picks and other goodies in your hair is too simplistic. Our magic man lacerates his body, and then hides various pieces of equipment in the wounds. He talks in a whisper, probably because of all the razor blades and other tools of the trade tucked away in his mouth.<br /><br />Now let me bring up the point that many other readers of this book seem to have missed. Person A  the evildoer, wants to bring serious grief to person B. Person B is an easily accessible sort of guy, about as easy to accost as you or I would be. So, mystery fans, why doesn't A just go and make B's life miserable. Ultimately none of the shenanigans in this tale have any purpose. The other murders, the thrust and parries between him and the NYPD are pointless. I simply couldn't figure out, in the long run why all this mayhem and running about took place. Well, actually I could. The mission of our evildoer is a gimmick, a Mcguffin, a frayed clothesline of a plot on which Deaver is able to hang his 20 or so plot reversals. The purpose of the book is not to answer a basic question of murder and motive, but to make you dizzy as you try and follow the zig zags of the chase.<br /><br />Deaver is a humorless writer, no comic relief except in one scene where a nitwit assassin fires his rifle through a closed window at a target across the street. Unfortunately the window is bullet proof, and causes the bullets to ricochet causing him some unexpected grief.<br /><br />Our good guy, by the way, is a quadriplegic criminalist, Lincoln Rhyme,  who is aided primarily by the redhead beauty, patrol officer Amelia Sachs. You should note that the author seems duty bound to tell us the hair color of all females in the book; unfortunately we are never provided with this valuable (?) information about the male characters. Rhyme isn't a particularly interesting fellow; he's sort of an irascible Perry Mason type with a more severe disability. It seems that mystery writers have really gone on a search for  more exotic main characters. The drunken PI or the ethically challenged detective seem seem to be passe'. Next I envision a deceased detective who solves crimes using his casket as an office.<br /><br />By the way, one author has come up with an interesting new crime solver.

Chief of Police Charlie Grover has difficulty understanding how anyone could make such careful predictions of tornado touchdowns that he could enter a home just as the storm struck. The average reader will also have such difficulties. So Charlie visits the resident meteorologist whose beauty is described at great length. Charlie, of course, falls immediately in love with her despite author Blanchard's telling us that pulchritudinous Willa has coarse, greasy hair. Now isn't that a neat mental image to carry in your head every time Willa enters the scene? Ms. Blanchard also wants you to know that she had a dictionary of meteorology at her side when she wrote the book so she could insert stuff that sounds like \\"inverted diacritical layers that push the particle potential well above the diaphanous part of the lower troposphere.\\" Hey, I would have loved to get a basic education in tornado-ology, but terms are tossed out and never explained. It's akin to the macho male adventure writer who fills his novel with tedious and gratuitous descriptions of various firearms and munitions.<br />Ms Willa really doesn't contribute a single thing to the solution of the crime. She is just there as a romantic interest for Charlie who is overcome by her greasy hair. Charlie has had a hard life. He is a widower with a painful past, a drunken father, and a teenage rebellious daughter whose head seems to be stuffed with cotton balls.<br />Anyway Charlie is hot on the trail of the \\"debris killer\\", and the author tosses in several very obvious red herrings. This is the sort of tale where you sit there uttering a repeated mantra of \\"I don't believe this.\\" Charlie, for instance, zooms down the highway in an ancient pickup truck. While eating up the miles at 60 plus miles an hour he finds time to use a laptop computer, and holds a flashlight in one hand while hanging onto a roadmap with the other. I mean who needs to steer anyway? Of course he is talking on the CB radio all during this. In a tornado scene one guy flees in a vehicle and another runs away on foot. Which of these two does the tornado fling up into the air? Well the guy in the car, silly. The one on foot easily outruns the twister.<br />Hey, those were the plausible scenes. Elsewhere in the book a seriously injured gentleman is pronounced brain dead.

The book, easily understood by the average lay reader, recounts the history of climate change research starting in about 1896. I should point out that the reader will not take away a reasonably thorough knowledge of global warming science from the book. That is not its purpose. You do learn some elements of the science involved, but essentially you learn how our present day view of climate change came about.<br />Our knowledge of our climate chugged along at a fairly slow rate over the last 108 years for several reasons. A major problem was the essential need for the involvement of a wide variety of scientific specialties. In order to advance the study we have needed the input of physicists, oceanographers, geologists, chemists, meteorologists and even botanists. It is rare that such a diverse group of scientists are needed for an advance in a certain area. Weart describes how all of these researchers started working together in their search for answers to global climate change.<br />The second major difficulty was the lack of certain technologies necessary to achieve meaningful progress. Only recently have we had computers fast enough to process the data in climate modeling programs. Technological advances also had to be made in the equipment needed to take kilometers deep core samples from ice and other strata. Researchers had to learn the hard way that you can't even breathe on ice cores as your breath will contaminate the sample.<br />Weart brings us up to the present and discusses the roles of journalism and politics in advancing and often  hindering the governmental support for the recommendations of scientists. The author has no doubt that our planet is warming up, and notes that literally thousands of scientists now support this conclusion.<br />Again, if you are trying to learn the science basics of this topic, you will need a companion volume to this one for that material.

Daniel isn't legally married, but he is in a committed relationship with another woman and her child. He is smitten with a black married woman, Iris,  that he meets while taking the child to a day care center, and the relationship soon develops. Iris's husband, Hampton, is a cold, aloof banker who is consumed with feelings about race and discrimination.<br />Author Spencer does a good job of showing the difficulties of such a relationship, how they eventually cause anguish for those involved and those they live with. Can anything good come from infidelity? The question is asked not from a standpoint of morality, but from the reference point of psychological stress, and the effect such a relationship ultimately has on the physical, mental, social, and economic life of those touched  by the event. Spencer deals with these issues. His characters are all decent people who perhaps have made unfortunate choices. Daniel's mate, Kate, can be shrewish, and Iris's husband is definitely not the romantic sort. Kate says frequently that Daniel is basically a decent man who has gone astray.<br />But perhaps we might question Spencer's characterization of this foursome. His attribution of flaws to the victimized spouses make it somewhat easier to elicit a few drops of sympathy for the wayward characters, who seem to really have no psychological deficits other than that they are unfaithful. Sure Daniel is passive, and lacks ambition, but Kate has no difficulty with this. How would this tale have spun out if the two victimized people had been a bit less flawed?<br />All in all SP does a good job of portraying the turmoil and destruction  to relationships caused by an extramarital affair. Does everything work out in the end? That you will have to find out for yourself.	2004-05-25

After reading the book one wonders at the lengths to which novelists or poets are willing to go to promote their books.<br />There seem to be two main events that cause the mortification of novelists and poets:<br />1. Book readings. The worst possible thing that can happen at a reading is that nobody shows up for the reading. Or is it? How about when you are told that your book stunk.  Or  there is another author reading with you, and afterwards his book signing line stretches off toward the horizon while in front of you there is nothing but silent open space from here to the Andromeda galaxy.<br />I learned a curious thing about poets. Many of those represented in this book seem to have a drinking problem. Many recount experiences where they mounted the podium in a very inebriated condition, and surprisingly their drunkenness often isn't the humiliating problem. That they are besotted with drink doesn't seem to bother them in the least.<br />2. Media Interviews. The author typically arises at an early hour and is whisked off to a radio station for a 6AM interview. The interviewer typically has never heard of the author or his book, and has no interest in either. Questions posed are about what the author thought of his mother, or are generally of the \\"what is your favorite color\\" type of solicitation.<br />Some of these confessions of mortification are hilarious. One writer was put up for the night by an elderly couple who owned two very large, very hyperactive Boxer dogs. They continually leapt on him and the other guests throughout the evening, their enthusiasm being so great that they frequently lost control of their bladders. They prowled about under the dining table for the entire meal, and you can guess what all they got into there.<br />What mystified me most was that some of the contributors to the book seemed to have misunderstood the assignment. Their responses, in my opinion, had nothing to do with humbling experiences resulting from their trade of writing. The final episode, for instance, recounts the writer's experience being caught in the bathroom indulging in a certain solitary pleasure. Hmmm. A couple of respondents seemed to feel that this was a splendid opportunity to write some experimental literature.<br />All in all a fun read if you are a book lover, and are curious about the lives of those who write them. I am acquainted with about half the authors (such as Margaret Atwood, Carl Hiaasen, William Trevor, Paul Muldoon, Charles Simic, Billy Collins, and Margaret Drabble). The rest were new to me, but no less enjoyable.isunderstood the assignment. Their responses, in my opinion, had nothing to do with humbling experiences resulting from their trade of writing.

The evaluations of such books are often made by people who are pulling their hair and rending their garments over poems that should have been in the books reviewed.<br />First of all, there are few volumes of poetry from the Romantic period in print (A comment to those who are unfamiliar with the term &quot;Romantic&quot; in reference to an historical period. This is not a book of &quot;love poems&quot;; it is a book of poems written during the period of roughly 1795 to 1830.) The only way that one who is interested in poems from this era can build a collection of them is to buy more than one book. I know of no single book that can meet an expectation of completeness. Therefore it is silly to get into this type of debate.<br />What this book does provide is 1000 pages representing the major, and many minor poets of the period.<br />For those who are not serious scholars it also has three important extra features:<br />1. It provides an informative introduction to the poetry.<br />2. It provides about 150 pages of notes on the poems. To me this is a most useful aid to reading, and I am disappointed when an anthology of poetry from a long gone era does not provide it. The notes provide interpretations and explanations of obsolete English terms, classical and obscure literary references, and, in the case of this book, some interesting comments on various lines in the poem.<br />3. It provides brief biographies of the poets.<br />What is unusual in the book is that it presents the poems according to various themes such as &quot;Man and Nature&quot;, The Romantic Sonnet&quot;, and &quot;Protest and Politics&quot;. You, as I, may prefer the simple technique of having the contents laid out by poets in alphabetical order, but fortunately there is an index of each poet with all of that author's poems listed under his/her name. This method of organizing the book isn't any less screwy than the one found in &quot;The New Oxfod Book of Romantic Period Verse&quot;, in which each section is by year, starting with the poems written in 1785. Thus one poet's works my be spread throughout a huge chunk of the book.<br />There is a lot of poetry in this book, but if you really, really want to encompass the period you have to buy more books.<br />To the best of my knowledge those in print at reasonable cost are:<br />1.The New Oxford Book of Romantic Period Verse. It is annotated.<br />2.English Romantic Poetry An Anthology. This is a Dover Publication. A smaller book of only 240 pages, and typically, for Dover books, it is not annotated. The good  news is that it is dirt cheap.<br />3. The Norton Anthology of Poetry. There are about 250 pages of Romantic Poetry in this massive 2000 page book. The advantage of this volume is that you are getting an annotated book of poems ranging from the beginning of English poetry to the present.

After all that word generally connotes a book that is tedious, dry  and full of obscure jargon. This is a different book, however. It is indeed a sprightly introduction to poetry that informs and entertains. It has sections on Irony, Tone, Words, Metaphors, Sound, Rhythm, Form, Symbol, Myth, and Narrative, just to mention a few.<br />The discussion of each topic is illustrated by the provision of relevant poems. The poems are generally analyzed, and the reader is asked pertinent questions about them.  I can't praise the authors enough for their choice of poems. Most are relatively brief works, but they are excellent examples of the topic at hand.<br />What could be a better poem exemplifying Irony than this little classic deploring child labor written by Sarah N. Cleghorn in 1917:<br />The golf links lie so near the mill/That almost every day/The laboring children can look out/ And see the men at play.<br />There are many other goodies in this book:<br />1. A chapter that provides poems and brief critical essays on the works of Langston Hughes, and Emily Dickinson.<br />2. A section that provides brief but informative biographies of many of the poets represented in the book.<br />3. A large chapter of more poems for reading and enjoying. These are very accomplished poems that are generally very accessible to the general reader.<br />4. A section on literary criticism. Yes, I know that is a dreaded term, but the authors do a good job of clearly  presenting the material -even when deconstructionism is the topic- and provide brief extracts from noted literary critics.<br />5. At the end of the book is a convenient glossary of literary terms.<br />6. For those who become enthused about writing poetry there is a chapter covering this topic.<br />There are other introductory books on the market (such as \\"The Poetry Reader's Toolkit\\", by Marc Polonsky, and the venerable \\"Understanding Poetry\\" by Cleanth Brooks), but this is a truly astounding work.

Not that there is anything wrong with that, mind you. This collection of slightly bent individuals dwells in the environs of the poetry department of an eastern university. The main character, Anabelle, is an undergraduate assistant to a celebrity poetry professor named \\"Z\\". Anabelle so worships poetry and her boss that no assignment is too trivial and demeaning for her. Then there is her boyfriend who is a Joyce buff who makes her dress like Nora and do things to her privates while he ogles her and types his great novel. We are then subjected to passages (mercifully brief) from his great work that bring to mind classrom writings from my 3rd grade classmates.<br />The inhabitants of  \\"Apprentice\\" (which include a poet named Braun Brown) variously indulge in lesbianism, student seduction, incest, adultery, plagiarism, and, worst of all, abysmally awful poetry writing. It's fun to read the atrocious poems that pop up from page to page, although I must admit to a little embarrassment in that regard. After reading one poem, and mentally trashing it for its apparent total lack of merit, I come to find in the next paragraph that it is an actual poem by D.H. Lawrence. Oh, well.<br />You chuckle and enjoy yourself as you read each page, but then when the book ends you don't feel like you have had a full meal with this literature light read. I don't regret reading it, and probably will look into Ms Weinstein's next novel. It just doesn't hold its own with some of the academic parody greats by such authors as Russo, Lodge, and Kingsley Amis.	2004-03-18

Sometimes I have difficulty understanding exactly what he is saying, but no matter, his off the cuff remarks are unlike those of any other president in our history.<br />BUT: You are paying dearly for them when you buy this book. There are only 95 of them in the 84 pages of this slim tome. Gosh, almost 10 cents apiece? It's a book that can actually be read in a few minutes.<br />Staunch supporters of the prez should consider buying this book, not for the quotations, but for the 44 (yes, forty four)pictures of the president in the book - plus one picture of his dog. Many are full page, suitable for framing shots that would fit nicely on your corporate desk.<br />And now would someone please explain a couple of the quotes?<br />\\"You see, the Senate wants to take away some of the powers of the Administrative branch.\\" I was taught that there are 3 branches of govmint: Executive, Legislative and Judicial. On what date was the Administrative branch added?<br />\\"There's an old saying in Tennessee -I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee- that says fool me once, shame on- shame on you. Fool me,- you can't get fooled again.\\" I thought it was supposed to go \\"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\\"<br />And lets part with the following: \\"I am the master of low expectations.\\" and \\"There may be some tough times here in America.

It must be the most painless and entertaining book about the field of science ever written. Hopefully those who read it will become interested in science, and read more books that describe the wonderful world around us. BB does cover most everything from Astronomy to Zoology.<br />I am a layman who loves to read science books, and I must say that I learned some new things by reading the Short History. Bryson devotes a significant amount of the book to the history of science, writing out brief biographies of discoverers from the famous like Darwin, to the unknown like Hallum Movius. Indeed, he seems to like the obscure scientists the best, and on reading about discoveries and their discoverers you do, indeed, begin to subscribe to the saying that new discoveries are first rejected by the scientific community; then are put down as of little importance; and when fully accepted the credit for them is given to the wrong person.<br />I picked up many interesting facts such as that the layers of ash underground in eastern Nebraska came from a volcanic eruption in Yellowstone park. The explosion was roughly 300 times larger than Mt. St. Helens and the ash settled on 19 western states. Sometime in the future Yellowstone will blow again..<br />While I heartily endorse this fun book, I do have a few criticisms. First of all the author is a bit patronizing in presenting data. He buries you under metaphors. The average water pressure at the oceans average depth is presented not as pounds per square inch, but as the weight of fourteen cement trucks lying on top of you.  The book bulges with things that tell you that if something very teeny were the size of basketballs then the number of them in your body would stretch from here to the constellation Cygnus. Does this make things simpler than to just tell you that there are 10 million of them per square millimeter?<br />The other problem is that when you put the book down after consuming its 500 pages you quickly realize that you havent really learned much science. This is not Mr. Brysons fault, I guess. Subtract the history from the book, and really how much overall scientific information can you provide? There is a section of the book that is devoted to cells, and after reading it I realized that about all that was really presented on cell function was that ATP is manufactured in the mitochondria, and that there is such a thing as programmed cell death. Cellular function is one of the worlds most fascinating marvels, and has been  described in books such as the exciting and very accessible book Life Itself, by Boyce Rensberger. I worry that BBs chapter on the cell will not spur much interest in this topic. He again spends too much time with his metaphors, e.g. the heart pumps 675, 000 gallons of blood per year which is enough to fill 4 Olympic size swimming pools; and that cells are frenzied places each containing 100 million protein molecules (and if each, I suppose, were the size of a Chevy Suburban and placed end to end would.well you know how it goes).<br />But, dont let my nitpicks dissuade you from reading this enjoyable book filled with Bill Brysons usual wit.

The concept of evil has occupied a significant place in philosophy throughout the history of man's thinking. Dr. Neiman has written a very interesting book that explores the problem of evil as considered from early modern thinking to the present.<br />The question is, of course, how do you reconcile an omnipotent, benevolent Deity with the existence of evil. She starts the discussion with Leibnitz who felt that God considered all possible worlds, and decided that the one we have is the best one possible. Evil was divided into two types: natural evil that encompassed the cruelties of nature (floods, earthquakes, droughts, etc.) and moral evil i.e. those acts that we humans are responsible for. Pierre Bayle and Voltaire eagerly tore this idea to shreds. Rousseau came along and said that man, and not God was responsible for all evil, as man had become corrupted through the progress of civilization.<br />Neiman goes on to discuss the thoughts of Hume, Schopenhauer, Kant, Nietzsche, Feud, and even the Marquis de Sade. Then she delves into the topic of the Holocaust, and September 11. Of particular interest here is the thoughts of Hannah Arendt on the Holocaust, and her reflections during the war crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann. Arendt feels that the vast majority of those involved in the Holocaust, Eichmann included, had no malicious intent in what they did. They merely performed assigned tasks, and did not really have the evil impulses that might be found in one of de Sade's novels. Evil truly had become banal, a merely boring activity of a bureaucracy. September 11th did provide evidence of evil intent, however. Those involved were determined to destroy innocent human lives.<br />At this point one has to wonder whether Evil as a philosophical issue has become obsolete. Arendt's reaction to evil (and Freud's too) pointed out psychological issues, and my feeling is that our study of the topic should move on to the examination of the individual and social psychology, and the cultural factors that examine our species' seeming propensity to engage in acts of \\"moral\\" evil. Author Neiman also asks the question of whether Philosophy can go any further with this topic.<br />One outstanding book that covers this topic is \\"Humanity: A Moral History of the Twentieth Century\\" by Jonathan Glover. He explores how humans become desensitized to evil; how we are able to dispassionately \\"kill from a distance.\\" A government can decided to drop bombs on people; missiles are fired that do the task. Yet no one involved actually is engaged in any close up killing of another human.<br />Other books to consider are \\"Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty\\" by Roy Baumeister; \\"The Roots of Evil\\", by Ervin Straub; \\"Why They Kill\\", by Richard Rhodes; and \\"Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People\\", by John Conroy. These books all explore the psychology of evil behavior.<br />A final comment. This book can be read and enjoyed by that ubiquitous \\"educated layman\\", but an interest in the topic of western philosophy would be helpful, as would some memory traces of what you learned in Philosophy 101.the cultural factors that examine our species' seeming propensity to engage in acts of \\"moral\\" evil.

As far as I know this is the most extensive history of philosophy produced by a single author (W.T. Jones has also engaged in such an endeavor, but was only able to produce a meager five volume history).<br />Dr. Copleston had resisted urgings to compile his memoirs, but then, entering his late 80s, found that he wanted to continue writing, but was tired of philosophy. So he sat down and dashed off this slight memoir that was published a year before his death in 1994. The result is like having the good Doctor over for some dinner and drinks. Over a brandy he recounts travel stories and anecdotes, like the time a fellow plane passenger insisted that a flying saucer had just passed by; or the Italian he knew that became so obsessed with his backyard menagerie that he spent most of his day and night catering to his chickens and rabbits.<br />FCC does recount some of the more significant events in his life such as his conversion to Catholicism, and the frightening final year of his Jesuit training that took place in Germany, and ended a scant month before the invasion of Poland. All in all he tries to write as the objective academic. If a comment might seem to imply criticism of something he is quick to use many \\"on the one hand...on the other hand\\" type of comments. He takes great pains to make his subjective comments as clear as possible, going on for several paragraphs deconstructing his remarks. In regard to the question of whether he has ever had doubts about his faith, he responds by dissecting the words \\"doubts\\" and \\"difficulties\\".  His use of language is amusing. His writing is stately, and would give the impression that he is writing the book in 1933 instead of 1993. Yet overall, it is a very easy read, and quite entertaining.<br />Entertainment, however, is not what every reader wants from Dr. Copleston. Many of the very frequent anecdotes about publicly unknown people he met, or places he visited would make most folks yawn if the tales were not coming from the mouth of such a distinguished person. The most interesting chapter concerns his radio debates with Bertrand Russell, and A.J. Ayer. Before the broadcast Copleston and Ayer sat drinking whiskey. By the time they went on the air they were half potted, and the next day the two of them couldn't even remember what they had talked about.<br />I was pleased to become briefly acquainted with Dr. Copleston, but I do wish he would have talked more about his involvement in the philosophical controversies of his day. Copleston seems to  have wanted to reach a wide audience, and thus eschewed any discussion of philosophy that might bore the general public, but let's face it, who other than those interested in philosophy are likely to pick up this book?<br />I now know something about Frederick C. Copleston, but, sadly, not as much as I would like to. My 3 stars are not intended to dissuade people from reading the book. On the contrary it is an interesting read. It's just that when I finished it I felt disappointed that he chose to reveal so little about his life.every reader wants from Dr. Copleston.

Every entering actor is correctly identified as to which nation he or she belongs to, and then the story goes on. I was a bit bemused by this approach to character identification in fiction, but, what the heck, Stephen Carter is a good story teller. He writes intelligently and you quickly get comfortable as he meanders along in his tale of Talcott Garland, a man whose father, a prominent judge, has just died.<br />Talcott's sister thinks dad was murdered. Everyone else makes light of this view, and indeed one doubts throughout the book that Oliver Garland was the victim of foul play. There was a shady friend in Judge Garland's life, however, that hovers in the background of all that takes place. What role did he play in the judge's life, and in his death? Son Talcott, a university law professor, finds himself dragged into his sister's hysteria after a variety of strange events take place. Villains start creeping out of various holes right from the beginning. In fact a separate score card is almost needed in order to keep track of them all.<br />It's a good story, and Stephen Carter is a new author that I hope to see more of. He is an extremely literate writer, and generally enjoyable to read. Note that I said \\"generally\\" enjoyable. As I said before, the story meanders. Sometimes it wanders too much. Talcott has a young son whom he dearly loves. In fact the author tells you over and over that Talcott loves his son. Pages are spent on taking the lad hither and thither, to playgrounds, to ice cream shops, to just about anyplace that will use up some of the reader's time. And from time to time we wander down other trails, some interesting, some not. There is a key character in the story who intrigues our interest, and who at one point vanishes with no authorial explanation, and believe me one is really needed. You also meet almost every law professor on the university's faculty, and it certainly seems to be a big department.

It's a 1300+ page book that contains poems from all over the world from ancient Sumeria to the present. You will find poetry from the Bronze age; odes from the Ottoman empire; Latin American and Native American verses, and more from just about every country that has ever produced a poet. There is religious poetry from India and Asia, translations from Sanskrit and from medieval Russian. Vietnamese, Icelandic and Finnish poets are all represented.<br />The book is bulky yet with a scope so immensely  broad it still has to be a sampler. Major English poets like Alexander Pope end up with half a page while, strangely, Victor Hugo gets three-and-a-half pages.<br />This is a book not just for those who love poetry, but for those who want a taste of  history and culture. It's fascinating to go through these old texts and get a glimmer of  the interests and feelings of people in different lands at different times throughout history.<br />Now for the clinkers. A work like this requires a large number of translators, and some of them have been a little too free in their conversions to English.<br />A poem of Martial (40-104AD) reads thusly: \\"Ted's studio burnt down, with all his poems./ Have the muses hung their heads?/ You, bet, for it was criminal neglect/ not also to have saut&eacute;ed Ted.\\"<br />Hipponax (around 540BC) supposedly said, \\"Big Daddy/ no scrumptious feast of partridge and hare/ no sesame pancakes/ no fritters drenched/ in honey.\\"<br />And that most frequently translated of all classical poets Horace (65 -8BC) is accused of coming up with the lines \\"Dazzled though he be, poor dope, by the golden looks/ Your locks fetched up out of a bottle of Clairol..\\"<br />Fun is fun, but I want a serious book of trustworthy translations when I buy an expensive anthology like this. Still, it is a remarkable book, and one of the most important additions to my library.	2003-07-07

Author Ishiguro provides us with the  reminiscences of a stereotypically reserved British butler.  It is 1956, and Stevens is nearing the end of a long, loyal career serving the inhabitants of Darlington Hall. Lord Darlington has died, and an American has purchased the estate.  The once sizable staff of 27 servants has now been reduced to three. Stevens is on a brief motor trip from Oxfordshire to Cornwall to visit the former Housekeeper of Darlington Hall, Mrs. Kenton, and is hopeful of enticing her to return with him to join his small staff.<br />From his musings while traveling we learn that Stevens repressed every aspect of his personal feelings and values in order to do his duty as head of the household staff of the estate. Duty, loyalty and dignity are the sole values that he admits to, and they have governed his life since arriving at Darlington Hall around 1927. While his father dies in an upstairs room he cannot attend to him as he must see to it that nothing goes amiss at a large conference that is underway. His dealings with Mrs. Kenton are cold and formal, though you become increasingly aware that there are feelings developing between them that go beyond those of a usual co-worker relationship. Stevens also feels that his loyal service to Lord Darlington enabled him to play a small, but meaningful role in Lord Darlington's efforts to bring about world peace.<br />As Stevens analyzes the past both he and the reader begin to realize that his defense of  his life is falling apart. He is forced to realize that his blind support of an aristocrat may have been misguided. His denial of feelings have  cost him a relationship with a woman who had fallen in love with him.  Stevens has come ultimately to face the \\"remains of the day\\", that being the remaining years of  his life.<br />The style of this novel is simple and stately. It is filled with an understated eloquence that is spellbinding. This is a reality novel of the mind. For the length of the book we are privy to Stevens's thoughts as he wrestles with them, as he tries to grapple with the disturbing feelings about his life that are bubbling to the surface.<br />Ishiguro is an incredibly talented author.

You know, the novel where the lawyer takes on an impossible-to-win case, wrings his hands for 100 or so pages, and then, with fingers crossed,  enters the courtroom and the trial begins. We, the knowing readers, then read on patiently waiting for the surprise witness to come in and save the day.  But, hey, its fun to see our hero lawyer make fools of the judge, the prosecutor, and most of the witnesses. Thats what courtroom novels are all about, in my opinion.<br />So here comes Andy Carpenter handling a client who has already been convicted, and is cooling his heels on death row. Do folks think that he has lost his mind for picking up this case? Well of course they do. And there are some folks who go beyond just thinking about it, and try some industrial strength techniques to get him to drop his client. Then there is the matter of Andys father who dies and leaves him $22 million dollars. Where did dad get that kind of money? Dad mingled with some important, powerful people, and they seem to have taken a strange interest in this case.<br />Whats especially good about this formula story is that the author has a good sense of humor. There is a lot of witty dialogue mingled with the usual cunning courtroom antics, spots of violence, and, of course, a love interest.  Open and Shut is a cut above average. Good forensic fluff to while away an evening.	2003-07-06

The thinkers of that age had a sizable impact on concepts of science, nature, politics, religion and society. How do we become immersed in the wealth of writing of that period, however, without giving up job and family in order to read the works of the Enlightenment authors?<br />This reader is an excellent book for novices and experienced readers alike. It is an excellent 600+ page book filled with short, pithy excerpts from the key thinkers of the period. Actually the writings go back as far as 1620 with an excerpt from Francis Bacon where he puts down the Greek philosophers and introduces what is to become the scientific method. Beccaria comes up with novel thinking on crime and punishment. Does the death penalty deter crime? How about the punishment fitting the crime instead of being meted out at the whim of some aristocrat?<br />Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau and Paine weigh in with their political philosophy. The skeptics speak up with their religious criticisms. Manners, morals, art, war, and gender and race issues are all discussed by the likes of Mary Wollstonecraft, David Hume, Reynolds, Pope, and Bentham.<br />Bite sized as these entries are, they give the flavor of Enlightenment thought. And, importantly for the general reader, they are all mentally digestible. You don't have to read every paragraph six times in order to get a glimmer of the authors' meanings. The represented authors are not just from France either. The best thinkers from France, Italy, Germany, the United States and Great Britain are represented.	2003-07-06

As the story opens Jo is having one of those \\"Is this all there is?\\" flashes. She leads a comfortable life with her husband, despite the fact that neither her nor daughters have any interest in the Lord's Work. Yet something is amiss.<br />A man from her past  re-enters her life one day, and the author takes us on a sizeable flashback that is, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the book. That's saying a lot for me, because I usually groan audibly when flashbacks interrupt the story. While in her twenties Jo lives in a communal house with a group of twenty-somethings. She becomes an especially close friend with one of the other women living there, who, to everyone's horror, is murdered one day.<br />Jo is interested in renewing a friendship with the newly arrived Eli, if for no other reason than to discuss old times. But, middle aged rut trekker that she is, wisps of adulterous ideas begin to flit through her mind. We, the astute readers, also know that more information on the years-ago murder will undoubtedly emerge.<br />What did I like about this book? As I said the flashback is the truly most interesting part of the book. And the rest of it? The events in the present are often interesting, but they are burdened by the humdrum lives of the Becker family. Frequent digressions occur where we have to patiently put up with the antics of the dreary daughters. We are captive guests during an extensive (in pages) family holiday reunion in which nothing happens to further the story. It's like the author insists we sit through several hours of dull home movies. And the husband? Well he gets to play the role of a ministerial cipher, who is tested, and fails to follow the kind of advice he undoubtedly would dispense to a parishioner who feared that a spouse might be flirting with the idea of an affair.<br />I know that the NY Times Book critic was caught up in spasms of joy over this book, but this humble reviewer is at a loss in coming up with many superlatives to describe my reading experience. Mind you the story is somewhat entertaining, and I did not have to fight my way through to the end. It's just that an obscure book on estate tax law would have provided me with an equally good time.imes Book critic was caught up in spasms of joy over this book, but this humble reviewer is at a loss in coming up with many superlatives to describe my reading experience.

Author Keneally, a former seminarian himself, totally understands the mind of the young, devout parish priest. Father Darragh has assimilated all of the counseling techniques taught at the seminary, and now tries them out in real life. Alas he has no real understanding of human psychology. When people are mired in the complex, often sordid, problems of life our good priest offers them pious platitudes that provide no help.<br />One thing that the seminary did not prepare him for was the sexual stirrings that begin to intrude when he tries to provide some of his canned counseling to an attractive  young mother whose husband is a Japanese prisoner of war. After she rejects his advice, Father Darragh, tries to find ways to see her again, telling himself that he just wants to help her resolve her problems. I guess they didn't teach much about psychological (or physical) denial in the seminary.<br />He does meet with her again, and the visit is quite innocuous, but shortly thereafter the young woman is murdered. Our hero continues to be peripherally involved in the case, which results in increased suspicion by the police, and increased annoyance by his pastor. We follow the stumblings of Father Frank as he sniffs along the murder trail, and gets involved in some other difficulties which even get him beaten up by some tough guys.<br />Keneally is a fine writer, having a great sense of style and wit. I found this to be a comfortable, entertaining tale that was especially appealing to me as I also spent some time in the seminary a century or so ago. Readers who are unfamiliar with Catholic liturgy will be either intrigued by the book's frequent description of it, or perhaps turned off by it.  My only nit is that I wasn't tremendously pleased with the story's ending, but, that is probably just my problem. This is a good, literate read, and I have  no reservations in recommending it.ervations in recommending it.	2003-07-06

This book is no exception. Author Bainbridge has written a slim book of 181 pages, that tells us the marvels, eccentricities, and terrors hidden away in the X chromosome. It always amuses me when people extol the human body as the epitome of creation excellence. When you look deeply into our physical engineering, though,  you usually start wondering if perhaps we were designed by a fractious committee. <br />It is the male Y chromosome, and specifically the \\"Sry\\" gene on that chromosome, that actively sets out to make any cell blob containing it to turn into a male. But the Y chromosome is really just a dried up fossil of a gene that serves no other purpose than determining sex. It is the X that has many functions.<br />The book answers many questions. Why are diseases such as  Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia mostly limited to males? Why are male identical twins really identical, while female identical twins are not totally identical? Why are approximately 50% of female body cell X chromosomes different from the other 50% while in a male the cells are all alike? Why are women the main sufferers from autoimmune diseases? What happens when a woman is born with only one sex chromosome, a single X? Why is it that color blindness affects mostly men, and why is color blindness almost inevitably red-green, and almost never blue-yellow?<br />We also learn that many other mammals live and reproduce perfectly well with no Y chromosomes. Armadillos generally give birth to identical quadruplets. And on and on goes Mr. Bainbridge with the facts about the unusual X chromosome that is an astounding two inches long yet is able to intricately fold itself to fit into every tiny body cell. <br />This is a very accessible book that should educate and, indeed, entertain anyone who picks it up.	2003-06-14

It's not a book to use as a home medical guide. It is a compendium of articles that relate to medicine, but there seems to be no overall focus to the book. There are many historical entries covering such topics as Greek Medicine, Nursing in Britain, medicine in Italy, the Plague, the Flying Doctors and the Sisters of Charity. Most medical specialties such as dermatology, neurology, gynecological oncology and obstetrics are given coverage.<br />There are a variety of articles on medical research, but none on the topic of research methodology in general. Although not a guide to medical diseases there are articles that do pertain to such specific ailments as diabetes, and sexually transmitted diseases. You will find philosophy represented here in an article on epistemology (the study of knowledge). There is also a section on religion, and the medical views of various sects and denominations. I found that the authors refrained from being critical of religious beliefs as they pertain to medicine. The article on Christian Science is a benign one. The article on Chiropractic is also quite gentle. Indeed the book states that  Chiropractors tend to get to know their patients to a far greater extent than medical practitioners.<br />Again, this is a strange compendium of many different topics: hysteria; hypnotism; near-death experiences; mummies; and the pharmaceutical industries. Will this book fill any of your special needs? It is of value to me by simply being an interesting volume of medical articles that I often just read at random..	2003-06-14

Indeed the natives provide a warm welcome for the family, but things seem to go wrong right from the start. The celebration is marred when the minister chastises the group because the women have, to him, the vile habit of wearing nothing from the waste up. This righteous, rigid man of God doesnt have a chance. His preaching is pedantic, filled with biblical illusions that many American fundamentalists would have difficulty with. His theology is not one of love, but of stern exhortations to mind Gods law.<br />Life in the jungle is difficult, and some members of the family become depressed with the hardships of a life that is made worse by the tyranny of the father. Then there is an event which prompts the family to begin its slow exodus back to civilization.<br /> We are now at about page 500 of  a 650 page book, and this is where the novel really should end.

Mr. Karl, of necessity perhaps, relates much of the plots of her books, and thus creates a real spoiler for the novels that I havent read. Thats my problem, of course, and not the authors.<br />It would seem that people today are probably unaware of this important author who was known throughout England during her writing lifetime.

In this novel we visit an England where bishops are bureaucrats and the parish priests seem to be atheists. Author A.N. Wilson is not new to witnessing the decline of the Anglican Church. A few years back he wrote \\"God's Funeral\\",  the informative and witty history of the decline of religion in Victorian England. Things don't seem to have changed much in modern day Britain.<br />Our protagonist is the Vicar of St. Birnius church, a small parish in a small town. The Rev. Francis Kreer stopped believing in God many years ago, roughly about the same time that he stopped loving his wife. He still likes his job though; it's easy, and there is some good to be accomplished in ministering to the faithful. His wife is another matter. He can't stand the sight of her. To make matters worse his mother has just died, and he has become quite depressed. One day a group of hippies squats down on the town's edge and Francis meets a young girl from the group. One thing leads to another and our pastor has fallen in love with her.<br />Francis runs off with the young lady, and ultimately loses his parish. What follows is a rather bizarre tale of mental deterioration. Author Wilson tells this story through moments of hilarity followed by sequences of sadness. Although the Reverend Kreer has had a succession of traumas in his recent life it is sometimes hard to understand the serious mental imbalance that results. Be that as it may, this book may be considered a delightful tragedy. If \\"delightful tragedy\\" fits a category that piques your interest do, by all means, pick up a copy.	2003-01-27

The host is secretly pleased because the date of one of their male friends has slipped him her phone number.<br />All this happens on the first two pages, and my immediate thought is oh, no, not another novel about a decaying, suburban marriage. Well, actually, it is another novel about a decaying, suburban marriage, but the good news, the saving grace of it all, is that it is quite hilarious.<br />The couple, Paul and Elaine, are totally out of spiritual fuel. Their exasperation with their lives is manifested when, on sudden impulse during a barbecue, they use lighter fluid to spread flames from the grill to the outside of their house. They make a quick departure, and return several hours later to find the house damaged but still standing. While repairs are made they stay with friends who seem to be from another planet. They farm out their two boys to other couples, and then, to fill in the dead spots in their lives, they engage in affairs. Elaine tries out lesbianism, while Paul spends time, much time, with two women acquaintances.<br />Every day Paul goes into work determined to have the most productive day imaginable, and every day he spends his office hours doing next to nothing. Well I shouldn't say he is completely inert. He does go out for long lunches and bed sessions with a woman known only as \\"The Date\\". He also gets tattooed in a nether region of his anatomy. Elaine lunches with a vocational counselor to see if some form of education would start her on a course of rejuvenation. But these flailing gestures do not bring peace and happiness to our weary couple.<br />The novel mocks not only the suburban couple, but also the suburban community of friends, and the workplace. It is a sad story that is loaded with black humor. The ending is just sad - and rather bizarre.  There is no doubt in my mind that Paul and Elaine are riding on the edge of clinical depression. Does author Homes save them or do she push them over the edge?<br />Ms. Homes is an extremely talented writer who can take this rather overdone plot concept, and make it a delightful read. Hmmm. Why do I think a novel on marital disaster is delightful? Why do I chuckle at people who are desperate and depressed?

The book was a perfect choice for my needs. While the book's coverage extends from the French Revolution to the present day, it is mainly concerned with the events of the nineteenth century in Europe, England and Scotland.<br />Mr. Vidler starts with a discussion of Catholicism in France during the periods of revolution. He delineates the struggle between those favoring strong papal control and those who wanted a more secular society. He moves on to the Oxford movement in Britain where there was a tendency toward revival of Catholic beliefs and liturgy. The Chartist movement and the Christian Socialists were a development of the Industrial Revolution. Marked attempts were made to address the political and financial poverty of many of England's citizens.<br />The author also covers the split in the Church in Scotland; the impact of Charles Darwin on Christian thinking; the growth of liberal theology and the Catholic modernists; the influence of Kierkegaard; and the impact of imperialistic missionary programs on European and British colonies.<br />Although written by an Anglican theologian the book is a very even handed treatment of Protestant and Catholic movements and theology during modern times. He presents the good along with the bad, and in sum presents the reader with a concise, informative church history in slightly  less than 300 pages.  My only caveat is that if you are primarily interested in twentieth century coverage of this topic, then you had best look elsewhere. Coverage of the current period is relatively brief and extends only to 1971, the date of publication.	2003-01-24

To The Lighthouse (TTL) reads like a prose poem, a text that also needs more than one reading. You read it slowly, and intently, and then reread passages. This being the case it is somewhat gratifying that the book is only 200 pages long for if it went beyond that it could become a sizable reading project.<br />The reader becomes a spirit flitting between the minds of the novel's characters. Their thoughts become the substance of  the story. The plot is minimal; the action insignificant. In fact, the most physically active participants of TTL  are the sun and the wind which prowl through a decaying house in the book's mid-section. Here Ms. Woolf becomes particularly poetic in describing the effects of the elements on a house that has been abandoned for ten years.<br />Mrs. Ramsey is a strong woman who is married to a professor who is well grounded in Victorian views about women. Her role is to serve her family, and to praise and feel sympathy for her husband. A physically attractive woman with eight children she still has ways of wielding power over people.  Lily, on the other hand, is a single woman who values her independence, but doesn't seem  -to me- to be achieving anything.  The male characters are generally weak men who compensate by being arrogant. And it is not what these characters say that matters as much as what they think, and that is something you are privy to throughout the book.<br />The first 100 or so pages portray a one day scene in the lives of the Ramsey's and their guests in their seaside vacation home. Around thirty pages of the book are devoted to a dinner scene in which most everyone is bored. I must admit that the boredom was convincing as I began to be suffused with the same feeling. I am sure, however, that if I read this section one more time I will view it in a different light.<br />This stream of consciousness novel should be read by everyone interested in reading their way through the literary canon. Although it is a 1920s experiment in form it is still highly accessible to the average reader.be read by everyone interested in reading their way through the literary canon.

The cover says that this is the \\"Best bitter, cynical, and satirical writing in the world.\\" That such is the case is highly questionable, but let's not quibble about that. I already own much of this material so I was a bit let down about that.<br />If you have a decent library of the classics you may well find yourself in my position. Voltaire's Candide; Machiavelli's The Prince; Pope's The Rape of the Lock; Wilde's Picture of Dorian Gray. They are all sitting on a shelf in my library. What I do not have is Jane Austen's obscure Lady Susan which was not even published until more than 50 years after her death.<br />I would also note that the selections do not contain any explanatory notes. Many older works use terms and references unknown to the contemporary general reader. If you read Pope's Rape of the Lock in the Norton Anthology of Poetry you will find approximately 75 notes that help the reader understand the classical or eighteenth century references. In \\"The Malcontents\\" you get no aids to understanding.<br />I realize that there may be a certain intellectual snobbery in saying that these works should all be on your bookshelf. I don't think that they need be there, but if you don't already own them, do you want to own them? This book contains a wide smattering of literature from Aristophanes' play The Birds, written around 400BC, to essays by Mark Twain, to short stories by Saki. Whole novels and plays are presented, bulking up the book and limiting the possible variety that could be found in an almost 1100 page volume of satire and cynicism. Indeed only 19 authors are represented.<br />I really don't think this is a collection that would appeal to the average reader. On the credit page it should be noted that most of this material was taken from Dover editions. As you may know Dover Publications sells very inexpensive copies of the classics. You could get most of the works in this expensive book by purchasing Dover reprints of each of these works for a couple of bucks a piece.

I enjoyed settling down with this interesting vignette of the lives and times of a group of single women in a hostel in London in the spring of 1945. The war in Europe has ended, and these unconquerable gals have survived. They have lived through the blitz; survived on low rations; and have kept their social world going by sharing one fancy dress among themselves. Blaring radios, and shrieks of laughter permeate the old building that has been their home for the last several years. Their amorous adventures have been fleeting ones in accord with the uncertainties of a world at war. We are now seeing them all as the first days of the rest of their lives are about to begin.<br />Ah, but Ms. Spark is not telling us this story just to provide an evening's light entertainment. A tragedy occurs that once again points out the absurdity of war. It is sad that there has been no time in any of our lives when this message is obsolete. It's a short novel, almost a short story writ long, but it doesn't need to be any longer than it is. The author has taken just the amount of time she has needed to paint her colorful literary portrait...and then put a big smudge right in the middle of it.	2002-12-24

For a reasonable price you get almost 1000 pages of literary information. Every obscure literary term imaginable is here, but that's not why I am taking the time to praise this handy little volume.  It's a browsers dream.<br />What I found most interesting were the lengthy sections on genres. There are pages devoted to specific types of novels, dramas, and poems. There are luxuriously long sections on science fiction novels, crime fiction, pastoral writings, short stories, gothic fiction, comic drama, and a host of other such topics. When you go to the short story section, for instance, you will find 12 pages dedicated to coverage of authors and their works dating from biblical times to the present (1998). I quickly found recommended writers that I hadn't known along with those I was well acquainted with. Although this book was inexpensive, I have spent many times its purchase price buying new books that I found referenced in this Dictionary. There are no individual entries for authors or their works in this book. For that you need to go to books like the Oxford, Cambridge, New York Public Library or Benet's  literature reference works.<br />In poetry sections you will find examples of the type of verse being discussed. You will be amused at some of the entries provided under \\"light verse\\" and \\"limericks\\". There is even a heading for \\"shaggy dog story\\".<br />Any weaknesses to the book? Well there are a few. This book has a single author, unlike many reference works that have a group of contributors. This can lead to weak sections that are outside the solo author's expertise.  Every reader will find a favorite author or two missing from the genre sections. I was appalled, for instance, to find no mention of Flannery O'Connor in the section on American short story authors. As the author is English, there may also be a slight bias toward English writers. I was also somewhat annoyed that Mr. Cuddon often -but not always- didn't take the time to give a foreign title its English translation. Would it have hurt him to list the Victor Hugo novel as \\"Toilers of the Sea\\" instead of  \\"Les Travailleurs de le Mer\\"?<br />I am a hopeless book addict, and this little reference work really made my day(s).ays- didn't take the time to give a foreign title its English translation.

The Reverend Harding is the warden of a small home providing quarters for 12 retired, indigent workers. The facility is provided for by a trust set up by its founder over two hundred years ago. Income off the land provides revenue for the maintenance of the home and a living for the warden.. The warden has traditionally been the benefactor of this income which has increased over the years. The Rev. Harding is a gentle, honest man who has never given thought to his 800 pound annual revenue until a young reformer files suit, claiming the intent of the will is being violated. Harding thinks about the matter and is inclined to resign. The Bishop and Archdeacon argue that he is entitled to the income.<br />This book certainly would be a good one for a book club read and discussion. The reformer, the lawyers, the church hierarchy and Reverend Harding all have their views on the matter. Author Trollope does not really pass final judgment on his characters; none of them are cast in black and white terms. In fact Trollope makes the unusual move of bringing a criticism of both the press and Charles Dickens into the novel. The press makes strident value judgments about issues without bothering itself with all the facts or considering the effect their articles will have on the people involved; Charles Dickens treats people as being all good or all bad. Indeed, I found myself arguing with myself for several days after reading The Warden. What should the Rev. Harding done? Was the issue shrouded in shades of gray, or was it clear cut one way or the other?<br />Many critics consider this to be one of Trollope's lesser works, yet to me it is a very interesting, valuable  presentation of an ethical dilemma. And for readers who are reluctant to pick up Victorian novels because of their common 700+ page lengths, this is a little gem at less than 300 pages. Criticism? Well I did a bit of eye-rolling during some of the melodramatic passages. All and all, though, this is an excellent read. From an historical standpoint there was considerable attention being paid to clergy income during this period in England. Trollope's tale was very timely in this regard.<br />One final note. There are many outstanding Victorian novels that I would give a five star rating to. This book doesn't quite fit into that hall of fame so I have given it just 4 stars, which shouldn't be interpreted as a slight to Mr. Trollope or The Warden.g some of the melodramatic passages.

One immediately realizes that sanitation standards for such accommodations were seriously lacking. The dining room \\"table [was] covered with oilcloth so greasy that, if a waggish diner wanted to, he could write his name in it, using nothing more than his finger as a pen.\\" We  then quickly learn about the overwhelming contrast between the boarders' life style  and that of  aristocratic Parisian society..<br />The protagonists of the story are Eugene, a young and poor law student, and old man Goriot, the aging father of two narcissistic daughters who live in the upper strata of Parisian society. While many mediocre authors manage to make cardboard characters out of real people, Balzac has the task of making cardboard people real. Eugene is invited to a ball held by his cousin, a countess, and falls in love with the beautiful people and their world. He is determined to be a part of it. Vautrin, a fellow boarder, a wise street philosopher, and prototype for modern day CEOs, tells Eugene that money is everything. Eugene promptly appropriates every cent of his family's savings to buy the clothes that will allow him to blend in with the aristocracy. Soon he meets Goriot's aristocratic daughters and falls in love with one of them. These two grasping young ladies, in  their need for the necessities in life (fine clothing and jewelry), have taken so much money from their formerly wealthy father that he now lives in abject poverty, sleeping on a moldy straw mattress in Madame Vauquer's boarding house.<br />By now I am sure that you have discerned Balzac's attitude toward the socially elite. He has no love for people who are famous for being famous. We should resist the urge, though,  to shake our heads in wonder over these strange 19th century Parisians.  If Balzac  were alive today I am sure he would loosen his poison pen on our own celebrities whose meaningless lives are constantly being spotlighted during their fifteen minutes of fame. Balzac is a lively writer. He supposedly drank huge amounts of coffee every day, and his writing often seems to be the product of a  highly caffeinated mind. If the highly stylized writing of some Victorian era writers  numbs your brain you might want to dip into Balzac.<br />I strongly recommend that you consider purchasing the Norton Critical Edition of this novel. It provides an additional 150 pages of commentary on Balzac, this novel, and his oeuvre in general; an  extra dollar or two well spent.sure he would loosen his poison pen on our own celebrities whose meaningless lives are constantly being spotlighted during their fifteen minutes of fame.

First of all this is not a book about the period of the Enlightenment, and secondly it does not discuss \\"centuries\\" of thought. A.N. Wilson's task is to depict the decline in faith among intellectuals (and the working class poor to some extent)  in Victorian England - the period essentially between 1837 and 1901.<br />Some authors lecture to you from a distant rostrum; Mr. Wilson sits down with you in your living room, and talks to you in an informed and witty manner. While it might help to have a modicum of knowledge of  history and philosophy to get the most out of this book, it's not really necessary. He might drop a phrase on you like \\"rotten borough\\" (a voting district under the control of a few individuals) without explaining it, but that's a minor problem. I did encounter one small annoyance, and that was ANW's tendency to occasionally tease you with little tidbits of information. In one of his many, interesting mini-biographies he might say, \\"And then there was the incident of such and such, but as that story is so well known I won't bother repeating it here.\\" But I want it repeated here; I am not acquainted with the story.<br />As I stated above, ANW  has quite a sense of wit. It's not often that you read a book on such a topic, and find yourself chuckling frequently. Let me give an example. Most authors would have told you that Benno Erdmann was a leading proponent of Hegelian philosophy after Georg Hegel's death. Wilson expresses the thought thusly, \\"Erdmann was Hegel's representative on earth.\\"<br />Mr. Wilson is at his best in telling us about the religious and philosophical beliefs of Carlyle, Ruskin, Cardinal Newman, George Eliot, the nincompoop Herbert Spencer, Matthew Arnold, Thomas Hardy and many others including a chapter on our best known American philosopher, William James. Many British intellectuals no longer believed in God, but did believe in the social utility of religion, i.e. God, or no God, religious teachings help keep society from falling apart. Of course 19th century Englishmen were still nervous about the prospect of a French-like revolution occurring on their home turf. Others felt that the beliefs and rituals of religion were so moving that if there isn't a God there really should be someone like Him out there.<br />If you think that learning history is a matter of diligently plowing through obfuscatory prose, then you will experience this book as a guilty pleasure.ty of religion, i.e. God, or no God, religious teachings help keep society from falling apart.

Candide isn't just some hectic adventure story. It really fails as literature in this regard, and certainly Voltaire's purpose was not to make you chuckle while you whiled away a few empty hours. He would weep to think that you missed out on what he was really trying to tell you. Rest easy. I am not going to launch into a stuffy monologue on Leibnitz and 18th century French Catholicism, but in essence you should know that this is the essence of the story. The philosopher Leibnitz (who with Isaac Newton independently invented Calculus) explained the existence of evil in the world thusly: God, in his infinite wisdom, thought of all possible worlds that he could create, and he chose this one; therefore this must be the best of all possible worlds. Voltaire was also continually chastising the Catholic Church for it's lack of tolerance of other beliefs, and for its aristocratic pomp.<br />Enter now the Norton Critical Edition of Candide. This book presents the 75 page story along with 130 additional pages of various articles and essays on the times in which it was written; commentary by Voltaire and by his contemporaries; and critiques of the story by modern writers. Sure there are always a few dull, academic essays making their mandatory appearance in a book like this, but my suggestion is just to skip them. After all there are a lot of them to choose from.<br />Learn the story behind the story so to speak. After all it is the background of Candide that makes Candide the forceful satire that it is.	2002-12-07

The difficulty that many readers face when they pick up a classic, pre-twentieth century novel is that they are not conversant with the history of the times in which it was written. Heart of Darkness can  be enjoyed purely as a well written novella, but then you miss so much of what Conrad is trying to say not only regarding the thin veneer of man's social persona (ala Lord of the Flies) but about the evils of 19th century imperialism. What is the story of Colonialism? Do Conrad's derogatory remarks about Blacks make him a bigot? What were Conrad's overall views on life? What were Conrad's personal experiences in the Congo? What did readers think of Heart of Darkness when it was written, and what do the critics think of it today?<br />The Norton Critical Edition gives you 325 extra pages of material written by Conrad and others that provide answers to the above questions. You don't have to read all of these many articles, of course, but a good sampling of them will make your immersion in this famous story all the more enjoyable and meaningful.<br />This is a story that everyone should read, and the Norton Critical Edition provides the best format for the reading experience.	2002-12-07

I  need never again plod over to the bookshelf and drag down one of the two hefty volumes of my Oxford Shorter Dictionary.<br />Well was I surprised. I decided to give it a test run using the book I was currently reading as a source for words to look up. Indeed \\"cat\\" and \\"mouse\\" are not to be found in this dictionary, but neither are \\"juridical\\", \\"ineluctable\\", \\"sibylline\\" and  just about every other lesser used word that I came across in my reading. What the Oxford Dictionary of Difficult Words (ODDW) does is take a slice out of the middle, so to speak: no simple words, and yet no really difficult words. The sample words that I used above ARE to be found in my Oxford Pocket American Dictionary, a book of about the same physical size as the ODDW. Here are some so called difficult words that are found in the ODDW: \\"absolute\\", \\"intelligence\\", \\"privilege\\", and \\"anxious\\". If you find those words to be difficult then maybe this should be your choice.<br />This might be a good selection for a middle or high school student, but, in my opinion, is of no value to an adult who is a fairly avid reader of non-fiction.

Starting at a young age he studies the Classics; learns Latin and Greek, and opens his mind wide to knowledge in general. He is preparing himself for Oxford, but Oxford won't have him, nor undoubtedly will any other university. You see he is poor, and poor people aren't admitted to  college in Victorian times.<br /><br />After exiting a short-lived dismal marriage Jude then meets and falls in love with his cousin who ultimately leaves her husband and moves in with him. There is no \\"happily ever after\\" in this novel. Sue, his lover, has sexual problems that need the ministrations of Dr. Ruth, who unfortunately was not available at the time. Sex is repellent to her, and so she and Jude live fairly platonic lives; lives that are not made easier by society's negative reaction to their living in \\"sin\\".<br />Jude and Sue are nice, if not psychologically whole, individuals. You wish them well, but Thomas Hardy has decided to sacrifice them to his philosophical views. He burdens the poor couple with society's repressive attitudes toward women, the lower classes, and marital nonconformity. A novel that begins with the hope of springtime, ends in a winter of despair.<br />It is a pessimistic, depressing story that examines Victorian sexual and societal mores, and for this it was condemned by many critics. Hardy was so affected by this criticism that he never wrote another novel. Instead he successfully turned to poetry, although his pessimism was again apparent in some of his verses (Read for instance his elegant poem \\"God's Funeral\\"). Some of the novel is a bit melodramatic, but that is a common trait of many works of the period. My credulity is strained somewhat by the basically non-sexual relationship of Jude and Sue. Sue is described as an attractive, intelligent and even flirtatious woman. Put simply, I could not fall in love with such a lady, and live with her as brother and sister.<br />I enjoy many Victorian novels because they combine outstanding literature with an exposition of the society of the times. Hardy is one of England's best. Highly recommended, and I strongly suggest that you buy the Norton Critical Edition of this work. In addition to the novel text you are provided with interesting information about the author, and a collection of contemporary and current reviews of the novel.bine outstanding literature with an exposition of the society of the times.

The sturdy,  oversized Guide presents over one thousand pages of information on authors, novels, poetry, drama, and literary terms. There are interesting biographies of prominent writers and obscure ones, from Mrs. Humphrey Ward to William Faulkner.<br />Good plot summaries are provided for a wide range of novels. If you are a fan of Anthony Trollope, you will find no less than twenty five of his books discussed. You have to be careful, however, if you are reading the plot of a book in order to decided whether or not you want to read it - the ending is always given away. The Cambridge Guide explores many literary terms: Meter; the Bloomsbury Group; positivism; and post-structuralism. There are also entries on Literary Journals - yes, the New York Review of Books is here as well as Granta.<br />The Cambridge Guide is written for the average layman and avoids academic jargon. I decided to try the entry on \\"deconstruction\\" as the extreme test of explaining difficult concepts. It's hard to say: either they failed the test, or I failed it.<br />This book has become one of my prized possessions, and I would have been willing to buy it at twice the price charged.	2002-11-29

Borrowed Finery is a memoir of her life that provides us with a collection of small episodes extending from childhood through her teen years. I hate reading memoirs, but decided to read this one to get a better understanding of Paula Fox the Novelist. Nothing much pleasant transpired during these years; the brief incidents that we hear about are, perhaps, the only ones she feels at ease telling.<br />Her parents simply didn't want to raise her. Father was a screenwriter, and mother was offended by a daughter who disrupted her life by being born. Both were heavy drinkers. Ms Fox's father seemed to have some affection for her, while the mother reacted to Paula as if someone had let some mangy, un-housebroken dog into the room. Young Paula was sent to live with a variety of people during her life, and she never knew how long she would spend with any of her caretakers. For some time she was taken by her grandmother to her great grandmother's Cuban plantation where she was left totally on her own. She got up, went to school, came home, talked to some of the servants and went to bed without any contact with the grandparents.<br />It was a sad life for a child, but Ms Fox grew up, married, and wrote 21 children's books and her excellent novels. By the way, she is also Courtney Love's grandmother.<br />Borrowed Finery also provides some insight into the mind behind the characters and themes in her books. My suggestion: read her memoir and her novels.	2002-11-29

First off I must mention that I am one of those demented individuals who prefer reading negative book reviews to grinding through the adulatory critiques of a lot of critics who do not wish to offend authors who might retaliate in kind. Why this perversion? Well, to be honest, I think they are more entertaining, and if shooting down authors and critics is humorous then this is the comic masterpiece of our young century.<br />What sport to attack critics who say that so-and-so's latest book isn't much for plot or characters, but individual sentences are often the work of genius! Doesn't that make you really want to go out and buy it? Would your and my response to such an idiotic statement be any different than Mr. Meyer's?  But Mr. Myers has a special knack for puncturing such nonsense.<br />And surely you get weary of authors who write sentences that repeat words and thoughts over and over again; authors who never tire of using 150 words to replace a more realistic, succinct sentence of about ten words.<br />Of course the true work of literary genius, as in art, is to write a book that is incomprehensible. Critics then invariably blame the disappointed reader as one who is too intellectually lazy to accept the challenge of decoding the text (of course Alan Turing couldn't even do much with some of these deadly tomes). Or maybe the lavishly praised sentences in the book are just plain idiotic. One of my favorites comes from the novel Shelter by Jayne Anne Phillips: \\"the urinals were a long-necked row of cracked porcelain forms, laced with shadow, supplicant, open-mouthed.\\"<br />In any event if you abhor obscure literary texts, and book reviews that are larded with terms from Literary Criticism 101 then read The Reader's Manifesto and have a good laugh while Mr. Myers sticks pins in a bunch of pompous literary dolls.	2002-11-28

The Secret History is a wonderfully written novel that brings us closely into the lives of a clique of Greek scholars at a New Hampshire college. It's a murder mystery that tells you at the very beginning who is murdered and who did it. The Greek scholars did it we are told, and the suspense of the story is in the gradual unveiling of the process by which one of their members meets his fate. While I love academia, and, if financially independent, might well have embraced a life of being a career student, I don't think I would have been a member of this group.<br />While it is not unusual for college students to deviate from established societal norms, this small group excels in collegiate strangeness. One is gay, which is OK, but his appearance and behavior is unusual. In this modern day  he floats through campus his fiery red hair an accent mark to his \\"Comte de Montesquiou\\" dress of starched shirts with French cuffs, necktie, and \\"a black greatcoat that billowed behind him as he walked that made him look like a cross between a student prince and Jack the Ripper.\\"  Then there is the tall, laconic Henry who says little and often studies 20 a hours day. The twins Charles and Camilla live together, and one immediately wonders about this living arrangement. The narrator of the book, is close to normal except for his trait of lying rather frequently. The about to be murdered student is a loud mouth thief who parasitically depends on the others for his entire sustenance.<br />The one area in which these students seem absolutely normal is in their drinking habits. All six seem to be drunk most of the time, but then in Ms Tarrt's view they are probably moral idealists compared to all of the other students at Hampden who find solace in being constantly drunk and also high on drugs. Strange chemical labs thrive in school basements. Miss Poovey down the hall has a fairly complete pharmacy in her room. One student has achieved great success in his drug dealing business. The wonder of it all is that this is such a beautifully written story detailing a rather depressing (unless you are also a serious imbiber) scholastic environment.<br />The problem in the novel is keeping a secret. When you have a big one to keep you have to work very hard at maintaining it. In trying to contain it you may indulge in behavior that creates more secrets. Toward the end of the novel there is a harrowing sequence where it looks like....well you will just have to read the book to find out.wonder of it all is that this is such a beautifully written story detailing a rather depressing (unless you are also a serious imbiber) scholastic environment. <br />The problem in the novel is keeping a secret.

It is all of 800 pages shorter. Perhaps all Victorian era novels should undergo such modernizing. For years I have seen my copy of Les Miserables sitting unread on my bookshelf. \\"When oh when,\\" I think \\"can I take a month out of my life to reading its 1463 pages?\\"<br />Poor Ned Maddstone is a happy young man in love with a beautiful maiden when disaster strikes. He has some faux friends who secretly despise him and play a prank on him that results in a sort of imprisonment for him. Well to make a short story even shorter he eventually escapes from captivity and returns to the real world with revenge on his mind. And of course he does exact some serious revenge on the miscreants that did him wrong.<br />Stephen Fry is a decent writer with a good sense of humor, but during the progress of this book humor gradually walks out the door as malevolence makes its entrance. It can be quite disrupting to a reader whose sympathy for the main character starts turning to revulsion.  What is the proper payback for the blokes who caused Ned so much grief? How far can you go before you have just about ruined the life that you have just recently rescued? Interesting psychological dilemma, and Mr. Fry makes it a very interesting story. Even when you are deploring some of the actions in the last part of the book you can't help from being amused at their diabolical cleverness.<br />Should you laugh of cry at the end? You read and decide.	2002-11-28
US	53070409	RR80NHAC1SGNF	0393974529	3653538	Middlemarch	Books	5	6	7	N	N	George Eliot�s Humble Servant	I really stand in awe of Ms Eliot's tremendous talent. I would not like to be classified among those modern day literary critics who indicate that a certain author's plots aren't worth much, but the books are saved by their wonderfully constructed sentences. But there is no doubt that GE is a master of the language. She is a writer of profound elegance who shows a deep understanding of human psychology. All that said I am pleased to say that she can also write a darn good story.<br />Middlemarch is one of many Victorian novels that presents the plight of women during that period (how many other women were out there with writing talent that were stifled, I wonder). There are three plots in the novel that examine male and female relationships and the role that both sexes play during courting and marriage, and we learn how women were treated with condescension if they voiced an opinion on something.  But this is not a gothic romance novel. It is a beautifully written story of the social milieu of English provincial life around 1830.<br />There is a certain law that pertains to Victorian novels: If a character is married early in the novel, then that marriage is doomed to failure. Middlemarch follows the law scrupulously. You must be married in the book's waning pages if you want to live happily ever after. Dorothea is a wealthy young woman who marries a scholastic, elderly clergyman because she wants to gain knowledge at the feet of a master. Unfortunately he is a dried up fig with no ability to communicate wisdom. He dies but leaves Dorothea with a burdensome restriction in the will: she can not marry a man that she also loves. Dr. Lydgate marries a dim and self centered woman who sees a husband solely as a provider of a fine life style. And poor drifting Fred courts a plain, but bright commoner who will continue to reject his advances until he settles down and finds a career for  himself.<br />Now maybe that plot outline makes you yawn, but it is the way that George Eliot tells it that makes the difference. She presents a crystal clear picture of these people and their lives and society and even politics. And despite her stately language GE has an engaging, subtle humor to her writing. Mr. Crabbe, the glazier, loved joining the group for gossip, and is described as one \\"who gathered much news and then groped among it dimly.\\"<br />My copy of Middlemarch is the Norton Critical Edition, and I highly recommend it. It contains and extra 150 pages of Ms Eliot's letters about the book; her notes laying out the story; and some interesting contemporary and current reviews and analyses of the novel. Henry James, liked it, but had some criticisms of the lead characters, which I found myself (sort of)agreeing with.

Don't stop reading this review if the first sentence caused your eyes to glaze over. You don't need to understand those terms. RCL is simply saying that our social environment is more important than our genetic structure.<br /> And, no, this book is not about Marxist ideas as one reviewer wrote. One is not a marxist because one supports environmental affects on society. He is not spouting Marxism when he suggests that society is responsible for many diseases, and not microbes. Tuberculosis had greatly declined by the early twentieth century, not because of vaccination, but because living conditions and nutrition had improved. The ultimate cause of some cancers is not so much the proximate cause of pollution, but the society that has decided that pollution in the air is acceptable in furthering our society.<br />Our society is not based on the total genetic activity of its members. First of all there aren't enough genes to begin to determine the billions of circuits in the brain, many of which aren't constructed until after birth. We become individuals in a society. The two most common ways in which children are similar to their parents relate to religion and politics. Are we then to say that there is a Baptist gene, or a Republican gene?<br />Lewontin believes that the genome project(s) will not fulfill the promises currently being made. His social constructionist beliefs (that science is culturally determined) must be given some credence when he states that no prominent geneticist of his acquaintance is free of a financial interest in these projects. We also cannot assume that mapping the genome of an individual will result in a set of genes that we can accept as a normal reference. You, the reader, and I may be very normal human beings, but our genes differ by about 3 million nucleotides.<br />The author also states that organisms create their environment; they do not react passively to their surroundings. There is no such thing as a environmental balance he says. 99.99% of all beings that existed are now extinct. The environment has always been in a state of continual flux. He points out that many organisms have had a negative effect on the environment. The beaver, for example, is notorious for its destruction of its surroundings.<br />A very thought provoking book. I read it through twice which was easy to do because of its 128 page length.

Married for 13 years and still madly in love we find them surrounded by flowers, trees and a beautiful blue sky. In fact the the number of botanical species described in the first chapter made me think that I had perhaps opened a gardening book by mistake. Short of that I worried that this was a novel that would bury me in literary molasses by page 25. Yet the birds singing outside the Ford's bower on this fine day would soon turn silent in mourning. You see Ms. Hoffman sets it up this way in order that the end of paradise would be more striking.<br />Unknown to anyone Ethan had commited a serious crime before meeting Jorie, and now the police have arrived to take him into custody. From this page on the author takes us on a ride down a dark road where her characters are trudging along looking for the light. Ms. Hoffman really knows how to portray unhappy people; a sister who can't feel for others; a neighbor girl who can't love; a boy who wants simply to disappear; a man who lives in seclusion after a family tragedy many years ago. And the list goes on.<br />Sounds depressing doesn't it. Well, not exactly. The story is an intriguing one, and the characters and their problems are always of interest. Even the bit players make an impression on you. This novel is not a mystery or a police procedural yet you constantly wonder what is going to happen to all of these citizens of Monroe, Massachusetts. Will Ms Hoffman stick more pins in them or will she relent and offer them some sort of peace? I enjoyed the book, and was content with the ending. Highly recommended.	2002-08-19

The Monk Downstairs is a warm little novel that explores that period when a man and a woman wonder if this is all there is to life. Rebecca is a single mom who is lonely, and not too happy with her job as a graphic artist. Michael  has left a monastery where, for twenty years, he had dedicated  himself to the contemplative life.<br />Michael rents a small apartment in the basement of Rebeccca's home, and you can easily guess what develops from that arrangement. This is a pleasant, feel good romance, and you are pleased that two souls find a growing happiness in each other's company. From one standpoint Michael is an ideal find: he and 6 year old Mary Martha get along perfectly. The daughter Mary Martha's name is symbolic for Michael's spiritual dilemma. In a New Testament passage Martha bustles around the house doing her chores while Mary sits at the feet of Jesus. Is it best to spend one's life contemplating God, or should one find God through an active life in the world?<br />Mr. Farrington presents his tale in a way that successfully stays away from being overtly sentimental. Some obstacles are encountered including near tragedy. The only formulaic part of the story is encountered in the Hollywood tradition where two people meet, enjoy a budding relationship, spat and separate, and then reunite. Do Michael and Rebecca find happiness together? Well, gosh, you can tell almost immediately that the author is not one who enjoys sticking pins in  his character dolls. The pleasure of the story lies in its interesting plot and characters. I thoroughly enjoyed it.	2002-08-07

Please bear with me a bit. Pennock hasn't written a book that will cause drowsiness in the average lay reader, rather he has penned one that skips the usual biological nuts and bolts arguments, and covers some interestingly different territory.<br />RTP spends time acquainting the reader with the beliefs of the young world creationists, and then spends a major amount of time discussing the approach of the newer Intelligent Design Creationists (IDC). These creationists avoid old weary arguments such as the one that evolution would violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and focus more directly on intelligent design versus the randomness of evolution. Essential to most creationist arguments for inclusion of their views in science education is the argument that creationism is a viable alternate to evolution and thus should be given equal time in the classroom. Pennock, a philosopher of science, points out that such a point is a logical fallacy, creating a false dilemma. The creationists are implying (or sometimes stating) that there are only two alternatives. In fact there are a wide variety of religious views on the subject, ranging from the Native American Modoc tribe to practioners of Shintoism. One researcher has noted that there are 23,000 different religious denominations in America. Which one has the truth? Many Christian denominations accept that evolution is not a threat to their religious beliefs. Pope John Paul II made a statement supporting evolutionary theory. So what we have are religious fundamentalists deciding that their religious views on the subject are the only tenable ones, and that their beliefs should be the only acceptable alternative to evolution.<br />The author spends some time discussing the evolution of languages. If one takes the bible seriously you believe that the current variety of languages is a result of the tower of Babel incident. This is an interesting topic, but is not the major subject of the book.<br />Pennock believes that the strong, hostile opposition to evolution is not about science, but involves the search for meaning in life. Some believers cannot accept the possibility that there may not be a God directed purpose to life. They feel that without God their lives would be meaningless. Perhaps they should observe the many people who lead happy, productive lives even thought they don't share theological principles with creationists.<br />This is a wonderful book If you are new to the evolution-creation debate I would recommend that you read a book on the basics of evolutionary theory first. Good ones to start with are Phillip Kitcher's \\"Abusing Science\\", or Douglas Futuyama's \\"Science on Trial\\".<br />One of the stars awarded this book is for some great quotations.

It's a strange, schizophrenic combination, that concerns a picture that Martin Clay sees in his country neighbor's home. The neighbor thinks it is junk, but Martin thinks he has found a work by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. If he can correctly discover its provenance he hopes to buy the painting for a pittance, and then resell it for a small fortune.<br />Martin's subsequent adventures with the rather uncouth neighbor, his flirtatious wife, and the London art world are hectic, bizarre, and above all quite funny. Now comes the qualification. About half of the book's text is taken up with Martin's library research concerning Bruegel,  his paintings, and late 16th century Netherlands history. Now I am interested in both art history, and medieval  history so I was quite intrigued by all of this. But if you are not of a similar mind, you might object to several antic escapades being interrupted for another lesson in the history of Bruegel's paintings. If you don't like art lessons can you skip through the pedantic parts? Well, I don't know. If you don't like boxing can you skip the fight scenes in Rocky?<br />I'm rating it four stars, because I liked both components of the book. You'll have to decide for yourself if you are in the mood for Art History 101.	2002-07-26

It's quite simple: nothing much ever happened to me worth writing about. And so it is with most folks. Yet when we pick up The Stone Diaries we read a fictional autobiography of a very ordinary woman that starts when Daisy Stone is comfortably in the womb, and finishes with her obituary. Daisy tells her tale in the third person, and uses documents, letters, and the commentary of others to flesh out the story of her unexceptional life...<br />We really never get to know Daisy well. Her thoughts and emotions, her joys and sorrows lie hidden. Even when she becomes clinically depressed we never get any closer to her mind. To avoid sentimentality she frequently uses letters and the interview-like comments of others to tell the story. She is intelligent and educated, but what was that worth in the first half of the 20th century? Not much. She marries for security, dutifully raises her children, and, without joy, makes herself available in bed. She shows happiness when given a column to write in a newspaper, and that is perhaps her life's triumph.<br />So what do we make of all of this? It is easy to see that born 40 years later Daisy would probably have been quite the achiever. She was born in 1905, however, and Carol Shields does a splendid job of presenting a person who was born, served time on the planet, and then departed, her mark being that she left three children who had more opportunities to develop their talents.<br />This is a novel that may captivate many readers -after all it did win a Pulitzer Prize- or it may leave some dissatisfied. I found the book to be well written, and intriguing, yet Daisy was just too distant for me. You should read it, though. It's a modern classic.	2002-07-14

Sophie and Otto live quite securely; they have money, position, a renovated brownstone, and a Mercedes. Unfortunately the world around them is not behaving in a civilized manner. A cat bites Sophie; a neighbor relieves himself out of his bedroom window; drunks vomit on the sidewalk. Otto and his law partner break up, and their Long Island farmhouse is vandalized. At one point Otto laments \\"I wish someone could tell me how I can live.\\"<br />These are people viewed at a distance. They are cardboard characters, not because of any ineptness on behalf of the author, but because they truly are made of cardboard. There is no \\"there\\" there when we search for the inner beings of Sophie and Otto. One can categorize this novel as a story of a failing marriage, but I don't think that's the case. What we are viewing is a stagnant marriage, but stagnation seems normal for this couple; it is a life for which they are especially suited. Sophie makes sporadic, impulsive attempts to loosen her bondage to this existence: she has an affair; in a sudden rage she calls a friend a \\"dumb old collapsed bag\\"; she goes out for drinks with Otto's former partner at 3AM. Yet throughout the book we feel no sympathy for anyone who makes an appearance. Well almost anyone. The guy who empties his bladder out of his bedroom window does seem to be an independent cuss. Maybe we should get to know him better.<br />Oh, and the word pictures, the metaphors, the similes: \\"her glance rested on Leon and Sophie with remote interest, like someone who does not particularly like fish, but finds herself imprisoned in an aquarium.\\" This is one of many 1970's novels that portray the vacuous nature of the new, spiritually dead, materialistic society (see Richard Yates's Revolutionary Road, for example). It's an amazing book. Now I'm off to buy her other novels.	2002-05-21

Immediately ruling out spontaneous combustion as the cause of this unusual event, the couple decides that the dog burning is a forewarning of something ominous. Later that same day Leon goes to the store for some microwave popcorn, and never returns. Much later a burglar breaks into the house in the middle of the night. Kate now feels that something is really wrong, and the police, after finding drugs during their search of the house, totally agree.<br />I thought that this might really be an interesting tale, what with the burning dog and all. Sadly the story never really comes alive. Turns out that lighting a dog on fire is simply a message meaning \\"See me at once, I have bad news.\\" Clever way to communicate; really beats the risk of using the telephone.<br />Well, anyway, Kate and her sidekick 14 year old Evan (yes, 14 is correct) take off after the bad guys. Is her husband alive or isn't he? Is he mixed up in some sort of designer drug lab? Are two recent deaths connected to her husband's disappearance? Will another canine be torched?

You don't need to read the book, of course, to answer that last question.<br />It's not a bad book. It's just an average one, a modestly entertaining easily forgettable tale. So forgettable that I raced to type this review before the story evaporated from memory.	2002-05-15

The lawyer defends a man accused of murder who is acquitted, yet we find out at the end that the defendant was guilty of the crime. Hope springs eternal that I will find another shocker of this sort. The norm, however, is that we know the defendant our lawyer hero defends will turn out to be innocent. My mathematical law in this regard is that the innocence of the accused is directly proportional to the amount of evidence against him/her.  Will this book fall into this category? I'm not giving away anything by saying that while most of the community wants a hanging, lawyer Dismas Hardy has an increasing belief in his client's innocence. Did the homeless heroin addict kill the beautiful, prominent attorney Elaine Wager? Dismas and his police lieutenant friend Abe Glitsky pursue the case, and find a possible tie in involving child molestation.<br />Everything is going fine here. It's an entertaining, engrossing tale that we trial fans know will end up in some sizzling courtroom scenes. Good guys turn out to be not so good guys. People disappear, people have heart attacks. Good fun. Now comes the bad part. We ultimately find ourselves in a true Perry Mason setting. The problem with such settings is that they make it difficult for me to suspend disbelief. They are situations that just don't seem to happen. I was disappointed with the way the story progressed, and thus have given it fewer stars. Perry Mason fans, however, should buy the book without delay.	2002-05-05

Mr. Harrison uses up a whole quiver of needles while sticking them in his character of Peter Scattergood. Peter's an upstanding, decent assistant district attorney who is assigned a case involving the murder of the mayor's nephew. Peter investigates the murder, and comes up with more leads than the police. Is the criminal investigation the main plot of the story? Perhaps not. Peter's wife has left him and he is disconsolate; he needs to win her back. He tries unsuccessfully to mend the relationship, and, to our dismay, turns into a stalker. What a paradox as his legal ethics begin conflicting with the unethical behavior in his personal life. He becomes seriously deluded in his belief that his marriage will be saved.<br />Colin Harrison frequently presents us with extremely fallible humans. They tend to persist in following a bad turn along one of life's roads. Reason falls victim to rationalization. You want to slap Peter Scattergood in the face, and hear him say, \\"Thanks, I needed that.\\" So once again we have a Harrison novel in which it is hard to identify with those who live in its pages. For those who do like CH, however, this is another rewarding read.	2002-05-05

The trend of reaching for increased verisimilitude in novels by describing the exact nature of the nourishment consumed by the characters?  The protagonist didnt just discuss something over an undefined dinner. He or she spoke while ingesting sweetbreads smothered in a delicate sauce ofwell you get the picture. In A Place of Execution we are informed every time that a character smokes a cigarette. Not only are we enlighted about the lighting up ceremony, but we are also told the brand of the cigarette, and kept abreast of events by updates on ash flicking, inhaling and stub extinguishing. Not that this makes for an unworthy novel; its just odd that Ms McDermid has decided to spend so much time on this particular vice. My hunch is that the author had just given up smoking when writing the novel, and that she is smoking vicariously through her characters.<br />The novel concerns a young girl who has disappeared from her home in a tiny, secluded town in England. Police Inspector George Barnett is in charge of the case and a dedicated man he is. He devotes most of his time in trying to find young Alison, and we readers share the effort being dragged through hill and dale in the search. The townspeople, being very secluded, would be good candidates for biological research in the investigation of the genetic effects of inbreeding. They are horrified about Alisons disappearance, yet are strangely uncooperative with the police. Yet the diligence of Georges intensive search while smoking pack after pack of cigarettes pays off. Someone is arrested for the crime, and is convicted of murder. Then we jump 30 years and find new information about the disappearance that is quite disconcerting. While reading the book a strange thought kept creeping into my mind, a thought that later proved accurate. Will you guess the answer to the mystery? Read the book and find out. Its quite entertaining.	2002-05-03

Research, however, shows that this concept is not accurate. The visual recollection of an event has to be recreated by assembling bits and pieces of memory into a whole picture. Our recollection of events is thus often distorted. A variety of psychological experiments have been conducted that demonstrate this phenomenon.  Subjects shown a picture of an office later, when asked to recall the photograph, put items such as bookcases or a calendar in the scene that were not actually there. Other aspects of the office are forgotten.<br />Elizabeth Loftus, an internationally known expert on memory, applies research and her experience to the topic of eye witness testimony in the legal setting. The book attempts to be both entertaining in its often informal presentation of case histories, and modestly academic in presenting psychological theory and research. The case histories for the most part describe trials in which eyewitness testimony resulted in the conviction of an innocent person. Loftus shows how inaccurate recollections combined with inappropriate police photo and lineup presentations can cause a witness to create false recollections. As a side note the book also shows how fallible juries can be. All in all this book provides further proof that eyewitness testimony is not superior to circumstantial evidence.<br />My only criticism of this book should probably be directed toward the co-author. This book is oriented toward the general public, and the case descriptions are often fluffed to create the \\"true crime\\" approach used by writers in that genre. What I found particularly amusing was that, in a book devoted to the topic of fallible memory, Ms Loftus recalls minute trivia that most of us would normally forget within a day. She relates, for example, that in one case she had just finished eating a breakfast of coffee and wheat toast. The coffee had just been put in front of her when the lawyer for the defendant walked into the restaurant. Beyond this attempt at verisimilitude we are presented with a memory of an extremely inconsequential event -the breakfast, and its delivery timing- ten years after the event.<br />This book is an important read. It demonstrates vividly the inaccuracies of memory, and it presents the subject in a format that would entertain most courtroom novel fans. Author Loftus has written a variety of books including a recent one -The Myth of Repressed Memory&quot;- that debunks repressed memory. A classic of hers is \\"Eyewitness Testimony\\" that is oriented more toward psychological theory and research.her when the lawyer for the defendant walked into the restaurant.

US	53070409	RMAO5LEZVMDAI	0446678422	30029813	1st to Die	Books	3	1	1	N	Y	The Four Musketeers	Sometime ago novelists found that a tough, wily, female heroine sold books. Now James Patterson has decided that more is better. In 1st To Die we have a feminine foursome that tackles crime. This sounds interesting, but in actuality we have one heroine with three other gals pretty much relegated to secondary characters. These three also suffer from a lack of character development. Ken Follett's women in the recent book Jackdaws, on the other hand, benefit greatly from more extensive development of their personalities.<br />Yet the book is quite entertaining, and leads us down a literary road of sharp turns. Essentially we are trying to find a killer who has discovered a new angle in the serial killer profession which is offing newlyweds.. Lindsay Boxer, San Francisco detective, (no relation to Barbara) forms a women's murder club to help her solve the crime.<br />The first strain on our credulity comes when we view the membership list of this club. Would a detective, prosecutor, and medical examiner really welcome a newspaper reporter to their small clique? I have my doubts.<br />Then there are Mr. Patterson's mental lapses.  Suppose you are a typical serial killer who has rented a limousine to be used as a setting for your next job. You take your chosen twosome out to a lonely area, stop the car, and then turn around and shoot them while they are blissfully trying to make children in the back seat. Finally you wash out the car, and return it to the rental agency, pleased that no one will guess what you used the limo for. Well if I worked at the agency I would be a bit puzzled at the bullet holes in the back seat, and the exterior of the car where the missiles probably exited. Then there's the Medical Examiner who feels surprised that a groom wet his pants at his execution. After dealing with dead bodies for years she evidently doesn't realize that when a person dies those two little lower body sphincters relax. This would be trivial carping if weren't that this bodily fluid plays a role in the story. There's more, but what the heck.<br />As I said above it's an entertaining book with the added feature of extremely short chapters. If you don't like to put a book down until you reach the end of a chapter, you will find that that opportunity comes up every three minutes. Wary of reading long, 500 page books? Not to worry. There is so much blank space in this novel that you will finish it in record time.odily fluid plays a role in the story.

Obviously we cannot conduct similar experiments on humans. We can, however, learn a lot about human brain function by studying the behavior of people who have suffered brain damage through trauma or disease.<br />Dr. Ramachandran spends his time studying such patients. His book, Phantoms In The Brain, is filled with case studies from his experiences. A significant section of the book discusses the problems of patients with phantom limb syndrome. Why does the brain continue to think an amputated limb is still present? When a patient's brain reacts as if an amputated hand is in a continually clenched position, causing much pain, how can the brain be fooled into unclenching the hand? Why does shaving sometimes feel like your amputated arm is being stimulated?<br />Damage to various brain centers creates an amazing number of strange maladies. Damage to a visual area can cause \\"blindsight', where the patient cannot see an object, but can point out where it is. And, yes, what about the limbic system? Damage to certain areas in this system can cause various religious experiences. Then there's anosognosia. A stroke may leave one whole side of a patient paralyzed, yet the patient thinks that there is nothing wrong with him.<br />This book is the perfect adjunct to reading a basic book on brain function. That's not necessary, though, as it is totally accessible to the layman, and should keep the reader spellbound. Such works also impress upon me that the brain is the mind. Damage to that vital organ can change who we are.	2002-03-23

This is a book about life. The neighborhoods she shoots are generally poor ones, yet we see people that are involved; people who are actively engaged in life even when they seem to be doing nothing. Her subjects -often children- play, they love, they communicate, they are lost in thought, and occasionally are sleeping.<br />A fine sense of humor permeates many of the scenes. Some subjects are caught in contorted, puzzling positions. We see the incongruous position of objects: an old 33rpm record in the street; a pair of shoes sitting by themselves on a sidewalk; three chickens wandering around a decrepit room -where did they come from? A mother's head is buried in the bottom of a baby buggy while the tyke yelps with joy. A dog is caught in the act of mistaking his owner's leg for a fire hydrant while she talks to a friend.<br />In general HL catches the warm side of humanity. Only a couple of pictures look like they were taken from a file of Jacob Riis (a 19th century photographer of New York tenement life). There was one particularly sad shot of a woman and her three children sitting on their front steps. They are obviously impoverished. The two youngest children seem quite content, but the mother seems weighed down with her life, and in the teen-age daughter we see the beginning of lost hopes.<br />This book is a must for anyone interested in street photography. It will take you a long time to get through this book as each photograph will hold your attention for some time.	2002-03-23

Not content with the usual practice of painting to canvas, he applies his art to the sides of buildings. He takes boring, blank building walls and transforms them into unbelievable elegance. Adding realistic looking windows to these walls is child's play to him.  His true talent lies in creating three-dimensional scenes. What was once bare brick is now fully windowed with a grand curved stairway entrance complete with sculptures and fountains.<br />A dreary Con-Ed substation comes alive with a new architectural style. Windows and doors appear, and the crowning touch is an open courtyard that penetrates the entire building and shows the Brooklyn Bridge behind it - remember this is a flat brick wall.<br />The photographic realness is truly awesome.  The book is full of high quality color prints on glossy paper. If you like photography, art, and architecture, then this is a must read book.	2002-03-22

But to many of the worlds citizens modernization has been extremely painful. The changing of society has also led to religious and political changes that have threatened many devoted religious believers.<br />Karen Armstrong discusses modernization and its effects on three religious faiths: Islam, Protestantism, and Judaism. Secular governments have replaced theocracies; religious reforms have alienated believers; and modernization has caused abrupt cultural changes. Fundamentalism in America developed early in the 20th century when higher criticism scholars began taking a more liberal view of the bible. Jews began making religious changes in order to facilitate assimilation into the general society.  Islam was threatened by modernization attempts made during the 1800s to the present. Britain and France interfered in Egypt while Britain and Russia made their presence known in Iran. Their involvement was near ruinous. Brutal secular governments in Turkey and Egypt threatened the Muslim world. Finally the United States which was viewed as a benevolent country because of its non-involvement in the Middle East  became a negative force when it was involved in the overthrow of Prime Minister Musaddiq in Iran in 1953. The USs support of the Shah even when the mass of Iranian society was protesting his regime, -a regime that had no respect for religion or culture - was a further blight on our diplomacy.<br />These three religious societies feel threatened by the world, and this has resulted in the growth of more extreme fundamentalist views. Its them vs. a corrupt world (the United States is not free from this phenomenon. Not only are fundamentalists trying to inject more religion into government, but also the Christian Reconstructionists have the avowed goal of making the US a theocracy).<br />This should be a must read book for everyone, and especially those who feel that Western society, including the United States, has had nothing to do with the growth of extreme fundamentalism and its resulting fear of the Westd be a must read book for everyone, and especially those who feel that Western society, including the United States, has had nothing to do with the growth of extreme fundamentalism and its resulting fear of the West	2002-03-22

In 1993 and 1994 FC wrote two essays in the New York Review of Books debunking Freud in the first, and tearing to shreds the recovered memory movement in the second.<br />These two essays and the letters in response to them have been put into the book The Memory Wars. As someone trained in experimental psychology you can guess my own personal bias in this matter. Crews discusses Freud's botched cases; his frequent vacillation in theory formation; some of his sillier theories; and his serious interjection of personal bias into the formation of his beliefs. The main problem with the whole Freudian system is the total lack of scientific evidence supporting it. Freudian psychoanalysis is founded on anecdote and supported by anecdotes. To be fair, much current non-Freudian therapy is also based on anecdote. Indignant Freud followers write back, and their letters are indeed interesting (and often pompous).<br />The second half of the book takes on the recovered memory movement. It would be great to poke fun at this movement if it weren't for the fact that it has caused so much damage to all parties involved. Symptoms checklists are published with the statement if you suffer from these symptoms you may be a victim of sexual abuse. Read the list and you will find that the majority of Americans will find that they have been abused. It's all a patient seduction game with the intent to make big money. Hospitals have even set up units to treat such patients (Having worked in the psychiatric hospital industry I am well aware of the \\"product lines\\" that such facilities set up in order to fill beds). Crews does an excellent job of dissecting the memory movement, and once again we get to read the indignant responses.<br />Those who believe that psychological therapy should be based on sound scientific evidence will love this book. Those who have accepted Freudianism with a religious like faith will, of course, hate it. To me this whole subject is analogous to the evolution vs. creationist debate. It's science versus pseudoscience.th a religious like faith will, of course, hate it. To me this whole subject is analogous to the evolution vs. creationist debate.

This is, however, not a story about number nerds. Andrea Aspinall signs on as an agent to spy against the Germans in Lisbon with employment at Shell Oil Company (product placement?) as her cover. The story moves on swiftly with various dead bodies soon scattered around the beautiful Portuguese landscape. Much smoking and drinking is undertaken to pass the time, and Andrea finds romance with a member of the, er, opposition. It's a dangerous liaison, though, and the suspense keeps building.<br />Only twenty days have passed since Andrea landed in Lisbon, and the book is half finished. Surprise. At page 280 the Lisbon adventure ends, and we are back in London years later. Mystified, the reader wonders what is going to happen next. The story meanders along until finally we see that Andrea will spy once again. But this time there is a strange twist to the story. More bodies; more intrigue; more smoking.<br />It's a well written book that is several literary steps above the usual cardboard character novels turned out by various other genre writers appearing on the best seller lists.	2002-03-21

I should qualify that statement by saying that this subject is never an easy read. You need to have more than a middling interest in order to pursue such studies beyond a superficial level. My way of studying scientific topics is to read several books on a subject, gaining different perspectives, and letting it all sink in by the repetition involved.<br />Anatomy of Thought is a fine place to start. Unlike other brain books such as Richard Thompson's \\"The Brain\\", Glynn decided to expand his coverage to include a discussion of evolution, origins of life, and the history of nervous system discovery. It's all very interesting, but some readers may be put off by having to wait until after page 100 to start learning about the main topic.<br />Glynn describes neuron structure and activity, and focuses much attention on vision and linguistics. A very nice coverage of those topics, but only four pages are dedicated to hearing. Much fascinating information is provided on how brain damage affects vision and speech (read also books by Klawans, Sacks and Ramachandran if this topic interests you). Personally I think much of the \\"nervous history\\" section could have been skipped in order to provide a carefully detailed description of nerve function. More pictures and diagrams would also have been helpful.<br />The final section of the book is quite interesting. Forty some pages are devoted to the philosophy of mind, a discussion of the mind-body problem, and free will vs.determinism. If philosophy leaves you cold then you'll be relieved to know that this is really an elective section that can be easily skipped.	2002-03-20

Sophie Chase is bedding a boyfriend when the phone rings. She is told that her recently divorced husband has been found dead. She travels to their home on an island off Massachusetts where he is to be buried. His body was found weeks after he had died, and so the cause of death is not immediately discernible. Sophie knew that he had been despondent over their separation, so her grief is mixed with guilt. The plot involves both her coming to terms with this tragedy, and with relating to his ex-wife and daughters who are also there for the funeral.<br />That's about it, folks.

It is geared to the layman, and is an eminently readable exposition of all the main schools of moral thought. Author Rachels presents each ethical theory, and then presents arguments favoring and opposing the concept. He also applies ethical theories to such concrete problems as abortion, homosexuality, euthanasia, and civil disobedience. If you like mind challenging ideas than you will enjoy this book. At the least you will find that all is not as it seems in the world of moral behavior.<br />All of the main schools of thought are discussed including religious theories, cultural relativism, egoism and utilitarianism. It's an engrossing book that may easily change the way you think.<br />Consider cultural relativism. Is it always wrong to kill? Years ago it was found that nomadic Eskimos often killed newborn infants. A child requires breast nourishment for four years in the cold north, and is carried and sheltered in the mother's parka as the family constantly travels. It is not feasible for a mother to carry, protect, and feed two infants at one time. The entire group would face extinction if too many infants were allowed to grow. Are these Eskimos to be considered immoral?<br />If you have an open mind, this is a great opportunity to learn that ethical behavior is not as rigidly defined as you may have thought.	2002-03-18

Say that you meet a beautiful woman, one thing leads to another, and you find yourself in bed with her quite often. OK, not quite often, but daily. How do you feel about her when passion has been satisfied? Well for one thing the leading lady in this book doesn't always tell the truth, and she seems to have an advanced degree in New Age Speak. She lives in a London slum basement that hasn't been cleaned since Charles Dickens died. Senta also suffers from agoraphobia (actually the least of her mental aberrations), and she gets most of her nutrition from wine and chocolates. Enter Phillip who settles down with her in this squalor, and being that he works as an interior decorator he at least feels obliged to nudge her into changing the sheets every three weeks or so.<br /> Truly I have never met a man whose brains have sagged so far below his belt buckle. I have also never met someone who is able to rationalize a physical infatuation quite like this simple soul. To say that his friend Senta inhabits a dark world is like saying that Satan has a few bad habits.<br />All in all it's a quite interesting Ruth Rendell tale, and I found it to have a most satisfying ending, although, depraved anthropoid that I am, I kept hoping that constantly deluded Phillip would eventually meet an untimely end by having his head mushed in a garbage disposal.

The hero of this novel, a choreographer, is kidnapped by three women who want to use him to satisfy their physical desires. This they do, but our friend really doesn't get into the spirit of it all, and yearns to escape. I don't think I can describe much of this for fear of getting censored by the word police. Let's just say that all the women get pretty satisfied, and then, suddenly, after a few weeks they release him.<br />Does he run to the police and report his kidnapping? He thinks about it, but who would believe him? He's been violated, but can't tell anybody about it. He takes three years off and tours the world to get it out of his system, but when he returns to England he becomes obsessed with finding these women. His search is extensive, but naturally I can't report the outcome. I'll just say that if Camus were alive I would bet anything that he had been hired to write the ending.<br />The theme of this novel is quite original. We can easily accept that women who are abused by men undergo considerable psychological trauma. In this story RT shows us that a man could also suffer damage from such an experience, especially when he feels unable to seek help.<br />Well worth reading.	2002-03-17

Catholic reviewers of these books often view the authors as anti-Catholic writers who have set out to vilify the Church. Readers who wish to so categorize this book have a problem on their hands. They would have to view the Catholic Church itself as being anti-Catholic. The vast majority of Popes Against The Jews is based on material newly released from the Vatican archives, and much of the information presented is from Vatican correspondence and Church newspapers, most significantly the two publications under Vatican supervision: Civilta Cattolica, and L'Osservatore romano.<br />It's really amazing reading. Until the 1850s, when the Papal States were dissolved, Jews living in the Papal States were confined to ghettoes that were locked at night. The Vatican did not allow Jews to own property outside the ghetto, and often they were required to wear identifying armbands. The ghettoes became de facto concentration camps. The size of these areas was not allowed to increase despite increasing populations. Jews lived in poverty and misery.<br />Why this attitude? The Church believed that Jews hated Christians and were required by the Talmud to murder Christian children and consume their blood during Jewish holydays.  The Church promulgated this information not for decades, but for centuries. Catholic newspapers prided themselves on their anti-Semitism. I kept thinking that surely this will disappear by the beginning of the 20th century, but no, it goes on until after the Second World War. The Vatican was pleased that Mussolini passed laws taking away many civil rights from the Jews. All through the centuries the Church declared that there were two kinds of anti-Semitism: the good kind was being opposed to their degraded religious beliefs, and the bad kind which was pure racial anti-Semitism. Franciscans, Dominicans and Jesuits went through towns in many countries ranting against Jews. Catholic newspapers urged them on, but always published the disclaimer that the Church wished them no physical harm.<br />Author Kertzer never criticizes Catholic theology or ritual. He has not set out to mock the Church, but to report material directly from Vatican archives relating to the Church's treatment of the Jews. I had 13 years of Catholic education, and marvel how so much church history was absent from religion classes. I wonder if the same is true today.nting against Jews.

Then again my worst days have occurred after brushing my teeth. Why do I only remember the positive connections? Author Vyse has written an interesting treatise on superstitious people: their types, upbringing, and thinking.<br />Certain social and occupational groups tend to be particularly superstitious: athletes, sailors, soldiers, gamblers, miners, financial investors, and, surprisingly (to me), college students. Many students dress up or dress down for an exam; bring lucky pens; sit in a certain place; indulge in bizarre rituals like entering the exam room through a window, or not coming to the exam until finding a penny on the ground outside.<br />Although the author explores much research seeking the answer to the question of who is most likely to be superstitious, many of the results are not highly significant. One reason for the development of superstition is to give a person a feeling of control in situations where events are often beyond control. This is especially associated with depressed or highly anxious individuals, and those who are deficient in critical thinking.<br />Included is a very important chapter on coincidence, probability, and contiguity. Was an event a coincidence, a supernatural happening or simple proof of the laws of probability? If two events happen in immediate succession was this a coincidence or a case of cause and effect? The author, in conclusion, deplores the fact that critical thinking is not taught in schools. As a result skeptics (like myself) are derided while non-rational beliefs such as New Age thinking are often considered to be the in thing.<br />The beauty of this book is that it can be informative to those with psychology backgrounds, and to the general reader. It's easy reading, entertaining, and sure to increase your knowledge of superstitious behavior. Highly recommended reading.	2002-03-16

Well, it does assume that you know nothing about the nervous system, but it certainly goes beyond what most people consider a primer to be. Actually this is a wonderful book for the interested, intelligent layman who wants to learn more than a superficial introduction to the subject. It's a thick book of 500 pages, and you will want to take your time with it. You'll be reading and rereading many passages in order to fully comprehend what you've read. Skim through it and you'll finish with very little of it stuck in your long-term memory.<br />Doctor Thompson, a Neuropsychologist, is a patient teacher. For the most part he proceeds slowly, never leaping over one step in order to get to the next. The first 200 pages are on the structure and physiology of nerves. Extensive coverage is given to the function of neurotransmitters, and to what happens when they go wrong.<br />The rest of the book is about the brain itself, and includes a discussion of sensory and motor control systems; the life cycle of the brain; learning and memory; and an introduction to cognitive neuroscience. Each chapter provides an end summary of the material covered.<br />In the latter half of the book I did feel confused at times. The brain has so many parts and areas of specialization that I had some difficulty keeping things straight. If you are fascinated by the brain, and are willing to read an extensive yet accessible treatise on the subject this may be the book for you.	2002-03-12

Theron Ware enters the scene as a small town Methodist Minister. He and his wife seem to be humble folk and settle into a small house near his church. Soon he meets a Catholic priest, an atheist physician, and a beautiful Irish lass. They make quite an impression on him. They are sophisticated, well educated, and quite worldly. Alas, they are such a strong influence on him that he starts playing the worldly role, and begins to look down on his job and his religion. He also finds himself strongly attracted to the lovely Celia Madden. I should mention that in those days the Irish were assigned to the caste of untouchables.<br />Theron acts as if he is now a man of the world, although he knows nothing of the literature, music, and philosophy discussed by others. He becomes a boring, mean minded buffoon. The book continues with his steady degradation, a preacher who has become a victim of that secular humanism that our current day fundamentalists complain so much about.<br />The novel provides an interesting view of religion and culture of the late 1800s. It was somewhat difficult for me to understand how such a seemingly pious man could turn into such a churlish fellow. Perhaps his upbringing was quite religiously strict, and he developed a strong reaction formation to it all.	2002-03-12

We generally think of them as belonging to George Bush's axis of evil. As a matter of fact, says author Tom Wakeford, the majority of these mini creatures are essential for life. This is an easy to read, highly accessible little volume on symbiosis. Symbiosis involves two or more life forms combining their efforts to add to the life benefit of each.<br />At the beginning of the book we bump into, of all people, Beatrix Potter of Peter Rabbit fame. She was actually a biologist who subscribed to the then dissident theory that some organisms were combinations of two separate entities. She believed that lichens, those lumpy gray/green things on rocks and tree trunks, were composed of a fungus and an alga. Her scientific peers were so scornful of this belief that she ultimately quit biology, and consoled herself by writing. This career change could be considered good or bad, depending on whether you are fascinated by lichens or prefer to read books about Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle.<br />We learn of the interesting symbiosis between plants, fungi, and bacteria. Nitrogen fixing bacteria provide the plants with necessary, accessible nitrogen. Part of the problem that plants then face is finding the rest of the nutrients that they need. They simply can't grow huge root systems to search and find patches of underground food. Various fungi solve this problem by linking up with plants. They then send tiny tendrils far afield that discover the nutrients and send them to the plant roots. Orchids in the tropics have become endangered species. People dig them up and send them to collectors in the other parts of the world. They are then planted in gardens where they promptly die. They require a certain fungus to survive, and that fungus is found only in the habitat where they originally grew.<br />The book is full of tales of symbiotic science. How do some insects thrive on nutrients from leaves that they can neither chew nor digest? What bacteria live in our bodies, and how do they help us? This is one of those great science books that both teach and entertain.ve in our bodies, and how do they help us? This is one of those great science books that both teach and entertain.	2002-03-11

It's a fascinating book written for the general reader. Pragmatism is considered to be America's chief contribution to philosophy. Menand covers all of the above topics in the context of the culture of the times. Mini-biographies of William James, Oliver Wendell Holmes, John Dewey and Charles Sanders Peirce are seamlessly woven into the text.<br />The reader learns of the development of the new fields of Psychology and Sociology. Holmes' new theories of the law are discussed: Law is based not on logic, but on experience; liability under the law is based on what a reasonable man would determine.<br />I found the section on late nineteenth century science to be quite interesting. Today's social constructionists say science is not based on a search for truth, but is reflective of cultural and political beliefs. Although I am not in agreement with much of this current philosophy, you will find interesting evidence of this concept being exhibited in the late 1800s. Samuel Norton, an anthropologist did some very flawed, actually meaningless research, and concluded that there were five basic races that could be graded by skull size. Caucasians had the largest skulls, and Blacks the smallest, thus proving that  Whites are the brightest, and Blacks the most intellectual inferior. Many liked this theory, including the noted scientist Louis Agassiz. It confirmed their views of that \\"degraded\\" Black race.<br />This is a fascinating book that is very accessible to the intelligent layman. You'll enjoy it, unless, of course, you have no interest in philosophy, law, religion, science, psychology, sociology, anthropology or culture.	2002-03-11

My education is in Psychology, but I love biology, neuroscience, physics, and related topics. Tapir's Bath looked like an entertaining way to cram more about creature behavior into my brain. Actually you end up learning not an awful lot about the behavior of animals in the wild, but you do get an education about the behavior of scientists in the wild. While most primates, man included, are social animals, scientists seem to be loners like members of the cat family. They often are reclusive, enticed to be social only by the promise of a party that offers booze and food. Territorially jealous they form caste systems that allow them to sneer at other specialties. They grumble about cell biologists that sit in nice warm laboratories while they have to plow through muck and rain, bitten by a variety of small insects. Oh yes, and the microbiologists get all of the public attention, and the research funding. The public just doesn't seem to care about the distance a bat flies to obtain food.<br />The science bits are quite interesting, but not comprehensive enough to add much to your knowledge of biology. But that doesn't matter. The scientists on Barro Colorado Island deserve a lot of credit for their painstaking, difficult, uncomfortable research. I was interested in reading about their field research while being thankful that I majored in a subject that keeps me indoors where my biggest environmental problem is getting the thermostat adjusted correctly. Elizabeth Royte also proves that science writers often have to endure hardships. Pregnant during some of her long stay on Barro Colorado, she also trekked through rain and mud, returning to base to rest in bed and meditate on the cockroaches climbing her walls. It's a fun book.	2002-03-11

It would seem that some Americans are divorced from the reality of torture, and view it as an abstract concept. Those folks should read this book. There are some disturbing torture scenes in this novel, but they are not gratuitous. After reading these scenes I would hope that you would agree that torture in not an acceptable interrogation technique.<br />Colin Harrison writes books that do not follow standard formulae, even when the book is a thriller such as this one. Afterburn is also a tale that takes its time; a story that does not feel required to advance at a frantic pace. In my opinion the characters are well defined. CH spends a lot of time acquainting us with their thoughts, feelings and behavior. The problem for some readers might be that no one in the book is very likeable.<br />The plot circles slowly around an event that happened prior to the beginning of the book. A truckload of stolen air conditioners is intercepted by the police, and one of those involved, Christina Welles, serves some prison time for her bad behavior. Near the beginning of the book she is released from prison. Other characters are introduced chapter by chapter, and we begin wondering how they will all be tied together. While it would be difficult to identify with any of them, they do arouse your curiosity. What particularly intrigued me was the increasing feeling that some, if not all, of the main characters might meet with disaster. But you are never sure who will survive, and who will not. There is also an important mystery in Afterburn that you do not become aware of until the second half of the book. It then begins to slowly grow until you are caught up in a new wave of suspense.<br />In my opinion this Colin Harrison novel is on a par with the rest of his works: an excellent, ingenious tale.

Forget the fact that it seems to be printed on paper three grades below newsprint. Pay no attention to its external dimensions, which are smaller than most hardback novels. Although it's natural to be skeptical about any book that has \\"complete\\" in its title, lets ignore that. The key question is: What's inside the book?<br />Why did I get such a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu feeling when I started to thumb through the it? Turning to the table of contents I soon realized why some of the material seemed so familiar. The entire book is made up of chapters from other books! Do you own the book Mastering Photoshop 6? Well six chapters of that book show up in this one. All in all about 8 books were raided in order to compose this one volume.<br />Now if you don't own any of those 8 books, then by all means consider buying this one. It does have a lot of useful information in it, and it certainly won't require you to take out a three-year loan to pay for it. I do own a couple of the other books, however, and so I feel a bit cheated.	2001-12-29

Do you know the meaning of every one of the zillion commands found in Photoshop? No, I thought not. When you want to find out the difference between random or level-based methods in the Extrude Dialog Box, can you immediately turn to that topic in one of your Photoshop Books? The Photoshop 6 Shop Manual is an astounding and necessary volume for a Photoshop library. This encyclopedia lists every command, tool, dialog box, and option found in Photoshop. It lists them, and then describes their usage along with issues to consider in their use and mistakes to avoid. This material uses up the first 700 pages of the book.<br />Next we come upon 230 pages containing 170 techniques which include such things as: correcting fleshtones; colorizing with duotone mode; and evaluating shadows and highlights. Wait, we're not finished yet. The next section contains 23 pages of keyboard shortcuts. I'm used to some small two-sided cardboard list of the shortcuts. I never dreamed there were this many. Next there are 15 pages of color plate, followed by an immense index of topics, and an issue index.<br />A couple of years ago I purchase a book for Photoshop 5 titled \\"Photoshop in a Nutshell\\" which pretty much followed the same format.

First of all it is a pretty good story, and that's why I gave it a handful of stars, but please don't try and suspend your disbelief while reading it. Read it as a frenzied, fantasy thriller sinking under the weight of its hilarious mistakes. I'll give you one example. Our hero has spent a good half-hour crawling through a totally dark cave tunnel when he emerges into a large cavern where equipment is stored. The cavern is dimly lit from cracks of light coming through a large door to the outside. Folks are in the cavern talking amongst themselves, but before John Reacher joins them he stops to let his \\"vision build.\\" The author doesn't seem to realize that vision adaptation takes place when going from light to dark, but not from dark to light. When you get up in the middle of the night and turn your 40-watt bedside lamp, you don't sit there for ten minutes waiting for your \\"vision to build.\\"<br />Our fearless protagonist spends this book fighting a fanatic militia group located in a remote Montana forest. He's way outnumbered of course, but the FBI is coming to the rescue.  Three of their stalwart agents decide to penetrate the dense, heavily patrolled forest, so they button their pin stripe suit coats, straighten their ties, shine their wingtip shoes, and head for the woods. Child doesn't tell whether or not they took their briefcases with them. What ever happened to the casual attire, the jackets with FBI emblazoned on the back?<br />Then there's the shrugging. When is the last time you shrugged? Child's characters do it constantly, often more than once per page. It really grates on you after awhile. The author also seems compelled to use that creaky old literary device of providing a lengthy description of every weapon used. You know, the one that goes something like this: \\"George picked up his Schlock .369 rifle with its lemon scented, knotty pine stock, cantilevered lead alloy barrel, and viscous damped trigger. The Schlock is capable of firing a 27.6 gram  projectile at the rate of ..Etc.\\" [...]P>In any event it's still a fun read relatively unmarred by mushy romance.

It is a volume that presents the actual majority and minority opinions of those Supreme Court decisions most significant in the field of constitutional law. Other books might, for instance, give you an analysis of the Dredd Scott decision, but this book presents the actual wording of Chief Justice Taney's opinion. About 100 cases are included, with the opinions edited to make them more manageable. It's an invaluable reference for those interested in some of the country's most important legal decisions. Its only deficiency is that it doesn't cover any cases after 1984.<br />If this book interests you, then you might also consider &quot;The Constitution and Religion&quot;, edited by Robert S. Alley.

Zadie Smith's ability to portray a person, a  place, or an organization gets you so absorbed that you resent it when she  grabs you by the arm, and insists that you return to the plot that meanders  vaguely through the book. Where some authors might state that a character  clears his throat, Ms Smith provides us with &quot;Erhummmm, a  sound..(that) began in his arched nostrils and reverberated through his  slight, elongated, misshapen limbs like the final shiver of a hanged  man.&quot;<br /> Mind you she can be offensive to some. She's probably  alienated a whole country when she states that Bangladesh is God's attempt  at black humor. Ah, but the pictures she paints. There are the two people  who are swallowed whole by their commitment to Jehovah's Witnesses, their  dialogue suffused with musty, dreary religious references. Then there is  that lengthy description of teens furtively smoking at recess, or the  history of Ibrahim ad-Din Shukrallah, founder of KEVIN, a militant Islamic  youth organization. He spent five years in his aunt's garage, never leaving  it until he had written his 637 often-incomprehensible rules for his new  movement. Ibrahim gives a hilariously inept speech to his followers, and Ms  Smith, as usual, drags me away from it. She also forcibly removes me from  O'Connell's Poolroom wherein dwell, permanently it would seem, some of  London's most colorful curmudgeons.<br />Ms Smith mistreats her characters.  She introduces them, gets you interested in them, and then often relegates  them to the shadows. I had great hopes in getting to know Clara, the tall,  beautiful, but toothless Jamaican beauty that enters to much fanfare in an  early scene, and then all but vanishes. Others suffer the same fate. The  Bangladeshi Asmad has a wonderful way of speaking, but somewhere around the  middle of the book you wonder why he rarely makes any more appearances. The  author essentially tells the tale of two generations of two families. There  is nothing heroic or virtuous about these people, so Ms Smith simply makes  them funny.

Your  average racist would say that Australia would have developed a great  civilization while Europe would have remained a region of the world where  people today would still be throwing spears about. Mr. Diamond explores the  progress of humanity by scientifically studying the factors that permitted  and encouraged the growth of complex societies. A society is where it is  because of geographical factors, and not because of any variables of  intelligence or physique. What are these factors? The answers are  fascinating:<br />Societies moved from hunter/gatherer types to farmers  because they lived in areas where potential food crops grew, and where  animals capable of being domesticated lived. Most of the world's food crops  originated in the Fertile Crescent of the Mediterranean. Many areas of the  world such as Australia and much of the United States had no original food  crops. Could it be that some people were just too stupid to recognize a  plant's potential? No. Amazingly almost all edible plants were domesticated  thousands of years ago, as were our domesticated animals. Australia had no  animals capable of being domesticated while horses, sheep, goats, and pigs  originated in, and spread quickly through the Euro-Asian continent. We  learn some interesting facts about food plant development. Many plants  became food because of defective genes. The wild almond tree is poisonous,  but some trees were found with defective cyanide producing genes. They were  cultivated. Wild peas have a gene that causes the pea pod to explode when  ripe, which would make harvesting impossible. Pea plants were found that  lacked this &quot;explosion&quot; gene, and so today we eat  peas.<br />Societies with domestic animals developed diseases that originated  in these animals. (Measles, tuberculosis, and smallpox come from cattle;  influenza from pigs). Thus Europeans decimated the Incas and Native  Americans by passing on these germs. Incas and Native Americans had no  domesticated animals (only the llama in Peru), so they could not fight back  with germs of their own.<br />Mr. Diamond presents an immense amount of  evidence to show that all peoples are intelligent, and that the development  of large, organized societies hinges entirely on varied local natural  resources, and being in locations where natural barriers (deserts,  mountains, oceans) did not preclude the sharing of resources with others.  This is a most impressive work that provides the reader with insight into  why hunter/gatherer tribes live together on the same planet with highly  complex technological nations.mals.

This is a nicely bound, low priced volume of Shakespeare's sonnets. But it  is more than just that. Each sonnet is on a page by itself with explanatory  notes on the facing page. While most of us do not need a spoon-feeding of  these wonderful works, we sometimes do come to an abrupt halt at &quot;some  in their garments like new-fangled ill&quot;, or &quot;sometimes a  blusterer that the ruffle knew of court&quot;. In the above instances we  are talking about fashionable but absurd garments, and a braggart's  display. Also, many elisions are changed to modern words (e.g. advised for  aduis'd) except where such a change would hinder the flow of the sonnet.  There are also over 100 pages of historical and critical comments at the  front of the book, which you can read or ignore as you choose.<br />All in  all this is an excellent package of the sonnets with a very useful set of  notes. It's great that all of the notes are adjacent to the sonnets, so  that you do not have to page back and forth, and that there are no nasty  little note reference numbers marring the lines of the sonnets.	2000-08-03

This amazing woman botanist hauls herself up by rope or other devices into the 150-foot high  canopies of forest trees to study herbivory (process by which animals  consume plant leaves). She spends weeks in tropical forests in Cameroon,  Peru, Belize, Australia, and Panama patiently counting leaves, and insect  damage to them. She works in 100-degree humid heat, covered with mud,  bitten by botflies, and chewed on by chiggers. How does she describe these  arduous adventures? Well, try words like exciting and exhilarating. All  this should come as quite a shock to folks who imagine botanists work in  nice little greenhouses developing a new breed of chartreuse rose. It is  indeed amazing and difficult work, and we are fortunate to have people  eager to do it.<br />Normally I don't care for little biographies of this  type because they are usually heavy on the personal life, and light on the  science. Life In The Treetops presents a pleasant blend of the two. After  receiving her Ph.D. in Sydney the author married a farmer and lived in the  Australian outback. Women aren't expected to have careers there, and her  story of that part of her life is fascinating.<br />You will also learn  interesting informational morsels from the world of botany. Fig trees start  life as an epiphyte, their seeds germinating high in the crown of a tree.  They then send tendrils down the tree, and these become roots when they  touch the ground. The tree essentially grows backwards. Touch a certain  Australian tree, and it stings you with venom equal to a bee sting. Some  ants bring a variety of seeds to the top of the tree, and let them  germinate there to form an ant garden. Ants farming? Some trees in the dark  forest grow to a five inch height, and then wait for as long as 35 years  for a sunny opening to develop in the canopy. Then they shoot up.<br />Typical of most science books I read these days, this volume ends on a  sad note regarding humans and the environment.

It's an encyclopedia that discusses many of those shameful heretical theories, and includes biographies of those villains who propose them. But  wait a minute. Why are there articles in here on Louis Pasteur, the big  bang theory, biofeedback, continental drift, and Sir Isaac Newton? Half the  book is filled with supposed charlatans and groundless theories while the  other half reads like a who's who of science. Sir Isaac Newton? One brief  sentence in a long biography of him mentions that he was interested in  alchemy. Continental drift and Big Bang? The author states that when first  proposed these theories were thought to be nonsense. Well, isn't that the  case with a lot of theories? Alfred Wegener had a lot of evidence to  support his 1915 theory of continental drift. You don't have evidence in  pseudoscience (that's what makes it pseudoscience). The author praises  biofeedback as effective, stating that it is based on sound scientific  principles. So why is it in this book?<br />Rest assured there are articles on  pseudoscience in the book. You'll find sections on Theosophy, lycanthropy,  kickapoo oil, the I ching, Hoxsey's cancer treatment, Our Lady of Fatima,  fairies, dowsing, Madame Blavatsky, and Immanuel Velikovsky. I found almost  all of the articles interesting to read regardless of subject.<br />There is  suggested reading material at the end of many articles, and, at the end of  the book, an immense bibliography of books. I do wish that Mr. Williams had  left out the articles on subjects that admittedly are real science, and  used the space for more material on pseudoscience. In his discussion of  parapsychology, for example, he mentions that experiments in the field have  become more rigorous in recent years. Yet he says nothing either about the  design problems of older experiments, or the results of the newer, better  controlled studies. He also doesn't comment on the vast amount of material  critiquing parapsychology - the 1987 study by the National Academy of  Sciences, for example.<br />I should stress that this is a book for true  skeptics. If you believe in homeopathy, reflexology or astrology you will  need your blood pressure medication when you read this. If you believe in  all three of those above theories, well, you might suffer a cerebrovascular  accident (stroke) by the time you reach page 46.amount of material  critiquing parapsychology - the 1987 study by the National Academy of  Sciences, for example.<br />I should stress that this is a book for true  skeptics.

Rare Fish Discovers Human Predators	What should you do if you are a fish thought to be extinct for millions of years, and suddenly humans discover you?  You should really give some serious thought to finding a better place to hide. Ms. Weinberg tells the  exciting story of the 1938 discovery of this rare fish, and the continual  efforts to obtain more of them. You immediately develop an affectionate  bond with this strange, yet beautiful, creature that hides in rocky caves  far from the surface of the ocean. Its fins are almost like limbs; its tail  is like that of no other fish; it likes to stand on its head; its babies  are born live; it seems to use magnetic fields to find its prey; its brain  is the size of a grape.<br />Understandably scientists wanted to see more of  these fish on their dissection tables, and to date more than two hundred  coelacanths have ended up there. Bounties were established for their  capture, and the Japanese wanted to get a live specimen. Fortunately  conservationists were reasonably quick in getting regulations established  for old &quot;four legs'&quot; protection.  The fish cannot live in  captivity: It overheats in surface temperature water, and the bright  sunlight blinds it. It's really sad when a scientist has to state that if  the coelacanth prospers in other locations hopefully we won't find  them.<br />I experienced some frustration in my reading. As a layman with a  strong interest in science I came to tire of the extensive human  biographies found in the book, and wanted to learn more about the fish  itself. Fortunately there is a 9-page appendix in the back of the book that  discusses the anatomy and physiology of the coelacanth. Still there could  have been some more accessible science in this book.  On the other hand  &quot;A Fish Caught In Time&quot; is an important, necessary work.	2000-07-29

Author Garry Wills' thesis is that Catholicism has evolved from a church that valued the input of all of its members to an authoritarian institution that is &quot;all head and no limbs.&quot; Since Pope Pius IX had the  papacy declared infallible (when speaking ex cathedra) in 1870 we have seen  the development of the concept that, in Wills' words, &quot;the Pope alone  is competent to tell Christian people how to live. No one else can have any  say in the matter - not a Council, not the college of all bishops, not the  national synods of bishops, not the Christian people.&quot;<br />Mr. Wills  devotes various chapters to authoritarian teachings that were not part of  the early church such as birth control, priestly celibacy, women's roles,  and the cult of Mary. He describes, for instance how Pope Paul VI and  conservative cardinals tried to keep the birth control issue out of the  Vatican Council. A committee was formed, and it was hoped that it would  make a recommendation supporting the status quo. The large, prestigious  committee voted overwhelmingly, however, to change the church's position on  birth control. Paul VI disregarded their report feeling, presumably, that  the church would lose face changing a teaching that has been in effect for  centuries.<br />Wills explores in some detail the biblical passages that are  used to support various teachings, and finds them wanting. He relates the  emphasis that St. Augustine placed on honesty in the church, and then  deplores the modern church's frequent attempts to cover up unpleasant  matters such as the banking scandal, and various cases of sexual abuse by  the clergy.<br />While there may be a feeling of great security in belonging  to a church that rules with paternal authority, there should be room as in  the early church for its members to have a say. Gary Wills is having his  say. This is an excellent book that makes you think about how the church  has evolved. Do many current teachings reflect the will of God, or the will  of the Vatican?of God, or the will  of the Vatican?	2000-07-28

It summons up its strength, and shoots all of its internal organs out its, uh, rear end directly into the face of its assailant. The dazed, disgusted  fish, covered with a mucky mess, wanders off looking elsewhere for its  lunch. Amazingly the sea cucumber has the ability to then regenerate all of  its internal organs.<br />This book generally covers the same topics found in  an introductory text of Oceanography. Oriented toward the general reader it  skips the math, the chemical formulas, and other aspects of hard science  that might frighten away the non-scientist. The first section takes one  through the ocean's development from the Precambrian era to the present  time. We then study the composition of the ocean, its currents and climate.  After reading about tsunamis you will understand why the science in the  movie The Poseidon Adventure was, um, all wet. In the ocean geology  section, plate tectonics are discussed, and we read an interesting  discourse on how Hawaii developed as a chain of small islands.<br />The  largest section of the book deals with the ocean's biology. What is its  best-designed fish (the tuna)? Why are fish able to drink salt water while  we humans cannot tolerate it? When we say that a certain fish lives to a  certain age how do we know that? We study its ears - read the book for the  details.<br />The material presented was so fascinating that I often became  frustrated. I found myself crying out, &quot;Don't stop now; tell me more  about that.&quot; When the author mentions that the Portuguese Man-Of-War  was actually a colony of various organisms, I wanted to know more about how  this could be.  But, as usual, I was led off to another interesting topic.  Another trivial complaint: while the book has some pictures and drawings, I  frequently wished there were more of them. In the &quot;news you can  use&quot; category I think she should have spent some time discussing  formation and destruction of beaches (suggested reading on this topic:  Against The Tide by Cornelia Dean).<br />I like to read science books, but I  become increasingly depressed about some of what I read in those dedicated  to the biological and earth sciences. Almost every author spends some time  discussing the damage we humans are causing to the environment.

Who better than Bill Bryson to introduce us to Megascolides australis, the giant 12 foot long Australian earthworms? He is, after all, the antithesis to the academic who, in broaching such a subject, would have you nodding  off within five sentences. Bill is such an amiable entertainer that he can  quickly get you enthused with his brief doses of Australian politics,  history, culture and natural history. Some have thought this book to be  shallow, but they are missing the point. We don't pick up a Bill Bryson  book when we seek research material for our doctoral dissertations.  Likewise we don't pore through a Dave Barry volume to learn the latest  political theory, or a George Carlin tome to soak up modern religious  philosophy.<br />This very funny book provides the reader with an introduction  to many aspects of Australia. He is fascinated with the countryside, and  the amazing flora and fauna that call this intriguing continent home. He  gives us easily digestible historical and cultural anecdotes, and we are as  soon excited about the platypus as he is. No he doesn't spend a lot of time  discussing night life in Sydney; he's much happier looking under a rock in  the desert near Alice Springs or wandering through some secondhand  bookshop, or dusty museum.<br />Plus you thrill as he bravely fights two  giant, poisonous spiders - well.. actually it's their webs that he fights;  the spiders seemed to be away at the moment. Sit there amazed as he tells  you tales of deadly crocodiles, and venomous snakes. Be bored silly each  day when at 5PM he drags you to a lonely pub in order to quaff booze in  quantities sufficient to render him comatose and to generate his next  morning's hangover. The continual recounting of his daily imbibing is the  one annoyance that seems to go through most of his books. That aside, this  is one of his best efforts. Not as good as The Lost Continent (his  funniest) or Notes from a Small Island, but much better than I'm a Stranger  Here Myself.Myself.	2000-07-14

Ted Conover is a reporter who, without the knowledge of his employer, went through the training academy, and then spent close to a year as a guard at Sing Sing - but please don't call them guards to their faces; they are  Corrections Officers (CO).<br />In our every day society we meet all types of  people. Human psychology is such that we all have to have someone to look  down on. We simply have to be better than many of the other folks in our  world. We look down on liberals, or conservatives. We feel superior to our  bosses, or gays, minorities, atheists, or trailer trash. Surely somebody  doesn't cut it as well as we do. In prison there are only two classes of  people: guards and those who are guarded. And each class finds the other  group inferior. Wait a minute. I should have said there are three classes.  Senior COs also look down on junior officers.<br />Prisoner abuse? That  doesn't appear to happen too often. What about guard abuse? Surprisingly  the COs seem to be the subject of nearly constant harassment by the  prisoners. The prisoners, having time on their hands, love to confront COs,  and shower them with epithets. And, as I mentioned earlier, Senior COs  harass guards who are one step lower than they are.<br />What are the rewards  of such a job? As far as I can determine there are none whatsoever. The pay  is not good. Most of those around you hate you, or at best tolerate you,  and never expect someone to say that you are doing good work. The rules are  applied so ambiguously and inconsistently that you are constantly  frustrated. The fear also never seems to go away. Sometimes the pent up  stress is relieved in physical contact between prisoners and their keepers  (generally initiated by the prisoners). Maybe even that's not all bad.  Better, perhaps than going home and beating up the wife, and kicking the  dog.<br />This is a very interesting book, and while the author does not  really get into the heads of the COs and the felons, it is a tale not often  heard.e not often  heard.	2000-07-05

Or, use it as I do as an excellent reference  tool.<br />The book begins with almost fifty pages of global maps showing the  position of the continents and the condition of earth from Precambrian  times to the present. Most of the rest of the book is devoted to picturing  and describing life forms during the same periods. Chapters at the end of  the book deal with plate tectonics, types of rock, fossils and dating  techniques and many other appropriate subjects. And yes, dinosaur fans,  there is a section on the K-T boundary, that period 65 million years ago  when the Chicxulub meteorite ended their reign.<br />I'm currently reading a  book on oceanography, in which the author describes a late Cambrian  creature called Hallucigenia which had stiff spikes on one side and  flexible appendages on the other side. The creature was so strange that for  a long time scientists could not determine which sides were top or bottom.  There was no picture of this oddity in my oceanography book, and being very  curious about  Hallucigenia's appearance I grabbed my Atlas of the  Prehistoric world. Sure enough, there was a good picture of the fossil.   The atlas is packed with fossil photos and artistic renderings of what  these creatures probably looked like. Paper quality and layout are  excellent, and I like the fact that each section is presented by earth's  ages. Trying to remember just what the Devonian period is famous for?  Finding the answer (it is fish) is easy.	2000-07-01

Your average racist would say that Australia would have developed a great  civilization while Europe would have remained a region of the world where  people today would still be throwing spears about. Mr. Diamond explores the  progress of humanity by scientifically studying the factors that permitted  and encouraged the growth of complex societies. A society is where it is  because of geographical factors, and not because of any variables of  intelligence or physique. What are these factors? The answers are  fascinating:<br />Societies moved from hunter/gatherer types to farmers  because they lived in areas where potential food crops grew, and where  animals capable of being domesticated lived. Most of the world's food crops  originated in the Fertile Crescent of the Mediterranean. Many areas of the  world such as Australia and much of the United States had no original food  crops. Could it be that some people were just too stupid to recognize a  plant's potential? No. Amazingly almost all edible plants were domesticated  thousands of years ago, as were our domesticated animals. Australia had no  animals capable of being domesticated while horses, sheep, goats, and pigs  originated in, and spread quickly through the Euro-Asian continent. We  learn some interesting facts about food plant development. Many plants  became food because of defective genes. The wild almond tree is poisonous,  but some trees were found with defective cyanide producing genes. They were  cultivated. Wild peas have a gene that causes the pea pod to explode when  ripe, which would make harvesting impossible. Pea plants were found that  lacked this &quot;explosion&quot; gene, and so today we eat  peas.<br />Societies with domestic animals developed diseases that originated  in these animals. (Measles, tuberculosis, and smallpox come from cattle;  influenza from pigs). Thus Europeans decimated the Incas and Native  Americans by passing on these germs. Incas and Native Americans had no  domesticated animals (only the llama in Peru), so they could not fight back  with germs of their own. <br />Mr. Diamond presents an immense amount of  evidence to show that all peoples are intelligent, and that the development  of large, organized societies hinges entirely on varied local natural  resources, and being in locations where natural barriers (deserts,  mountains, oceans) did not preclude the sharing of resources with others.  This is a most impressive work that provides the reader with insight into  why hunter/gatherer tribes live together on the same planet with highly  complex technological nations.	2000-06-30

I don't know who is worse. Is it the doctor, the subject of this book, an alleged murderer of 35 or more hospital patients, or is it the arrogantly stupid physicians who let him get away with it in not one, but at least  five hospitals? Michael Swango is a licensed physician who seemingly has a  compulsion to kill people. Possibly a narcissistic psychopath he evidently  enjoys injecting poisonous substances into hospital patients, friends and  co-workers. Slipping arsenic into the ice tea of fellow paramedics is what  got him his first prison sentence.<br />He first started his alleged killing  spree during a residency at Ohio State University Hospital. He evidently  continued his bizarre activities after prison during residencies at the  University of South Dakota, and at the State University of New York at  Stony Brook. Why does a physician felon convicted of poisoning people  continue to obtain medical residencies? Here's why. The physicians  conducting the admissions programs are too incompetent to properly screen  his application, even though he admits to being an ex convict. Then after  patients die left and right, and nursing staff turn him in to the medical  staff, the doctors refuse to believe their testimony. One key witness was a  student nurse. It was quickly agreed by medical staff, as they all rolled  their eyes, that no one should really accept what a student nurse has to  say.<br />One doctor conducted an egregiously incompetent investigation of  Dr. Swango's activities. Another was equally negligent in screening Dr.  Swango's admission to a residency program. What punishment has been meted  out to these two physicians? They both are now working for the Association  of Medical Colleges in Washington, D.C. where they oversee the application  process of all medical school residents in America. Isn't that wonderful?<br />Dr. Swango now moves on to work in African hospitals where the death  toll continues to rise. Suspended from one hospital for his suspected  murder of several patients, he secures another position at a hospital  nearby while the police investigate charges against him. Returning to the  USA he is arrested, tried and convicted on a fraud charge. He will be  released from prison any day now, and presumably might join the medical  staff at a hospital near you.<br />I normally don't read true-crime books,  but, having spent my entire career in hospital management, the topic  intrigued me. It reads like a thriller, and believe me the behavior of the  doctors (excluding Dr. Swango) in the book didn't surprise me at all.suspected  murder of several patients, he secures another position at a hospital  nearby while the police investigate charges against him.

This is a nicely bound, low priced volume of Shakespeare's sonnets. But it is more than just that. Each sonnet is on a page by itself with explanatory notes on the facing page. While most of us do not need a spoon-feeding of  these wonderful works, we sometimes do come to an abrupt halt at &quot;some  in their garments like new-fangled ill&quot;, or &quot;sometimes a  blusterer that the ruffle knew of court&quot;. In the above instances we  are talking about fashionable but absurd garments, and a braggart's  display. Also, many elisions are changed to modern words (e.g. advised for  aduis'd) except where such a change would hinder the flow of the sonnet.  There are also over 100 pages of historical and critical comments at the  front of the book, which you can read or ignore as you choose. <br />All in  all this is an excellent package of the sonnets with a very useful set of  notes. It's great that all of the notes are adjacent to the sonnets, so  that you do not have to page back and forth, and that there are no nasty  little note reference numbers marring the lines of the sonnets.	2000-06-28

A little paraphrase there of Edwin Arlington  Robinson's &quot;Richard Cory.&quot; Yes, the protagonist of this novel  does admire the rich Richard Corys of the world. He's a low paid, bitter  director of a non-profit foundation, and is surrounded by the rich members  of its board. Yet every day he climbs into his dented Honda, and drives  home to his tiny, rented town house, and is greeted there by his average  wife, and average children (If I had written the book I would have been  tempted to name them John and Jane Doe). These folks are not graduates of  the ghetto, mind you; they both have college degrees, yet are going  nowhere. His wife Megan at one point muses to herself that Warner is the  singularly most negative person she ever met. Part of the reason he is  negative is that he considers himself a modern day Job. He hates foundation  work. A misspent grant has put his job in jeopardy, and his wife's job is  also sort of iffy. The day care center considers his daughter to be slower  than everyone else, and his infant son seems to cry an awful lot.<br />One  day someone sneaks up behind wife Megan at the art gallery where she works,  and smashes her in the back of the head with a hammer.

Well, the guys get involved in helping an attractive  woman retrieve some stolen money, and a strange murder infringes on their  imbibing rituals. Judge Wheeling also decides to punish his wife for a  marital no-no by chaining her naked to the freeway exit sign at Climax,  North Carolina. The judge also has some strange mental lapses that suggest  some sort of organic brain syndrome. And what about that yellowed letter  with the strange stamps?<br />The dialogue in this novel is great fun,  although its baroque quality varies from time to time. The conversations  between judge Wheeling and his black girlfriend are particularly amusing.  This book is about a couple of ne'er-do-well brothers who ultimately seem  on the road to mediocre-do-well. It's different; it's fun.	2000-06-09

Sure there is a Republican senatorial candidate who isn't someone you'd like to have a beer with, but there also is a sleazy Democrat president, and a Democrat appointee for the Cabinet  who has some very bad habits. Our protagonist, Senator Martin, is running  for re-election in a midwestern state. The author shows the forces that  constrain the life of a politician. Behavior is political; decisions are  political. Our elected representatives are often less than admirable  people, but you already know that. Senator Martin considers trips back to  &quot;poke the folks&quot; in his home state as equivalent to &quot;paying  the bills&quot;, a tedious repetitious task that he is quite skilled at.<br />The story weaves together Martin's political life with his romantic  life. Both are often at risk. His election rival is a gentleman who thumps  the bible, but is he really that righteous? The fact that he is a  Republican should not be upsetting. Remember that all of our recent  presidential hopefuls have managed to tell us how religious they are.  Author Klein's sanctimonious candidate simply reminds us that Thomas  Jefferson and many of his peers felt that religion in politics only serves  to demean religion; we are in deep trouble if God needs politicians to be  His spokesmen. Yet despite the campaigns managed by Lee Atwater act alikes,  we see candidates who do have beliefs, and one of those is that if their  opponent wins the country will be severely damaged. Succumbing to the  temptations of negative campaigning results from concluding that all is  lost if they take the more honorable road.<br />Yet Klein does show some  honorable behavior sandwiched in with the compromises, cover ups, and pat  political responses to constituents. Indeed should we be critical of only  the politicians? Klein points out that we the voters mercilessly pressure  our elected officials to yield to our vested interests. Are we any better  than they are when we prod our congressmen to continue the lucrative, job  producing defense contract in our district? That defense contract that  produces something no one, not even the Pentagon, seems to want?<br />The  book is a good one, the characters interesting, the dialogue often witty.n we prod our congressmen to continue the lucrative, job  producing defense contract in our district?

Here's a book for those who love England's old churches, castles and country homes, and are filled with curiosity about how they were built. This informative and entertaining book teaches us about medieval history  and culture as discovered through its buildings. How are the stones  prepared for the massive cathedral walls (they are first trimmed with an  axe)?  How did Anglo-Saxon churches evolve into gothic cathedrals? Did you  know that until Elizabethan times there were no universal standards of  measurement? If you wanted pillars to be sixteen feet apart you took  sixteen men and had each put their right foot behind each other. How were  the massive vaults built, and what kept them from tumbling down (some did)?  What's the best place to build a castle, and how do you make it relatively  impregnable?  What's a groined vault and what's a cap roof?<br />This brief  blurb really cannot do justice to this book. It is fascinating reading if  you are intrigued by the Middle Ages. I have a variety of books on medieval  buildings and architecture, and this is one of the best that I have found.	2000-05-29

While understandable  that 95% of the populace believes in God, it is disconcerting to the  rational skeptic that over 90% believe in angels; 66% endorse ESP; 50% see  value in psychic healing; 40% endorse astrology; and 25% subscribe to  beliefs in reincarnation and channeling. By the same token, in another  survey, 71% of those interviewed felt that atheists should not be allowed  use of an auditorium to give a speech against God or religion. Freedom of  religion means simply that you must believe in religion or your views not  only don't count, they should be suppressed.<br />Today if you believe in  rational thinking you are viewed as someone who is not evolved. WK states  that we have forsaken logic to view sincerity as adequate evidence to  establish truth. Ubiquity of belief also seems sufficient to establish  truth. She refers to one book, Ask Your Angels, that asserts that the  frequent references to angels in our culture constitutes definite evidence  of their existence. She cringes at the unquestioning acceptance given to  authoritative statements of modern gurus. At one conference an angel expert  was queried about the speed at which angels travel. The response was that  angels travel at the speed of light. No one in the audience questioned his  response. No one asked where he obtained that information (My own personal  theory -if forced to come up with one- would be that angels would not be  part of the space/time continuum, and thus their movements from point A to  point B would be instantaneous).<br />The author feels that people gravitate  to pop spirituality movements because they do not understand or trust  science, and the gurus give them a way of ordering their lives that is not  intellectually challenging. Strangely, however, while their followers steer  clear of the complex laws of science, they buy books that lay out strictly  ordered formulas for living happy lives. Ms Kaminer spends some time on  junk science, criticizing those like Deepak Chopra who, in meaningless  ways, appropriate the language of quantum physics.<br />A lot of her wrath  issues forth in a chapter on the recovery movement. She details the damage  done by the repressed memory therapists. During the heyday of dredging up  false memories of abuse 70% of people surveyed by Redbook had actually come  to believe in the widespread existence of satanic cults. Her other main  essay deals with cyberspace and its strengths and weaknesses as a medium of  exchange of ideas.<br />You may not agree with all that Ms Kaminer has to say,  but she makes many points worthy of consideration. Yes, she is an agnostic,  but if there is room in this country for the thoughts of Rush Limbaugh, Pat  Robertson, and Marianne Williamson, surely we can examine the views of one  Ivy League intellectual without succumbing to a fit of apoplexy.steer  clear of the complex laws of science, they buy books that lay out strictly  ordered formulas for living happy lives.

I've got some fairly comprehensive books on each of those  subjects, but unfortunately do not have someone to carry this library with  me on field trips. What to do. Well this one book is intended to solve the  problem of lowering the weight of a backpack. It goes without saying,  however, that you can't condense a few thousand pages into 430 pages. Stuff  is missing. Yet it is an excellent, durable little volume to carry with you  into the woods or the desert, even though you will periodically become  frustrated because that peculiar little beetle that you just saw isn't in  it.<br />The book is filled with generally high quality pictures and  descriptions of most of the things that you can bump into when wandering  about this glorious state. What are some of its weaknesses? I found the  section on trees to be difficult to use. Generally my other tree books show  pictures of the whole tree, plus close-ups of its leaves, cones, and  flowers. In this book you see the trunk of a red alder, the flowers of a  pacific dogwood, and the leaves of a pacific willow. Heaven help you if you  come upon a dogwood when it isn't flowering. The wildflower section also  seems to have no organization. The flowers are not grouped by color, region  or any other system that I can discern. Sometimes you question the choices  made by the author in determining what to include. He certainly could have  skipped the item on the common mosquito, and substituted some more  interesting, and less known California insect. After all we don't want  outlanders to know that we have mosquitoes here. One nice extra feature is  several seasonal star maps for times when you are out at night.<br />All in  all its well worth the money if you're going hiking and want something  light to carry.	2000-05-29

Gary Winogrand was the type of photographer who had a very itchy camera trigger finger. When he died he left behind around 10,000 rolls of undeveloped film. If it moved he photographed it. Did he shoot so many good  pictures simply because he took such an unbelievably large number of them,  i.e. if you take a million shots aren't you bound statistically to get at  least a thousand good ones? Good question, yet GW is one of my favorite  people. If you like street photography with insight and humor he is almost  unbeatable. These are candid portraits that catch people gawking, staring,  laughing, having fun, showing pain, and often being oblivious to everything  around them. Gary was not shy; he thrust his camera right into people's  faces, and caught them in off guard moments. A man crawls along a sidewalk  unnoticed by a group of American Legionnaires. Another man walks nude  through a crowd without attracting much attention at all. Another man walks  through a crowd carrying an immense poster of the Beatles. Why is he doing  this; where is he going? A man with a bandaged nose stares strangely at his  female passenger as he drives along. Is he angry with her or is he perhaps  lusting after her. You decide.<br />It takes you forever to get through this  book as you sit and look at each picture for a long, long time. How  revealing are the faces, the postures, and the gestures; each shot prompts  you to weave a story around the captured event. Winogrand seems to be made  up of equal portions of Elliott Erwitt, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Diane Arbus,  and Andre Kertesz (if you are unfamiliar with any of these folks, and you  like Winogrand, you had better check them out). The saddest thing is that  almost all of Winogrand's books are out of print. This is a breathtaking  collection of his work.	2000-05-28

Does it seem possible that congress would hold a hearing on why a gentleman was refused  a patent on a machine that seemingly has a higher energy output than input,  which violates the first law of thermodynamics? I have often laughed at the  Indiana legislature that many, many years ago passed a law fixing pi at  3.14. But here is Trent Lott and his pompous brethren now holding a hearing  on a machine that the physicists of the nation have said is a fraud. As is  typical at a congressional hearing the egocentric politicians made speeches  instead of asking questions. Then Senator Glenn asked a few pertinent  questions that caused the committee to finally sniff disaster. The matter  was dropped. Later there was another hearing on the cold fusion matter in  which congress was again embarrassed by its total scientific ignorance. How  did our fine representatives react to being publicly humiliated by these  science debacles? Well, in 1995 they abolished the Office of Technology  Assessment whose purpose was to advise congress on scientific and technical  issues. Why seek advice when you are already infallible?<br />This book  provides the reader with a variety of scientific frauds that have  hoodwinked not only congress, but also the nation. Sadly the media often  further the cause of misinformation by presenting untruths as truths. They  find it much more entertaining to present pseudo-science in a manner that  suggests it might all be for real.  Mr. Park also discusses how the media  helped create the flurry over Electromagnetic Force (EMF) which proved to  be total ado over nothing (a good book to read on how the media creates  phony epidemics and trends is Culture of Fear by Barry Glassner). The  author also decries the efforts of New Agers to misappropriate the terms of  physics to espouse their theories (read also an interesting chapter on junk  science in Wendy Kaminer's book Sleeping With Extraterrestrials.)<br />This is  an excellent read for those interested in real science, even though the  scientific stupidities presented will have you pulling your hair and  rending your garments. The problem with the book is that it is much too  short. Park just gets going, and whoops its page 213 and time to stop. This  topic could easily fill a volume twice as thick. Let's hope there is a  sequel.<br />Oh... one other matter. Another reviewer is distressed at author  Park's dismissal of ESP when there is &quot;a good body of hard evidence to  support it&quot;. Park dismisses it because, as he states, the National  Academy of Sciences undertook a complete review of all of the literature on  the subject going back 130 years, and could find no scientific  justification for its existence in the research that was studied.

This novel, written in 1961, is about a couple that lives this American Dream. But this pre-yuppie pair leads a life of exquisite monotony. He hates his  white-collar job; she stays home with the kids. One of their most frequent  recreational activities is to visit with another similar couple, and spend  a few hours shaking their heads and complaining about how unevolved  everyone else is. We smile ruefully as we read about them, thinking how  common these folks are. Or have we fallen into a trap by putting ourselves  in the same place by looking down on Frank and April as they look down on  others.<br />Frank and April Wheeler look forward to things: a part in a  little theater play, a move to Paris, an affair, a promotion. It would  seem, though, that for them happiness is only in the anticipation of  events. The story's participants also are deeply into playing roles with  their spouses, their co-workers, their friends, and above all with  themselves. There is no one in this book that you want to identify with.  Why? Is it because they are poor, hopelessly lost dullards, or is it  because they represent us in too many unpleasant ways? It's a sad story,  but one that makes you think about your own life, and the ultimate value of  what you have accomplished. While some of our culture has changed since  this book was written (we no longer sit in hospital waiting rooms smoking  cigarettes), its theme is as modern as can be.	2000-05-25

For most of us the cells that make up our bodies are as well known as aliens from another galaxy. I took college biology back in an era that seemed not far distant from when Leeuwenhoek developed the microscope. In  that time cells seemed to be blobish creatures that led mysterious,  ill-defined lives. Boyce Rensberger brings us a fascinating, up to date,  tale of who these little people are. I say &quot;little people&quot;,  because in the telling of it you can't but wonder if these smallest parts  of biological existence don't lead an almost sentient life. I found myself  developing a personal theory that millions of years ago a group of cells  got together and decided to build some big creatures that would go out and  hunt food for them. They are in charge, not us.<br />Our cells have ports in  their membranes that require a special key to get in. If a morsel of cell  food (glucose) arrives in a little boxcar (vesicle) it must have a key that  fits in the membrane receptor. Vesicles travel around the cell cytoplasm on  microtubules, which are like so many train tracks. A seven step process  takes place that changes the glucose to pyruvate which is then shipped to  little organelles called mitochrondia which change this substance to ATP  which is the universal cell food. The marvelous thing is that things are  moved, and acted on by various protein molecules. How do little things like  molecules dash about carrying out various assignments? In another part of  the book the author describes the replication of the chromosomes. Not only  do molecules carry out this assignment, but another molecule checks the  finished work for accuracy. Throughout the book I kept saying over and  over, &quot;but how can these molecules actually do this?&quot; How do  cilia and sperm cells wag? Essentially a protein molecule holds on to a  stiff fiber, reaches over to another fiber and bends it towards the first  fiber. Incredible.<br />I'm just a layman, but this is one of the most  exciting science books that I have ever read. Mr. Rensberger makes it very  accessible by providing diagrams, and by using extremely useful analogies  to help you understand a most complex life form. I've also taken a college  course in human physiology, but these little microscopic life forms seem  much more fascinating and complex than the operation of the human body  itself.xciting science books that I have ever read.

St. Augustine in his Confessions speaks of the &quot;filth of concupiscence&quot;.  He felt that sexual union in marriage was not sinful as long as the act was to beget offspring, and hopefully would be managed  without &quot;lust&quot;. Unfortunately his views permeated the Catholic  Church up until modern times. This novel explores the psychological  negativity of such a view as experienced by two of three women. The three  women are in successive generations of a northern Minnesota family. The  grandmother and the mother, influenced by this sexual theology become, to  their regret, sexually cold individuals. Elise the granddaughter seems to  sublimate her desires and joins a convent.<br />The book portrays life as a  postulant and novice in a religious order, the boot camp, so to speak, of  training for the religious life. Can one really become an empty vessel to  be filled with God's grace and love? Can you really conquer your will and  desires, and become as nothing so that God can take over? The new nun  expects not only to achieve personal perfection, but also to find  perfection in her surroundings. These expectations seem doomed, for our  human nature is probably not suited for sainthood. The three vows of  poverty, chastity and obedience make tremendous demands that can be  overwhelming. Is it possible to forever deny physical desires as well as to  deny the rest of our self-interests?<br />CLW is not trying to write a sexy  novel. She is writing a book about the physical as well as spiritual needs  that hold sway over human bodies. Does religion provide adequate answers on  how to deal with sexuality? I find nothing wrong with this theme, and found  Ms Weber's exploration of this topic to be intriguing. A good book with an  unusual setting.	2000-05-14

In &quot;Vapor&quot;  the man  faced with this problem kidnaps the would-be actress, holds her prisoner in  a cell, and physically abuses her when she resists his tutoring process.  She becomes a better actress, but does this end justify these means?<br />This  is a strange book. I should state at the onset that I like black humor, but  this novel simply dismayed me. While weaving a tale that hovers between  reality and fantasy Ms Filipacchi adds additional trauma through revenge,  murder by torture, and various psychological abuses. The book often has a  light hearted, floating manner that frequently crashes under the jarring  weight of the characters in their horrendous psychological or physical  mistreatment of each other. One man in the book has his girl friend, a  model, suffer through repeated plastic surgeries in order for her to attain  physical perfection - an end which, to her dismay, she never  achieves.<br />It's like a roadrunner cartoon where life sort of happily goes  on despite frequent mauling of the participants. I find it hard to  understand why women -or men- like this book. Holding a person prisoner in  a cage against their will for months, and torturing them for not complying  with one's wishes is, to me, a repellent theme. I would not have thought  this to be a modern woman reader's fantasy, but yet this novel reaps  acclaim from such an audience.<br />The quality of the writing? It's fine.

If you are a true paranoid you will have no problem in relating to a tale where most of the members of the U.S. Army are traitors. Then again I was in the Navy, so  I really don't know what goes on in the Army.<br />Our story begins in Germany  during the chaos of mid 1945. Our hero is an Army major, Devlin Judge, who  is chasing down vicious ex SS major Erich Seyss who was responsible for the  murder of Judge's brother. It appears that Seyss has been employed to  conduct one last operation for the greater glory of Germany. He is to wreak  some sort of havoc at the Potsdam conference to be attended by Truman,  Stalin, and Churchill.<br />Go ahead, your turn. You fill in the story  blanks. That's right our hero is right on the heels of the villain but  can't quite catch him. A pretty woman enters the story.  People that should  be trusted really let us down. Excitement mounts as we near the Potsdam  city limits. Stalin and his new friends eat borscht unaware that danger  threatens.<br />I'm not trying to imply that the book is a bad one. It really  isn't. The post WWII Germany setting is quite interesting. The story hums  along just fine with lots of thrills and spills engineered to keep you  awake an extra hour at night. The only problem is that the plot doesn't  vary much from the standard formula for stories involving the good guy who  is one step behind the bad guy who is about to destroy the world as we know  it.<br />Oh yes, there's that strange ballistics lesson that we are given.  Our villain has just shot a man in the head in order to steal his uniform.  Author Reich states &quot;It had been a clean shot, barrel pressed to skin  so as not to risk bloodying the uniform.&quot; I guess when you shoot an  officer in the head the bullet just rattles around inside the skull instead  of exiting, and soiling those nice khakis with blood and brain fragments	2000-05-08

Military references  frequently dot the speeches of members of the Christian Right as they  strive to rally supporters. The goal is to make &quot;spiritual  warfare&quot; to take back the country from &quot;secular humanists&quot;,  &quot;the liberal media&quot;, &quot;radical homosexuals,&quot; and  &quot;extreme separationists.&quot;<br />Robert Boston's task in this book is  not to debate theological issues, but to acquaint us mostly with the  political agendas of groups who feel that their religious and moral views  should be the law of the land. I would agree that people should be allowed  to follow their own consciences and believe what they want to believe. The  problem is when one group feels their views should be impressed on others.<br />Boston's full time job is following religious right groups, and he  diligently reads their publications and attends their meetings and  conventions. For much of the book he allows the leaders of these groups to  speak for themselves by writing their comments made in speeches, interviews  and publications. Included in the book are chapters on the Christian  Coalition, the Promise Keepers, the Rutherford Institute, Focus on the  Family, and the ministry of James Kennedy.<br />While these groups  unquestionably frighten the targets of their frequent wrath, they should be  causing some alarm amongst mainstream Christians. Many members of these  Christian Right groups look upon other Christians as apostates. In  excerpting their speeches Mr. Boston also shows that leaders of the right  have no compunction about misleading their followers by distorting history.  The colonial America experience, the philosophy of Jefferson and Madison,  and the principles involved in Supreme Court decisions frequently are  radically twisted in addresses to the faithful.ddresses to the faithful.	2000-05-08

Since the 1800s geologists felt that the earth and the cosmos followed a concept of  uniformitarianism, i.e. that cosmic and geologic evolution had proceeded at  a gradual, steady state. The main catastrophists were religious people who  viewed Noah's flood as an absolute reality. In recent years scientists have  come to accept the significant effect that meteorite impacts have had on  the earth, moons, and our other terrestrial planets. This is not to say  that the authors accept any of the theories of creationists or writers like  Velikovsky. They do not (some time is spent debunking these theories).  Instead they explore how various heavenly bodies - asteroids, comets, and  meteors - have caused abrupt changes on earth and elsewhere.<br /> Interesting  tales are also told of several of the moons in our solar system. Uranus's  moon Miranda looks like it was once torn to pieces by an impact, and then  reformed as a patchwork quilt of rock formations going in all different  directions. There is a chapter on chaos in which we explore Saturn's  fascinating little moon Hyperion. This moon seems to have a mind of its  own, ignoring all the laws by changing its rotation speed and spin axis for  no apparent reason. And, it never repeats an orbital performance twice!<br />The most recent theory of the origin of the earth's moon is presented.  There is a section on supernovae, - don't worry our sun will never become  one- and there is a discussion of the atmospheres of Venus and Mars, and  what they teach us about the greenhouse effect. Will global warming be our  downfall? What are the chances of another large meteor striking the earth  and causing another mass extinction?  The authors' conclusions seem well  reasoned.<br />This book covers a variety of topics in Astronomy, and does so  at greater depth than you would usually find in a college Astronomy text.  It is also one of those ideal books for the non-scientist: highly  informative yet easily accessible and entertaining.Astronomy text.

It should be stressed that Ward and Brownlee feel strongly that  there are probably simple, bacteria like creatures on other planets, but  nothing more complex. This is a most interesting book even if you do not  agree with their hypotheses. It provides an entertaining and accessible  summary of the biological, cosmological, and geological science involved in  the development of our home planet. W&amp;B feel that the necessary  conditions for complex life are so numerous that few, if any, planets  elsewhere could meet the requirements.<br />Read this book and see: 1. Why the  moon and Jupiter are essential for our existence. 2. Why a system of plate  tectonics is vital for the development of life forms. 3. The effects that  mass extinctions have had on evolution. 4. Why life may have originated in  the deep ocean near hydrothermal vents. 5. Why earth is very lucky to be  located on the far edge of our galaxy.<br />For the scientific oriented layman  this book is a true gem.	2000-04-28

About half of the book takes place in the courtroom, where a lawyer is being tried for murder. Hooray you say; all lawyers should be on trial for their crimes. But wait, our  hero Mike Daley, representing the defendant, believes his best friend to be  innocent. In most ways this is a formula courtroom novel. The protagonist  is a lawyer who takes on a client who is charged with murder, and all of  the evidence seems to indicate that the client is guilty. The search starts  for exculpatory evidence, and during the trial you wait for the surprise  witness that allows our lawyer defendant to go free and return to his  business of being the typical, annoying attorney.<br />Does the surprise  witness show up? You'll have to read the book to find out. Mr. Siegel is a  capable writer. Another Grisham wannabe he falls a little short, though.  While his writing is entertaining the plot never truly rises above the  standard formula. One reason the trial seems realistic is that some of the  testimony gets to be quite tedious - having served as a juror on a long  trial I can vouch for the incredible boredom that sometimes sets in. But  if, like me, you just love books about trials, then this is just one more  that needs to be on your &quot;buy&quot; list. By the way the story takes  place in San Francisco, so if you are familiar with the City you will enjoy  the local references.	2000-03-28

He believes that when one is shot, no matter where, blood gushes forth from one's body like beer from a keg that has just been plugged with a bullet from a 45. And believe me this  book has a large cast of perforated people with blood gushing, spurting,  flowing, and streaming from them. In this novel a newly punctured torso  should prompt someone to run forth with one of those yellow signs that  state &quot;Caution! Wet Floor!&quot;<br />Sacred Heart is essentially an  historical Western that takes place in Mexico in the early 1930s when that  country was going through one of its anti-clergy cycles. Two American  brothers, one a priest and the other a murderous gangster refugee fight for  religious freedom in the Mexican state of Jalisco. It is a tale of a saint  who becomes a sinner, and a vile sinner who seems to be on the road to  sainthood. I found it a bit difficult to accept some of the character  changes encountered, but you may feel otherwise.<br />Mr. Montecino is an  above average writer, although this book, in my opinion, is not equal to  his other two novels, the excellent &quot;The Crosskiller&quot;, and  &quot;Big Time&quot;. Yet this is a more intelligently written story of the  desert than most, and is a thriller with a non-formula plot. Remember,  though, if you can't stand the sight of blood, you will probably faint  several times while reading the book.	2000-03-27
US	53070409	R2TDEPYHGQ3NSL	0316154067	559013514	Void Moon	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Void People	Let's face it; all of the characters in this book are not very evolved. First there is the heroine, Cassie Black. It is difficult to develop much feeling for Ms. Black, the author telling us only that Cassie is in her  early thirties. Even though we are tired of male authors describing their  heroines as physical goddesses, we would like to have some, minimal  description of the young lady that we are going to spend several hours  with.  She's a convicted felon who, after giving it a lot of serious  thought, has decided to return to a life of crime. Cassie gets put onto a  job robbing a high roller in a Vegas casino. Using high tech equipment she  steals big bucks from this gentleman's bedroom. This upsets lots of bad  persons, and they start murdering numerous people while tracking Cassie.  Various undesirable people meet untimely ends, and if you are a good  person, then undoubtedly you will also be killed, seriously injured, or  emotionally traumatized as punishment for showing up in this novel. Does  our tarnished heroine escape those forces even more evil than herself?  Given the 391page length of the novel will it be possible for the author to  find time to adequately punish all of the psychopaths wandering the book's  pages?<br />Now for the good news. This is a fairly quick moving thriller, and  for the most part it does hold your attention. If you like to see  characters exit a book as a result of fatal injuries, well then, you've got  an extra bonus here. Mr. Connelly is an excellent writer. If you have not  read any of his books then your assignment is to read all eight of his  other novels before picking up this one. That way you will see him at his  best, and be more forgiving of the flaws found in Void Moon.	2000-03-21

I say &quot;might be&quot; because there is good news,  and there is bad news here. I am a layman who has a strong interest in the  field of evolution, so I was immediately caught up in this novel about what  would happen if genetic elements decided on their own that something needed  to be changed in order for homo sapiens to cope in an overly stressful  world. There is a fascinating idea here, but the bad news is that a  significant part of the book reads like an abstract of a group of  scientific conferences. Yes, sci-fi fans, much of this book involves not  only scientific discussions between individuals, but involves that bane of  our existence: The Committee Meeting. Pages full of meeting discussions.  What happens after hours? Why our heroine climbs into bed with her new  friend and they discuss large protein complexes and human endogenous  retroviruses. Yikes. Once while reading Darwin's Radio I decided I needed  to put the book down for awhile and pick up some lighter reading, like  Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe.<br />The last third of the book shows  more interesting human activity, and makes the book worthwhile. In this  part of the novel we see how people cope with the new biology. This  definitely is not a book for space opera enthusiasts, or the non-science  oriented individual.	2000-03-10

He can write a thriller that is very serious, and also very funny. Sure Carl Hiaasen can also write a sort of comic thriller, but it usually turns out to be very silly. Mr. DeMille  brings back detective John Corey of Plum Island fame - if you didn't like  Corey's attitude in Plum Island, you won't find him any more endearing  here. John really has both attitude, and an unrelenting sense of humor that  usually tends to alienate him from the stuffier FBI and CIA types that  surround him.<br />John Corey provides some of the fun, and surprisingly the  rest of the chuckles come from a Libyan terrorist who tours the U.S.  killing off a select group of people that have offended his country in  general, and him in particular. This gun toting, demented version of  Charles Kuralt drives and flies around America trying to understand the  culture as he goes. Driving across the state line into Georgia he sees a  sign that says, &quot;Welcome to Georgia, The Peach State.&quot; He is much  befuddled by a state that seems to want to identify with a fruit. And on he  goes meeting with a variety of our citizens -usually briefly - and  marveling more and more at the strangeness of American ways. Teen-age girls  that zoom by in a convertible and wave to him are obviously, in his  Mid-Eastern way of thinking,  ladies of the evening. Charter pilots who  cannot stop babbling in the most awful way also torment him. Indeed,  although generally deploring his unkind way of dealing with people, we find  ourselves hoping that he will fire several rounds into each pilot shortly  after landing.<br />What happens when John Corey and our Libyan finally have a  telephone conversation? Corey cracks jokes of course, and Mr. Terrorist  thinks he's quite funny. I think that you will be amused also. At almost  700 pages this is a nice, long, entertaining read.	2000-03-06

This book is  a brilliant collection of gallery visitors who are not only looking at  works of art, but seemingly are interacting with them. The gentleman stares  at a statue, and the statue stares back. A youth places his finger on the  outstretched digit of a sculpture, and we are reminded of the ceiling of  the Sistine Chapel.

We see  people staring attentively at empty picture frames; a man takes a video,  not of a painting, but of the small descriptive plaque next to the  painting. But the best part is that these are pictures of quality with  excellent composition and lighting. What impresses me most is that Erwitt  took many of these outstanding shots surreptitiously, mindful that many  museums forbid photography. I am also duly impressed by the number of  galleries that the author has managed to see in his lifetime; he has even  visited the sculptures in the Oakland, California mudflats.<br />If you enjoy  good photography that possesses a sense of humor, then this is a must for  your collection.

After returning to the United States after spending 1.5 years in Japan she finds that Americans do not want to hear anything about her experiences  unless they can be stated in 25 words or yes. I spent 1.5 years living  abroad, too, and also found Americans to be totally uninterested in even  very brief recountings of adventures outside of the American territorial  limits. So who is this book for? Well, if you are also a member of the one  time expatriate club you will probably find this book quite amusing. Then  there are the remaining 2% of Americans who have a curiosity about other  cultures. They might enjoy curling up with this slim volume of goofs,  gaffes, and good times in a foreign land.<br />Trying to fit into a foreign  culture can be challenging, and attempting to fit into the daily life of  the Japanese seems an especially daunting assignment. Ms. Paine relates her  experiences with humility and humor. How was she to know that blowing your  nose in public is one step below passing gas? She, as everyone else who has  left the security of America, quickly learns that indeed there are no  absolutes in this world.<br />On the negative side Ms. Paine seems to ration  out her tales of cultural assimilation. She interjects them between  traditional tourist stories, and some boring commentary on life on the  Hewlett Packard payroll. I did learn one interesting thing about HP,  though. They seem to have a penchant for wasting money. To me there is one  great classic in the &quot;funny times living abroad&quot; oeuvre: Bill  Bryson's &quot;Notes From A Small Island&quot;, an hilarious account of his  years living in Great Britain. One a one to ten scale I would give him a  10, and Ms. Paine a 5. Bryson's is also a standard width book (Paine's  publisher gives us a very narrow book in order to increase the slim number  of pages) at over 300 pages, thus giving much more good reading for the  buck.buck.	2000-02-27

Einar is Danish, and married to a California woman. They live in Denmark, and the story starts in the 1920s.  There is a woman entrapped in Einar's body, and as the book progresses  &quot;Lili&quot; becomes the predominant personality. Einar/Lili's wife  Greta is supportive, and loves both persons. She and their circle of  friends help Einar find a doctor who performs on Einar what is evidently  the first transsexual operation.<br />This book is based on a true event, but  the author's motivation in writing the book is not to record history. He  attempts to focus on the emotional life of the characters. What does Greta  feel as her husband slowly fades away, and a young woman takes his place?  How does Einar cope with his sexual confusion? I feel the author is not  totally successful in meeting this literary challenge. Greta is almost  saintly in her support. Would she not have gone through more emotional  turmoil than is predicted here? For one thing their weak sex life all but  disappeared shortly after they married. All of their friends are totally  behind Greta and Einar. Were people in Europe in the 1920s that much more  tolerant than 20th century Americans? Perhaps so, but the author seems to  me to have buried an awful lot of feelings. I worked for many years in the  field of mental health, and came across a few transsexual patients. They  were seriously conflicted individuals.<br />In any event this is a novel  unlike any that I have read before. Highly recommended unless you find such  topics threatening. This will probably not be choice reading for members of  the Christian Coalition.	2000-02-23

Dr. Futuyma certainly does enough figurative hair pulling and garment rending in this book whenever the thought of creationists comes to his mind. A SUNY professor, and author of a well-known textbook on Evolutionary  Biology, DJF writes this most interesting book for the layman interested in  learning more about the case for evolution. While there are numerous books  of this type in print today, Futuyma emphasizes topics not stressed in some  of the others. He discusses the history of evolution from early times up to  the neo-Darwinism of today. Interesting chapters follow on the fossil  record - including a good section on the evolution of the horse -, natural  selection, chance and mutation, and the basic concepts of scientific  knowledge.<br />The author presents many of the creationist arguments, and  spends time refuting them. As I mentioned above, he really gets irate when  he considers their criticisms of evolutionary theory. &quot;Abysmally  ignorant&quot;, &quot;nonsense&quot;, and &quot;absurd&quot; are some of  the modifiers he uses when discussing them. His main points are that  creationists perform no original research of their own, but instead try to  discredit evolution by such means as: quoting scientists out of context;  using disagreements between scientists as evidence that evolution is in  trouble; conveniently disregarding evidence that they cannot explain; and  promoting arguments inappropriately such as the second law of  thermodynamics.<br />There are other excellent books to read on this subject.  My favorites are The Blind Watchmaker by  R. Dawkins,  and Abusing Science  by Philip Kitcher. This one deservedly belongs on the same bookshelf,  unless of course, you are a creationist.	2000-02-22

The author is entranced by abandoned structures. His viewpoint of these tragic, yet often eerily beautiful buildings is made clear by a quotation he provides from a  play by Fernando Pessoa, i.e. he fantasizes about the life that went on in  them when they were alive. These are pictures from a graveyard, and we, as  readers, are attending a memorial service, with Mr.Vergara providing a  well-written eulogy.<br />When first leafing through the book I immediately  thought of Jacob Riis, the turn of the century photographer who  photographed the New York slums. This thought also occurred to someone  providing a review on the dust jacket of the book. I ended up revoking this  comparison, however. Mr. Vergara's task here is not to provide social  commentary. For the most part he simply loves these buildings. I feel that  he would not even care to see many of them restored, but envisions leaving  them in a state of arrested decay, like the large ghost town of Bodie in  California. Recently, in a series of articles on corporate welfare, Time  magazine remarked on the fact that wealthy corporations often easily  abandoned obsolete sites, showing no concern over the blight they caused in  the community. So here we see derelicts owned by RCA, a company that could  afford to tear them down or restore them for community use. My point is  that this book may raise many thoughts regarding American community  problems, but Mr. Vergara is not here to deal with these issues. And that  is really OK, too, as the book is wonderful just as sort of an  archaeological document.<br />My one disappointment is that the book covers  only a few cities: New York, Detroit, Chicago, Gary, Camden, and the South  Bronx. For a sequel I would suggest that Mr. Vergara tour more cities to  find some of the other classics that exist. He could photograph the  Winecoff hotel, site of the country's most disastrous hotel fire that  killed 119 people in 1946. This 16-story structure still stands abandoned  in downtown Atlanta. Or he could document the huge Kelso depot that stands  empty in the middle of the Mojave Desert. I am certainly looking forward to  that book.1946.

Should we be afraid of being done in by tiny tots? Well, the 125% increase brings the annual total up to about 40 per  year. I would guess that means there are 40 bad eggs in a population of  about 40 million little guys.<br />The misleading reporting just recounted is  what this book is all about. Only anecdotal evidence and misleading  statistics typically support the latest report on the newest &quot;national  menace&quot;. Then, to really convince you that you should be frightened  out of your wits, some second rate professional or scholar is quoted saying  that things are just awful. A prominent west coast newspaper declared that  the Pacific Northwest was a region particularly &quot;plagued by a rise in  road rage&quot;, and then after 22 paragraphs of anecdotes and warnings,  informed the reader that 5 people had died in road rage incidents in the  region in the last five years. &quot;One death a year constitutes a  plague?&quot; asks the author.<br />In my own experience I am frequently  frustrated by these kinds of stories which are often found in the nation's  two major newsweeklies (which publications come under frequent attack by  Glassner). I am repeatedly asked to believe in some new horror for which  only a few anecdotes are presented as support.<br />The sad thing is that  this unfortunate reporting has resulted in unnecessary laws; corporate  bankruptcies; misapplication of scarce resources; and the ignoring of true  problems and their causes. You may disagree with some of the author's  views, but hopefully reading the book will make you more skeptical the next  time a news anchor tries to inform you of the national danger brought about  by the increasing number of people bludgeoned to death with a frozen leg of  lamb.	2000-01-26

Laughing at  Miami's problems might even help us temporarily forget similar problems in  our own hometown.<br />As they often say, truth is stranger than fiction. And  often funnier, I might add. It's good Carl Hiaasen...and you really get your  money's worth. It's no slim tome of essays; there are over 200 columns  reprinted here giving us 450 pages of chuckles.	2000-01-21

If your curiosity about feathered creatures goes beyond just appearances here is the book for you. It's a big, 450-page book  that is packed with information. This is not just a big picture book,  though it is full of beautiful color shots. It's mainly a reference book  that describes, by species, birds' lives in detail, covering such topics as  mating, nesting, communication, feeding, and socialization.  There are many  fascinating sidebars, such as the one describing why owls have such broad  heads, and the one on the Hoatzin chick's claws on its wings that enable it  to climb around trees while still an infant. There is excellent material on  how various birds have developed features that have enabled them to adapt  to their environment - probably the best know example being the beaks of  finches.<br />And, best of all, this encyclopedia is interestingly written.  It's informative, but not drearily academic. It's one of those books that  you can just open up to any page and find yourself reading something truly  fascinating about birds. Highly recommended.	2000-01-14

Lets not quibble about whether a legend or two got missed. This book contains 500 pages of tales that a lot of people have thought to be true. Yes, I admit it, I've been snookered into believing a few of them, but now I have been set straight. Actually, author Brunvand lets us know that a few  of them actually are true. What's really important is that a lot of these  stupid stories have circulated on the internet: send a dying kid a get well  card and put him in the Guinness book of records; beware of having your  kidneys removed in a motel room. Indeed one of the most serious of computer  viruses seems to be the Gullibility Virus that attacks the minds of those  who wander about the internet.<br />What makes it all especially interesting  is that Mr. Brunvand traces down the origin of these legends. That bizarre  &quot;true&quot; event related to you by a friend who heard that it  happened to a relative of his ex-girlfriend has actually been circulating  in one form or another for the last 70 years or so. My only quibble with  the book is that occasionally the author tells too many versions of the  same story, and you find yourself saying &quot;enough already.&quot;<br />Oh  yes, take Paul Harvey, Dear Abby, and the Reader's Digest with a grain of  salt. They seem most gullible of all, having passed on a lot of these  legends as true. The book is a veritable encyclopedia of these fun tales,  and I heartily recommend it.<br />Finally, there was that strange incident  regarding a virgin birth during the Civil War. Is it true? Get the facts in  Too Good To Be True.	2000-01-09

Dave shouldn't take offense at this comment as whom does he have endorsing  his book?  Why none other than Hiaasen and Leonard.<br />This is a story that  takes place over a period of about two days, and is both frenetic and fun.  While most of the characters are strictly out of the Hiaasen Casting  Agency, they are enjoyable. Essentially a few decent people get entangled  with Russian arms dealers, incompetent robbers, nasty FBI agents, the local  police, and, most evil of all, the Miami International Airport. What is  that ominous weapon in the suitcase? Will the goats in the street block our  heroes' way to the airport? Will the python at the airline ticket counter  manage to squish one of the hit men? How many bribes does it take to get a  seat on a plane at the Miami airport? Read the book and find out.<br />On  every page I half expected to read the words &quot;I am not making this  up&quot;, but they never appeared. Most of the time you actually feel you  are reading a novel, and not an extended newspaper column, although Barry  yields to temptation at least once when he gives his views of elderly  cruise ship addicts. All in all not bad for a first effort.	2000-01-09

Weber's Hot Ticket: Fausto Kiss, Krikor Tunalian,  Tanqueray Tougaw. Saying Hi to these folks made my heart sink. Am I going  to have some serious difficulty in suspending disbelief? Yup.<br />I was one  of JWs biggest fans up until the moment I opened this book. Our protagonist  Leslie Frost, concert violinist and secret agent, is assigned the task of  solving the Washington D.C. murder of another beautiful, female agent. We  meet a lecherous president, and his ambitious wife - at least this is  believable - plus a variety of other Washington insiders who all seem a bit  strange even for Capital dwellers. Leslie becomes closely attached to  Fausto Kiss, a big person around town - big in physical size as well as  being influential. <br />Aside from the strange characters, and the  &quot;what's this all about&quot; story, I had problems with the plot  mechanics. For a significant part of the book Leslie does no sleuthing,  evidently thinking that if she hangs around Fausto long enough someone will  spontaneously present her with evidence. Then when she wants to locate  someone to interrogate she calls her boss, Maxine, in Germany, and has her  locate the desired person. Maxine calls back the next day with the desired  information. Wow, what a detective is our Miss Frost. For diversion she  makes two trips to Belize. How believable is this? She travels at night to  a hidden camp by walking across two jungle mountains in pitch darkness,  arriving at dawn the next morning. I live in a rural area without  streetlights, and can't even see my house at night when I stand twenty feet  away from it.<br />The humor falls flat; the metaphors and similes are  strained; the story drags - although near the end there is an interesting  murder with a most unusual weapon. Don't read this book, but do read Janice  Weber's other books.	2000-01-06

Now don't get the idea that he lives out in the boonies somewhere; Ralph is not too far  distant from that bigger city, Texarkana. Ralph's a bit jaded with his job  at the Nipper gas station, and somehwhat claustrophobic living in the same  small house with his sister Vernell and her husband Bill Bird. Thus we  collect a $70 debt owed by a fellow marine.<br />Norwood gets to the big city  via car and freight train, and then finds that his buddy has moved back to  his home around Memphis. Now on a bus journey, Norwood gradually assembles  an entourage of a young woman, a midget, and an educated chicken. Does  Norwood collect his debt? It doesn't matter. The money owed is a  Hitchcockian McGuffin; it's our travels with Norwood that really  matter.<br />It's a funny book that provides us with the company of an  interesting group of simple, small town folk. Mind you they are mostly  decent folk, and Mr. Portis doesn't put them down. In fact you get to learn  some new aphorisms such as, &quot;Don't let your mouth write a check that  you're ass can't cash.&quot;  It's a slender volume with wide margins that  can be read quickly; more like an extended novella - if such a thing  exists. If you have a rusting '57 Hudson in your front yard you will feel  totally at home with Norwood.	2000-01-06

The majority opinion and dissenting opinion(s) are presented with  occasional abridgement. Most of these cases fall in three main  categories:<br />1. Support to religious schools 2. Religion in public schools  3. Restrictions on the free exercise of one's religion<br />The editor, Mr.  Alley, provides no critique of the Supreme Court's action in these matters,  so one doesn't actually critique the book in the normal sense. What the  Court has written, it has written. My only disappointment was in finding  that a brief summary was sometimes presented in lieu of any Court opinions.  Mr. Alley undoubtedly had book size restrictions to consider (the book is  545 pages long), and presumably he gave short shrift to cases that were  less (in his opinion) important, or were based significantly on reasoning  established in prior cases.<br />As an example, I have a strong interest in  the creationist vs. evolution controversy. The Epperson vs. Arkansas case  concerning teaching creationism in public schools was presented in a half  page summary. A similar case involving a state law in Louisiana, Edwards  vs. Aguillard, was dismissed in one sentence.<br />In balance, however, it's a  great reference book. I can see that this would be an outstanding resource  for students writing term papers on the subject of the first amendment and  religion.	2000-01-06

Indeed we are presented with quite interesting material in this regard. Mr. Schermer uses the fields of  psychology, evolutionary biology, sociology, philosophy, and anthropology,  amongst others, to help explain belief systems.<br />While I found that  almost all the book held my interest, it seemed somewhat disjointed. Some  of the material is also quite controversial. While such matters only serve  to entertain me, others may get offended - Christians may take umbrage at  having their beliefs repeatedly referred to as &quot;myths&quot;.<br />The  book presents intriguing survey results on why people believe in God. What  is most fascinating is that respondents felt that other people believe in  God for reasons that differ considerably from their own. Shermer moves on  into a discussion of evolutionary biology and a &quot;belief module&quot;  (more controversy). Then, surprisingly, we move into a section concerned  with traditional philosophical arguments (primarily those of Thomas  Aquinas) for belief in God. When you get right down to it, no one embraces  religious belief purely on the basis of philosophical arguments.  Creationists will be offended by a section on their beliefs. A chunk of the  book is given to the Indian Ghost Dance of the 1890s, and we read a  discussion on a mathematical refutation of the recent best seller The Bible  Code. Good stuff, but its like reading a collection of essays that are not  often obviously related to each other.<br />The final chapter had me  scratching my head the most. It's a section discussing the controversy  surrounding Stephen Jay Gould's theories of evolution regarding  necessity/contingency/chance. While poring through this I kept wondering  what it had to do with religion. My question was never answered  satisfactorily. Shermer forces this subject into a paean to the wonders of  living in a contingent universe. He states that his abandonment of religion  allows him to bask in the beauty of our magnificent universe. I get annoyed  with concept that if you are religious you can't appreciate science and  nature. Not every religious believer is constrained by fundamentalist young  earth/intelligent design theories. I am an agnostic who was brought up a  Catholic. My intense curiosity and admiration of nature was as strong when  I was a believer as it is as a non-believer today.states that his abandonment of religion  allows him to bask in the beauty of our magnificent universe.

Told as part of a minibiography of the then current Galveston head of the US Weather Bureau, Isaac Cline, we learn of  the development process of both the hurricane, and the Weather Bureau. The  hurricane is an example of the bad side of nature, while the fledgling  Weather Bureau epitomizes the bad side of bureaucracy.<br />Much of the story  is an &quot;edge of your seat&quot; story of the hurricane's fury, covering  the experiences of both Galveston's residents, and travelers on ships at  sea. Cuban weather experts warn of the approaching danger, but the US  Weather Bureau, trying to make a name for itself, says its not a hurricane,  and its headed north. And, anyway, why pay attention to those inferior  beings living in Cuba. What do they know?<br />You'll learn something reading  this book, and be entertained at the same time. Unhappily most of us seem  not to have learned anything from this nightmarish event. Americans still  build on beaches, and the taxpayer continues to pay for rebuilding what  nature periodically destroys.<br />If you really want to learn and not just  be entertained, run out and buy *Against The Tide: The Battle For America's  Beaches*, by Cornelia Dean. This book brings us up to date on our beach  building disasters, and shows how we have literally destroyed our beaches,  and continue the folly of trying to build on them. Mother Nature is not  amused with our stupidity.	1999-12-07

Not only has an intense friendship been maintained between the two sets of parents, but also the daughter of one family has, literally since birth, been  closely paired with a son of the other family. It is now accepted by all  concerned that Chris and Emily will eventually be married.<br />Then Emily is  shot dead, and Chris becomes the key suspect. Was her death part of a  suicide pact? Why would this outgoing, normal girl remotely consider  suicide? The book flashes back and forth between life before and after the  tragic incident.<br />This is an unusual and interesting novel that explores  a problem that can arise between two intimates who have known each other  all of their lives. My main dissatisfaction with the tale revolves around  Chris's reasoning processes through all the sturm und drang of the events.  But then again teen agers don't always think with wisdom.

Ms. Dean provides us with a well-researched book on the physics (don't let that word throw you off; she makes it all quite understandable) of beaches, and how,  in one century, we have managed to destroy them. Quite simply the ocean  cannot and should not be conquered. While capable of causing intense damage  to our shores, the ocean, given time, will also inevitably repair the  damage it has caused. But, build houses, hotels and other structures as  well as jetties, revetments, seawalls, and groins on the beaches and you  will ultimately destroy them.<br />The truly sad part of this book is not just  that we have destroyed thousands of miles of our beaches, but that we are  led by ignorant, self-serving politicians and greedy commercial and private  interests to build even more damaging structures on what's left of our  shores. To add insult to injury the taxpayer continues to be dunned for the  money to pay for continued &quot;beach management&quot; (read:  mismanagement), and for rebuilding destroyed structures in areas where  nothing should be built. I no longer have the slightest sympathy for people  whose shorefront homes are destroyed by storms. Move inland where you  belong.<br />A must read for the concerned citizen.	1999-11-07

Woman of the world Clea Shawn decides to give up her lovers and travels, and seeks peace in a small town in New  Hampshire. She surprisingly does adapt to little Roches Ridge although she  is now physically separated from her husband, teenage children, and her  female best friend.<br />While I enjoyed the book I did find the whole thing a  bit unsettling. The two plot lines of the novel clashed a bit. The part of  the story dealing with the outlandish citizens of Roches Ridge -and believe  me there is not a normal person in the whole town- is quite hilarious. The  other theme, Clea's relations with her family, and, most importantly, with  her best friend Elke provide us with a more serious story.

The reviewer  for the NY Times says that it is &quot;a harrowing new thriller (that)  moves with breakneck velocity.&quot; My impression was that it is a nice  leisurely paced novel that is far removed from those taut, fast paced  thrillers that cause severe palpitations of the heart. The back cover blurb  writer tells you it's an exciting story of saving the life of our heroine  who has been bitten by a snake. Let me just say this: she indeed does get  bitten, and that is part of the story up to page 30. The author then  digresses for the next 122 pages! The bulk of the book is about the two  main characters, their affair, and incidents in each person's life. Mind  you I'm not being critical of the book, as I really enjoyed it. I'm just  warning Ludlum readers that thrive on panic and paranoia that this book  will not give them their usual adrenaline high.<br />Well, maybe I could make  one criticism. I like a writer who pauses to describe scenes, emotions and  the patterns of light on the wall, but Mr. Nova seems to be obsessed with  color. He doesn't seem to be able to describe something unless he tells you  its color. Oh well, at least he stays away from mauve, puce, and burnt  sienna.	1999-05-27

Wouldn't it be wonderful if the heroine from Harvest could meet the star of Life Support for a cup of coffee. Picture them together, the amazed looks on their faces as they realize how much they have in common! Both are  talented female hospital based physicians who find out that an evil cabal  of doctors is wreaking havoc on the health of patients. And, in both cases  our protagonists digging into their affairs do not amuse the dastardly  doctors.<br />Toby and her new found friend discover that a few missteps in  their work coupled by efforts of the vile physicians have placed their jobs  and personal safety in great jeopardy. And, gasp, both of them had to face  real or potential malpractice lawsuits.<br />Tess Gerritsen can write  attention-grabbing thrillers. No question of that, but is she going to use  the same plot format for all of her stories? I realize that her latest  novel, Bloodstream, which I have not read, takes place outside of a  hospital, but a read through of the cover summary makes me awfully  suspicious that the same plot is going to descend on us once  again.<br />Please, TG, you seem to be a good thriller writer, but would you  please, please, change some of the basic elements in your next story? If  you have not read either of these novels, please do read one of them, and  you will be well rewarded. If you read both I'm sure you will be drenched  in d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.	1999-05-15

In Swimming With Jonah we encounter an underperforming, introverted woman student whose  efforts to get in medical school have all but failed. Finally a school on  an island in the South Pacific that has been set up just for students who  cannot gain admission anywhere else accepts her. This hot, humid island  becomes her cage.<br />While it may be viewed in one sense that our heroine  comes out of her shell while attending this demanding school, it also seems  that her mental faculties are losing their moorings. It wouldn't seem that  having you mind drift off into a surreal world would be symptomatic of good  mental health.<br />In both novels Ms. Schulman creates groups of characters  that are all flawed in some way. A reader might often wish that he/she  could meet some of the characters met in novels. After reading an AS novel  you are likely to say, &quot;Thank God none of those people are my next  door neighbors.<br />Be that as it may the novel is very interesting, and very  well written. I do like Ms. Schulman's writing style and eagerly await her  next book.	1999-05-15

On involuntary leave for punching out his lieutenant he tackles the unsolved mystery of who murdered his mother 30 years ago. If you like police procedurals that  have an air of verisimilitude about them you are always safe plunging into  a Michael Connelly novel. I just finished a faux police procedural written  by JA Jance, and the difference between the two writers is amazing.  Connelly seems to have lived in the police department (like Daley, Caunitz,  Dee, and Mahoney), while Jance's knowledge of police operations seems to  have been gained when she was ticketed for jaywalking.<br />The poor writers  have their cases solved by talking to one witness or relative of the  victim, who gives a lead on another person to talk to, who gives another  lead on another person, and on goes this chain. Connelly deals a lot with  evidence. Nice curious, strange pieces of evidence. Makes things much more  interesting and challenging.	1999-04-13

Isn't it terrible the way supervisors can thwart our ambitions to get ahead in the workaday jungle? In this  instance our hero (?) takes the bull, or boss, by the horns, and shows him  that he just won't take it any more. Life is indeed tough in the boiler  rooms of the telemarketing industry. Not an outstanding book, but if you  like noir novels this is a good one to add to your collection.	1999-04-11

I love police procedurals when written by people who seem to have at least a minimum knowledge of police department operations: Michael Connelly, Daley, and Caunitz, to mention a  few. Even McBain does better than this. Early on Jance lectures us on the  really old concept of the need to solve a murder in the first 48 hours.  After passing on this profound insight into the workings of the world of  homicide detectives, her inside knowledge seems used up. Has this gal ever  even been in a police station? Does the Seattle police department really  have no lieutenants on the force?<br />Two cases are presented. One is a  boring arson case, and the other involves an Indian curse which we are  expected to believe. People die left and right, but at the end of the book  we are not sure why some folks met an untimely end. Perhaps her next books  will cover the horrible effects of being the recipient of voodoo or  witches' curses; everyday types of cases in your average homicide bureau.  As for me I'll just wait for Michael Connelly's next Harry Bosch novel.	1999-04-10

As I happily read my way through this fascinating book, I, like any hopeless romantic, wanted our hero to end up carting his true love off to a pretty little cottage with a white picket fence. Every night for a week I  would breathe a deep sigh, put the book aside, turn out the light, and  drift off to sleep. But every night just before my brain and body yielded  to a night of dreams, a jarring thought raced through my head. &quot;Do you  realize that you are hoping that our hero finds true happiness with his  sister?&quot;<br />The highly dysfunctional Johnson family fits nicely into  the socio-economic class informally know as trailer trash. Somewhere in the  history of this family an elder must have neglected to pass down  information on whom one does and does not have sex with. As a result of  this information gap the Johnsons seem to have established no restrictions  on their sexual activity. Yet, seamy as this is, we develop a certain  fondness for brother Ray, the book's narrator. Part of the reason for this  is that Ray doesn't talk like someone with highly defective genes. Sure,  the author has him using a few verbs in the wrong tense, but he still  sounds as intelligent as many of my buddies in graduate school.<br />What is  astounding is that Lisa Reardon, a New York City resident with a Master in  Fine Arts from Yale School of Drama, would decide to get inside the head of  a small town, good ole boy from rural Michigan. She does a pretty good job  of it. You may well like reading it, but of course you can't tell anyone  you enjoyed it. What would they think of you?	1999-03-27

That's the question that runs through your mind constantly as you read the court cases presented in this book. The first part of the book deals briefly with our founders' concepts of religion and state that found  expression in the first amendment. After another short review of court  actions up until 1940 the book begins in earnest to cover the major cases  of the 1960s to the present.<br />The typical first amendment case involves  some form of prayer or religious teaching being imposed on all students.  Even if students are not required to participate, their non-participation  usually exposes them to harassment by other students.<br />Without exception,  plaintiffs in first amendment religious cases have been the victims of  death threats and hate mail. Plaintiffs have also suffered beatings and  damage of property at the hands of hostile Christians. What is also amazing  is the fact that most citizens do not realize that the bill of rights does  not establish a system of majority rule, but instead protects the  individual rights of all citizens. In terms of the first amendment this  means that I as a non Christian should not have to be forced to pray to a  Christian God.<br />For a good presentation of what our country's founders  were thinking about when they wrote the constitution read &quot;The Godless  Constitution&quot;, by Kramnick and Moore. Washington, Madison and  Jefferson did not in any sense want religion mixed with government.	1999-03-24

Particularly good is Dawkin's explanation of how complex beings can have indeed evolved over time. Some sections are more difficult than others. It has always  annoyed me that authors of books containing a significant amount of  information on molecular biology do not provide you with drawings of such  matters as replication and transcription. Dawkins often does this to you:  page after page of dense print without a single diagram. To solve this  problem I purchased &quot;Molecular Biology made simple and fun&quot;, by  David P. Clark, and Lonnie Russell. It's a 500 page book that covers a lot  of ground and contains at least 300 drawings of how all of this stuff  works.<br />Dawkins spends almost no time attacking the creationists. I would  suggest that other books such as Kitcher's &quot;Abusing Science&quot; be  read along with Blind Watchmaker, to get a better feel for the evolution  vs. creationist controversy.	1999-03-24

Her father is also in the drug business, as is his best buddy, and his girl  friend.....etc.  An honest guy sneaks into the book, but the author does him  in quickly so that he doesn't make the other characters look too tawdry.<br />So, what's our Key West, trailer trash heroine (with the attractive  feminine nickname of &quot;Al&quot;) up to? She's moving a computer disc  with some Vietnam secrets from one bad guy to the next, and she runs into  trouble. There are three ho hum action scenes in the book separated by  great gobs of filler.<br />I didn't care about any of the following elements  of the book: the heroine; her friends; her family; the tedious, hackneyed  Viet Nam atrocity plot; the soporific action scenes; or the writing. This,  indeed, is one of those books that once you put it down, you will have  trouble picking it up again.	1999-03-18

Over time he began to have serious doubts about the worthiness of the bible and the existence of God. These doubts led to a &quot;deconversion&quot; to  atheism. DB is a good logician, and presents excellent arguments for  non-belief in God, and lucidly shows the bible to be a negative rather than  positive document.<br />For the most part he will be preaching to the choir,  and those disagreeing with him will engage in ad hominem attacks, an  approach he is well used to. He frequently is frustrated that Christians do  not debate him on the merits of his arguments, but on the basis that  something is obviously seriously wrong with him or he wouldn't think the  way he does. He points out that most Christians have little knowledge of  what is actually in the bible, and when he quotes the many passages that  show its god to be one of malicious vengeance, they don't believe he is  actually quoting from the &quot;good book&quot;.<br />This is a well-reasoned  criticism of Christianity.

The fact that IM is a philosopher was an added attraction to me.<br />What to say. The only one word description of this novel that comes to  my mind is &quot;pedestrian&quot;. It was an easy read.

I am sorry, but I did not find it &quot;wise, witty and  compulsive&quot;. I found it to be a plain, uninspired narrative.<br />Perhaps I picked the wrong Murdoch book.

To some degree this sort of effort must often be more difficult than the challenges they  face in their daily scientific work. In the first half of this book Mr.  Ferris' ideas successfully penetrate the wooly interior of my brain, and  allow me to perceive some of the complexities of the structure of the  universe that we live in (and there may be other universes out there,  friends).<br />Things get progressively more sticky, however, as we approach  the &quot;speed of space&quot;. I begin to experience problems. Perhaps the  subject matter is now too difficult for many laymen, or I am a few million  neurons short of a fully equipped brain, or perhaps Mr. Ferris's  explanatory powers have hit the wall. Naturally my pride leans toward  hoping for  the last possibility mentioned.<br />I had some difficulty  understanding the horizon problem connected to the expansion of the  universe. I decided to see if I could find a discussion of this subject  presented by another science writer. New to my library is a book just  released called &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot;, by Brian Greene, a very  prominent string theorist. Mr. Greene does indeed discuss the horizon  problem, and I found his presentation quite accessible.<br />In a nutshell,  then, TF is a good writer, and this book is an important one for the  layman.

Evangelicals like Behnken often make such  statements, and in doing so show their abysmal knowledge of the  Constitution and those who developed it.<br />There actually is no mention of  God in the Constitution, and the only reference it makes to religion is in  article 6 where it states that there shall be no religious test for  political office. A current tragedy is that religious conservatives have,  indeed, established informal religious tests of office through their  &quot;voting guides&quot;.<br />In developing the constitution men like  Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison were strongly influenced by the  Enlightenment philosopher John Locke who believed that the function of  Government was solely to keep the peace. While religious enthusiasts like  to point out the section of the Declaration of Independence that states  that our &quot;Creator&quot; endowed us with certain unalienable rights,  they seem unable to thoroughly assess the meaning of the following words  that state these rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These  are secular attributes of government, i.e. that the state should protect  us, and our property, and keep us free. And that is exactly the role  envisioned by our Founders. Government should not promote religious laws  that place restriction on our basic freedoms. Government should not decide  moral issues.<br />Jefferson and the others felt that when religion was  involved in government it corrupted government and degraded religion. He  felt it absurd that politicians should be the interpreters of the will of  God. God, said Jefferson, needs no government officials to speak for Him.<br />Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison did not want religion mixed with  politics, and this book provides us with an excellent exposition of their  views. Many Christians were very upset with the &quot;godless  constitution&quot; and founded various organizations that from 1863 to 1945  fought for an amendment that would provide a statement in the preamble  &quot;acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all authority and power  in civil government..&quot;.

The initial article that seemed to have given one  exasperated reviewer such trouble was simply Bishop Paley's famous 1805  Blind Watchmaker argument for a creator as first cause. His inclusion of  the eye as an example of argument from design is famous, and has stuck with  the creationists ever since. Its inclusion in the book was important.<br />Included articles discuss the history and development of Darwinian  theory, the essence of evolutionary and creationist mechanisms (Yes, there  is a creationist article in the book, by Gish), and the philosophy of  science surrounding both evolution in general, and, towards the book's end,  an extensive philosophical analysis of the trial arguments. I found the  discussions of the trial to be fascinating.<br />The sophistication and  topics of the essays vary widely, and I would not recommend this book as an  initial introduction for the layman. An excellent book to be read first or  concurrently with &quot;But Is It Science&quot;, would be &quot;Abusing  Science&quot;, by the noted philosopher of science, Phillip Kitcher. That  book covers the basic mechanics and philosophy of evolutionist/creationist  theory in any easy to understand, but reasonably thorough way.	1999-02-03

Naturally the book wouldn't sell  too many copies if the word &quot;Philosophy&quot; ended up in the title so  we have this cutesy title that unfortunately may not give sufficient clues  as to what is inside.<br />My wife is a believer in all things paranormal,  and I am a true skeptic with an education in experimental psychology. We  have a shaky truce in our house about these issues, and I have developed an  intense interest in the claims made in astrology, channeling, ESP, NDE and  the like.<br />This book lays out the logic for analyzing claims made in the  name of science or the paranormal. We are told first of all that knowledge  without evidence is not knowledge; it may constitute a belief, but it is  not knowledge. What is reliable evidence? What is objective truth? What is  the value of anecdotal evidence? What are the criteria of adequacy for a  hypothesis? How is a scientific study properly set up? What sort of studies  can establish the effectiveness of a medical treatment beyond a reasonable  doubt?<br />The author discusses all of this and more as he applies the logic  learned to medicine, dowsing, astrology, ESP, Channeling, and even UFO  abductions. Its an informative, entertaining book that will educate without  boring you or even making your poor brain work overtime. If nothing else  you can read the book, and impress (or bore) your friends by telling them  you just read a book on applied epistemology.	1999-01-24

It perhaps should be even more concerned about innumeracy, the mathematical equivalent of illiteracy. While many of us would be insulted  if someone questioned our ability to comprehend the written word, we quite  easily laugh at being idiots when mathematics is involved.<br />As a result we  think nothing of an ad promising that a new light bulb will save 200% on  energy. If that statement sounds OK  to you, then you better read this book  or one like it.<br />Here's a slim tome that addresses some of the more  egregious insults to the field of mathematics and statistics. If you are  totally innumerate it will raise your numbers IQ a few points. It's an easy  book to read; too easy, as a matter of fact, and that's a shame. The author  provides very little theory, many, sometimes useless, anecdotes, and some  soap box preaching about mathematics being the premiere science.<br />He does  touch on the mathematics of probablity, a subject that most people should  know more about. Anyone with a basic knowledge of probability quickly  realizes that coincidences don't just happen, they MUST happen. That fact  throws a wrench into a lot of &quot;sciences of the paranormal.&quot; And  remember, from a statistical standpoint your chance of winning the big  lottery is no different whether you buy a ticket or don't buy it. Is there  a way to improve your chances for winning big? Yes.  Pick numbers that no  one else picks like, 1,2,3,4,5,6. That way you run less of a chance of  getting tied with someone.<br />There are other books out there that give you  better information, but this one is OK if you want to learn a little  applied math without having to turn your brain on at all.	1999-01-21

Books	4	11	14	N	Y	The Work and Philosophy of a Civil Libertarian	This book informs the reader of some of the activity of the ACLU, and the personal philosophy of the author. I have been a long time supporter of the ACLU, and was interested in learning Ms Kennedy's viewpoint. There are many  of us, I assume, who think that the ACLU is an organization that leans a  bit to the left. No, says, SSK. True Republicans believe that the less  government the better. Such a philosophy means keeping government out of  our lives, and enhances our civil liberties. Ms. Kennedy worries (as I do)  about the conservative elements of the Republican Party who seem to want  less government for themselves, but more for other people, as witnessed by  demands for laws pertaining to abortion, school prayer and flag burning.  She decries right wing efforts to legislate morality, which reminds me of  G.K.

While sworn to uphold the US  Constitution, elected officials often quickly cater to special interest  groups who want their agendas advanced even though they violate the bill of  rights.<br />I'm a fairly liberal Democrat, and found myself agreeing with  everything Ms. Kennedy said.

David Hunt's heroine is a photographer with autosomal recessive achromatopsia. It means she is  totally color blind, and sees only shades of gray. Naturally she sticks to  black and white photography.<br />This is a well written book, and while it  is not full of twists and turns that make you gasp in surprise, it is a  worthy mystery tale. The heroine, true to today's current writing fashion,  is a feisty lady who pursues the bad guys without giving in to threats, and  even beatings.<br />This author obviously lives or has lived in San  Francisco. For those of us who have also lived there, DH never leaves us in  the dark as to which street corner Kay Farrow is standing on. That's a lot  of fun for me, but probably won't be exciting to readers in Mobile,  Alabama. It is also nice to know that the author has some knowledge of the  protagonist's profession. It is jarring when technical mistakes work their  way into a book, but DH seems to have at least a nodding acquaintance with  photography. When Kay takes a picture of her father outside of his bakery,  DH mentions that the resulting image resembles an August Sander portrait.  Shows he knows something about the field.<br />I refer to David Hunt as a  &quot;he&quot;, but I have heard rumors that the author is really a woman.  (?)	1998-12-21

David Rubel compiles a reading list of 110 authors and describes their books. Two good aspects of this book are that he doesn't just give his opinion of the books, but tells how the works were received by the critics  and the public; and he lists every book written by each author. Thus one is  not presented by a select list of what Mr. Rubel considers to be an  author's best works.<br />When a book such as this comes out there is the  usual cry about what authors didn't make the book. I may have my own  criticisms in this regard, but that's not the point. I am not interested in  knowing about writer's that I already love or hate; I want to hear about  authors that I am unfamiliar with. The first novel that I read after  perusing this reading list was Cathie Pelletier's &quot;The Funeral  Makers.&quot; That book alone made the entire purchase price of the Reading  List worthwhile.	1998-12-21

Elizabeth Berg portrays the strength and sorrow of such a relationship when one of a group of women friends is slowly dying of  cancer. The group provides constant emotional support to their stricken  member, and EB shows the unique pain that each is going through as death  approaches.<br />The author does not burden us with a novel of unmitigated  sadness, however. Ruth has reached the point of accepting death (a status  not yet achieved by all of her friends), and she faces the end with  remarkable humor. As the Charlotte Observer noted in its review, &quot;One  minute you're laughing, the next you're crying.&quot;<br />If, like me, you  have reached the age where you no longer consider yourself immortal, you  may like this well told tale of that final adventure that we all face.	1998-12-21

Her curiosity plunges her career into a  downward spiral that seems to have no bottom. Once again we have a female  protagonist who is not a wimpy, ankle-spraining female in need of a strong  man (Thank God).<br />Although the reader quickly becomes aware of where the  story is going, the gripping narrative never lets one relax. TG is one  physician novelist who believes in really adding some medicine to her  books. Some readers may be turned off by her frequent injections of  technical terms, but to me it just made the story more real. In this regard  she reminds me of Kathy Reichs, the forensic pathologist who wrote the  novel Deja Dead. Only Harvest is better.	1998-11-28

Ken Follett now shows up with a courageous, smart, female FBI agent who makes her fellow male agents look like self  serving, incompetent idiots. Would this have been the character set up in  an FBI story of 10 years ago?  If  J. Edgar Hoover hears about this he will  be doing some serious rotating in his grave.<br />Can the terrorists fulfill  their threat to create California earthquakes if their demands are not met?  It would seem they could, although Judy Maddox's brainless fellow agents  scoff and publicly embarrass her. Well we all know what will happen don't  we?<br />It's a fun ride though, and I enjoyed it. As someone who lived for  years in the San Francisco area I had an extra pleasure in seeing if a  British writer would make any mistakes describing northern California. He  did pretty well, making only a few trifling errors.<br />Recommended as an OK  time passer, although I still think Follett's best books were his first  ones.	1998-11-28

Sisters Pearl and Sicily get along well with each other, but the positive feelings end there. Sicily's daughter is 13 and has a crush on a 32-year-old low life thief.  Her husband is an alcoholic. Pearl's husband and son are  undertakers-whoops, I mean funeral directors--, and her wimpy daughter has  a son who might be a good candidate for an exorcism. This family has a  series of misadventures throughout the book: their car ends up in a river  with them in it; a rape takes place; a car is stolen; little son of satan  demolishes a hotel room. And it's all quite hilarious.<br />This is Sinclair  Lewis's Main Street gone seriously bad. CP's characters are well developed,  despite the dark humor. The author has much affection for them despite her  tendency to stick pins in their suffering bodies. The humor finally  subsides later in the book, as Ms Pelletier shows us people who do and some  who do not struggle on after seeing the failure of their lives' ambitions.  These are imperfect people living in a far from perfect world.<br />Ultimately this is a very serious book, and unless you share my love of  black humor, you might be a bit perplexed by the whole thing. Cathie  Pelletier is a very talented writer.	1998-11-28

They have hum drum jobs, and share their boredom with a boring spouse. One man enjoys talking  to his weeds, while Jocelyn posts household hints on her front window.  Aaron sits stunned in his office as he realizes an original thought just  passed through his brain. Others engage in a battle of wits with their  dogs. They generally lose. Some find their world too stressful and drive up  to the drive in therapy window for help.<br />Strange humor? You bet, but to  me its the most hilarious stuff in the world. I was very disappointed when  I bought the book, though, because at 144 pages I thought, &quot;Oh no, I  can read this at one sitting.&quot; My solution? I limited my reading of it  to 6 pages a day. That way I could keep laughing for over three weeks.<br />I  read JvA's Ballard Street daily newspaper cartoon in the LA Times for  years, but then moved to humorless Atlanta.

If you like action with a plot that  strains your credibility to the limit, then this is your read. Gee whiz,  the CIA Director of Operations is an evil genius who has scammed millions  from the government and other sources to form an evil company  all so that  he can retire without any financial worries. An equally evil doctor has  many of the top French politicians on mind altering drugs....and if this  isn't enough, the world's greatest assassin wanders around Paris in his  clever disguise: a clown costume. People might mistake him for an idiot,  but they would never guess that he is Carnivore, assassin nonpareil.<br />His  aide wants to tell him the BIG PLAN is on track. In most novels she would  pass him on the street at a scheduled time and stick her finger in her left  ear if everything is OK. In this novel she changes her clothes in a latrine  (don't ask why) then stands on the curb as a parade passes by. Our deadly  assassin in his clown suit saunters over toward her, and she shoves her  bicycle into him and he falls to the ground. In mock solicitation she bends  over and says &quot;everything is OK.&quot; She then returns to the latrine  and changes again (again don't ask why). Isn't this a fascinating way to  communicate a message? He appears at othe points in the story - again in  clown costume.<br />You'll feel faint reading similes like, &quot;(they drove  along)..a paved road that rolled up and down the undulating hills like a  shipping lane in a high sea.&quot; I had some difficulty forming the image  of hills resembling shipping lanes.<br />I gave it three stars because its a  good enough read if you are trapped on an airliner for an 11 hour flight.  On the other hand there are a lot of exciting novels out there with  reasonably credible plots that I'd rather read. Of course I'm one of those  staid people who don't believe the CIA killed Kennedy.

Why did she do it.  Her boss, Captain Amanda Grant isn't satisfied with the answers she has so  far.<br />The novel brings in various psychological issues which are quite  interesting, but herein lies a few of the story's flaws. Amanda Grant has  an MA in psychology, yet when she asks various psychiatrists for answers to  certain basic psychological questions she is astounded at the answers. Did  she sleep through all of her psych courses? I realize that many of these  discussions are exposition to inform the readers, but why didn't her  non-psychologist Lieutenant ask the questions? Also at one point someone  informs the reader that all psychiatrists must undergo analysis. Nothing  could be farther from the truth.<br />All in all, though, it's a very  entertaining novel. I would recommend it.	1998-10-30

This is  a book that is obviously written by a woman, which is fine with me. Male or  feminine approaches to a story are of equal interest to me. Mind you she is  not one of those sappy soap opera writers frequently found on the best  seller list.<br />Denise Burke is a true- crime novel author whose husband  works with the President (Denise sometimes gets phone calls from Hillary,  and they have bubbly little chats). Many people think an innocent man was  found guilty of a murder, and sent to prison.

Dr. Martin's attack on Christianity is based on historical and  philosophical evaluations of the life and teachings of Christ. He examines  historical writings and concludes that Christ may not even have existed.  Even if he did, was he the significant figure that we make him out to be?  Why do the early Christian writers such as Paul seem totally unfamiliar  with his teachings. Paul, for instance, has many opinions, but he never  uses any of Christ's teachings to bolster his (Paul's) beliefs.<br />Martin  explores the Resurrection, the Virgin Birth, and the Incarnation. Much of  his analysis is centered on the biblical contradictions regarding these  events. He also tears apart the bible in discussing the ethics of  Christianity.<br />I found this to be an interesting philosophical and  historical treatise. While the author seems to be reaching at times to  interpret biblical statements in line with his own beliefs, it is well  worth reading if you are interested in varied perspectives of Christianity.	1998-09-28

Both of these are mature themes, i.e. they have been  dealt with repeatedly in novels. The author's task is to present them to us  with a fresh perspective. I feel that he was only modestly successful.<br />First he deals with the subject of changing history. What is his view?  It's a no no. Anything new here, then? Not really. Literally hundreds of  books, both fiction and non fiction have dealt with the concentration  camps. Dunn paints a good picture of  its life and its horrors. He develops  both courageous and evil characters. This is the successful part of the  book.<br />The weakest parts of the book are the interruptions to bring us up  to date on the folks involved in the time travel mission. We are presented  with a pile of names attached to some hazy, vague characters that I  sometimes wished would be sent off to their own concentration camp  somewhere out of the story. I really wish the protagonists could have been  limited to James,  the &quot;enforcer&quot;, and Alma, the  &quot;rescuer.&quot;  Dunn was obviously intrigued by the concept of time  travel throughout all history, presumably from the big bang to the end of  time. This is an interesting concept to deal with, but he didn't really  develop it satisfactorily.<br />In summary, the camp scenes were excellent;  the rest was boring.	1998-09-15

It allows the author  to explore any technical, social, political, philosophical or religious  concept imaginable. It doesn't have to have &quot;good&quot; science in it  in order to be a worthwhile piece of literature. Most &quot;technical&quot;  space operas are simply filled with Star Trek gibberish anyway.<br />The  science in this book is execrable, but who cares. It wouldn't have mattered  if the group went to the planet Rakhat on winged horses. This book explores  religious and social concepts.<br />If we have absolute faith in God, will he  catch us when we fall over backwards? How can we anticipate that the most  inocuous seeming activities may have destructive results on a planet's  society. Many philosophical themes run through this book, and I enjoyed it,  even though I am an agnostic.<br />There seems to be quite a divergence of  opinion on the substance of the main characters. I liked them, and they  were real to me. I thought they were witty, concerned human beings.	1998-08-23

In the far distant future it would appear that any job aboard a Navy ship can be successfully carried out by either man or woman. Thats wonderful. On the other hand it seemed like the author simply assigned male and female names to the crew at random. The name was the only element that identified a person's gender. Does total equality mean an androgynous society? Lord, I hope not. Space opera buffs probably don't like mushy stuff in their shoot 'em ups, but to  me some gender identification would have made people more realistic.<br />Honor is a likable and competent skipper, and I enjoyed traveling with her (obviously I could never flirt with her,though).<br />While the plot never failed to hold my interest, I did get bored a bit when DW decided to provide me with a long orientation to his specialized knowledge of psuedo-science. I generally like scie nce in science fiction, particularly when today'! s theories are extrapolated into the future, but this story was full of the usual Star Trek gibberish. Terms like &quot;bottle node&quot;, &quot;impeller wedges&quot; and &quot;gravity sidewalls&quot; abound, making us fully aware that we are indeed in an era of advanced technology.	1998-07-31

This is the type of book that a lot of &quot;science fiction&quot; fans won't like: It contains some actual, fairly believable science; it takes place in the present; it is not a space opera. Twistor uses the concept of a shadow universe to provide us with a most interesting thriller. If the modest amount of science is over your head you can safely skim through it.<br />My only annoyance was with the fairy tale that the protagonist told to two children in stages throughout the book. While I can grasp the author's intent in telling it, I didn't like the plot interruption. All in all a most worthy book.	1998-07-23

This is an excellent presentation of the case by a philosopher, and can be easily understood by the average reader. Admittedly creationists will not be converted by this or any other book supporting evolution as their belief system will not allow it. I am amused by creationist reviews of books on evolutionary topics when they criticize &quot;evolutionists&quot; as not having open minds. I believe in evolution because the evidence seems to support it, not because I have any religious need to believe it. If the scientific community decided tomorrow that the theory of evolution is wrong, I would be fascinated by the information, and not threatened by it.<br />Kitcher shows the lack of logic in creationism, and exposes it as non science. Particularly vexing are his many examples of creationists quoting scientists out of c! ontext to try and prove their point.<br />This is an excellent book for the open minded, non  belief threatened individual who is truly interested in assimilating more information on evolution and creationism.	1998-07-21

Great fun. There is a feeling of ominous dread creeping in at the end of the book, though. It appears that Jane may be on the road to matrimony (which she does, I gather, in the next novel in the series).

I am an American who also lived in England, and I laughed myself silly reading this book. This isn't meant to be a travel guide or an in depth academic study of British culture as some reviewers must evidently believe. There are many ways to reminisce about life in a foreign country, and BB chose to tell us fond, funny stories of his life in the UK. Let's not be stuffily chauvinistic about these things. I'm sure many Brits could write equally hilarious tales of their lives over here in the USA. For me its hard to understand that any American who has lived in Britain would not find funny such tales as the train/bus schedule incident (As I remember it the Brit Rail agent couldn't understand Bryson's difficulty with a schedule that had a daily train arrive in a town minutes after the scheduled departure of the daily bus that took travellers to their next destination.)<br />If y! ou are a Bryson fan, this is as good as he gets.

That poses a problem, of course, because a lot of science isn't easy - especially Quantum Physics. I am a decently educated, reasonably bright individual so I tend to pore through books like these. Mr. Gribbin is writing for the laity here, but I found the going a bit difficult in some parts of the book. His writing style is not particularly enthralling either; others have done a better job in that respect.  There is a certain difficulty in writing these books. You can make them very simple and easy to understand, and thus not convey much information. Or you can really try to educate by providing a lot of material on the subject. Problem is the more information provided, the more difficult it will have to become. Someone with a liberal arts education can't really expect to mind meld with Feynman or Einstein. The way I try to learn this stuff is to read several books on the same subject. If there was something I didn't underst! ! and in one book, another author might explain it better. The repetition also helps you to learn and retain the material in memory. Its worth putting this book on your list if you are a science junkie, but if your interest in Quantum theory is very casual, you might want to look elsewhere.	1998-07-16

His substitution is a new, uninvolved Ground of Being. Now along comes Chet Raymo who does the same thing as the Reverend Spong except he seems to be substituting the &quot;Awe of Science&quot; for God. Raymo deals briefly with Creationists, Astrologers and other pseudo scientists, but in a superficial way. If you are interested in science vs everyone else, you best read books dedicated to such topics.<br />He does have a few interesting aphorisms: True Believers are Yearners, and Skeptics are Learners; Coincidence is the Evidence of the True Believer, etc, but essentially this is another person who has slipped into religious disbelief. He asks you to marvel in the awesomeness of the universe. Understandably he is unhappy that only 6% of Americans have any basic scientific literacy. In any event he finds his God in the substance of the universe itself.<br />What the new promoters of pantheism or animism or similar beliefs forget is that folks find at least three important things in religion: a sense of purpose; a goal; and a support system. God in a rock just won't be a good substitute. You may also stand in awe of the Hubbell photographs of galaxies 10 billion light years away, but that also makes one feel insignificant, something that is often threatening to the true believer. I guess our Pragmatist friend William James had something, though, when he said, in essence, believe in whatever works for you. Spong and Raymo are individuals on a personal journey to find answers (as are we all, I guess), but I find that their purely personal current beliefs really lack any serious philosophical, theological or scientific merit. I may be interested in having the Spongs and the Raymos tell me their current religious views, but I no longer want to spend $20+ to find out about it.	1998-07-10

His arrogance and insensitivity are definitely not endearing traits.  When schizophrenia captures his mind your first reaction is to think bad Karma has caught up with him. But as the pages and the years go buy you become deeply saddened by this man's loss. It is gratifying that Princeton and its academic staff stood by Nash, and kindly let him wander about the Math department for almost thirty years. His ex wife is an heroic individual who took care of him even though divorced from him. Another tragedy is Nash's mentally ill son who was granted a PhD from Rutgers and who has been unable to do anything with it in the 13 years since. You are, however, overjoyed at John Nash's mental resurrection in the 1990s. A well written book. Scientists reading this book should note that unlike many science biographies this is not a book heavy with mathematical theorems. It's about a life.<br />I have one nitpicky complaint. The author spends a lot of time discussing the symptoms and treatment of schizophrenia. Yet when mental illness strikes other people in the book she uses trite, meaningless terms like &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; and &quot;mental collapse&quot;. That's like referring to a physical ailment as &quot;the vapors&quot;. Won't we ever bury such stupid terms?	1998-07-06
US	53070409	RC1NZLC3DZAEJ	0451187709	214453045	Heart of War	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Acceptable Military Legal Thriller	This book provides us with a pretty good cast of army personnel caught up in a homicide at Fort Benning, Georgia. The author does a good job with the protagonist, but most of the other characters seemed  mediocre. Its interesting how many male authors now have a female as their strong main character e.g. Thomas Perry's Jane Whitefield series. I downgraded the book a bit because of a couple of strange time discontinuities. As an example in one scene military attorney Guidry and an assistant DA are at a District of Columbia arraignment trying to get a prisoner transferred to Army jurisdiction at Fort Benning. The prisoner's attorney objects to this, and the judge orders all attorneys to submit briefs on the issue. A couple of pages and two days later Guidry is visiting the prisoner in the Fort Benning stockade with no mention of the judge's ruling and how he got there so fast. I don't like it when the author evidently assumes that his readers are a bunch of dummies who won't notice these things. All in all, though, its a pretty good read, and takes place in an interesting sitting.	1998-06-30

You Might be a Biblioholic	Do you have a good time browsing through book reviews on Amazon.com? If so you might have the serious addiction described in this book. Many of us who have strange addictions are surprised when we first find out we are not alone. I certainly could identify with a lot of the presented symptoms (My wife and I have a large 11 room house  that provides the space needed for our books - why use a dining room for eating when it can easily become a library?).  Fortunately the book is so funny that it squelches the guilt feelings that it elicits. If one of your ideas of a good time is to spend a few hours in a book store, then buy this one. Having been disturbed by a customer's screaming, running children in a bookstore yesterday, I would hope that Raabe's next venture would be a book for the unwashed masses regarding rules of behavior in a bookstore.	1998-06-28

I enjoy him because I love his humor, and because I share his environmental concerns. As a retired senior executive of a large corporation, I also have no illusions about the goals of business.  We need gadflies, and Carl's buzzing about can only bring issues to the surface to be thought about and discussed. Disagree with him you may, but I see nothing wrong in presenting facts about the power and plasticity of the Disney world. Many folks want their big brother provided sanitized entertainment, and will evidently brook no criticism of the source of their pleasure. For myself I am interested to find out how yet another big business manipulates local governments and the press. It's fascinating to read how devoted fans will pay 25 to 40% more for a home because its built by Mickey and his friends, while disregarding the fact that the same guys built substandard housing in Miami. The way people are mesmerized by the fantastic plastic world of Disney sometimes scares me. Its like some dystopic future world from a science fiction novel.<br />I will agree that $8.95 is a lot to pay for 83 pages, but it sure is good quality Hiaasen.	1998-06-28

PP addicts may get bored with a book that for almost 550 pages chugs through only two days of activity. It is heavy with dialogue - somewhat like a George Higgins novel. Price got the idea for this novel from the true event where a southern lady drove her kids into a lake, and reported them kidnapped. The author takes this plot thread and moves it to New Jersey, his home.  I was delighted with the characters, and with Price's descriptive writing; he's a master of the  metaphor - and simile. The characters, their dialogue and feelings, are everything in this novel. While the book delves into the problem of racial conflict it mostly re-emphasizes the known problems without shedding much new light on the issue. Those looking for an action packed thriller should look elsewhere; that is not what this novel is about. If you are interested in a modern &quot;American Tragedy&quot;, however, give it a try.	1998-06-26

While the reader will be quick to sympathize with the mother, there is the ethical question of whether this is the correct action to take when a child is involved. The author doesn't delve into this issue. We are certainly never given reason to believe that the husband, while unquestionably abusive to the wife, would provide any threat to the child; indeed he seems to be a reasonably good parent. The book is well worth reading, and the reader can come to his own conclusions. I would make one comment regarding the protagonist. She essentially seems to be an uninteresting person with no strong interests or hobbies. I can't imagine her picking up this or any other book and reading it. One can have strong empathy for her situation, and wish her well, but she is someone we really don't have much interest in knowing personally.	1998-06-22

He can no longer believe in a theistic God, and gives good reasons for his rejection. He also critiques the bible, and wonders again why many people stress the inerrancy of scripture, yet pick and choose what precepts they want to follow. As someone else once said, many Christians use the bible as a weapon to throw against those who disagree with them.  Bishop Spong is at a point where his God is a Ground of Being, an ineffable deity that just permeates all things, but is not personal or involved. After death who knows what happens. Surprisingly Bishop Spong believes that these modest beliefs still warrant an organized church with services and sacraments. If this is all his new religion would have to offer, why bother with a church. My feeling is that the good Bishop is just in the middle of a journey from serious belief to serious disbelief. The primary appeal of this book would be for those who are exactly in the same place. Believers who read it will want to beat him over the head with their bibles, and my fellow agnostics will say &quot;been there, done that.&quot;	1998-06-22

If they kept the faith they new they would have to live out their remaining days as a single person. Now the Church seems to work overtime to allow folks to annull marriages that endured for 30 years or more and that produced many children. Ms. Kennedy provides some interesting anecdotes of various women who protested the annullment process, and who generally were not successful. The weakness of the book is that it is anecdotal. Four or five stories do not provide valid overall data. In my opinion the author makes these stories overly long, and adds other extraneous material in a seeming attempt to flesh out the book to a respectable 200+ pages.  As a divorced Catholic I feel that I could get an annullment (I knew my wife only 8 weeks when we married, and I deeply resented and didn't believe the priest's pre-marriage counseling that the primary reason for marriage was to have children), but feel that my 12 year marriage that produced 3 children was a true marriage. Anecdotal or not the process described by Ms. Kennedy left me with very negative feelings. And as someone with a background in Psychology, I find the description of the church's process for assessing mental status 20 or 30 years ago (barring some documented serious psychopathology) to be laughable.	1998-06-22

I also love black humor, and to me this book fits the category (then again, if no one else finds the book funny maybe I need therapy). Surely no one would dig themselves in this deep in real life.

I found Mr. Nancy's book to be mildly amusing at best, and generally tedious. Why? The secret to a successful book in this genre, as other authors such as Rosa and Novello have found, is to write silly letters that make the recipients swallow them hook, line and sinker, and respond with a letter thats almost as funny as the author's. Nancy doesn't have this talent. Many letters go without reply, or are answered with curt form letters. This makes the joke fall flat. We can all write stupid letters, but if we can't catch the victim in our trap what's the use? Don't waste your money on the second book in this series; instead go out and buy one of the other similar books by authors who know how to do the job properly.	1998-06-04

The protagonist is an average bloke with failings that seem to outnumber his strengths, yet he is a quiet hero in his role of caregiver to a seriously ill lover. I am a reader who is in a position to be acutely aware of his mortality, and was quickly caught up in the main theme of this poignant story.<br />Dufresne handles the basic plot with a serious tenderness, but in other subplots involving human trauma he seems to switch into black comedy. One wonders how Laf's sick lover is as well adjusted as she seems to be when her family is so full of strange people who are often either killing or being killed. Some of their antics were a bit jarring and at times tended to upset the mood of the book. All in all its a book well worth reading.	1998-06-03

Is the book too gory? I didn't think so. Reichs' impressive background would be wasted if she didn't bring some detail into the story. There is only one place where she loses control in this regard: a nine page analysis of the various cutting effects of saws on bone.<br />All in all I came to like our heroine Tempe Brennan, and would be willing to follow her on another adventure.	1998-05-31

Written in a non-academic style it tells the story of how the allies crippled Germany's heavy water supply in Norway. It is a fascinating tale of a few heroes who risked, and sometimes gave, their lives to prevent Germany from developing the atomic bomb. Some interesting facts are also given regarding the development of a nuclear weapon. If German scientists had just developed a slightly different mind set they wouldn't have needed the heavy water, and could have built a bomb without it. Good rendering of a small but very important story of World War II.	1998-05-20

I purchased this book because I felt that it would report verbatim the testimony given in depositions and in the trial, and thus could not suffer too much from creative, biased writing. The author is, of course, biased. He represented the plaintiff, and felt Simpson was guilty, but I cannot conceive of anyone objectively reading this book and not coming to the conclusion that Simpson is a double murderer.<br />While many of this country's citizens may have legitimate concerns about their treatment by the police, this is not the case to represent those grievances. Simpson's side simply has no evidence regarding a police conspiracy. It is amazing to read about the mock trials conducted by Petrocelli's team wherein some Afro-American members of the mock jury indicated that while feeling Simpson guilty they would vote to acquit. As Petrocelli says, he wasn't trying to keep Blacks off the jury, he was trying to keep people with this sort of bias off the jury.<br />This book is important as history. It relates almost all the research done by the plaintiff's legal team, and the testimony presented in depositions and at the trial. For all of this, it is never tedious or dull; rather it reads like a courtroom thriller novel.<br />I have only one negative feeling about the book. While I am convinced that it is an important, necessary book, it seems odd that Petrocelli should make millions from writing it while the plaintiffs in the suit will probably see little of the 33.5 million dollar judgment. I had hoped that somewhere Petrocelli would say that he is giving some of his profits to the charitable organization founded by Goldman. Petrocelli also states how the Goldmans became like family to him. I guess he needed another family as it was obvious that he totally neglected his own for a year.	1998-05-18

Ms. Kaminer writes a scathing analysis of many self help books and programs, and does it in an often hilarious way.

I use the word &quot;continues&quot;, because psych fads have been always with us it seems. In my college time it was Maslow's self actualization and I'm OK, you're OK, and the let it all hang out period (1960's in case you weren't around).

What would the world be like if Dave Barry, Calvin Trillin, or Fran Lebowitz pulled such a stunt?<br />The book was worth the price, though, just to read the articles on Buckley's feud with Tom Clancy.

Our Rachel did find out why someone was murdered, but didn't really find out who done it. In the less than clever denouement the killer more or less walks up to Ms. Gold and admits the crime.  The author can't think of a way for our sleuth to solve the mystery? You sort of get the feeling that Michael Kahn put the names of all the characters on a dart board and chose the one hit by his flying dart to be the big baddie. I don't know if I care for this random selection technique. Kahn's Rachel Gold books have gotten good reviews, so maybe this just isn't one of his better ones.

He's got a modicum of talent, but to compare him with Westlake or Hiaasen would be a real joke if it weren't a bit sacriligious.  One of the problems of the book is that the author can't resist providing us with a lot of facts about something we generally have no interest in: bugs. He's like the expert on Proust who bores us to death at a cocktail party by rambling on and on about the great author. And...can you really get into a story where the protagonist's method for killing cockroaches is to stick them in his pants pocket and then smashing them with the palm of his hand? Yes, I am squeamish; I live in Georgia where I have to put up with enough unpleasant insects.  I also found that I had no interest in the main character. I really wouldn't have cared if the assassins chasing him would have been victorious, especially if they could have did him in around 100 pages into the book.

He states that there are more trees in America now than were here in 1492, and millions of ditto heads nod up and down in agreement. There is plenty of room for various political philosophies in this country, but to me it is immoral to state things as true when they are not.

I felt this to be a beautifully written book about well developed characters living in an important period of America's development. This is an anti war novel that will not please those who view the civil war as romantic. It is also not a Hollywood action pic converted to book form. Its description of the lives and community of rural Carolinians is fascinating. I have read no other novel of the civil war period that matches this one. The author is impressive in his display of knowledge of the regional culture that he writes about (although recently he admitted some chagrin at finding out that the golden delicious apple that his hero consumed was not yet developed in the 1860s). No, the book does not move at a lightning pace; it moves at a comfortable, spell binding pace. I loved it.	1998-05-02

This book provides interesting insights to the Kansas-Missouri troubles of the 1850s as well as a fascinating exposition of the social culture of the times.

There is some unintentional hilarity in this book: The author has serious problems with similes and metaphors. The author has our gal lying in bed. Does a sensuous word picture describe the scene? Not really. He has her lying there &quot;curled like a shrimp.&quot; Ideas take hold of her like fishooks lodging in her brain. She senses events &quot;moving on the horizon, arranging and rearranging themselves the way a lava flow crushes and mutates the landscape.&quot; Here's an experiment for you. Fill a manila envelope with photographs. Hold them up in the air and dump them out on a desk. Do they fall out like &quot;butterfly wings?&quot; Mr. Shelby thinks they will. Later, our sweet heroine finds that her,&quot;mourning and guilt had been cauterized, like a white hot iron pressed against an open vein, leaving her swollen with contempt.&quot; Light continually &quot;crawls&quot;, sometimes through the window at dawn, at another time over tinted glass. There are some even better ones, but they have faded from memory. I would have rated the book a &quot;4&quot;, but upped it to a &quot;6&quot; because of the humorous  similes and metaphors; Days of Drums is worth reading just for those.	1998-04-24

Diane Arbus had significant talent, and it is amazing that she continued to produce outstanding work when burdened with a serious chronic depression. The author also impresses us with Arbus's special ability to coax almost anybody to pose for her. If she had lacked this skill, many of her portraits would never have come into being. This is a must read for those interested in the history of photography.	1998-04-23

After reading a few pages, however, I was caught up in the history of the Russian revolution, and Stalin's attempt to manipulate that history. The book is so interesting that I wasn't the least disappointed that the techniques used in altering the pictures weren't discussed. Suffice it to say in that regard that Stalin's photographic retouchers were quite primitive.	1998-04-23

We think we have a basic right to privacy, but, surprise, we don't. Ms Kennedy, and Ms Alderman do a good job of presenting what rights we have, and, sad to say, what privacy rights are not guaranteed us.	1998-04-23
US	53070409	R2H8FDCCONWRN8	0440224071	64914490	Los Alamos	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Neither Fish Nor Fowl	I didn't find this book to be great as thriller or history. As romance it was boring: The characters didn't interest me that much, and their love affair was ho hum. I stuck with it because of the history and my increasing time investment. The funny thing is that Kanon is a pretty good writer,  but the book is lengthy and somewhat tedious. It did inspire me enough to go out and buy Richard Rhode's Pulitzer Prize winning book &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb.&quot; It promises to be more interesting.	1998-04-17

Mr. Preston evidently felt that the average American won't read a book about science unless it reads like very light fiction. Instead of a character arising and going to work Preston would say something like &quot;X arose, took off his silk pajamas and took a long, soothing shower. After putting on his new tan suit, he deliberated about what tie to wear, the red striped one or the one with orange amoebas on it. Going down the stairs he noted that the third step from the bottom still creaked, and he made a mental note to fix it this Saturday.....&quot;. Who cares? I read a lot of non-fiction, and it doesn't have to be reduced to a third grade level of pop writing for me to enjoy it. Narrative non-fiction is fine, and this book could have been entertainingly presented at about half its current length. It frustrated me no end to spend half of my time reading about meaningless trivia.	1998-03-19

I didn't know, for instance that divers often worked in total darkness. Unfortunately the author didn't seem able to fill 214 pages with just diving stories so he fleshed out his book with anecdotes about drinking and dating on liberty. I read history to learn. Meaningless, lengthy stories teach me nothing. I was a sailor, too, and his tales didn't advance my knowledge one iota. The dust jacket summary of the book is somewhat dishonest. It says that inside the book we will find &quot;..the whole story of the desperate attempts to save crewmembers caught inside their sinking ships.&quot; Actually only a few sentences are written on this subject as the author was not personally involved in the work. The intensive efforts to rescue crewmembers from the capsized Oklahoma receive no coverage. The book did provide me with interesting information on Navy WWII diving techniques, but I did feel frustrated with the wining and whoring sections. Hint: skip through them and you won't miss a thing.	1998-02-21

We  Americans are fortunate that we do not have England's libel laws where corporations like McDonalds do not hesitate to use the law to squelch free speech. This is a fascinating book that follows the longest civil trial in British history. The author is able to summarize the trial without getting bogged down in the mass of testimony that was presented. The book's downside is that the author makes lengthy asides to preach on environmental issues. I share his concerns, but I bought the book to read about the specific issue of the trial itself.	1998-02-19

A variety of characters were introduced fairly rapidly, and I thought gee this should be one of those books where they list all of the personae on a page before the book begins. I did finish July 7th and really enjoyed it. The author uses a McGuffin of a convenience store murder to establish the story, but the book is really about a group of related people in a small town in North Carolina. While JM has at least one serious message to present, the novel is essentially an intelligent, witty development of her characters during a 24 hour period of their lives. A central event is the birthday party of &quot;Granner&quot; the gift loving matriarch of the clan (She thought it a shame that her birthday and Independence Day didn't coincide so she has her clan celebrate July 4th on her birthday July 7th).	1998-02-18

No other book does this. You want to know what the heck &quot;Edge Simplicity&quot; means in the Cutout box. This book tells you. And everything is easy to look up. No this is not a &quot;how to&quot; book (It says right on the cover that it is a reference book, and not a teaching book). Every other of the myriad Photoshop books trys to be a how to book. I have many of these massive tomes, and still cussed because they didn't explain some weird command that I needed an explanation for. This 600 page book explains them all, and, miracle of miracles, it is a Photoshop book that actually costs less than $20!	1998-02-18

And we are supposed to identify with this dysfunctional woman? While she is ignoring her advice at home she is about to have an affair with a man when his wife coincidentally comes to her office for advice. Our hero therapist can't wait to run to this lady's husband and tell him everything that his wife said. What is amazing is that it never even crosses her mind that to pass on this information would be highly unethical - as having an affair with the husband of a client would also be. The main puzzle in this book is trying to determine who is the most addled, the main character or her serial killer loving sister.	1998-02-02

I think that if you can't suspend your disbelief, then you will not be able to read many thrillers. Certainly Ludlum's plots are not plausible. In any event this is a suspenseful thriller that, to my relief, was not about another psychopathic serial killer or a conspiracy to take over the world. Its more in the mold of the several novels written about attempts to kill Hitler or FDR during WWII. If you like that sort of thing you should really give this book a try.	1998-01-28

Did this guy read the same book? I have never disagreed more with an entire review than  this one. I thought the book was excellent, and hope that it will raise the world's consciousness about this entire event. The sad thing is that all the time I was reading it I was thinking, &quot;and now the Chinese have been doing similar things in Tibet.&quot; Perhaps Ms. Chang should explore the psychodynamics of that in her next book. I certainly agree with her about how thin is the veneer of civilization.	1998-01-27

Stone City took place in a prison. This novel deals with a woman's life alone in the wilderness of northern Alaska. She lives there because she likes living there. Novelists are often cautioned to write about what they know best. Smith is neither a woman nor an Alaskan, but this book of an arduous life is fascinating, and seems very realistic. I highly recommend it.	1998-01-21

The boy narrator, Calvin, and his iconoclastic, foul mouthed grandmother provide delightful contrast to the religious drudges that make up the rest of the family. The characterizations are quite good, and the story is great fun to read.	1997-12-23

I was frustrated and angry with every single one of them all through the book. I cannot believe that people would respond in this manner to the ordeal of the daughter. I am sad to finish many books because I know that I will miss the characters that I have just spent hours with. When I finished this book I had a different feeling. I said good riddance to all of them.	1997-12-10

Carl provides me with real &quot;comfort&quot; books, ones that I can curl up with, forget the world and just laugh and laugh. The only problem with this and his other books is that it ends.<br /> The only criticism that I would make is that Hiaasen sometimes try to carry his &quot;hilarity&quot; into descriptions of violent or unpleasant death. There are some things that just aren't funny.	1997-12-04
