Writing with both years of biblical faithfulness and a keen insight into culture to his credit, Carson presents a carefully written synopsis and evaluation of the emerging church which is both appreciative and critical. \\"Whenever a Christian movement comes along that presents itself as reformist,\\" Carson writes, \\"it should not be summarily dismissed. Even if one ultimately decides that the movement embraces some worrying weaknesses, it may also have some important things to say that the rest of the Christian world needs to hear\\" (10). Carson succeeds in both listening to the important things the emerging church leaders are saying, and bringing Scripture to bear on their worrying weaknesses.<br /><br />Chapter one gives a profile of the emerging church, with Carson assuming little to no acquaintance with the emerging church from his readers. Carson has obviously done his homework on the `conversation,' as his numerous references to writings by Brian McLaren, Dan Kimball, Mike Yaconelli, Spencer Burke, Leonard Sweet, Robert Webber, Dave Tomlinson, and others reveals.  \\"At the heart of the emerging reformation lies a perception of a major change in culture\\" (42). This perception has led many of the emerging church leaders into protest - protest against modernism, and both traditional and pragmatic (i.e. seeker-sensitive) evangelicals, who (in their estimation) are becoming increasingly irrelevant in our rapidly changing culture. Very little appreciation or criticism is offered at this point. Instead, Carson insists that \\"the emerging church movement must be evaluated as to its reading of contemporary culture\\" (43), while its \\"proposals for the way ahead must be assessed for their biblical fidelity\\" (44).<br /><br />The second chapter focuses on the strengths of the movement. In the author's view, some of those strengths include:<br /><br />* Its honest attempts \\"to read the culture in which we find ourselves and to think through the implications of such a reading for our witness, our grasp of theology, our churchmanship, even our self understanding\\" (45);<br /><br />* Its push for authenticity in our corporate worship of God (49-51);<br /><br />* Its recognition of our own social location, that is that \\"we ourselves are part of this rapidly changing culture, and we cannot help but be influenced by it\\" (51);<br /><br />* Its concern for \\"evangelizing people who are often overlooked by the church\\" (52);<br /><br />* And its \\"probing links with the [Christian] tradition\\" (54), casting off some traditions that are deemed unhelpful and wrong while remaining open to exploring practices that belong to the larger swath of Christendom (a strength that is also at times a weakness).<br /><br />But while all of these things are positive traits within the emergent church, for which we should be thankful, Carson concludes by describing one church which embodies all of these characteristics, but which is not likely to be identified with the emerging church movement. The point being, that \\"the emerging church movement has numerous strengths, and we should be grateful for them - but they are not exclusively theirs\\" (56).<br /><br />Next is Carson's summary of the emerging church's analysis of contemporary culture. \\"This exercise is important because the emerging church leaders themselves ground their call to reformation in cultural changes taking place around us\\" (57). Several criticisms of this analysis are offered. First, Carson points out that emergent leaders tend to be overly reductionistic in their understanding of modernism. \\"The modern period is treated as if it were all of a piece, consistently devoted to the rational, the cerebral, the linear, theabsolute, the objective. But history isn't that neat\\" (59). This misreading of modernism is especially troubling because of the emerging movement's tendency to unfairly criticize and almost universally condemn confessional Christianity. This is Carson's second criticism. \\"In my reading of the emerging church literature, Christianity under modernism is rationalistic, cerebral rather than emotional, and given toward arrogance because of its absolutism\\" (60). Of course, examples of such can be found, but this has certainly not been universally true of all Christians within modernism. There are also examples of Christians whose firm beliefs were matched with fervent devotion to Christ. (As a case in point, Carson provides a lengthy quotation from Spurgeon.) Third, Carson takes issue with the emerging movement because its condemnation of confessional Christianity is often theologically shallow and intellectually incoherent. \\"It is theologically shallow because it overlooks the basic fact that no worldview, no epistemological system developed by us in a fallen world, is entirely good or entirely bad . . . It is intellectually incoherent because, in the spirit of postmodern toleration, most emergent publications go out of their way to find good things about every other `ism'. . . . The one `ism' about which some appear to find it almost impossible to say anything positive, especially in the publications of emergent leaders,  is modernism (as they understand it)\\" (68-69). Carson also surveys the movements analysis of postmodernism, and confesses that \\"in many aspects [he] agrees with [their] understanding\\" (75). But he does feel that they appeal too much and too carelessly to the buzz word \\"postmodernism\\" - especially given the fact that in popular culture the word (and other accompanying nomenclature) means different things to different people, while \\"in academic circles, the subject is beginning to look pass&eacute;\\" (81). To lump all social changes under this one rubric, decreases the credibility of the emerging church's analysis. And the claim that, with postmodernism, the age of authentic Christianity has arrived betrays a lack of evenhanded evaluation. Some writers need to tone down their rhetoric.<br /><br />Very helpful is Carson's \\"personal reflections on postmodernism's contributions and challenges\\" in the fourth chapter. While this chapter requires the most effort, it is probably the most rewarding, as Carson defines and contrasts the epistemologies of premodernism, modernism, and postmodernism. In short, premodern epistemology said \\"knowledge depends on revelation - i.e. on God disclosing some part of what he knows, however that revelation is accomplished\\" (88). Modern epistemology, \\"a label commonly applied to the epistemology of the Western world from about the beginning of the seventeenth century until a few decades ago\\" (92), begins with man instead of God (Descartes' \\"I think, therefore I am\\") and claims that the right foundation plus the correct method would invariable yield objective truth (92-95). Postmodern epistemology, like that of modernism, begins with the finite \\"I,\\" but draws very different conclusions. It is \\"passionately anti-foundationalist,\\" meaning that \\"there is no ultimate fulcrum on which the levers of knowledge can rest\\" (97) and it \\"insists that there are many methods [of knowing], all of which produce distinguishable results and none of which is any more or less `true' than the results produced by the other methods\\" (97). \\"Objective knowledge is neither attainable nor desirable\\" and under this regime, truth \\"cannot partake of ahistorical universality\\" (97). With postmodernism come several correlatives (syncretism, secularization, biblical illiteracy, ill-defined spirituality, and globalization) and entailments (98-102). Carson then details both strengths and weaknesses in postmodern epistemology, and helpfully distinguishes between what he calls hard and soft postmodernism. Hard postmodernism concludes that \\"human beings cannot have objective knowledge about anything\\" (105), while soft postmodernism, admitting that human knowledge is necessarily perspectival, still insists that \\"we can in measure approach the truth in some objective sense\\" (105-106). The appropriate place of \\"critical realism\\" (110-111) needs to be recognized and new models for helping us think explored (116-122).<br /><br />Chapter five contains Carson's most detailed critique of the emerging church movement itself. He voices five criticisms, all of them related to the movement's handling of truth-related issues. They are (1) their failure to come to terms with the importance of non-omniscient truth-claims (126-132); (2) their failure to face the tough questions especially if they are truth related (132-138); (3) their failure to use Scripture as the norming norm over against an eclectic appeal to tradition (139-146); (4) their failure to handle \\"becoming\\" and \\"belonging\\" tensions in a biblically faithful way (146-155); and (5) their failure to handle facts, both exegetical and historical in a responsible way (155-156). Chapter six specifies this critique by carefully examining two significant books, Brian McLaren's A Generous Orthodoxy and Steven Chalke's The Lost Message of Jesus. Carson's criticisms are irenic and charitable in tone, though he doesn't hesitate to call these authors on the carpet where he deems it warranted by Scripture.<br /><br />Finally, in chapters seven and eight Carson points his readers to some biblical passages to help us in our evaluation of postmodernism and the emergent church. He lists over 120 passages (some more helpful than others) relevant to truth, knowledge, and pluralism (188-202), then briefly comments on ten texts that are particularly insightful for this discussion (202-217), and concludes with an excellent biblical meditation on truth and experience, grounded in a chapter-length exposition of 2 Peter 1. Scripture, subject, and name indices are included at the end of the book.<br /><br />Having been both stirred and troubled in reading several books on postmodernism and the emergent church, I came to this book with high hopes of being guided by this biblically faithful, contemporary scholar. I was not disappointed. Carson helped clarify my understanding of both modernism and postmodernism, seemed to resonate with the emergent church in some of its positive features, and was well able to articulate the cautions I have intuitively felt in my own reading. His research is impeccable, his knowledge of Scripture profound, his love for the church obvious, and his critique insightful. All of that to say this: if you only read one book on postmodernism and the emergent church, read this one.of the emerging church's analysis.

As the title suggests, this book is developed around the story-line of Jonah whose disobedience and running from God parallel similar sins in pastors. Peterson confronts pastors who do not stay rooted in one place, succumb to the lusts of \\"ecclesiastical pornography\\" (see the quote in a review below), and serve up religion to parishioners by making golden calves. His playful prose explores multiple dimensions of the pastoral vocation including prayer, spiritual direction, and cultivating (as a farmer cultivates a field, as opposed to a developer excavating land to build a shopping mall) the top-soil of the congregation. A chapter which meanders through the works of Dostoevsky, gleaning numerous insights into the soul-work of pastors, was especially helpful. I found myself rebuked, refocused, revived, and refreshed in my reading of this book over vacation this year. Just what I needed. The exegesis in Jonah may be strained at a few points, but the pastoral theology is sound and I'm grateful for what I gleaned from this book. I plan to return to it again in the future.	2005-07-02

This was, unfortunately, the first biography on Lewis that I read (apart from Lewis's own Surprised by Joy and A Grief Observed) some eight years ago. I naively bought it in a second-hand shop and read it uncritically. Only years later did I realize how spurious Wilson's research and misleading his conclusions were. While this book is hailed as being a more honest and forthright account of Lewis, especially in his humanity and less than evangelical-approved habits (i.e. smoking, drinking, and bawdy humor), this book is really the dashing of several myths about Lewis that only a few people have believed, but the dashing of which make Christians look stupid, C. S. Lewis look confused, and Wilson look good, allowing him to reconstruct Lewis via Freudian psychoanalysis. Kathryn Lindskoog's Light in the Shadow Lands: Protecting the Real C. S. Lewis, Appendix 4, gives a fine and even-handed critique of Wilson's biography (with careful documentation of his errors) and helped set my thinking and reading straight. A far better biography of Lewis is George Sayer's Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis. The Lewis I read about in Sayer's biography resonated with the man I have discovered myself in Lewis's own writings - a very human man, to be sure, but a man who was filled with the love of Christ.	2005-06-08

The book is sprinkled with some helpful illustrations and great quotations from the Puritan/Reformed tradition. This is a good follow-up to Whitney's more popular book Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life.	2005-03-05

My only (very slight) complaint is that Dekker left me with a couple of unanswered questions . . . my hope is that maybe this was intended to leave open a window for a follow-up novel. We'll see.

Written from the conviction that \\"learning to grasp the unity of the Bible . . . is necessary for a right understanding of the meaning of any individual text\\" (p. 7), this introductory-level biblical theology is an excellent survey of the history of God's mighty redemptive acts as recorded in the unfolding narrative of Scripture.<br /><br />Goldsworthy's stated aim is to (1) introduce his readers to an integrated theology of the Bible (2) written with a full acceptance of the full inspiration and authority of Scripture as God's Word, (3) for ordinary Christians. His work is a success.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts, answering the questions \\"why?\\", \\"how?\\", \\"what?\\" and \\"where?\\" about biblical theology. Part one is a single chapter which answers the \\"why?\\" question by raising several questions (about interpretation of problem passages, the relevance of the Old Testament to today, and whether there is a unifying theme to the Bible)which make biblical theology so necessary for believers.<br /><br />Part two, the most academic part of the book (and the part most likely to intimidate Goldsworthy's intended audience of lay-people), answers the \\"what?\\" question in six chapters which introduce the foundational presuppositions which form the basis for the author's biblical-theological method. Biblical theology is compared to other forms of theology (systematic, historical, exegetical, pastoral) (chapter two), Christian theism is contrasted with secular humanism and theistic humanism (chapter three), and the nature of Scripture as God's divine-human word of revelation to man, which is focused on Christ as redeemer, is thoroughly addressed (chapters four - seven). Chapter five is especially helpful in fleshing out a distinctively Christian (Christ-centered) approach to Scripture, understanding that the Bible contains \\"progressive, redemptive revelation.\\" \\"It is revelation because in it God makes himself known. It is redemptive because God reveals himself in the act of redeeming us. It is progressive because God makes himself and his purposes known by stages until the full light is revealed in Jesus Christ\\" (p. 57). This portion of the book should be read at some point, although some readers may prefer to skip ahead to part three and revisit part two later.<br /><br />Part three is much more accessible as the author now answers the \\"what?\\" question in eighteen short chapters. These chapters cover the entire sweep of Scripture by highlighting the key epochs and events in the biblical story-line (e.g. creation, the fall, first promises of redemption (with Noah), the call of Abraham, the exodus of Israel from Egypt, the giving of the law, the wilderness temptation, the conquest of Canaan, the beginning of the monarcy, the exile of Israel into Babylon, the prophetic promises, the coming of Christ, the out-pouring of the Spirit, and the future consummation), all the while connecting the dots with biblical-theological themes of creation/new-creation, covenant/promise, kingdom, and regeneration. This portion of the book is invaluable and will forever change the way you read Scripture (if you have not already been exposed to biblical theology). These chapters make this book well-worth reading!<br /><br />Part four addresses the application question of \\"where?\\" - that is, where do we apply biblical theology? Only two topics are covered (guidance and life after death), and those only briefly, but the aim is to show us how to apply the methodology of biblical-theological study to other areas.

Because the supreme duty of every follower of Jesus is to glorify God (1 Cor 10:31) and because praise on the lips divorced from delight in the heart is hypocrisy (Matthew 15:8), nothing is more important than having a heart that is so satisfied in Jesus that it can say, \\"Whom have I heaven but You? And there is nothing on earth that I desire beside You\\" (Psalm 73:25). And since sustaining that kind of desire for God is a fight, John Piper served us well by writing this helpful book.<br /><br />Chapter One is entitled, \\"Why I Wrote This Book.\\" From the outset Piper makes clear that \\"the fight for joy in Christ is not a fight to soften the cushion of Western comforts. It is a fight to live a life of self-sacrificing love.\\" (p. 20). This is no health/wealth/prosperity handbook to grabbing as much joy in this life as possible. It is a field-manual for the believer who is dead earnest about not wasting his life on trivialities.<br /><br />Chapter Two, \\"What is the Difference Between Desire and Delight,\\" far from playing fast and loose in defining words, is a helpful exploration of \\"affections.\\" Drawing on C. S. Lewis's \\"Surprised by Joy,\\" Piper demonstrates that desire and delight are different though related, with God the all-important object of both. His discussion is laden with Scripture and his use of language wise.<br /><br />Chapter Three, \\"The Call to Fight for Joy in God,\\" is a serious look at God's demand that we delight in Him. Delight in God is serious because the essence of evil is to choose broken cisterns over the Fountain of Living Water (Jer. 2:13). And joy in God is so central to saving faith that Piper rightly says, \\"Heaven hangs on having the taste of joy in God\\" (p. 34). Which is why fighting for it is so urgent. This, however, doesn't lead us into the cul-de-sac of legalism, because \\"Joy in God is a Gift of God\\" (Chapter Four). God graciously gives what He demands by creating delight in our hearts. Chapter Five further explores that gift in discussing how \\"The Fight for Joy is a Fight to See\\" - and seeing is the result of God's gracious work. \\"Without the work of our omnipotent internal Eye Surgeon we would remain blind and unable to see. Oh, how we need the gift of spiritual sight!\\" (p. 58) Chapter Six, \\"Fighting for Joy Like a Justified Sinner,\\" shows how the gospel is central to our fight for joy and urges us to feast on the gospel in the preached Word and the Lord's Table.<br /><br />Chapters Seven through Twelve take us deeper into application, as Piper teaches us how to \\"Wield the Word in the Fight for Joy\\" (Chapters Seven and Eight), discusses the focus and practice of prayer in the fight for joy (Chapters Nine and Ten), and explores \\"How to Wield the World in the Fight for Joy\\" (Chapter Eleven - a very useful chapter which shows how to use food and fasting, sex and suffering, art and literature, and rest and nature in the fight for joy). Chapter Twelve is a hopeful encouragement for \\"When the Darkness Does Not Lift.\\"<br /><br />I've read most of Piper's books and this one is near the top, along with the classics Desiring God, Future Grace, and The Pleasures of God. It is certainly his most practical book to date and will be my companion for many years as I continue to battle for a heart satisfied in God alone.he cul-de-sac of legalism, because \\"Joy in God is a Gift of God\\" (Chapter Four).

But, unlike the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, this reformation is moving the church further away from God's Word, not closer. Schuller sounds orthodox at first. He uses familiar catchphrases of the Bible: sin, salvation, kingdom of God. For example, he writes: \\"I am convinced that the deepest of all human needs is salvation from sin and hell.\\" But, unfortunately, Schuller means something different by those words than what you might think. Understanding sin to be \\"rebellion against God\\" is \\"shallow and insulting the human being.\\" Schuller defines sin as \\"any act or thought that robs myself or another human being of his or her self-esteem\\" and hell as \\"the loss of pride that naturally follows separation from God.\\" And what is God? Schuller refers to him as \\"the ultimate and unfailing source of our soul's sense of self-respect.\\" \\"Lack of faith\\" is defined as \\"a profoundly deep sense of unworthiness.\\"  The cross of Christ is seen as \\"God's price tag on a human soul.\\"  And \\"the most serious sin is the one that causes me to say, `I am unworthy.' Schuller goes so far as to say that: \\"once a person believes he is an `unworthy sinner,' it is doubtful if he can really honestly accept the saving grace God offers in Jesus Christ.\\"  The kingdom of God is not the reign and rule of Jesus Christ but the \\"community of caring and Christ-inspired, compassionate people, who are committed to building a self-respecting society of persons whose inalienable right to self-worth controls communications, evangelism, economics, social ethics, and political systems. What about self-denial? Schuller says that \\"self-affirmation . . . is the pathway to self-denial.\\" In short, Schuller empties these terms of their biblical meaning and realigns everthing with man at the center. According to him, \\"classical theology has erred in its insistence that theology be 'God-centered,' not 'man-centered.'o him, \\"classical theology has erred in its insistence that theology be 'God-centered,' not 'man-centered.'	2004-09-18

The commentary reflects competent scholarship (but without being cumbersome, e.g. Greek words are transliterated) and a conservative theological perspective. Of special help are the many theological excursions spread throughout the text (A Note on the Meaning of 'Fellowship,' A Note on Hilasmos, A Note on Antichrist, A Note on Sinless Perfectionism, A Note on Sins that Do and Do Not Lead to Death, etc.) Kruse gives a good survey of various interpretations, but also grounds his own conclusions in solid exegesis of both text and context.

Paul David Tripp powerfully unfolds biblical principles for how &quot;people in need of change&quot; (like me) can help &quot;people in need of change&quot; (others). This gospel-centered book begins by describing &quot;the best of news&quot; which gives us &quot;a reason to get up in the morning.&quot; This news &quot;is not freedom from hardship, suffering and loss. It is the news of a Redeemer who has come to rescue me from MYSELF&quot; (p. 16). It is the news of a God who deals with sin and its paralyzing effects in our lives.<br />Tripp then discusses how &quot;God transforms people's lives as people bring his Word to others&quot; (p. 19). We are tools in the Master's hands, and His desire is to use us to speak the truth in love to others, so as to further His transforming work in their lives. This only happens as His Word is seen as more than an encyclopedia of answers to our problems, but as &quot;a narrative, a story of redemption, [with] its chief character . . . Jesus Christ&quot; (p. 27). The sovereignty, grace, and glory of God are seen as the &quot;rebar&quot; running through the pages of Scripture, the themes which give strength and meaning to its message - and to our lives, if we will align ourselves with it.<br />Central to the development of this book is the conviction that &quot;human beings by their very nature are WORSHIPERS&quot; (p. 44). This defines who we are. The question is whether we worship God or idols. In fact, &quot;stolen worship is at the core of what is wrong with fallen human beings&quot; (p. 45). All of our personal troubles and trials spring out of this &quot;worship disorder.&quot; Stress and burnout, depression and anger, breakdowns in relationships, and the disintegeration of family are all fruits springing from this one root: a heart that does not worship God. Therefore, the heart is the target in all personal ministry to others.<br />Jesus, the Wonderful Counselor, came to redeem and transform human hearts. And following His model, we are called to bring His redemptive word to others. This involves four basic steps: love, know, speak, do. These steps are unfolded in extremely practical ways with lots of personal stories and illustrations. Tripp trains us how to love people the way Jesus does, how to gather information about their lives so as to understand their hearts; and how to speak the truth in love to them so that they can change in in both heart and life to the glory of God. This is an excellent book which I highly recommend, especially to pastors and counselors.rful Counselor, came to redeem and transform human hearts.

Desiring God: The Meditations of a Christian Hedonist is, hands down, the most important book (except the Bible) that I have ever read. It is a series of profoundly biblical meditations on Scripture, rooted in painstaking exegesis by a competent and well-trained New Testament scholar, illustrated from the pages of history, and validated by the changed lives of hundreds of young men and women from the past 18 years (the first edition was released in 1986).<br />Piper's thesis is that the chief end of man is to glorify God BY enjoying Him forever. This is based on the conviction that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him. The call to Christian Hedonism is thus a call to abandon the short-term, low-yield pleasures of the world for the magnificent joys of knowing God in whom is fullness of joy and at whose right hand there are pleasures for ever more.<br />Don't be misled by negative reviews about this book. Piper does not seek &quot;to create Christians that are nothing more than self-seeking clones that ignore the Biblical concepts of humilty,&quot; nor does he attempt &quot;to make God into some type of tool that Christians can use for their enjoyment.&quot; Rather, he claims that people have already made a god out of what they derive the most enjoyment from. If you get more joy out of golf than out of God, you are worshiping an idol. The reason God commands (yes COMMANDS) us to enjoy Him (Psalm 37:4; Psalm 100:2; and dozens of other texts) is because this brings Him praise and honor. My wife is not honored by my taking her out to dinner if it is motivated by a desire to do my duty rather than by a spontaenous affection for her that delights in her presence. She is honored when I pursue her joy because it makes me happy to see her happy. That is true Hedonism.<br />This book is a radical call to deny yourself the fleeting pleasures of sin and to embrace the risk-taking lifestyle that has marked martyrs and missionaries across the ages. It is not a health/wealth/prosperity book, but a weighty Bible-saturated book of practical theology that is designed to produce saints who can be satisfied in God even though they suffer for the sake of Christ and the nations.<br />I have met John Piper (though he would not remember me) and corresponded with him more than once. I've listened to dozens of sermons, have heard him in person on numerous occasions and have read almost every book he has written. He is one of the most humble men I know. He gives every penny of his book royalties away and lives a simple life, pastoring a church in downtown Minneapolis. He has no love for money and no desire for glory for himself. His life is authentic and so is his message. Read this book and learn afresh the joy of following Jesus!not a health/wealth/prosperity book, but a weighty Bible-saturated book of practical theology that is designed to produce saints who can be satisfied in God even though they suffer for the sake of Christ and the nations. <br />I have met John Piper (though he would not remember me) and corresponded with him more than once.

Lindskoog's documentation is thorough and each chapter ends with suggestions for further reading about the given topic. Perhaps the most delightful aspect of this book is Lindskoog's mastery not only of Lewis's apologetics, but of his fiction. She deftly illustrates the former with the latter, and therein reveals the incredible unity in Lewis's own work.<br />Excellent!!!	2003-12-18

R. Tolkien as beautifully expressed in his mythological subcreation, Middle-Earth, popularized in The Lord of the Rings. Birzer does a wonderful job, in my opinion, of unfolding how Tolkien's Christian-Catholic world-view shaped his writings. He deals with topics such as Heroism, The Nature of Evil, Modernism, and Grace. While I am not Catholic and would not share many of Tolkien's sentiments, I am enthralled with his work and this book helped me understand it better. Birzer avoids drawing superficial parallels from Tolkien's stories or turning them into allegories (something Tolkien would have abhorred); but rather gets into the fabric of Tolkien's own thought (with excellent documentation in both the fiction of Tolkien and his letters), uncovering HIS vision of Middle-earth. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to really understand Tolkien better.	2003-12-18

Chapell takes preachers step by step through the process of preparing expository sermons which are faithful to the text, redemptive in focus, and application-oriented in style. His emphasis and teaching on finding their fallen redemptive focus of every text will help preachers keep the sermons redemptive and Christ-centered, rather than moralistic, legalistic, and discouraging. The balance Chapell suggests between explanation, illustration, and application is something more expositors need to heed. The book is well-written, well-documented (interacting well with most of the other material out there on preaching), and easy-to-apply. I cannot overstate how helpful this book has been for me. I recommend it very, very highly.	2003-12-04

Everything You Want in a Good Biography	This excellent study on the greatest theologian/philosopher in American history is everything you would ever want in a good biography. George Marsden writes with an objective eye and at an even pace in this thoroughly researched, yet popularly written biography on Edwards. Much attention is given to the intellectual development of Edwards, and Marsden helps us see Edwards against the backdrop of the age in which he lived. There is also considerable focus on the Great Awakening, including the good, the bad, and the ugly. No one can understand Edwards without understanding something about the controversies in which he was enmeshed; and again, Marsden gives an objective account which is not unsympathetic to Edwards, but does not fail to recognize his feet of clay either. Towards the end of the book are several chapters introducing Edwards most important theological books, such as Freedom of the Will, Original Sin, History of Redemption, and The End for Which God Created the World. The book is carefully documented and indexed, but for all the detail it is an absolutely delightful read! I highly,  highly recommend this book.	2003-12-04

Joshua Harris does a fantastic job of setting every man's battle in its proper biblical and theological context. He is not soft on sin, but neither does he lead one to discouragement or despair. He understands that a right relationship with God is by grace through faith alone, but he knows that the faith which justifies also sanctifies. He is candid and honest, yet remains discreet, writing a book which is appropriate for and targeted to both men and women. He avoids setting hard and fast rules, advocating that we develop \\"a custom-tailored plan\\" for fighting against lust, but he provides plenty of practical ideas about how to make progress. He addresses sensitive issues (like masturbation) as well as cultural issues (like media and dress). Best of all, he encourages open accountability (\\"lone rangers are dead rangers\\") and provides an excellent chapter on how to fight the lying promises of lust with the true and satisfying promises of God. Drawing on the wisdom of John Piper's Future Grace, and C. J. Mahaney's The Cross-centered Life, this is one of the best books on sanctification I've seen, and the best book on the particular subject of sexual temptation I've ever read. I highly recommend this to both men and women, single or married. Thanks, Josh for sharing your heart with us.	2003-09-24

Ryle's classic calls Christians to the hard and happy work of growing through grit in the grace of Christ. With a double-edged sword, Ryle cuts through the errors of both perfectionism and antinomianism, legalism and license, sinless perfection and carnal Christianity. He exhorts us to run with perserverance the race set before us and fight the good fight of faith and strive to enter the kingdom, yet keeps before us the grace of God which alone enables such holy soul-effort. The book begins by examining sin, sanctification, holiness, the fight, the cost, growth, and assurance, and then goes on to explore other related themes including an excellent chapter called &quot;A woman to be remembered&quot; on Lot's wife and her tragic backward glance. The chapters are more expository than topical, yet full of application. Many extracts from old English Puritans are included, as well.

Lewis was raised in a somewhat nominal Christianity, which he threw off as a school-boy. But as Lewis says, &quot;A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There were traps everywhere - 'Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,' as Herbert says, 'fine nets and strategems.' God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous.&quot; And this book is Lewis's chronicle of God's strategems and nets and the surprises which eventually converted Lewis back to Christianity. Central to this process was Lewis's experience of joy, which he defines as &quot;an unsatisfied desire which is itself more desirable than any other satisfaction.&quot; As a boy and as a man, Lewis was stabbed by this desire, yet never able to satisfy it. By a process of elimination, he came to realize that (as he says in another book) &quot;if I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.&quot; The desire led him to the Objective Other - the Absolute - Spirit. At first, Lewis viewed this Other as an impersonal and objective absolute. But, God strategically boxed him into a corner (Lewis uses the analogy of check-mate in a game of chess) where he was forced to acknowledge that this Other was God Himself, and beyond that, God enfleshed in Jesus Christ. Woven into the story are the events of Lewis's childhood, education, and intellectual development. Quite a lot of the discussion centers around his reading, from Beatrix Potter as a child, to Keats, Herbert, MacDonald, and Chesterton as a young adult. This is a fascinating book and one cannot quite hope to fully appreciate Lewis without reading it. I highly recommend it!	2003-09-12

It even beats The Lord of the Rings trilogy. C. S. Lewis's power of description, psychological insight, and emotional intensity reach a height here that is unparalleled. But beyond such engaging writing, Perelandra gives us poetry in prose, reality in story, theology in fantasy, truth in myth. It is an evocative tale, so compelling that for a faint second I could have believed it was true, and that Lewis was describing real events, not fictitious ones! And that is because it is so deeply grounded in the reality of The Great Dance, the drama of creation and redemption which is being enacted upon the stage of humanity. The final pages of this book sent my spirits soaring. I can scarcely describe its impact upon me. Take it and read.	2003-08-24

Screwtape fills his letters to young Wormwood with diabolically clever advice on how to thoroughly entangle his patient in the snares which will keep him from the Enemy, namely Jesus Christ. Screwtape advices Wormwood on how to capitalize on such things as domestic relationships, war, friendship, love, and sex, and includes many critical insights on the nature of pleasure, laughter, triviality, love, lust, humility, pride, anxiety, resignation, fear, etc.<br />Reading over Wormwood's shoulder will do two things for you: it will make you laugh (this is an incredibly funny book) and it will make you painfully aware of the demon whispering in your own ear. Few authors understand the psychological labyrinth of the human soul as Lewis does. He has a way of uncovering the subconscious motives and thought-processes of one's soul and forcing them into the bright light of true righteousness and love.<br />I read this book last night (it is a quick read) for the fourth time and walked away freshly challenged, convicted, and encouraged in my spiritual life. I highly, highly recommend this book.	2003-08-12

Dallas Willard tackles issues of discipleship and discipline in a fresh and invigorating way. Willard is rightly convinced that &quot;the practical irrelevance of actual obedience to Christ&quot; has weakened the effectiveness of Christianity in today's culture. &quot;Discipleship or apprenticeship to Jesus is, in our day, no longer thought of as in any way essential to faith in him,&quot; Willard says. &quot;It is regarded as a costly option, a spiritual luxury, or possibly even an evasion.&quot; This concern led Willard to write the third book in his trilogy on the spiritual life (along with In Search of Guidance and The Spirit of the Disciplines) which &quot;presents discipleship to Jesus as the very heart of the gospel.&quot;<br />Willard's path is a well-traveled one, though he views some of the familiar sights a bit differently than most of us are accustomed to. The Kingdom of the Heavens is seen primarily as the realm of God's rule (kingdom) which is as near to us as the atmosphere around us (the heavens). A new thought for me, and one I'm still mulling over. Eternal Life is mainly a quality of life - an eternal kind of life. Willard's reading of the Sermon on the Mount is certainly unique. Frankly, his understanding of the Beattitudes is one of the more novel and unbelievable parts of the book. But his analysis of Matthew chapters 6 and 7 is very helpful.<br />The heart of the book, found in chapters eight and nine, tackles what it means to be a student, or disciple, of Jesus, along with developing a curriculum for Christlikeness. Those two chapters alone are worth their weight in gold. I found them immensely helpful. Willard stresses the necessity of intention in our pursuit of the disciple's life and the importance of changing beliefs in order to shape behavior. Regarding a curriculum for Christlikeness, Willard helpfully shows that the objective is NOT &quot;external conformity to the wording of Jesus' teachings about actions in specific contexts&quot; or &quot;profession of perfectly correct doctrine.&quot; Not that these things are unimportant - but they are not the goal. The goal is not faithfulness to activities in church or special religious experiences, either. The goal, very simply, is coming to &quot;dearly love and constantly delight in&quot; the Father and removing the &quot;automatic responses againt the kingdom of God&quot; so that we are free from the dominion and enslavement of &quot;old habitual patterns of thought, feeling, and action.&quot; The goal is to develop automatic, reflex responses to life that mirror those of Christ. Willard's exposition of this is very good and will be eye-opening for many young disciples.<br />The strategies which help us develop this Christlike character are the spiritual disciplines. The disciplines, which Willard groups into two catagories (disciplines of abstinence and disciplines of engagement) are designed to help us enthrall the mind with God and aquire new habits of goodness, as we interact with both the work of the Holy Spirit and the testings and trials of life in our pursuit of Christlikeness. Willard fleshes this out briefly with a discussion about the disciplines of solitude, silence, study, and worship. The final chapter is a glorious discussion on the Restoration of All Things, as Willard describes where this whole Christian thing is headed.<br />Now, my brief caveats. I do have a couple of qualms about this book, but I tack them on the end and really do not want to overplay them, because they are really peripheral to Willard's message. My concerns are these: 1) In the helpful chapter &quot;Gospels of Sin Management,&quot; I think Willard overreacts to Evangelicals (the Right, as he calls us) in his discussion of the atonement and &quot;Lordship Salvation.&quot; In particular, the criticisms of John MacArthur seem completely unwarranted to me. I wondered if Willard had really read or heard anything by MacArthur apart from this one issue. 2) In chapter four on the Beattitudes, Willard is just out to lunch. I think he totally missed it on this point. 3) Willard's discussion (very brief) on the relationship of God's sovereignty and human responsibility reflects a very Arminian perspective. &quot;God has paid an awful price to arrange for human determination,&quot; says Willard. Other statements hint at a sympathetic view of Open Theism. Disappointing. In Willard's zeal to preserve the truth that prayer does change things, he has gone to the unhelpful and unbiblical extreme of elevating human autonomy too high. 4) In the midst of a very good discussion on the &quot;elephant in the church&quot; which everyone tries to ignore (namely, the lack of discipleship) Willard strongly states that he does not believe that only true disciples make it to heaven after death. In light of the overall message of Willard's book, it is hard to see how he can say this. It certainly doesn't comply with Jesus own words in John 8. So, those four things give me a little pause concerning this book. But not much. Just enough to make it a four star instead of a five star recommendation. The material I balk at could be contained in less than thirty pages of the book (out of 400!). So, I still say &quot;read it.&quot; Just be careful on the finer points of Willard's theology.ered if Willard had really read or heard anything by MacArthur apart from this one issue. 2) In chapter four on the Beattitudes, Willard is just out to lunch.

What a legacy John Piper will leave to this generation in this magnificent call to follow Christ down the Calvary Road. Full of autobiographical references, this challenging book discusses how God's passion to be glorified and man's passion to be satisfied reach their goal in the single passion of losing one's life to gain Christ. The cross is viewed as the only ground for boasting in the disciple's life and as the reason for embracing risk, pain, and death as the means of magnifying Christ by making others glad in Him. Piper calls us to be missionaries and martyrs - abroad and at home. An excellent chapter on \\"Making Much of Christ from 8 to 5\\" will give solid direction to American Christians who want to embrace the call to follow Christ, yet do not feel divinely compelled to the foreign mission field. In many ways, this is the essence of all Piper has been saying for twenty-years - and especially for the last decade. This would be an excellent gift for high school and college graduates. I cannot recommend it too highly.	2003-06-17

It's the essence of Christian Hedonism without the more intricate exegesis of Scripture and the fuller, lengthier illustrations from history. It serves as a good introduction to Piper's writings and/or as a good book for a new believer who is not used to heavier reading.<br />Readers should not stop here, however. This book is like the shallow water on the shore of Christian Hedonism, whereas Desiring God, The Pleasures of God, and Future Grace plummet the depths. So, if this book grips you, move on to the meatier version.<br />Unlike some of Piper's critics, I do not find him proof-texting Scripture (its more like the critics are proof-texting Piper). There is absolutely no relish in Piper for emotion-driven worship abstracted from a life of reflection or holiness. What Piper aims for, rather, is to free Christians from the silly notion that it is wrong to pursue pleasure in the All-Satisfying God. That would be like saying it is wrong for me to take my wife out to dinner because it makes me happy to be with her. How in the world could my pleasure in the person of my wife (not what she does, but who she is) fail to honor her? It is the same with God. When we worship Him without any emotional counterpart, we fall under the indictment of Jesus: \\"these people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.\\" As Piper says, \\"where feelings for God are dead, worship is dead.\\"<br />Finally, a comment on why the duty of delight is dangerous . . . It is dangerous, because it compels us to sell all for the treasure of Christ and count everything as rubbish for the surpassing value of knowing Christ and embrace suffering as a means of multiplying the joy of knowing Christ in the lives of others. It is this element in Piper that sets him apart from the rest. For Piper, joy is that which compels us to live a life of radical sacrifice in the service of God and others.<br />I highly recommend this book. It is one of the better \\"small books . . . big change\\" books out there. Just don't stop here. That would be like settling for an appetizer before dinner.

A helpful chapter called \\"The Cross Centered Day\\" lists several practical ways to keep one's focus constantly on the Cross. There is also a helpful, but simple, discussion of the differences between justification and sanctification.

Engaging because Sweet is a masterful communicator. I've rarely encountered such an excellent word-smith. He has a rare gift for illustrating truth through metaphor. The entire book, in fact, is built on the metaphor of the mariner. Jesus is our North Star, the Bible is our Compass, Tradition is our Anchor, Creativity is our Gyroscope, etc. Sweet talks about \\"the traps of maps\\" and how people go over-board in wrongly relating to the Bible. He freely quotes poets and actors, preachers and philosophers, newspapers and supermodels in his grasping for ways to communicate. His grasp of postmodern culture is amazing.<br />Not so, however, his grasp of Scripture and this is what makes the book disturbing. While he acknowledges the authority of Scripture, he fails to demonstrate proper exegesis. He calls himself almost a fundamentalist when it comes to the content of the gospel, but almost a libertine when it comes to the containers in which the gospel is presented, which sounds a lot like &quot;the end justifies the means.&quot; When it comes to methods, anything goes. I fear that such looseness with methods cannot help but compromise the message. A dirty container will pollute the content that is placed within it, and too much adaptation to culture will adversely affect our understanding of the gospel. Sweet walks too close to the line, I think.<br />There is more emphasis on giftedness and innovation in leadership than on character and godliness. In fact, I remember absolutely no discussion on the qualifcations for leadership stipulated in the Pastoral Epistles. Troubling, for a book on church leadership. Creativity is given more weight than fidelity to Scripture. The pulpit is considered a prison, not the primary platform for disseminating truth. These all make the book disturbing to me, and not one that I would quickly recommend to<br />others.<br />A few positives, though: his chapter on taking shore leave (Sabbaths) was needed and helpful. Also, his many, many colorful illustrations and quotations. The book is worth periodic revisiting for the illustrations alone. I also see value in Sweet's emphasis on utilizing technology, particularly the Internet, in the church - but not to the neglect of more traditional forms like preaching and teaching.<br />So, in summary, this book is a mixed bag.

Schreiner has given us an outstanding study on the theology and mission of the Apostle Paul in this easy-to-read yet thorough volume. While not exhaustive, Schreiner does wrestle with the most important issues. He simply avoids the wearisome type of New Testament scholarship that spends more time on extrabiblical sources than on the inspired text itself.<br />Schreiner's stance is decidedly conservative and Reformed, yet not to the point of Scripture twisting or skewing exegesis. There is a real freshness to this book, in that it avoids flattening Paul's theology into an emphasis on only one theme (such as justification, union with Christ, or reconciliation), but rather emphasizes all of these themes in relation to the central motif of God's glory as revealed in Christ. The glory of God in Christ is the sun in Paul's theological solar system and the planets of justification, union with Christ, reconciliation, et cetera all orbit around this one glorious center.<br />While Schreiner's exegesis is fresh, it is not a departure from historic Protestantism. Schreiner does NOT teach justification by works. But he does understand the already/not yet nature of God's salvific work. There are dimensions of salvation that are yet to be realized by God's people and the Scriptures represent perseverance in faith and obedience as a necessary corollary to final deliverance. But even our perseverance in faith and obedience are the direct result of God's effectual work within us, so all is of grace.<br />Another unique feature in Schreiner's work is his emphasis on Paul's suffering as a crucial means of fulfilling his mission. In fact, Schreiner does a wonderful job of weaving Paul's theology into the missionary context in which it was originally framed. This adds a personal dimension to the book and will help students avoid the danger of abstracting Paul's theology from real life.<br />This is an excellent book that I heartily recommend. The Christian church should thank the Lord for such gifted scholars as Thomas Schreiner and both scholars and pastors should take advantage of this labor of love.rd for such gifted scholars as Thomas Schreiner and both scholars and pastors should take advantage of this labor of love.	2003-05-21

Piper shows that sinners are made right with God through the righteousness of Christ which is credited to them. That this is being challenged to me today is mind-boggling. Why do people want to destroy such good news? Why wrestle against what is so lucid and clear and Scriptural? Well, the threats are there and John Piper has faced them. Chapter one describes the many personal reasons in family, church, culture, and the nations why this issue is so important. Chapters two and three set out the challenge to this doctrine and defend the truth exegetically. Piper is polite to his opponent (Robert Gundry) and honest with his arguments.

But that does not mean the scholarship is one-sided. The Jesus Seminar is representative of New Testament scholarship in the same way that The National Enquirer is representative of professional journalism! Strobel knows this and did not bother.

Understanding that the Holy Spirit's regenerating work in a person's life is powerfully transforming, Lawson focuses on nine &quot;vital signs&quot; of the new birth. There is absolutely no compromise of the historic Protestant doctrine of &quot;sola fide&quot; (salvation through faith alone), for Lawson understands what the Reformers taught, namely that the faith which justifies also sanctifies and that we are saved by faith alone, but not by a faith that is alone. Lawson is totally in harmony with &quot;sola fide.&quot; But more importantly, he is in harmony with Scripture. This book is filled with exposition of specific passages of Scripture, especially the book of I John. No true believer risks a loss of assurance from reading this book. And for those with a sham profession or an ungrounded assurance, this book may be the very means God will use to bring them to true faith in Jesus Christ.

They are good books, more like literary fiction than the cheap paperback novels that clutter so many shelves. Tolkien's attention to detail in describing the various cultures, peoples, locales, and languages of Middle-Earth is amazing. The multitude of encyclopedias and histories written on this fictional world attest to the genius and creativity of Tolkien and the magnitude of his creative achievement. But the story is interesting, too, with a complex plot, lovable characters, and high adventure. The protagonists are real heroes (especially Frodo and Sam) demonstrating loyalty, courage, integrity, and purity of heart. The line between good and evil is clearly drawn and the magic and violence is not graphic. Parents need not fear allowing their children to pore through these books.

I am actually still working through this large volume and find it to be a regular source of nourishment for my soul. There is an amazing grasp of Scripture in Bounds' writings and not nearly as much repetition as one might think. Bounds wrote with a fiery pen. If you want to be set aflame to burn in prayer, let this book ignite you.	2002-11-10

It is the best theological study on perseverance, assurance, and eternal security that I have ever read. For fellow John Piper fans, this book is the academic counterpart to Future Grace. What Future Grace (a book I call a \\"field manual for living the Christian life\\") does practically, The Race Set Before Us does on a more scholarly level (but make no mistake, it is also intensely practical, if you care about making it to heaven!).<br />Schreiner and Caneday build this book around the biblical metaphor of running a race. An outline of the contents: chapter 1 answers \\"what is there to win or lose?\\" Is it merely earthly blessings or eternal rewards, or is eternal life itself? Chapter 2 is a crucial look at \\"our present and future salvation.\\" This chapter is paradigm shifting, as the authors look at the many facets of salvation and pull them together into one unified reality. Chapter 3 is on \\"the necessity of obedient faith\\" and examines the various biblical metaphors for faith. Excellent! Chapter 4 is probably the most important chapter in the book, examining the nature of biblical warnings. Chapter 5 reflects on fallen runners and the nature of apostasy. Chapter 6 looks at how to finish the race by grace. Chapter 7 is on assurance and chapter 8 on \\"who are those who run to the end and win?\\" dealing with unconditional election.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough. Pastors need to read this. It takes a person deep into the fabric of Scripture, modeling careful and precise exegesis. One of the most important sermons I preached this year was born from this study. I urge you to get this book and mine these truths for yourself!	2002-11-09

John Newton, the converted slave-trader who penned Amazing Grace, is a model in &quot;habitual tenderness&quot; towards the hurting (most notably the manic-depressive poet William Cowpoer). Charles Simeon is lesser known, but proves to be a powerful demonstration of endurance in the face of almost unrelenting opposition and affliction. His endurance was rooted primarily in his high view of God and his low view of self (what a word for the self-esteem gurus filling America's pulpits today!!). Finally, William Wilberforce, the greatest instrument God used in the abolishment of slavery in Britain, is studied, along with the doctrine which gave him strength and moved him into action (the doctrine is justification by faith). This is a great book and very encouraging. Highly recommended.	2002-11-09

Piper sounds a clarion call for pastors to chunk professionalized ministry for the radical and humble, self-denying and soul-satisfying, culture-threatening and person-redeeming ministry commended in Scripture. \\"The more professional we long to be, the more spiritual death we will leave in our wake,\\" Piper warns. This comes from the first of thirty chapters that chart for us how to cultivate radical, biblical ministry. Piper tells us to make God's glory central, pursue our joy in Him, go hard after God in prayer, labor over the Scriptures, read great books, study great lives, and emphasize soul-saving truths. This book is full of clear-thinking about both doctrinal issues (like eternal security) and ethical issues (like abortion), and the clear-thinking is joined with a hot-hearted passion for God, holiness, the Word, eternity, and the perishing. Brothers, this is a great book. If you want to be God's man for such a time as this, then get it, read it, meditate on it, pray over it, and above all, live it. God help us.	2002-11-09

I have read few books that have been more helpful in the realm of practical church life. Warren skillfully presents a blue-print on how to grow a healthy in church in which the five purposes (which are presented Biblically) of worship, discipleship, fellowship, ministry, and evangelism are held in balance. The steps to take are practical and clear. Add to that a plethora of helpful common-sense tips to improving logistics in working with both the visitors and members of your church. This book is full of helpful ideas.<br />HOWEVER, the demerit of the book is its rather shallow Biblical basis. I believe that the five purposes Warren presents are biblical. I believe that the concept of moving people from membership to maturity to ministry to missions is biblical and very, very well developed. And I was impressed to see that Warren's church uses a church covenant and practices church discipline. I simply wish he had given a better biblical defense for these things. There are points where it seems like the author is taking Scripture out of context to defend a point - evidenced by his excessive use of paraphrases of Scripture. He should have used a literal translation and stuck to what the text actually says.<br />I also highly disagree with Warren's approach to music. He probably goes a bit overboard on the seeker-sensitive side of things, although I admit many of the things he says are non-moral, non-biblical, common-sense issues.<br />I was helped by reading this book. I have the sense to know that I can't apply everything Warren says in my own church culture and tradition, but there are some things any one can apply. I say, buy this book and read with discernment. As long as you don't make a Bible out of it, you will probably benefit greatly.	2001-10-09

I have found this book so encouraging and instructive. Though it was written primarily for women, I have found great help in it. I think every Christian would benefit from the practical Biblical teaching that Nancy DeMoss gives. Very few, if any, leaves are left unturned. Extended time is given to issues such as obstacles to overcome, dealing with distractions, preparing our hearts for devotion, time in the Word, and both praise and prayer. Each chapter ends with a &quot;Making It Personal&quot; section, giving a list of application questions, and a testimony relating to the devotional life from other Christian women such as Elisabeth Elliot, Joni Erickson Tada, and Kay Arthur.<br />This book has added meaning to me, because I was on staff with Life Action Ministries for three years and know Nancy DeMoss personally. Her testimony regarding her father's consistency in daily devotions had an impact on me in 1994. I also remember her own personal testimony in 1995 when the Lord did a lot of the ground-breaking work in her life in this area (this book being one of the results!). She is a special Christian woman with a special message to ladies of this generation. Men, this would be a great gift for your wives! (Ladies, reading and applying this would be a great gift to your husbands!) Highly recommended!	2001-08-21

This is the best one I have ever read on the former subject.<br />J. Oswald Sanders left us with a true spiritual classic on what it means to embody the Biblical qualities of true godliness. I found this to be a very FULL book, with incredible insights packed into short epigrammatic sentences which are pregnant with meaning. It demands to be re-read.<br />Spiritual issues are examined from several different angles as Sanders unfolds the Biblical criterion for leaders chapter by chapter. It seemed to me like the book gets better and better as it goes. The two chapters dealing with &quot;Qualities Essential to Leadership&quot; (discipline, vision, wisdom, decision, courage, humility, integrity/sincerity, humor, anger, patience, friendship, tact/diplomacy, inspirational power, executive ability, the therapy of listening, and the art of letter writing - quite an interesting list!) are worth their weight in gold.<br />Several chapters that immediately attacted my attention were &quot;The Leader and His Praying,&quot; &quot;The Leader and His Time,&quot; and &quot;The Leader and His Reading&quot; - all three instructive and inspiring. Other beneficial chapters deal with the fullness of the Spirit, the cost of leadership, delegation, tests of true leadership, replacement and reproduction of leaders, and perils of the leader (a powerful chapter with a dynamic little section called &quot;Prophet or Leader?&quot;).<br />Get this book and devour it - especially those of you who are pastors, elders, teachers, and deacons. Any one involved in roles of spiritual leadership should read this book.	2001-07-09

Open-theism has been attacking this vital doctrine of God's omniscience and Bruce Ware kindly, yet firmly, puts his exegetical skill to work in defense of exhaustive divine foreknowledge.<br />The strength of this book is it's expository method. Ware doesn't build straw men to tear down. He seriously and honestly interacts with the writings of Open-theists like Greg Boyd, Clark Pinnock, and John Sanders, answering their arguments from texts which apparently support openness theology and also presenting the full gammit of Biblical passages which most open-theists fail to mention, such as Isaiah 41:21-29, 42:8-9, 43:8-13, 44:6-8, 44:24-28, 45:20-23, 46:8-11, 48:3-8, and 48:14-16. Just a brief perusal of those texts should reveal the many holes in open-theism. Questions of God's immutability and &quot;repentance&quot; are also handled with care and answered well, in my opinion.<br />Reading this book helped me understand what attracts some people to open-theism - namely, the idea that suffering happens outside of God's knowledge and will. Some people seem to derive comfort from the idea that God is as surprised by the calamity which befalls us as we are. Personally, I find this concept totally unbiblical and without much comfort to offer. Open-theism's god is like a crippled king with a good heart, not an all-wise and all-powerful Sovereign who must be trusted by us. He is like a handicapped friend who empathizes with us, but cannot really help us. Open-theism puts God in a wheel-chair. I have experienced trials (as have we all) when I didn't fully understand why God had allowed it or what He was doing at the time. I suppose there are some questions that won't be answered this side of heaven. But I find much more comfort in believing that &quot;behind a frowning Providence, He hides a smiling face,&quot; than I would if I believed that God didn't know what was going on any sooner than I did.<br />It boils down to this. Either the Bible teaches that God actually has all knowledge of all things - past, present, and future - including the free choices of men, angels, and demons and all the sin and suffering which results from those choices - and has a purpose in permitting it all to happen as He does; OR, the Bible teaches that God is less than this: a kind-hearted but straight-jacketed despot who feels our pain but won't interfere because He exalts free-will above His own wisdom. I'm convinced that the Bible teaches the former, not the latter. Ware gives a good defense. If you are wrestling with the issue, I highly recommend this book.iling face,&quot; than I would if I believed that God didn't know what was going on any sooner than I did.<br />It boils down to this.

So God granted him what he requested.&quot; (I Chronicles 4:10 NKJV).<br />This prayer is the basis for this short, but powerful little book (hence the slogan &quot;little books, big change&quot;), which records the adventures in prayer of Bible-teacher, author, and founder of Walk Through the Bible Ministries, Bruce Wilkinson.<br />Wilkinson takes the Jabez prayer as a model for seeking God for a life of blessing, strength, and protection in ministry. Woven into his interesting Scriptural insights are accounts of numerous experiences Wilkinson has had of God's blessing in his ministry.<br />I found this book helpful, in that it encourages big (though not necessarily long) praying for God's blessing in our lives. I do not see this in the &quot;health/wealth/prosperity&quot; genre of books. It is closer to the &quot;Christian Hedonism&quot; that John Piper so well unpacks in &quot;Desiring God.&quot; Wilkinson is encouraging us to seek God's blessing in our spiritual lives, through service to Him - not in material blessings.<br />Perhaps the book suffers from a few overstatements, like God &quot;always&quot; answers this prayer, etc. Maybe, maybe not. Sometimes God does NOT answer our prayers as we expect, even when they are good. There is also some deviant theology underlying a statement in chapter four, which says that &quot;your loyal heart is the only part of His expansion plan that He will not provide.&quot; Strange statement for a book so dedicated to exalting God's power to work through our lives! But despite this, I think the book is valuable.	2001-05-22

At the time, it was very impactful for me. I was especially blessed by seeing the difference between chastening and pruning.<br />Wilkinson uses John 15 and the analogy of the Vine and Branches to develop three basic principles for Christian living, which he names \\"Secrets of the Vine.\\" Starting with the premise that there are four levels of fruit-bearing in the lives of all Christians (barrenness, fruit, more fruit, and much fruit), coupled with the presupposition that every branch spoken of in John 15 is a true believer, Wilkinson teaches:<br />1. If your life consistently bears no fruit, God will intervene to DISCIPLINE you.<br />2. If your life bears some fruit, God will intervene to PRUNE you.<br />3. If your life bears a lot of fruit, God will invite you to ABIDE more deeply with him.<br />The book is pretty much built around these three concepts: disciplining (chastening), pruning, and abiding. There is no doubt that there is much truth here. God DOES discipline his sinning children who for a season may not bear fruit, as Hebrews 12 makes clear. (But I am not absolutely convinced that this is what John 15:2 is describing.) Again, God DOES prune (or purge) his children, as the text makes clear. And Wilkinson does well in drawing distinctions between chastening and pruning. They are not the same. It is also true that we have a command to \\"abide\\" in Christ. But I think all Christians will do this to some degree, whereas Wilkinson seems to think that many, if not most, Christians never attain to \\"abiding.\\" I think he may go wrong here, not in his description of Christian experience(for it is without dispute that there can be vastly different degrees of closeness in people's relationships with the Lord), but in his interpretation of this particular passage.<br />There are some subtle theological beliefs which seem to be underlying this book, which I think are dangerous. Wilkinson seems to believe that it is possible to have Jesus as Savior, but not as Lord,and that perseverance in faith is not essential to eternal security (hence, the author's denial that John 15:6 refers to hell), and that there are \\"levels\\" in the Christian life (the old higher/deeper/fuller Christian life myth popularized by Keswick).<br />For a balance check out: D. A. Carson's Commentary on John: he gives a better interpretation of these verses. See also John MacArthur in &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus&quot; chapter 15. And to combat the Keswick-type deeper-life teaching, see Packer's &quot;Keep In Step With the Spirit.&quot; I think the teaching in these books is more true to Scripture.<br />HOWEVER, (to be fair) I will say (though I was quite surprised to see it) that A. W. Pink takes essentially the same interpretation that Wilkinson does. But Pink's Exposition of John was written in the early portion of his ministry and may reflect a position which he eventually discarded.<br />Anyway, with all of that said, I enjoyed my reading of this book. It has some very good lessons for us. I just wish Wilkinson had grounded it in a more accurate exegesis of Scripture.re dangerous.

Troubled by the lack of commitment in so many professed conversions to Christ, John MacArthur penned a desperately needed study of the Gospel, as it was given by Christ Himself. Showing how Jesus heralds, illustrates, explains, and fulfills His Gospel, MacArthur recovers the historic - and Biblical - gospel that demands not just an intellectual assent to the historical facts of the gospel, but transformation of the heart, repentance from sin, and surrender to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. This is the best book dealing with the parables of Christ that I have seen. It packs a wallop, and is likely to leave some readers angry, but for those who wish to honestly face the radical demands of the Jesus in the Bible, it is a breath of fresh air!	2001-04-21

There is a balancing truth that is not written here, namely, that there is an Almighty and Sovereign God exercising control over all things (see my review of A. W. Pink's \\"The Sovereignty of God\\"). But as far as it goes, the basic point that we must be proactive and not reactive, is good.<br />2. Covey helped me crystallize my sense of purpose in life. Imagining my funeral and writing a Personal Mission Statement (Habit 2 - Begin with the End in Mind) were immensely helpful exercises for me. But again, \\"A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps\\" (Prov. 16:9).<br />3. From Habit 3, \\"Put First Things First,\\" I really learned how to work through priorities. The urgent/important paradigm was extremely helpful to me. I think of it often in my day-to-day activities. Covey even succeeds in helping a person identify what some of those priorities should be. But he falls short in that he advocates \\"a principle-centered life\\" rather than a \\"God-centered life\\" (see my review of John Piper's \\"God's Passion For His Glory.\\")<br />4. The final habit (Sharpen the Saw) is just common sense. It is smart to exercise, relax, learn, and pursue spiritual vitality. And sometimes it must be planned.<br />The second triad of habits (Think Win/Win; Seek First to Understand, then to be Understood; and Synergize) were less helpful to me, but still worth reading. The emphasis on taking initiative and seeking creative options in relationships was helpful to me.<br />There are some dangers in this book.<br />1. It can lead a person to self-sufficiency. This is crippling to the Christian whose sufficiency must be found in the Lord Jesus Christ alone. We must be careful when reading this kind of material, lest we adopt an \\"I can do it\\" mentality which fosters pride and alienates us from God.<br />2. There is no objective foundation of reality behind this book and no standard except Covey's assimilation of the wisdom of the ages. I think Covey probably assumes the reality of God (I don't remember for sure), but there is no definition of who this God is what He is like. To me, if there is a God, then He must define all things and life must be centered around Him.<br />3. Covey could have said everything in about 150-200 less pages. Seven Habits is wordy and repetitive.<br />I have chosen to rate this book in the middle - three stars. I will not give it five stars because there are some profound philosophical and theological differences between Covey and myself (and more importantly, between Covey and the Bible). I will not give it one star because I was helped by the book and I think that thoughtful, Bible-saturated, God-centered leaders can sharpen their personal leadership skills through a cautious reading of this book.

The common thread joining the lives of these three men is suffering. Hence the subtitle: &quot;the fruit of affliction in the lives of ...&quot;<br />Piper gives us a good introduction to Bunyan, the tinker turned Baptist preacher who spent twelve years in Bedford jail in the 1600's because he wouldn't promise to quit preaching. Bunyan was also the author of The Pilgrim's Progress - probably the most widely-read Christian book besides the Bible ever published. Piper shows how Bunyan learned the secret to enduring suffering by &quot;seeing God who is invisible.&quot; This sketch is a great encouragement to persevere.<br />The second biography is of a different sort, looking at the life of the melancholy poet, William Cowper, who authored the best hymn on God's providence ever written, &quot;God Moves in a Mysterious Way.&quot; Cowper's life was checkered with depression, insanity, and multiple suicide attempts - a strange candidate for a Christian hero. Yet, Piper shows how through John Newton's tireless encouragement, Cowper managed to find windows of hope in his all but despair-filled life. It is a sad story, but an encouraging one. Those who appreciate poetry and the agony of soul that often breeds it, will appreciate this sketch of Cowper.<br />The third sketch covers the life of David Brainerd, the Yale student who was expelled for an untimely word, and became a missionary to the Indians. Despite tuberculosis and harsh living conditions, Brainerd pressed on in the wearisome labor of translation and preaching for the conversion of dozens of Indians. Drawing from the diary and journal compiled by Jonathan Edwards, Piper shows how Brainerd's fasting, prayer, and study helped sustain him through unmitigated suffering and affliction in the work of evangelizing the heathen - and how his example has inspired generations of missionaries (William Carey, Henry Martyn, and Jim Elliot to name a few) ever since. Brainerd's great passion was well expressed in his own words: &quot;O that I may not loiter in my heavenly journey!&quot; What an example.<br />These biographical masterpieces were first delivered as lectures at the Bethlehem Conference for Pastors at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Dr. Piper pastors. The audio cassettes are available from their ministry outreach (web site). I recommend these without reserve to those who want to be encouraged in the midst of suffering for the sake of the Kingdom.and how his example has inspired generations of missionaries (William Carey, Henry Martyn, and Jim Elliot to name a few) ever since.

Missions exists because worship doesn't. Worship therefore is the goal of missions. But even more than that, the impetus behind true missionary zeal is a heart that is satisfied in the glory of God above all things. Therefore, worship is also the fuel of missions.<br />Then Piper shows the key role that prayer plays in missionary effort. Prayer is a wartime walkie-talkie given by our Commander-in-Chief so that we can call Him for air cover when we are on the frontlines of the battle. The problem with most of us is that we have turned this wartime walkie-talkie into a domestic intercom by asking for more worldy comforts instead of help for Kingdom work.<br />A third chapter (in part one) shows the role that suffering plays in missions by expositing texts like Col. 1:24. This is a powerful and insightful section that will inspire and encourage you - as well as make you count the cost of following Jesus down the hard road of love.<br />The second part of the book deals with theological issues that are essential to a Biblical understanding of missions, such as the eternality of hell, the necessity of the atonement, and the necessity of faith in Christ for salvation. This book is a Calvinistic call to missions that exceeds anything I have ever read elsewhere! I recommend it heartily!	2001-03-17
US	49494617	R2THCAHWYFC938	0807014265	885790086	Man's Search for Meaning	Books	3	27	52	N	N	Nice superstructure, weak foundation	Jewish German psychiatrist, Viktor Frankl, fathered the \\"Third School of Viennese Psychiatry,\\" known \\"logotherapy.\\" This book introduces his philosophy as he tells the gripping account of his three years in the Nazi death camps World War II.<br />Frankl wrote seventeen volumes in German on the principles of logotherapy which he weaves into this short book, so it is difficult to summarize his philosophy in a review! Nevertheless, most basic to logotherapy is Frankl's strong conviction that man is responsible. I agree. Unfortunately, the great defect of Frankl's system is the lack of objective ground given for this responsibility! Humans are responsible, yes. But to what or who? Frankl fails to answer this. Logotherapy is then essentially a humanized moralism-better than the nihilism which was bred by Neitzsche,but still short of what men really need.<br />The following paragraph represents the strength and contribution of logotherapy to the field of psychiatrics: \\"We who lived in<br />concentration camps can remember the men who walked through huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"<br />This is also the essence of the proactivity which Stephen Covey commends in Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book in which I first learned of Frankl. In and of itself, this concept is good. But concepts cannot be divorced from a world-view. And a world-view which isn't built on objective reality is faulty.<br />According to Frankl, the basic motivation in man is \\"the striving to find a meaning in one's life\\" - notice he says a meaning, and not meaning. He didnt' believe it was possible to define meaning generally for all people: \\"The meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day, and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.\\"<br />Frankl's attempt to relieve the \\"existential frustration\\" of human beings fails to deliver right here; for though a subjectively perceived meaning may help a person endure suffering (as it did him), this meaning may have no objective ground in reality, and thus be REALLY meaningless after all, leaving the person deluded and deceived. Frankl says, \\"self-actualization cannot be attained if it is made an end in itself, but only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.\\" But is not self-transcendence impossible if there is no objective reality which is transcendent?! Logotherapy leaves us to ourselvs after all.<br />According to Frankl's philosphy, one can discover meaning in life in one of three ways: \\"by doing a deed, by experiencing a value [such as love], or by suffering.\\" Unfortunately, logotherapy fails to connect deeds, experiences, or suffering to anything objective; God is virtually absent.<br />Having said all of this, commendable in the book is Frankl's conviction that liberty be balanced with responsibility:  \\"freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.\\" True.<br />I also commend Frankl's rejection of pure naturalism:<br />\\"there is a danger inherent in the teaching of man's `nothingbutness,' the theory that man is nothing but the result of biological, psychological and sociological conditions, or the product of heredity and environment. Such a view of man makes him into a robot, not a human being. This neurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free.\\" Thus, Darwin and Freud both suffer from Frankl's analysis.<br />Of interest is Frankl's description of logotherapy as a technique, where he discusses \\"anticipatory anxiety\\" and its cure, \\"parodoxical intention.&quot; This sounded a lot like reverse psychology to me!<br />I'm not a psychiatrist or the son of a psychiatrist,but I am a pastor, a theologian, and an amateur philosopher; and in my judgment, Frankl leaves us with some helpful principles, but they are like a beautiful superstructure with no foundation, and thus, shaky. Man's search for meaning will ultimately fail if it does't terminate in the purpose for which human beings are created,namely, \\"to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.\\" Though Frankl has some good thoughts, I still prefer Saint Augustine who prayed to God: \\"Thou hast made us for thyself, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in Thee.\\" That is where meaning in life is ultimately found.que, where he discusses \\"anticipatory anxiety\\" and its cure, \\"parodoxical intention.&quot; This sounded a lot like reverse psychology to me!<br />I'm not a psychiatrist or the son of a psychiatrist,but I am a pastor, a theologian, and an amateur philosopher; and in my judgment, Frankl leaves us with some helpful principles, but they are like a beautiful superstructure with no foundation, and thus, shaky.

Now that I have read it all, I can say that this may be the best systematic theology written in the 20th century.<br />Dr. Grudem combines theological insight, practical application, and faithful exegesis of Scripture with simple, uncomplicated language and clear thinking. The result? The most readable and informative Systematic Theology one could desire. Every chapter starts with a question and ends with application questions and a hymn! Education is turned into exaltation over and over again as Grudem moves you from deep thinking to appropriate feeling about the greatest truths in the universe.<br />The arrangement of topics is typical. Grudem covers the doctrine of God, man, Christ, salvation, church, and last things. Like any book of this magnitude, it has strengths and weaknesses. But the strengths are more than the weaknesses. The section on theology proper (the doctrine of God) is outstanding. Grudem's explanation of the Trinity is very helpful avoiding both modalism and arianism. His treatment of God's character and attributes is especially good, arguing strongly against the &quot;open&quot; view of God and process theology.<br />The chapters on Creation and Providence are also very well-done containing lengthy Scriptural arguments for his position. His soteriology is Reformed and not much different than you would get from Berkhof or Murray. Still good, though.<br />Grudem spends much time discussing the Holy Spirit (though the chapters are scattered around the book and not in one section)and especially the church. His understanding of the nature of the church is excellent avoiding denominationalism, yet affirming a very Biblically-grounded argument for plural elders governing a congregational church. He is baptistic in polity, though not dogmatic on the issue. He believes that charismatic gifts are still current in the church today, but is wary of extremes. Whether one agrees with Grudem or not on this issue, he should be read, because he approaches the subject from a scholarly standpoint with supreme concern for the text of Scripture. One can't afford to neglect his arguments in forming their opinions (I still somewhat unsettled on many questions relating to this and so do not write from a bias.)<br />On last things, Grudem defends historic premillenialism and presents some thoughtful arguments to both amillenialism and dispensational pre-tribulation premillenialists. He should be read here. But again, he proceeds with caution.<br />The weakest chapter of the book is the one on the Atonement. Although Grudem provides some excellent scholarship on the question of Christ's &quot;descent into hell&quot; here, there is a lack of depth in his treatment of this most glorious doctrine. Berkhof and Gill are better.<br />Overall this is an excellent book. It's greatest strength is its textual basis. Grudem's chief concern is to be Scriptural and for the most part he succeeds well. You don't have to be a theologian to read this book. But you will become a theologian if you do.rent in the church today, but is wary of extremes.

The book is really a lengthy meditation and application of Psalm 52:7. which says &quot;I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.&quot; From this text, Flavel derives his &quot;doctrine&quot; (falling in line with typical Puritan sermon-structure): &quot;It is the duty of the saints, especially in times of straits, to reflect upon the performances of Providence for them in all the states and through all the stages of their lives.&quot;<br />This theme is then unfolded in in a three-part treatise, covering 1. The Evidence of Providence, in which Flavel seeks to prove and demonstrate the reality of God's Providential care over the lives of believers by looking at such things as birth, upbringing, conversion, employment, family affairs, preservation from evil, and sanctification; 2. Meditation on the Providence of God, where the author shows that it is our duty to meditate on Providence, directs in how to do this, and then covers ten advantage to gained from this practice; and 3. Application of the Doctrine of Providence, in which the practical implications of the doctrine are considered and the problems and questions arising in peoples minds are answered.<br />I personally found the first half of the book to be a little more laborious than the latter half. From about chapter eight onwards, the book was full of good and clear instruction. Flavel differs from many other Puritan authors I have read. He is not as witty and colorful as Thomas Brooks, as practical as Thomas Manton, as astute as Stephen Charnock, or as experiential as John Owen - but he has merits to commend him. He lived a difficult life in which he knew first hand how to rely on God's sovereignty in his life, and his work cultivates a greater awareness of God's mercy, trust in God's wisdom, and resignation to God's will in one's life. I would recommend it.mend it.	2000-12-07

Pink (The Sovereignty of God, Spiritual Growth, The Life of David, etc.). His letters will be no less rewarding. This collection of letters, written between the years 1924 and 1951, address all kinds of practical subjects such as methods of Bible study, seeking God's will for decision making, seeking a marriage-partner, developing spiritual character, etc. There are also numerous insights into the author's views on such subjects as supralapsarianism, premillenialism, the Christian's role in war, and the state of religion in the first half of the twentieth century. Other interesting nuggets in this book include Pink's recommendations of good books and authors and some clues about his personal life - interests, routine, relationships, personality, etc. While some might raise their eyebrows at some of the &quot;prickly&quot; statements made by Pink, no mature believer will walk away from these letters without a deeper appreciation for the wisdom and maturity of the Godly man who wrote them. Highly recommended.	2000-12-01

Perkins explicates the several principles for interpreting and expounding the Scriptures and then gives detailed instruction on how to apply the same. The chapter on &quot;Use and Application&quot; will give readers the background behind the familiar Puritan sermon structure of &quot;Doctrine and Use.&quot;<br />Parts Two and Three deal with &quot;The Calling of the Ministry.&quot; They are really nothing more than the exposition of two Old Testament passages of Scripture, Job 33 and Isaiah 6. Many interesting and practical issues are handled here including how a minister might know his calling and what his responsibilities are to God's people. Perkins had a high view of the dignity and authority of the ministerial gift which is sadly lacking among evangelicals today. While some of his ideas will seem foreign and perhaps a little extreme to many, it is certain that his emphasis will help balance our opposite extremes.<br />Perkins is not the best Puritan author that I have read, nor is this book the most helpful book on preaching I have encountered. But it was worth while. Incidentally - for those who are checking out this title hoping to get a Puritan perspective on the charismatic understanding of the gift of prophesy, the following quote well summarizes Perkins' view: &quot;I am not here making any allowance for the claims people make that they have received 'revelations'. These have no substance; they are either dreams of their own, or illusions of the devil. They despise both human learning and the study of the Scriptures, and trust exclusively in 'revelations of the Spirit'. But God's Spirit does not work except on the foundation of the Word.&quot; Such was the Puritan understanding of those who claimed extra-Biblical revelation. By &quot;prophesy&quot; Perkins understood &quot;preaching.&quot; And that is what this book is about.except on the foundation of the Word.&quot; Such was the Puritan understanding of those who claimed extra-Biblical revelation.

While strongly defending justification by faith alone apart from works, he avoids both legalism and antinomianism. The sermon is structured well,though laden with some very complex reasoning and it is thoroughly Scriptural and evangelical. But be prepared to think!<br />  For a synopsis, Edwards' &quot;doctrine&quot; is that &quot;we are justified only by faith in Christ, and not by any manner of virtue or goodness of our own.&quot; This truth he unfolds by I. Explaining the meaning of it; II. Considering the evidence of the truth of it; III. Showing how evangelical obedience is concerned in it (a most helpful section); IV. Answering objections; and V. Considering the importance of it. I would encourage readers to read ALL of this book before forming ANY opinions about it. You need to follow Edwards reasoning all the way through to the end and let him deal with the most likely objections you will have(and which he anticipates!).<br />One of the most valuable quotations of all is this: \\"God, in the act of justification, which is passed on a sinner's first believing, has respect to perseverance, as being virtually contained in the first act of faith; and it is looked upon, and taken by him that justifies, as being as it were a property in that faith.\\" Or, to paraphrase John Piper  &quot;God sees the oak tree of perseverance in the acorn of the first act of saving faith.&quot; That insight alone is worth the price of the whole book - but of course, there is much, much more gold to mine in Edwards, and in this sermon in especially.him that justifies, as being as it were a property in that faith.\\" Or, to paraphrase John Piper  &quot;God sees the oak tree of perseverance in the acorn of the first act of saving faith.&quot; That insight alone is worth the price of the whole book - but of course, there is much, much more gold to mine in Edwards, and in this sermon in especially.	2000-11-28

It carries the fragrance of the inner sanctuary, being written by one who was obviously acquainted with the glories of God's presence in the secret place.<br />This warm-hearted Scotsman covers the subject in eight  excellent chapters, which not only provide wonderful examples of prayer, and moving incentives for prayer, but also helpful instructions regarding prayer. The first chapter deals with &quot;The Life of Prayer,&quot; and particularly the arduous nature of prayer. This will encourage the one who feels weary in well-doing. Don't give up! Chapter two, on &quot;The Equipment,&quot; deals with the necessity of a quiet place, a quiet time, and a quiet heart, with special instruction on how to cultivate the latter (a. &quot;recognize our acceptance before God through the dying of the Lord Jesus;&quot; b. &quot;confess and receive the enabling grace of the Divine Spirit;&quot; and c. &quot;in the beginning of our supplications to direct our hearts toward the Holy Scriptures.&quot;) This chapter has much with which to feed the soul. The third chapter covers &quot;The Direction of the Mind&quot; with three helpful directives for your concentration: I. realize the presence of God; II. be honest (and real) in your dealings with God; and III. come in faith. Chapters four through six deal with three aspects of our engagement with God: worship, confession, and requests. Each chapter is rich and eloquent. And Chapters 7-8 cover the rewards of prayer: &quot;The Hidden Riches of the Secret Place&quot; and &quot;The Open Recompense.&quot;<br />I have read this twice now and it is still worthy of another thorough reading - in fact, I've placed it on my &quot;Master Book List&quot; - a short list of books which I would like to master in my life-time. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who is serious about God.	2000-11-28

It is less than 100 pages long (in my copy!), but it is packed with some of the most insightful thinking regarding sanctification, that I have ever read. Owen packs much into this brief book leaving hundreds of rocks just turned over for the reader to search out treasures for himself. There are nine preliminary steps to mortifying sin which were of great practical help to me. They are: 1. Consider the dangerous symptoms of your lust; 2. Get a clear sense of the guilt and danger of the sin; 3. Load your conscience with the guilt of the \\"perplexing distemper\\"; 4. Have a vehement desire for deliverance; 5. Determine whether the sin is rooted in your natural temperment; 6. Prevent the opportunites for sin; 7. Vigorously oppose the first actings of sin; 8. Think deeply about the majesty of God; 9. Speak no peace to your own disquieted heart - let God speak it. These principles form the bulk of the book, but they are fenced in by strong opposition to all legalistic methods of dealing with sin and with hearty exhortations to focus on Christ and be empowered by the Spirit in the whole task of mortifying sin. An excellent treatment of the subject and worthy of repeated readings.

Let me introduce you to Packer's introduction - maybe you will be enticed to explore further . . .<br />Packer's twenty chapters are arranged under six headings,<br />I. The Puritans in Profile - which serves as a rich introduction to the Puritans themselves, examining the Puritan movement in its historical context and exploring the practical relevance that the Puritans have to our own age.<br />II. The Puritans and the Bible - explores the Bibliology of the Puritans, including both their view of the Divine inspiration and authority of Scripture and their method of interpreting the Bible, and ending on their view of conscience.<br />III. The Puritans and the Gospel - containing a stunning introduction to John Owen's book &quot;The Death of Death in the Death of Christ&quot; which seeks to show how what is known as Calvinism is more than five subpoints of theology, but really defines the whole of the gospel; also including a look at the doctrine of justification and its development and decline among the Puritans; and ending on the Puritan view of preaching the gospel.<br />IV. The Puritans and the Holy Spirit - a rich and rewarding study of the way in which Puritans understood the ministry of the Holy Spirit - especially in relationship to assurance (with much from Thomas Goodwin, Richard Sibbes, and Thomas Brooks), sanctification and communion with God (with much from John Owen), and spiritual gifts. Invigorating.<br />V. The Puritan Christian Life - an exploration of the Puritan perception of worship (a rich spiritual feast with much from Stephen Charnock and George Swinnock), how they crafted the observance of the Christian Sabbath (the Lord's Day) into what it became, and the Puritan ideals for marriage and family relationships.<br />VI. The Puritans in Ministry - three rich chapters dealing with preaching, evangelism, and revival - introducing the reader to such rich gold mines as the works of Richard Baxter and Jonathan Edwards. A rewarding section of the book.<br />Such is an overview. The chapters are well organized and written with clarity, precision, and Packer's characterstic fervor and creativity. The book is immensely interesting. There are hundreds of quotations from the best of the Puritan literature, and the spiritually minded reader will find his appetite whetted so as to hunger for the Puritans themselves.<br />I commend this book to every Christian, and especially every pastor, who wants to grow deeper in humility, broader in Scripture, and higher in worship.

Spurgeon Autobiography, Volume 2: The Full Harvest 1860-1892	Books	4	35	35	N	N	An Animated Autobiography	Second volume of Spurgeon's massive biography is actually an edition edited by Banner of Truth (the full unedited original is published by Pilgrim Press). It is excellent. Full of numerous anecdotes, sermon extracts, letters, and data written by Spurgeon, Susannah Spurgeon (his wife), and Joseph Harrald (his secretary), this book was a real treasure to me.<br />It commences where volume one left off, near the building of the Metropolitan Tabernacle, where for thirty years Spurgeon heralded the gospel of Christ to thousands. Many aspects of his life are broadly covered, including his literary efforts, the pastors college and other institutions, information regarding his home, his trips to Mentone, France, his numerous afflictions, and the Down-grade controversy. Much of this book is fun and delightful, all of it interesting - at least, to a Spurgeon fan.	2000-10-02

Hyper-Calvinism: The Battle for Gospel Preaching	Books	4	13	15	N	N	Getting the Gospel Right	Another very satisfying and enlightening book by Murray on Spurgeon's battle for historic, evangelical, biblical Calvinism amidst the hypercalvinism prevelant among Baptists in his day. Murray shows the progression of the controversy between Spurgeon and James Wells, using myriads of quotes from periodicals like Earthen Vessel and Gospel Standard, as well as Spurgeon's sermons.<br />A helpful chapter develops Spurgeon's \\"fourfold appeal to Scripture\\" against the hyper's errors: 1. The universal invitations of the gospel, 2. The warrant of faith in the commands of Christ; 3. The responsibility of all men; and 4. The love and benevolence of God to all men.<br />Another chapter shows how hypercalvism began with John Hussey, was systematized by John Gill, and was popularized by William Huntington. There are also numerous extracts and quotes by such people as John Brown and T. C. Hammond on aspects of the controversy.<br />Many professed Calvinists would take great offence to the tone of this book and would level criticism at both Murray and Spurgeon. But I think the fruit of Spurgeon's ministry testifies God's blessing. Excellent book.<br />I also read the attmpted rebuttal of the book called Calvin v. Hyper-Spurgeonism edited by James North and Hugh Williams. It contained a good sermon on I Tim. 2:4 by Calvin (countering Spurgeon's interpretation of the text), but the rest of the pamphlet betrayed a caustic and annoying spirit.	2000-10-02

Fourteen of those original chapters are included here, dealing with  three areas of concern: 1. Biblical Analyses, 2. Theological Issues, and 3.  Pastoral Reflections. Contributors include such renowned scholars,  theologians, and pastors as Thomas Schreiner, D.A. Carson, J. I. Packer,  John Piper, and Wayne Grudem.<br />The book commences with a very satisfying  look at the sovereignty of God in the Old Testament, worked out carefully  by Raymond Ortland Jr. Tom Schreiner's chapter on Romans 9 is likewise  excellent and persuasive. Piper's chapter &quot;Are There Two Wills in  God?&quot; is worthy of careful consideration for die-hard Calvinists. He  offers a reconciliation between sovereign election and God's desire for all  to be saved that is interesting . . . although I am not persuaded that his  interpretation of I Tim. 2:4 is correct! Wayne Grudem's careful study of  the Hebrews warning passages and the doctrine of perseverance is of special  value. I highly commend it. His arguments are convincing and (I think)  virtually impossible to refute. Packer's chapter on God's love is typically  clear and concise and witty - but maybe a little too short for a book of  this caliber. Carson's reflections on assurance offer food for thought by  tying the issue together with other pertinent areas of theology. Baugh's  look at foreknowledge and Schreiner's look at the Wesleyan doctrine of  prevenient grace are also of value. Sam Storms, Jerry Bridges, and Ed  Clowney offer helpful thoughts on the more pastoral issues.<br />The book is  of special value in that it interacts well with opposing views and  especially takes on Clark Pinnock and company who wrote &quot;The Grace of  God, the Will of Man&quot; which is an attempted defense of Arminian  theology. I think any theologian (from either side!) would benefit from a  careful perusal of these pages.careful perusal of these pages.	2000-08-25

This is one of the three most important books that Dr. Piper has given us.  Voted one of the top 100 books of the 20th century by World magazine, this  book focuses on the character of God by gazing through the lense of His  pleasures and delights. It is a thorough-going Calvinistic look at the  greatness and beauty of God with a passionate emphasis on prayer and  missions. Of great value is the chapter on obedience which shows how faith  and obedience are organically connected. Obedience is not just an optional  second stage of discipleship. It is essential to genuine faith. I  whole-heartedly recommend this book. If you want to delight yourself in the  Lord (Ps. 37:4), you could hardly choose a better starting point.	2000-08-12

This is the story of an earthly (though not worldly) man with a heavenly mind. Jim Elliot was a man  of passion and a man of prayer. This book chronicles his journey from  childhood in Oregon to college days at Wheaton to the mission field of  Ecuador where he eventually gave his life at age 28. Full of journal  excerpts and personal letters, one gets to know this great man's heart. His  struggles, his ambitions, his loves, his dreams - and his all-consuming  passion for Christ and His kingdom - gripped my heart as a teenager. This  man became my hero. If you want to know the man behind the motto &quot;he  is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose&quot;  this is the place to start. I highly recommend this book - especially to  Christian teenagers who want to give 100% to Jesus Christ.	2000-07-25

He masterfully unfolds the various aspects of the atonement with careful exegesis of Scripture. He Biblically defends the doctrine of particular  redemption and explains with clarity such difficult concepts as  propitiation, reconciliation, and redemption. Part two deals with the  application of redemption. Again, the arguments are developed exegetically  with precision and clarity. The chapters on justification and perseverance  are particularly insightful, and I think his understanding of the ordo  salutis is both logical and Biblical. This is one of the ten most  impactful, thought-shaping books that I have read. I heartilly commend it  to all pastors, theologians, and students of the Word.	2000-07-21

He issues forth the call for purposeful preaching, in which the &quot;telos&quot; of the  passage of Scripture in question is sought out, applied, and implemented  through creative textual preaching. Topics such as the preacher's stance,  outline, introductions, conclusions, invitations, illustrations,  counselling, and application are covered. Adams may be overly critical of  the traditional scholastic method of preaching (embodied by the English  Puritans) and the one gaping hole of the book is the lack of emphasis on  prayer and the ministry of the Holy Spirit, but there are some invaluable  principles to be gleaned as well. Of great help was the chapter on  &quot;Gathering Storytelling Materials&quot;, where Adams gives a plan by  which to learn how to illustrate starting in your study. He claims that six  months worth of preaching illustrations are to be found in the normal  study! Also of interest is his idea of a six-month preaching plan. Some  good books to balance this one are Preaching and Preachers by Martyn  Lloyd-Jones and The Supremacy of God in Preaching by John Piper.	2000-07-21

Martyn Lloyd-Jones said that he was &quot;tempted, perhaps foolishly, to  compare the Puritans to the Alps, Luther and Calvin to the Himalayas, and  Jonathan Edwards to Mount Everest!&quot; (The Puritans: Their Origins and  Successors, p. 355). I concur. Nothing in my library holds such a  storehouse of wealth, as do these two hefty tomes. Edwards was a brilliant  theologian, a zealous evangelist, an astute philosopher, a warm hearted  pastor, and an eye-witness (and one of the primary instruments causing) the  first Great Awakening. If you want theology at its richest go to Edwards'  &quot;End for Which God Created the World.&quot; IF you want a passion for  souls, read his &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.&quot; If you  are interested in well-articulated philosophy at its finest, peruse  &quot;The Nature of True Virtue.&quot; If you want biography geared to  cultivate godliness in your own heart, read &quot;The Life of David  Brainerd.&quot; If you want pastoral counsel concerning the state of your  soul, you will find nothing better than &quot;The Religious  Affections.&quot; And if you want to know what a REAL revival looks like,  study &quot;A Narrative of Surprising Conversions.&quot; (And those works  are less than half of what is in here!) If my house were burning, I would  probably grab for these two books second only to the Bible. To get Edwards  is to get theology. So get Edwards!	2000-07-19

This is a warm and encouraging book for preachers.  Dr. Lloyd-Jones delivered these lectures at Westminister Seminary in the  sixties (I think), but they are still relelvant today for the preacher that  is serious about his calling. Lloyd-Jones defends the primacy of preaching,  showing that there is not any substitute for it. He delves into the  preparation, shape, and form of the sermon and hits on such issues as  humor, invitations, and the congregation. Best of all is the last chapter  on &quot;Demonstration of the Spirit and of the Power&quot; which deals  with the sacred anointing of the Holy Spirit in preaching.

Stott approaches it from a different angle than many do. His aim is to show that preaching must connect two worlds - the Biblical world and the modern world. The image he uses is bridge-building, and the only bridge that is successfully built, is the one with an end firmly planted on both sides of the gap it attempts to span! Thus, this book encourages not only a firm grasp of the Scriptures, but a regular perusal of the newspaper . . . not because the two are equal in authority, but because the aim of the preacher is to bring the Bible to bear on the mind of the modern man. Other very interesting things are discussed - like the history of preaching, methods of study, and how to prepare sermons. An excellent resource for preachers and pastors!	2000-07-19

It is a thorough and insightful study of  Romans 9:1-23. No difficult questions are dodged. Dr. Piper carefully  exegetes the text (be prepared for technicalities!) and develops from it a  thoroughly robust doctrine of the righteousness of God, which he defines as  God's unwavering commitment to uphold and display the glory of His name.  This is the foundation of the doctrines of grace - even before the  sovereignty of God comes the glory of God.<br />To Arminian theology, this  book is a FOE (though it might become a FRIEND to open-minded Arminians  themselves!). Piper is kind to those he opposes and he fights for Biblical  theology with fierce allegiance to the text and an eye to the glory of God.  But he doesn't hold anything back. His arguments are like sharp  double-edged swords beaten out in the fires of exegesis and honed on the  anvil of meditation. No Arminian theologian has refuted it. Their swords  just aren't strong enough or sharp enough.<br />To Christian Hedonists, this  book is a FEAST! It is different from Piper's more popular books like  Desiring God and The Pleasures of God. It is not as easy to read. This book  is strong meat. But oh is it nourishing! If you want to know about the  theology that undergirds Desiring God, then this is the book to read.	2000-07-19

Gary Thomas delivers a thoughtful and provocative study of Christian spirituality through the eyes of the Christian mystics (Pascal, Fenelon, Teresa of Avila, John of  the Cross, Francis De Sales, John Climacus, William Law, and others). It is  a fresh book - not just a rehash of some other excellent books on the  disciplines. Thomas offers fresh insight on basic areas of the spiritual  quest -  such as: spiritual goals, holiness, humility, simplicity, the  remembrance of death, surrender, the seasons of the soul, and spiritual  direction (mentors). The book is laced with excellent quotations from the  authors listed above and many others. In fact, if someone wanted to glean  the best thinking of the mystics, while avoiding the sacramentalism that  crept into many of their writings, this would be a great place for it. But  more than a great survey of old literature, this book presents old truths  in such a way that all seekers of God will find benefit.	2000-07-15

If you are wondering where the foundation of John Piper's God-centered theology may be found, this book is a good starting point. In it, Piper reintroduces a theological masterpiece that is almost three hundred years  old - &quot;The End for which God Created the World&quot; by the New  England Puritan pastor, Jonathan Edwards. Piper's own book-length  introduction describes the impact Jonathan Edwards has had on his own life,  suggests the relevance that this book will have to our own culture, and  provides a brief, but helpful sketch of Jonathan Edwards' life. The work by  Edwards is then carefully broken down into numbered paragraphs and is  accompanied by Piper's helpful footnotes. Edwards' thesis is simple - God's  ultimate aim in everything He does is to uphold and display the glory of  His name for the joy of His people. This thesis is worked out with  iron-clad logic (be prepared to think!) and meditation on dozens of  Biblical passages. If yours is the prayer of Moses  - &quot;show me Thy  glory&quot; - then this is the book for you.	2000-07-15

This God-saturated pastor delivers  one of the most helpful and hopeful books on the power of sanctification  that I have ever come across. He commends what Chalmers called &quot;the  expulsive power of a new affection&quot; as the key to holiness. He shows  from Scripture that gratitude is NOT to be the primary motive for the  believer's pursuit of God, but rather &quot;faith in future grace&quot; (or  &quot;trusting in the promises of God,&quot; to use a less original  phrase!). This theology is defended from Scripture, illustrated through  countless anecdotes and quotes from the likes of C. H. Spurgeon, John  Flavel, and Jonathan Edwards, and is applied to various sin struggles  (anxiety, bitterness, coveteousness, pride, lust, etc.) - which Piper shows  to be rooted in unbelief. The underlying theme of this book is that the  faith that justifies also sanctifies. As you might imagine, this book is an  aggressive (and needed) attack on the false concept that Jesus can be one's  Saviour without also being one's Lord. I commend this book very highly -  but I do warn you - it is a thinker. Read it twice. Once for familiarity  and then again for saturation and meditation.	2000-07-15

He pleas for glad preaching from pastors who have been ravished by the glory of God  through the cross of Christ and are empowered by the Holy Spirit. And he  presents as a wonderful model the New England pastor-theologian, Jonathan  Edwards. This is not the most technical book on preaching you will ever  read. But it may be the most passionate call for power in the pulpit that  you will ever consider. If I was training pastors, this would be required  reading for every student!	2000-07-15

Pink's excellent work on the sovereignty of God is one of the best twentieth-century treatments of the subject. It is a carefully reasoned, Scripture-saturated, heart-probing, man-abasing, God-exalting book. It is theology with a view to doxology. This exposition will lead you to exaltation!<br />Pink begins by defining God's sovereignty. Then he applies this understanding of God's sovereignty to creation, administration (providence), salvation, reprobation, operation, the human will, human responsibility, and prayer. He ends by looking at what our attitude towards God's sovereignty should be, answering objections, and emphasizing the value of the doctrine. There are four appendices dealing with the will of God, the fall of Adam, the meaning of \\"world\\" in John 3:16, and the meaning of I John 2:2.<br />This book is a supralapsarian Calvinistic look at the doctrine of God's sovereignty. I do not agree with Pink in every point, but I commend this book. I know for a fact that God has used this for the conversion of sinners. And regardless of whether you will accept all of Pink's interpretation of Scripture, you cannot help but walk away from this book with a higher view of God than you had before. I count this as one of the most important books I have read. Read this book. Study this book. And adore the God of this book. Be satisfied with sovereignty!	2000-07-04

It is simple and direct and easy to understand. White furnishes his readers with three basic biblical truths which formulate and safeguard the  doctrine of the trinity - 1. There is one God, 2. There are three Persons  in the Godhead, and 3. The three persons are equal. These points are  established and defended from exegesis of Scripture. Several key texts are  looked at indepth including the prologue of John and Phil. 2:5-11. Much  attention is given to establishing the Deity of Jesus Christ. This is an  excellent book for refuting the heretical doctrines of the Mormons and  Jehovah's Witnesses. White sticks to the basics about the doctrine of the  Trinity and avoids the more metaphysical speculative aspects of the  subject. Excellent for those wanting a basic overview of this important  truth!	2000-07-04

This insightful book lays historical foundations for the philosophy of Christian Hedonism (Biblically known simply as discipleship to Jesus Christ!) which John Piper first outlined in his book Desiring God: The  Meditations of a Christian Hedonist.<br />These chapters on Augustine, Luther,  and Calvin (originally lectures delivered at the Bethlehem Conference for  Pastors) are thought-provoking, heart-stirring mini-biographical studies  aimed at fanning the flames of God-centeredness in the lives of  Christians.<br />Piper beautifully develops the Augustinian understanding of  grace as &quot;sovereign joy&quot; which liberates us from the power of  sin, by showing how this dynamic worked to free Augustine himself from the  bondage of lust.<br />From Luther's life, Piper delves into the importance of  studying the Word of God even in the midst of suffering. And with Calvin,  we are told how devotion to the exposition of Scripture is the means by  which the Majesty of God is revealed with life-transforming power.<br />Piper  preserves the careful balance of admiring the virtues of these men without  condoning their flaws. He gives insightful and objective reflection on  Augustine's sacramentalism, Luther's vulgarity, and Calvin's consent to the  barbarity of his violent age. But he doesn't let these sad mistakes  obstruct from view the important contributions each of these men have made  to the history of the church.<br />I am glad that these studies are being  published (this is the first book of a series of such biographies). They  will prove helpful to both the serious student of Christian History, as  well as the average curious reader.	2000-06-19

Pink	Books	4	67	68	N	N	Interesting Story of a Great Man of the Word	Iain Murray, in typical fashion, has given yet another excellent biography of a great man of God (he is also the author of biographies on Spurgeon, Jonathan Edwards, Martyn Lloyd-Jones, and John Murray!).<br />Arthur W. Pink  is a familiar name to many Bible students today both among pastors and  laymen. But many may not know about the interesting life this man lived.  Murray gives a good portrait here.<br />He was converted from Theosophy while  in his twenties, and immediately felt called to preach. Though he never  even completed Bible College, he became a popular conference speaker in his  early ministry. After several pastorates in the United States, he moved to  Australia where he did conference work and pastored a &quot;Strict&quot;  Baptist church. But Pink's allegiance to the &quot;whole counsel of  God&quot; cost him the acceptance of men. He taught too much for both the  more common Arminians of his day and the &quot;high&quot; Calvinists, who  had drifted into hypercalvinism.<br />After years of struggle to find his  place, he reconciled himself to a ministry of writing instead of preaching.  From Stornoway, Scotland he faithfully penned his &quot;Studies in the  Scriptures&quot; magazine, which was sent to about 1000 (and sometimes  less) people across the world.<br />The books that have now become so popular  (The Life of Elijah, Exposition of Hebrews, Spiritual Growth, Eternal  Security, etc.) originated in this magazine.<br />Murray gives the details of  these different experiences of Pink and his wife, and also provides some  interesting insights into the cause of Pink's eventual isolation. He writes  charitably, yet with objectivity.<br />The ten chapter book concludes with a  lengthy section of extracts from Pink's writings on numerous subjects of  importance and a helpful bibliography of Pink's writings.	2000-06-19

The subject is treated in the classical  style, moving through the  Doctrines of God, Man in Relation to God, the  Person and Work of Christ, the Application of the Work of Redemption, the  Church and the Means of Grace, and the Last Things.<br />His treatment of the  Doctrine of God covers a lot of territory, but leaves something to be  desired in covering the Attributes of God. His chapter on the Trinity,  however, is most helpful.<br />He is decidedly Calvinistic in his approach to  soteriology, giving an excellent treatment of the classical Reformed view  of the &quot;doctrines of grace.&quot; His chapters on the Atonement are  among the best in Reformed theology; and his chapters on the respective  parts of the Application of Redemption (regeneration, conversion,  justification, sanctification, etc.) are helpful.<br />His doctrine of the  Church is Presbyterian to the last, which is a demerit to the book, in my  judgment. The final section on Last Things gives a helpful overview of  futurist eschatalogy, with Berkhof rejecting premillenialism. His critique  of Dispensationalism is helpful (and scathing!).<br />The strength of the  book is its clear coverage of the Reformed position. At times it is too  brief, especially when dealing with divergent views of the various subjects  - but that is almost necessary in a book like this.<br />The greatest fault  of the book is the author's lack of actual exegesis of texts. Most of his  theology is sound, but his exegetical defense of it is not as clear as one  could desire. Too often the passages are only referenced in brackets with  little or no quotation. Hence, one could easily read this book and become a  Reformed theologian without knowing how to use the Bible to substantiate  his or her beliefs.<br />That notwithstanding, this is a book to be read and  studied by pastors and theologians. It is not the only book on theology to  be digested, but it is a key one.iate  his or her beliefs. <br />That notwithstanding, this is a book to be read and  studied by pastors and theologians.

Most helpful of  all is his chapter outlining the basics of biblical holiness. His main  points are as follows:<br />1. The Nature of Holiness is Transformation  through Consecration  2. The Context of Holiness is Justification through  Jesus Christ 3. The Root of Holiness is Cocrucifixion and Coresurrection  with the Lord Jesus Christ 4. The Agent of Holiness is the Holy Spirit 5.  The Experience of Holiness is one of Conflict 6. The Rule of Holiness is  God's Revealed Law 7. The Heart of Holiness is the Spirit of Love<br />His  exposition of those points is worth its weight in gold. Then his  application of those principles to the various schools of thought regarding  sanctification (Augustinian, Wesleyan Perfectionism, and Keswick  &quot;Higher Life&quot;) is perceptive and accurate.<br />Chapters 5 and 6  focus on the charismatic movement, in which Packer ventures both positive  and negative comments. His critique is helpful, though maybe not as stout  as some Reformed types would like. His attitude remains benevolent  throughout.<br />All in all, this is a good book and worthy of being read by  the thoughtful, Biblically-based reader. I would recommend that it be  balanced with some other conservative treatments on the Holy Spirit.	2000-06-07

Gerstner's introduction to the theology of Jonathan Edwards will prove very helpful to those wanting to map their way through the lofty heights of Edwards' own writings. With quotations from sermons and books, Gerstner  summarizes into bite-size portions Edwards' thought on eleven important  theological subjects: 1. Reason and Revelation; 2. The Trinity; 3. Man and  His Fall; 4. Sin; 5. Atonement; 6. Regeneration; 7. Justification; 8.  Sanctification; 9. The Latter-day Glory and Eschatology; 10. Hell; and 11.  Heaven. For those who have bought into the literature book caricature of  Edwards as a &quot;hell-fire and brimstone&quot; evangelist, this will be  an eye-opener. One discovers, instead, that the man behind &quot;Sinners in  the Hands of an Angry God&quot; was a warm-hearted, sharp-minded,  philosophically-inclined GENIUS! No student of theology should be without  this helpful book.	2000-06-07

Pink's essays  (originally published under the title &quot;The Saints Perseverance&quot;  in Pink's magazine &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;) deals with the  doctrinal foundations of the saints security, provides helpful safeguards  against extremes and abuses relating to assurance, and gives practical  direction on how to &quot;persevere&quot;. It is a thoroughly Calvinistic  treatment of the subject. While the chapters are uneven in their literary  quality, the content is worth reading. This book is a helpful antidote to  the sickly condition of modern Christian teaching on eternal security.	2000-06-07

Martyn Lloyd-Jones who pastored the Westminister Chapel of London in the forties, fifties, and sixties, are masterpieces of Biblical exposition. The majority of the book focuses on  the famous Pauline prayer from Ephesians 3:14-21. Lloyd-Jones unfolds these  verses with clear logic, fervent devotion, and practical application. The  majesty of this important passage of Scripture came alive to me as I read  this book. Heartily recommended!	2000-06-07

If I could bump it up to six stars, instead of five, I would! John Piper has done the Christian community a great service by focusing a  Biblical lense on the whole concept of Christian motivation. And what he so  eloquently reveals is that the key to it all is delight - not duty -   because delight IS our duty! The concepts of &quot;Christian Hedonism&quot;  are hammered out with iron-clad logic and lyrical prose. Piper is both a  poet and a scholar and both his clear thinking and his deep feeling about a  God-centered God who delights to be the delight of His people come through.  His chapter on The Happiness of God is worth its weight in gold. His  reflections on conversion are very helpful in our day of easy-believism and  seeker-oriented evangelism that produces decisions, but not conversions.  The reflections on worship are absolutely paradigm-shifting, and the  application chapters on Scripture, prayer, money, marriage, missions, and  suffering all provide a biblical compass to give direction to the  hungry-hearted disciple. After reading this book three times, I am still  getting help from it, and I recommend it whole-heartedly to all who dare  risk considering &quot;the meditations of a Christian Hedonist!&quot;	2000-05-24

John Piper delivers a carefully studied Biblical portrait of what it means to be a man or a woman. The principles are based on sound Biblical exegesis, but without a lot of technicality and detail. The chapters  dealing with &quot;The Meaning of Masculinity&quot; and &quot;The Meaning  of Femininity&quot; are dealt with by the use of carefully constructed  definitions that are unfolded word-by-word. Extensive space is given to  describing the masculine role of leadership. Piper's approach is  Scriptural, and therefore relevant; and he labors hard to bridge any  apparant gaps between the Biblical model and its contemporary relevance. He  avoids hard and fast rules for specific circumstances, and sticks to sold  principles which should govern male-female relationships of differing  levels. This would be an excellent book for pastoral premarital  counselling.	2000-05-21

Spurgeon Autobiography: The Early Years, 1834-1859	Books	4	25	25	N	N	Spurgeon on Spurgeon	Banner of Truth Trust released this revised edition of Spurgeon's Autobiography, which originally appeared in four volumes. Having completed volume one of the now two volume set, I can say without hesitation that my  respect and admiration of this great man of God has grown even greater.  While any autobiography lacks the continuity of a well-researched  biography, there is a freshness to it that is endearing. Spurgeon relates  anecdote-like memories, along with detailed descriptions of some of the  more pertinent events of his life. The chapters dealing with his conviction  of sin and subsequent conversion are especially enlightening. Susannah  Spurgeon wrote several chapters that are also included - mostly about their  courtship and early wedded life. This volume deals mainly with Spurgeon's  childhood and early ministry with the New Park Street Baptist Church, and  it is not without some of Spurgeon's own humor. Very good indeed!	2000-05-21

What a great man of God was Lloyd-Jones, and what a great God he served. From the  account of his childhood in Wales, to his prominence in Harley Street as a  physician, to his conversion and subsequent ministry in Aberavon, this is a  wonderful book. Not a story full of dramatic happenings, but rather the  quiet obedience of a man who shunned publicity, but was honored by the God  of heaven, and saw the mysterious and sovereign movings of the Spirit upon  his hearers. Well documented with numerous sermon excerpts, newspaper  quotes, and personal interview with the &quot;Doctor&quot; and his wife  themselves, this was a fantastic book with which to end 1997. I shall  treasure this volume always, and make a point to read it more than once  more in the years to come. I thank God for this book and the inspiration it  has been to me.	2000-05-21
