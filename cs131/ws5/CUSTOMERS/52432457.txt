Doug Clegg has always been good, but he knocked my socks off with \\"The Hour Before Dark,\\" and this one is just as lean and mean, but even meatier.

Mr. Parker has always been exceptional at characterization, but this book nails real atmosphere as well, and is at the top of my 2004 list, along with The Narrows by Michael Connelly, Memorial Day by Harry Shannon and that new Robert Crais. The 60's seem especially relevent these days (war and all) so the writing really make my skin ripple. Great stuff! Buy it, you won't be disappointed. As usual.	2004-10-01

I have read every one of his novels at least twice, and this will be no exception. &quot;Moon of Red Ponies&quot; is not the best Burke ever (Neon Rain may be that one, or perhaps Electric Mist with Confederate Dead) but this book should be read by everyone who loves crime fiction and good writing, not necessarily in that order.

Every time I read one of his novels, I end up laughing out loud and the crisp western dialogue (&quot;He was big enough to go gator hunting with stern words&quot;) and Lansdale can always be relied upon to supply an intriguing mystery plot. He is one of a handful of writers whose books are always at the top of my &quot;gotta have it and can't wait for the paperback&quot; list.

Unlike John Dean, who stepped forward to expose the horrific excesses of the corrupt Nixon administration only while under pressure from the law and an indictment for his complicity, Clarke has put his entire professional life on the line--all the while knowing he will be personally attacked and possibly destroyed by the Karl Rove machine. Now we can expect to see a hundred negative posts from right-wingers who have not purchased or read the book, claiming to offer \\"objective\\" opinions. The man said everything under oath. If the Bush folks think he is lying, they should immediatly prosecute him for perjury...After all, they went after Clinton for lying about sexual encounters, why not Clarke for perjury? But they won't, and the reason is clear. This book is devastating to their OZ-like illusions, and although they are already moving to assasinate his character, they dare not challange his testimony in a court of law, or risk putting Condi Rice or anyone else on the stand against him. Regardless of your political persuasion, this registered Republican, who was originally appointed by Ronald Reagan and served under Bush, Sr. as well as Clinton and Bush, Jr., deserves to be taken seriously. Don't allow the talk-radio spin machine to keep you from buying, borrowing or otherwise obtaining and reading this amazing account of our sad terrorism follies. (Believe me, Clarke is not kind to Clinton either, although he saves his most penetrating and disturbing allegations for Rumsfeldt, Rice and George W. Bush himself). This is the most explosive stuff I have seen since the Pentagon Papers. The Gulf of Tonkin happened again in Iraq, and most of us didn't even notice.	2004-03-26

Shannon the author went over the top and half way to Europe with his wonderful first novel The Night Of The Beast, which turned out to be the first in a trilogy. This 'werewolf' book is the second and has got lots of attention going into the HORRORFIND convention in Baltimore. Tom Piccirilli, Douglas Clegg and others gave it advance raves and it is easy to see why. This novel is leaner and sleeker and less frantic than The Night Of The Beast. It is probably better and even more professional too. A burned out cop named Joe Case goes looking for his missing brother in law and bumps into a girl who is running from the mob. A Psycho like motel in Salt Lick Nevada (surrounded by a biker gang yet!) is where manure hits the fan. The tale is packed with in-joke references like people named McCammon and Garton and Case. Un-put-downable stuff from a rising genre talent.	2003-08-10

I couldn't. If Ann Coulter spewed this nasty, poorly-researched tripe about blacks, women, gays or any social group other than so-called 'liberals' she would be ostracized, dead or in jail. This woman proves the adage that beauty is only skin deep. If you chose to read this, also read \\"Blinded By The Right\\" by David Hale to get a saner perspective. I'm sorry, but Coulter is arrogant, childish and riding a wave of shallow, spiteful right-wing social backlash subsquent to 9/11. Every day another news report proves her wrong, yet every day she comes out with another unprovable 'charge' against millions of proud Americans--just like her admitted idol Joe McCarthy.

The continuing popularity of this novel clearly shows that there is still a market for sleek, cool pulp fiction. This one you gotta own.	2003-02-24

Like maverick Senator John McCain she is trying valiantly to warn us to come to our senses before it is too late. I've heard she plans a college tour: PLEASE GO! Perhaps this next generation will do what the latest has so badly failed to do: clean up the corruption in Washington and on Wall Street, so that the rest of us get a fair shake. This woman deserves admiration and support for sharing what she has seen first hand. I admire her.	2003-01-26

Dan Keohane is a fresh new talent, a guy you should keep an eye on. The sleek poetry of his descriptive language and lean dialogue make him one of horror's brightest new stars, and this collection is a delightful introduction to his work. The author also gives a portion away to charity, which tells you a great deal about the character of the man (and no, we've never met!) So give &quot;Christmas Trees and Monkeys&quot; a try.

It is written third-person present tense, like a screenplay and it ROCKS. I am a lover both both crime noir and horror fiction, and although there are no specificly supernatural elements here they are certainly hinted at (the left hand path, a fascination with death, the snake that eats its tail). Boston Teran is a genius. His writing makes your eye stumble at times because it borders on poetry but he is just amazing. I have read all three of his books now and they all are great but this is the best. As I said it is not marketed as horror, but certainly borders on it and has the same anger and drive as Harry Shannons \\"Night of the Beast\\" without being specific to the horror genre at all. don't miss this one.	2002-12-15

In comparative religion there is a concept joking referred to as the \\"theodicy trilemma,\\" meaning an irreconcilable triangle of three ideas which all seem true: (a) that there is a supreme being or force, (b) that it is essentially benevolant and (c) the fact that we suffer and die. Religion, philosophy all attempt to grapple with these points in various ways. British genius Tim Lebbon takes his shot here. This is an even more interesting work than his \\"The Nature of Balance,\\" which is saying something. Yes, it owes a bit to the John D. MacDonald classic generally known as \\"Cape Fear,\\" but it takes off on its own in no time. I love the whole spectrum of horror, from Harry Shannon's powerful 'pulp fiction' entry \\"Night of the Beast\\" to the literate sensibilities of Doug Clegg and \\"Hour Before Dark.\\" Tim Lebbon falls in the middle, leaning toward the more literate, Ramsey Campbell school. He is a gifted man and I am really looking forward to more mass-market editions of his stuff, ... . Oh, and Lebbons answer to 'why us'? \\"Why NOT you. Bad things happen.\\"	2002-12-13

I have been on a King rampage lately, and rediscovered his early stuff like Salem's Lot and The Shining. The only book in the last few years that comes close to this one is Harry Shannon's sprawling &quot;Night of the Beast,&quot; which takes place by cooincidence in the town of Two Trees, Nevada, which feels like a stones throw from Desperation! Other than that the two books are quite different, but the small desert town thing is creepy as hell. Neck and neck with similar themes, and great storytelling on both fronts. I plan to read them both again and that is a compliment to both authors. Desperation is a bit long and ponderous, but what novel by King isn't? Grab it.	2002-12-09

Folks, this kind of classic, 'horror pulp' writing is long overdue for a comeback (maybe Harry Shannon's 2002 shriek-fest &quot;Night of the Beast&quot; is the harbinger; let's hope so) and in the meanwhile, we should all be supporting the genre by digging up these older, cooler novels and re-reading them. &quot;Valley of Lights&quot; is cool and classic.

As usual, it's real food for thought (and in this case we may be the food for that thought,both literally and figuratively!) The thriller/horror film blockbuster potential is also there, although as a real horror fan I'd rather they made a book out of Harry Shannon's rollicking 'Night of the Beast,' so there would be some more surprises in store.

This is a slow, almost gentle character study. Masterton doesn't even bother to hide where he is going. The very fact that someone does a job like Bonnie's in the real world is disturbing enough. That we like her so much we begin to descend in hell along with her is VERY upsetting. I like pulp horror too (Harry Shannon's \\"Night of the Beast\\" being the most recent example of a well done rollercoaster ride)but this one is something altogether different. Settle in for a quiet, skin-crawling text about true psychological horror and you won't be disappointed. Subtle and dazzling. I think it is one of Masterton's best.	2002-12-02

Harry Shannon's new novel \\"Night of the Beast\\" covers similar territory quite beautifully too, with all the hideous stuff that happens to little Timmy Baxter, but every author to publish after this one owes a small debt to Mr. Clegg. The vampires (and where they originate from) are terrific. Buy it.	2002-11-30

This is dark and relentless stuff, from someone who doesn't want to give you too much time to catch your breath. Author Gord Rollo is obviously someone knows and loves the horror genre, and that makes \\"Crimson\\" a lot of fun to read. Sure, it has some flaws (a first novel in the small press always does) but the author's intensity and wicked gleefulness more than compensate for them. For a macabre, Halloween-style kick in the butt, try \\"Crimson.\\" It's a blast.	2002-11-25

I think King &amp; Straub hurt themselves a bit by choosing an odd present-tense &quot;screenplay&quot; like approach to the prose, and then using the roayl 'we' upon occasion to boot. The attack feels a little pretentious at times, unfortunately. Still, I enjoyed the book, particularly when the protagonists arrive at the mysterious house in question. The blur of lines between reality (and 'worlds') mutes a great deal of the violence. One of the most colorful, explosive pieces of pulp to emerge from 2002, although another real contender, at times even better, is Harry Shannon's wild and wooley &quot;Night of the Beast.&quot; It gives 'Black House' a run for the money. In short, this one is worth it for King fans (where 'Buick 8' may not be...)	2002-11-23

Douglas Clegg is a brilliant writer; he layers his work with sly references and short, intense bursts of energy. Totally the other end of the spectrum from the driving pulp intensity of Shannon's 'Night of the Beast,' but just as good. maybe better. This is an elegant and poetic kind of horror; the classic, patiently disturbing variety. If you like finesse and elegance with your horror you cannot go wrong with this one.	2002-11-23

King returns to familiar territory here, \\"Dead Zone\\" meets \\"Tommyknockers\\" meets \\"The Body.\\" Still, though it lacks the relentless pulp drive of Harry Shannon's \\"Night of the Beast\\" it's worth grabbing for entertainment. Curious to see what the film will be like? So am I. Great cast with Morgan Freeman et. al. and like \\"Green Mile\\" it will probably beat the book for a change, instead of the other way around.	2002-11-23

I love Boston Teran. &quot;God is a Bullet&quot; is a killer first novel, and 'Prince' is a very worthy follow-up. It doesn't have the same driving, horror-genre intensity as &quot;Bullet,&quot; (which is the only first novel besides Harry Shannon's wild, reckless horror offering 'Night of the Beast' to have the insanity of 'pulp fiction' this year) but shows Teran maturing as an author.

SL is the story of a boy who returns home to face the haunted Martsen House and his boyhood fears, only to discover a town slowly turning vampire. This one is a classic. I haven't read anything to touch it, especially lately (except perhaps for 'Night of the Beast, Harry Shannon's wonderfully over-the-top &quot;pulp&quot; novel released last August).

This is one of King's very best, although I'm not sure the extra padding of the unedited version actually improves the book. If the reader lets go and enjoys the ride (enormous suspension of disbelief is required, especially towards the middle) this is a classic. Harry Shannon's edgy first novel \\"Night of the Beast\\" is the only book I know of to employ as many horror tropes in such an original and entertaining manner, and although \\"The Stand\\" lacks NOTB's wry humor it belongs on every afficianados \\"booshelf.\\" King's 'Desperation' and 'It' are almost as good, but not quite.	2002-10-30

At times he is SF poet, at others master of horror. O'Neill philosophizes, bobs and weaves and then says BOO like early Bradbury. This novel muses about sin, pride and the possibility of redemption. Its world is a future that is bizarre and Orwellian, yet neo- Facist and familiar. In this bleak time, convicted criminals are color-coded. Their skin shades, and felony crimes, are to mark them forever. The Indigo Man dares to believe that his skin is fading back to its original color; thus that his shame may eventually be washed away. \\"The Burden of Indigo\\" considers momentous themes (all of our various \\"isms\\") while it spins a wonderful, dark tale. I think it represents the most valuable kind of speculative fiction: That which is relentless and probing, yet imaginative and lyrical. This is no space-opera, or cheese-fest. Reading this book is a highly subtle and subjective experience, but one I would recommend highly.	2002-05-19

Regardless of the faults \\"Red Church\\" might have, primarily at the ending, antagonist Archer McFall is a disturbing and reasonant creation, and Scott Nicholson is a very gifted man. His ear for the cadence of the rural south, his deft touch with the thoughts of a young boy, all conspire to make this the debut novel from someone I believe to be a major new talent. I was already familiar with the author from his small-press collection \\"Thank You For The Flowers,\\" but \\"The Red Church\\" still surprised me. It's up there with Harry Shannon's powerful pulp-fest \\"Night of the Beast\\" as the best debut of 2002, but at the other (slower and creepier) end of the spectrum. If you like Bentley Little, Peter Straub and Doug Clegg, then buy \\"The Red Church.\\" I believe you'll like it.	2002-05-18

The climax of \\"Loose Ends\\" did catch me me totally off guard. \\"She Who Is Kali\\" grossed me out and then made me laugh.
