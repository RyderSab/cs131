Harry's mood wasn't consistent with with the previous book (he should be more moody and crabby now, after all that's happened, shouldn't he?).  The grammar and punctuation were terrible.  There was too much kissing.  There was too much gore.  The only interesting parts came near the end.  The rest was formulaic and nearly plotless.  The whole thing was an overblown introduction to Book 7.  If I had actually bought a copy (rather than borrowing it from the library), I would be very angry at having wasted my money.  As it is, I'm angry that I wasted so much time.	2005-09-06

I almost bought this book a couple of times, but ended up taking it out of my cart at the last minute.  Now I know why.  The universe was trying to save me some money!  (I ended up borrowing it from the library instead.)<br /><br />I have a feeling I've read this book before but, if so, it was years ago and I don't remember the specifics (it must've been an earlier edition).  I'd seen recommendations for the book on one of the message boards I frequent, so I thought it would be good.  However, almost from the first page, I felt that something was \\"off\\"... and as I continued to read, that feeling only grew.  I like reading regression cases, but in this book, Goldberg jumps to conclusions too quickly in the way he interprets things.<br /><br />It's as if the author is one of the blind men in the story about the elephant, and he's only able to describe the animal by feeling its tail.  The bare bones about reincarnation are there, but there is way too much other stuff that many would view as nonsense, and that damages the credibility of researchers who are looking into the phenomenon of reincarnation.  In Goldberg's world, it seems that anyone with inexplicable behavior, past or present, must be possessed -- either by a poltergeist, a past-life persona, a demon, or an extraterrestrial time traveler.  I laughed out loud when I read the following passage concerning reptilian aliens: \\"These time travelers are most definitely to be avoided, as they eat humans.\\"  It is statements like this that make me suspicious of the whole book... that, and the fact that we can supposedly be protected from such malicious influences if we buy Goldberg's tapes.<br /><br />In addition, there were some inaccuracies (for example, stating that ulcers are not caused by bacteria), as well as many grammatical errors.  Since this is a new edition (or at least a book built on the foundation of an old one), I would expect that things would be updated, edited, and double-checked.  This doesn't appear to be the case.<br /><br />In contrast to many of the other books I've read on the subject, Goldberg's universe seems to be a contradictory, unenlightened place of hierarchy and punishment.  It merely skims the surface of what some other researchers have discovered about karma and rebirth.  Readers interested in time travel or alien invaders will probably like this book.  But if you are more interested in reincarnation, plain and simple, you will probably be disappointed.  I may have enjoyed it when I was first starting out on my journey of discovery, but it's not enough anymore and I've found many better books since.  Instead of this book, I would recommend: Jane Roberts' Seth books (especially \\"Seth Speaks\\"); Dr. Brian L. Weiss's books (they're easy to read and full of amazing stories); Dr. Michael Newton's books (they deal more with life between lives, but are still very relevant to past lives); or Roger Woolger's \\"Healing Your Past Lives.\\"ppear to be the case. <br /> <br />In contrast to many of the other books I've read on the subject, Goldberg's universe seems to be a contradictory, unenlightened place of hierarchy and punishment.

US	50952351	R1IIEBKKAQTPZH	0553804146	245113934	Life Expectancy: A Novel	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Okay...	This was the first book by Dean Koontz that I'd ever read.  I'm still not quite sure what to think about it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that his writing was, for the most part, grammatically correct and easy to read.  Some authors with as many books under their belts seem to leave readability and punctuation behind as their resume grows.  The story was a little slow at times (the first of the five bad days seemed to take up a disproportionately large amount of space, though I understand it was probably the most important of the terrible days).<br /><br />What bothered me is the author's use of the \\"I gotcha\\" device.  Something awful is happening... or so we think, because the characters (in their first-person point of view) tell us so.  We get worked up and worried... only to find out that they were only \\"yanking our chains\\".  I really don't care for that, even as a literary device.  Out and out lying to the reader is not going to endear the characters to anyone.<br /><br />It was a good yarn, though, and a fairly good premise, although a little silly.  Murderous clowns?  Insane aerialists?  It doesn't make circus folk look very good, that's for sure.  And the whole thing was a little contrived.  But, for an entertaining summer read, it was good enough.	2005-07-08

Melanie Gideon breathes a lot of life into her imaginary world.  Actually, the world is more interesting than the characters, which are somewhat one-dimensional.<br />Good points: Great descriptions, an interesting premise, and a truly threatening villain.<br />Bad points: Underdeveloped characters, too many things left unexplained, and an unsatisfying ending.<br />If Gideon had intended for this to be the first in a series of books about these characters or the imaginary world of Greenwater, that's fine.  But as it was, the book didn't really stand on its own.  I was hooked early on, but the ending wasn't satisfying and too many things were left a mystery.  Where is Nora's father?  Why is he so evil?  What happened to the manacle?  What is the origin of the Veil?<br />In addition, I felt that some of the characterizations fell rather flat.  The conversations between Nora and Billy sometimes seemed stilted.  Billy also had a strange habit of lapsing into speech that wasn't consistent with his age (he'd sound like a normal 11-year-old boy one moment, and then like a sage elder the next... it was a jarring transition and came off as somewhat corny).<br />Also, introducing pivotal characters at the midpoint of the novel seemed rather contrived.  Rip only appears twice before the end, and his presence seems rather \\"deus ex machina\\"... too convenient, as if Gideon needed a way to tie up her loose ends regarding the Provisioner.<br />If there is a sequel that goes into some of the points that were not explored in this book, that's great.  If not, the story was rather incomplete and will probably leave most readers wanting.  The beginning was good, but unfortunately the momentum doesn't last.	2004-06-29

However, I found it lacked some of the excitement of de Lint's other books.  The ending sort of fell flat for me.  Although I liked the premise (a spirit that takes over a website and begins to literally suck people in), I thought that it could have been done a little better.  De Lint has left the ending open for a sequel (I don't know if that's what he has planned), but I think the loose ends could have been tied up a little better, and with more excitement (I'm used to more explosive crescendos from de Lint).<br />I'd recommend de Lint's &quot;Trader&quot;, &quot;Yarrow&quot;, or &quot;Jack of Kinrowan&quot; over this book.  None of the three feature the Internet as a main player, but they are better examples of the urban fantasy for which de Lint is famous.	2004-02-04
US	50952351	R1OD5T2CQW4CU7	1551432706	45807069	Waiting for Sarah	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Mixed reaction	While I appreciate the fact that the author attempted to tackle such heavy subject matter, I really didn't understand the point of the story.  Was it a story about a boy learning to cope with his new life after the loss of his family and his legs?  Or was it a ghost story?  Somehow, I didn't quite understand how the two were supposed to fit together.  As a result of the strange mix, I felt that Mike's problems were not really delved into as deeply as they could have been, and the ghost story seemed like a superfluous plot that was tacked on as the author started to shirk away from the heavy subject matter.  Had it been just a straight ghost story, the whole issue of loss on Mike's part would have been unnecessary; why would he need to suffer such an enormous tragedy to work on the yearbook?<br />I guess what I'm trying to say is that it seemed like the tragic elements were only added for shock value, and then cast aside in order to tell the ghost story.  It could have been either a story of coping with loss, or a standard ghost story.  Instead, the two were mixed and, as a result, the book didn't quite work.	2004-02-04

It will be the last.<br />While the premise itself was interesting, I found its execution to be quite sloppy.  The characters were not developed very well (I kept getting them confused, as Clark provided very few details to bring them to life in the reader's mind), and all seemed to be cardboard cut-out clones of each other.  They talked the same, thought the same, even dressed the same (all the women -- even the young ones -- wore pantsuits!).<br />The villain was dreadful, and seemed to come out of nowhere.  Not enough hints were dropped that this person could be the killer, so when it was finally revealed, it was rather disorienting.  Besides this, the villain was kind of over-the-top... you know, the moustache-twirler who gleefully explains his plot to the hapless heroine right before he tries to kill her.  There was also a strange switch in the point of view halfway through, and the killer suddenly starts talking to the reader in the first person.<br />All in all, I was highly disappointed, and felt like I'd wasted my time.  I read this book because Mary Higgins Clark is so famous, and I want to see what all the fuss was about.<br />I don't get it.	2004-02-04

On the first page, I was almost swamped by Chabon's extremely long sentences that, while usually grammatically correct, are often a little hard to figure out (maybe the author could remember the beginning of his sentence by its end, a page later, but I found it a little difficult).  But I kept going, and soon fell into the story.<br />By the time I finished reading, I felt a little sad.  I'm not sure whether that was because the book was finally at an end and I'd have to bid farewell to the characters I'd come to care about, or if it was because I wasn't entirely satisfied by the ending (though, seeing the way in which Chabon led the events toward the conclusion, I'm really not sure how else the story could have ended that would have made sense).<br />The story is at times humourous, at times heart-wrenching... but it's always entertaining.  I did find certain passages a little slow (Chabon has a habit of jumping back from the main story to provide some backstory), but they did add to the overall flavour of the novel, and added some enlightening information that might have been difficult to work into the story otherwise.  I've never been a comic book fan, but by the end of the story, I had a strange urge to search out and read one.<br />The characters were interesting and unique, at least from each other; it's easy to form pictures of each person in your mind, unlike some stories with their cardboard cut-out characters who can only be told apart because of their different names.  I wasn't quite sure which character was supposed to be the focus of the book, since the viewpoint switched around quite a bit, and there were large gaps (years, sometimes) in the narrative.  I do wish that Chabon had perhaps written a little more about what Joe did during his decade-long, self-imposed exile; I'm guessing he was supposed to be the main character, and that gap was a little jarring.  Other than that, I thought the characters were great, and we were told what we needed to know about each of them to really begin to enjoy reading about them.<br />The reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is mainly because of the long sentences.  I realize that it's probably a style issue on Chabon's part, but it was still distracting (it's a pain to have to go back and try to find the subject of a 200-word sentence in order to make sense of the verb!).  But if you want to read a good story, set in a time period that'll fill you with nostalgia, this is a good place to start.characters were great, and we were told what we needed to know about each of them to really begin to enjoy reading about them.<br />The reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is mainly because of the long sentences.

According to one of the maps, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia now sit on an isolated island.  That's news to me!

Once upon a time, there was a boy named Harry Potter.  His adventures delighted us as we read about them in his first four books.  After a long wait, we finally found ourselves in the presence of the boy wizard again.  And some of us were disappointed...<br />I know I'm not going to be popular for saying so, but I had a lot of problems with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  For the first two weeks I had it, I barely touched it; I would try to read it, but the story just didn't seem to be going anywhere.  I almost decided to give up on it.  But I kept going, hoping the story would take off and grab my imagination.<br />For a book that took so long to write, I would have expected a lot more editing.  Take out a little bit of unnecessary dialogue here (can you say \\"er...?\\"), a little bit of irrelevant description there, and the book probably could have been trimmed to a more manageable size (reading this thing in bed is hard on the fingers... 700+ pages in hardcover make for a heavy book!).  I was also appalled at the lack of proper grammar.  Everyone in this book talks in run-on sentences!  I don't remember noticing this in the previous four books, but then, this book didn't have a really interesting storyline to distract me.<br />Book 5 also doesn't stand on its own.  You really have to have read the previous four books to make sense of all the references (and since I hadn't re-read any of the other books in preparation for this one, I couldn't properly remember half of the things that were mentioned... three years is a long time to have to remember all those little details).  There are still so many unanswered questions.  After 766 pages, I feel sort of empty and cheated.  Harry's lost someone else in his life, for seemingly little reason other than to make him more miserable.  There had better be some really good explanations in Books 6 and 7!<br />Finally, I realize this is first and foremost a series of books, not movies.  But, as it looks probable that all of these books will be turned into movies at some point, I am rather disturbed.  Book Four was depressing enough; how that could be made into a movie for kids, I'm not sure.  Book Five would have people leaving the theatres in tears of frustration and grief!  After all, who wants to spend $... to see a depressing cliffhanger?<br />I've given the book three stars because after I reached the mid-point, I started to get a little bit interested in the story.  The first half took two weeks for me to get through; the second half took a few hours.  I kept reading, desperately hoping that the story would blossom, that something would finally be explained.  I'm still disappointed with the way this book ended, but I did enjoy reading some parts of it.  Fred and George and their Skiving Snackboxes had me smiling to myself.  Professor Umbridge was deliciously nasty.  Hagrid's newest \\"project\\" was sort of amusing.  And I liked Rowling's clever literal use of a metaphor for death.  But, overall, it was not enough.<br />I hope Book 6 is a lot shorter, a lot more exciting, and a lot less depressing (although, judging by the tone set in the last two books, I don't think things are going to get any lighter).  And an editor would be helpful... there are enough reasons people want to ban Harry Potter books.

For the heroine, Cat Midhir, those ideas come from her dreams.  So what happens when the dreams stop?  That's what &quot;Yarrow&quot; is all about.<br />I did find the first part a little bit slow.  I thought there were too many scene shifts, and introductions to a lot of characters who turned out to be little more than scenery in the end.  I felt that these minor characters were developed almost at the expense of some of the other characters who should have been given more space.  Case in point: Kothlen.  I would have liked to see his character developed more, even in flashbacks, so that when Cat loses him, we don't have to be told how awful she feels; we should be able to feel it for ourselves.<br />Other than that, de Lint has woven a wonderful story.  I liked Tiddy Mun, Cat's little gnome friend, and the villain, Lysistratus, was deliciously formidable.  I highly recommend this book to fans of Charles de Lint who may not have read this earlier piece of urban fantasy.	2003-04-20

I really liked 'Wolf Tower,' so I was excited when I got my hands on 'Wolf Star,' the second book in the Claidi Journals series.  Unfortunately, this book didn't live up to the high expectations produced by the first book.<br />Instead of the rollicking adventure of 'Wolf Star,' 'Wolf Tower' traps the reader in a monotonous structure called \\"The Rise.\\"  Claidi is trapped here too, and I suppose Tanith Lee wanted to get that imprisoned feeling across.  Unfortunately, the author succeeded all too well.  I kept wanting to skip ahead, to find out if Claidi would ever escape from the Rise's constantly moving rooms (an interesting concept at first, but continued to the point of redundancy).  And then, after everything Claidi goes through to return to her true love, to find out you have to read the THIRD book to find out what happens is rather frustrating.  'Wolf Star' can not stand on its own like the first book did.<br />I was also disappointed that 'Wolf Star,' which I thought was part of a fantasy series, seemed to dissolve into cheesy science fiction near the end.  Case in point: Yinyay.  She sounded like the silver hose one would find behind a clothes-dryer, and she's just the type of character that you might find in some bad 1950s sci-fi movie, complete with tinsel hair.  I understand that Venn's mother was supposed to be a \\"scientist,\\" but Yinyay was just too much.<br />Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this book.  I just wanted the story to be over.	2003-03-17

I REALLY didn't like 'Wolf Queen.'<br />After slogging through the second book in the Claidi Journals series ('Wolf Star'), I thought that perhaps the story would get back on track.  I missed the interaction between Claidi and her true love, Argul.  But when I started to read 'Wolf Queen,' I quickly discovered that this would be yet another \\"Claidi-searching-for-her-boyfriend\\" book.<br />It was more interesting than 'Wolf Star,' however, with the constantly changing locales and the mysterious Jelly character.  But I felt very disappointed by the ending.  After all the tantalizing hints that Claidi might be royal blood, and then...  I won't spoil it if you haven't read it yet, but I felt the conclusion sort of made Claidi's whole search for her identity rather meaningless.  And the flying... how utterly convenient.<br />I see that Tanith Lee has now written a fourth book in the series.  I haven't decided if I will read it yet.  I'm a little tired of the pattern of overly contrived twists and turns that this series has fallen into.	2003-03-17

On its own, this book is good.  It's entertaining and fairly easy to read.  The only real complaint I had was that some of the language Claidi uses seems a bit too modern (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5).  Claidi is an engaging heroine with a mind of her own, and this narrative of her travels in a strange world is highly enjoyable.<br />This book can (and should) stand on its own.  I was extremely disappointed with the next two books in the series.  So I would definitely recommend 'Wolf Tower'... just stay clear of 'Wolf Star' and 'Wolf Queen' if you don't want to be left with a bad taste in your mouth.	2003-03-17

The writing, however, is awful.  I found grammatical errors and inconsistencies throughout.  The worst part of this book, though, has to be the ending.  It seems as if the author dug himself into a hole and then took the easy way out.  Having read other books on the subject of reincarnation, I can think of many other possibilities that would have made the ending more palatable, and perhaps a lot more interesting.<br />If you want to read a book that was obviously published without the benefit of an editor, a book that takes the easy way out when confronted with a life-and-death dilemma... go ahead and read this one.  For those who are looking to read about reincarnation, try the non-fiction section.  The books by Michael Newton, Brian Weiss, and others who have experience in this area are much more interesting... in some cases, more interesting than fiction.	2002-12-07

I've read the first two books in the series, and if this third one is any indication, we can't hope for much from any future installments.<br />Georgia has to be the most annoying, bratty, shallow, spoiled, selfish, cruel teenager that has ever been portrayed as the \\"hero\\" of a novel.  She wasn't so bad in the first book.  I noticed these tendencies getting worse in the second.  In this book, it was awful.<br />The gimmick is getting old.  I'm tired of seeing words like \\"maturiosity\\", \\"sophisticosity\\", and \\"bottomosity\\" (in fact, I'm not sure Georgia even knows that there are nouns that DON'T end in \\"-osity\\").  Hey, I've got a good word: \\"monstrosity\\"... that's what this book is.  I had hoped that by the third book, the character would have grown and changed somehow.  Not so.  Georgia gets dumber and meaner.<br />I started reading the books in this series because I wanted to know why they were such top sellers.  The first book explains it.  Unfortunately, the momentum didn't continue, and now I feel like I've wasted my time with the other two books.  Besides the fact that there's no story to this third book, Georgia isn't exactly a role model.  According to her, anything that isn't related to makeup or making out is totally uncool.  Georgia needs to grow up, and if the author isn't going to take charge and make that happen, she shouldn't be inflicting such mindless values on her readers.<br />There are much better books for teens out there.	2002-10-05

Although it is marketed as a children's book, as an adult, I quite enjoyed it.  In fact, I would hesitate to buy it for children who still need to be read to, as the format of this particular book doesn't really lend itself to being read out loud.  But for slightly older kids (or adults with an appreciation of great kids' books), this is great fun.	2002-09-21

I loved the ending.  There are so many children's books out there of varying quality, so I was pleased to come across this little gem.	2002-09-21
US	50952351	R3N1AVFMTYIGDF	0380977788	425362981	Coraline	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Interesting concept	I kept hearing about this book, so I had to read it to find out what all the fuss was about.  Indeed, it is a deliciously creepy tale for children, and I managed to race through it within an afternoon.  I did like it; however, I was expecting a little more.<br />Coraline is a refreshingly intelligent girl, but perhaps almost too intelligent.  She never seems quite concerned enough about her dilemma, even though her very soul is at stake.  This, in turn, made the story a little flat for me.  I suppose I didn't believe the danger, since she was so casual about it.<br />While reading this book, the ominous overtones kept reminding me of another children's book, the similarly creepy \\"Marianne Dreams\\" by Catherine Storr (unfortunately, it's only available in the UK at the moment).  If you read \\"Coraline\\" and like it, you might like this book as well.<br />The writing was flowing and easy to read, and the story drew me in.  It's nice to see that there are some intelligent, wonderfully creative stories for kids out there.	2002-09-21

Actually, my favourite character was not Bridget, but her mother.  Such a colourful, silly, petty, STRANGE woman!<br />For those who have seen the movie before reading the book, be forewarned... all is not the same.  Both start off in a similar manner, but the end of the book is quite different (I almost wish they had filmed the book's version of the last few diary entries... that would have been a hoot!).<br />All in all, it's a fun book, but don't read it expecting to learn anything or experience anything new and earth-shattering.  It's light reading at its best.	2002-09-17
US	50952351	R1QZL01HBIMBLI	0060288132	605226542	On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Okay, but not as good as "Angus..."	After reading \\"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging\\", I was eager to read the next installment of Georgia Nicholson's fabby fab fab adventures.  Well, I wasn't too impressed.  Sure, the book is charming like its predecessor, but I just didn't find myself laughing as hard this time.  What made the difference?<br />First, I think the novelty wore off.  You can only hear so much of this strange teenage slang before it begins to sound forced and silly.  Second, I wasn't pleased with the way the whole New Zealand issue was handled.  I would have liked to see Georgia's adventures in \\"Kiwi-a-gogo\\" land, as she calls it.  However, I can see why the family never went.  The author obviously didn't know enough about New Zealand to properly write about it; this is evident in the continuous stereotypes about New Zealand: people sitting around eating bugs, geothermal vents that apparently burst from the ground and injure people on a regular basis.  Give me a break.  Third, Georgia is unlikeable in this book.  She's rather mean to her friends, and seems to be getting dumber as she progresses through school (one would expect that a British teenager her age would know that Sweden is not on the other side of the world).  Did I miss something?  She doesn't seem to be quite the same character she was before.<br />I'm still planning on reading the third book in the series, but I can only hope that it is better than this second foray into Georgia Nicolson's life.	2002-09-14

Actually, it was quite good.  It sort of reminded me of a \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" for the teenage set.  I found myself laughing out loud at times.<br />Angus the cat's antics are amusing (although worrisome for any owners of poodles), Libby is charming (even though she smells like a hamster), and Georgia is a fun heroine whom you'll want to follow throughout her year at school.<br />Luckily for us North Americans, a glossary has been provided so that we know what those strange British slang terms (like \\"double cool with knobs\\" and \\"nuddy-pants\\") mean.	2002-09-14

I managed to look past the distracting rhyming adjectives (&quot;bruised and confused&quot;, &quot;wired and tired&quot;). I tried to look past the fact that Reverend Jesse J. Buchanan suddenly became Reverend Samuel J. Buchanan (was there a legal name change we weren't made aware of?). But how on earth did Gavin survive being impaled with &quot;a jagged piece of wooden decking, ugly enough to slay a vampire&quot; without any medical attention? In fact, a few minutes later he's snuggled up with his girlfriend, trying to decide where to go on vacation! Was the editor asleep? Judging by the lapses throughout the book, I'm tempted to suggest that there was no editor.  Too bad... all these problems ruined an otherwise exciting story. Rather than looking forward to reading a sequel (the story is left open-ended enough for a sequel to be possible), I felt like tossing the book across the room. The only reason I give the book two stars instead of one is because it started out with a bang and got me hooked right away. I wish that momentum hadn't been interrupted by such silly, obvious problems.	2002-08-25

This is a great book for writers, or for anyone who is interested in stories.  It's amazing to see how the character archetypes and stages of the hero's journey can be seen in most books and movies.  I felt as if I was privy to a backstage look at storycrafting; now I have a much better appreciation of stories such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; (both of which are studied in the book).  I'm constantly pulling this book out to look at the different sections.  It's great!	2002-05-28

Reading the glowing reviews of this book from other readers, I started to wonder if we had indeed read the same novel. This is the first of Connie Willis' books I've read, but if this is indicative of her other books, it will probably be the last too.<br />The two stars I gave it in my rating are simply because, for the first half of the book, I was spellbound. Then something happened... Suddenly, I felt like I was reading a completely different book. The continuity seemed lost, and I kept getting the feeling that Willis really wasn't sure what she wanted the second half of the book to be about; it seemed tacked on. In the first half, there were hints of things to come... and they never materialized.<br />Also, I found the angle at which the subject matter was tackled a little disturbing. Yes, it is a heavy subject; I didn't have a problem with that. The problem I had was the constant put-downs of any character who didn't share the doctors' purely scientific views. Yes, Mandrake was terribly annoying and somewhat over-the-top in his views, but while reading the story, I began to wonder if the author wasn't just as bad... she almost seems to be using this book as a personal agenda to promote her beliefs. In addition, I felt that many, many pages of scientific explanation could have been cut out (for the layman, hearing about beta-endorphins and cortisol levels for paragraphs on end can get boring).<br />After reading this LONG (nearly 600 pages) book, I felt cheated. I kept reading, hoping that the author could recapture the magic and excitement from the first half. Instead, all I found was a disjointed series of images and events.  All in all, I was very disappointed.	2001-12-07

Then things started to go downhill. Without giving too much away for people who might want to read it, some of the story elements seemed corny, and parts of the ending are hackneyed and contrived. I had such high hopes for this book (and the next ones in the series), but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think I'll be reading the next one... if I do, it'll have to be awfully good to hold my interest through another 300 pages!	2001-08-27

I came across this book at the local library, checked it out, and proceeded to read it from cover to cover, something I rarely do with &quot;how-to&quot; books. Then I had to buy it, because I knew I would be referring to it again and again.  After trying many times, unsuccessfully, to start and continue writing a novel, this book suggested ways to begin writing that hadn't occurred to me before... now, I'm almost finished my first draft! If anything, this book provides some great tips that keep your interest level running high.<br />My only complaint would be that there was not enough about formatting a manuscript. However, there are many other books that can teach that. If you're looking to start writing your book (or you're looking for the confidence to start writing it), then I highly recommend you take a look.	2001-08-20

At first, I wasn't sure that I liked the main character, Corinna, at all.  But I kept at it, and eventually realized some of the reasons why she is the way she is.  Franny  Billingsley's prose is lovely too... she's found ways of describing things  that are so poetic, yet make so much sense.  I would definitely recommend  this book.	2000-04-09

Unfortunately, this book is not as good as the miniseries.  Of course it has the whole wonderful story and the wacky characters, but it wasn't particularly well written.

I'd never heard of it before, but the title captured my imagination.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  I identified so much with Cassandra, it was almost scary... I  felt like someone had been inside my head and written down some of my  thoughts.  I so enjoyed this book that I didn't want it to end.  I hope  this book is discovered by many people.  It is so touching, heartwarming,  and real.  It was a true joy to read.	1998-12-28
