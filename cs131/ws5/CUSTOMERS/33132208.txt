US	33132208	R1Y4IX9OSB6NO5	0553587080	236523182	Haunted	Books	4	71	79	N	N	Avid Reviewer and Reader	Haunted by Kelley Armstrong, is another fantastic adventure in the Women of the Otherworld series.  Haunted has a very unusual main character - Eve Levine, Savannah's mother and a ghost.  Eve was a black witch and a half-demon when alive.  She believed witch magic had been corrupted and diluted, as Paige discovers in Dime Store Magic.  Eve has done many murky things to gain sorcerer and witch spells that she was able to use.  This quest for greater power made Eve careless, which lead to her death before the events of Stolen occurred.  While her death was a peripheral plot line  in the series, the consequences where far reaching for Savannah.  Much of Dime Store Magic was the result of Savannah coming to terms with her mother's death.   <br /> <br />Haunted gives a great deal of insight into how Eve and Savannah are so much alike.  Eve will not let go of Savannah and spends a great of her time in the afterlife checking up on her.  Eve has been reunited with Kristof, Savannah's father, but will not allow him to be more then a friend.  Kristoff is not your average Cabal sorcerer.  He has regretted not pursing Eve and Savannah for 15 years and is determined not to make the same mistake a second time.   <br /> <br />The Fates, overseers of the supernatural afterlife, have decided to call in the favor that Eve garnered at the conclusion of Industrial Magic. Eve is being sent on a mission to track a Nix, a Germanic demi-demon nymph who feeds off chaos.  This particular Nix has been jumping from woman to woman giving them the necessary drive to murder.  The Nix feeds off the chaos and anguish these murders create.  Eventually she grows weary of her partner and devises a way for them to be caught and create even more chaos.  The Fates have sent three previous hunters to catch the Nix and return her to hell.  Each has failed leaving the Nix to continue her reign of terror. <br /> <br />The Fates hope Eve, with her unusual talents will be successful is catching the Nix.  Withthe help of Kirstof, an angel named Trsiel, and the infamous necromancer Jamie Vegas, Eve sets out on a course that changes everything. <br /> <br />Haunted starts out slow and is hard to relate to at first since all the main characters are not corporal beings.  Once the plot with the Nix begins to unfold, the characters transcend death and the afterlife they live in begins to make sense.  Kelley Armstrong is author to be lauded.  Instead of cranking out another adventure using werewolves, witches, or sorcerers, she has created an entire mythological inspired afterlife that exists as another layer to the series.  The world Eve and Kristoff inhabit is fascinating to read about.  The living and the afterlife are connected, but the dead cannot touch, feel, or communicate directly (except through a necromancer)  with the living.  Eve has been desperately searching for a way to influence and protect Savannah - at the cost of her sense of purpose.  The afterlife is supposed to be a nice retirement of the worries of the living.  Eve is definitely not ready for any sort of retirement. <br /> <br />Haunted is well worth reading.  Kelley Armstrong has created an entertaining novel and stretched her wings.  Many writers in her position simply rest on their laurels, but Kelley has instead decided to create something entirely different.  And it works as an entreating piece of fiction. <br /> <br />Kelley Armstrong currently resides in Ontario, Canada with her family.  She has published five books in the Women of the Otherworld series; Bitten, Stolen, Dime Store Magic, Industrial Magic, and Haunted.  The sixth in the series, Broken, will revisit Elena, Clay, and the werewolves and is to be released in May 2006.  A mainstream novel titled Exit Strategy is forthcoming in 2006.

Sookie, the buxom, blond, barmaid from Bon Temps is once again thrust into things that she should not be.  Her psychic abilities make her a magnet for the supernatural world. <br /> <br />At the conclusion of the Dead to the World, Eric has regained his self, but remembers nothing of his time with Sookie.  Jason, Sookie's brother has been found, but is now a werepanther.  Dead as a Doornail opens with Jason experiencing his first full moon as a werepanther.  Amazingly enough, Jason embraces his new life and enjoys shifting.  As much of a relief as this is for Sookie, trouble is looming.  Someone is killing shifters and Jason is the prime suspect.  To add to Sookie's turmoil, Eric does not remember his time with Sookie, but knows something important happened.  In another twist, Debbie's family is desperately searching for her.  This search finds its way to Sookie's doorstep once again. <br /> <br />In Dead as a Doornail we get a much clearer picture of the shifter communities - the werewolves and werepanthers.  Sookie is drawn into the political struggles within the werewolf pack structure.  The outcome is not a happy ending for Sookie or werewolves.  Calvin Norris, the head of the werepanthers in Hot Shot continues to attempt to woo Sookie.   Another love interest is most certainly not something Sookie needs in her already complicated love life.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading Dead as a Doornail immensely.  Sookie and her adventures are always a treat.  The only drawback to this book is that Sookie and the reader become very disappointed when knowledge of certain character defects becomes evident within those close to Sookie.  All of the characters, old and new, add flavor to the series and make Sookie's madcap adventures even more entertaining.  On the whole, Dead as a Doornail is a fun read. <br /> <br />Charlaine Harris is the author of four previous Sookie Stackhouse novels; Dead Until Dark, Living Dead in Dallas, Club Dead, and Dead to the World. She is also the author of two popular mystery novel series, the Aurora Tegarden series and the Lily Bard Shakespeare series. Dead as a Doornail will be published May 3, 2005. <br />	2005-05-03

The four stories contained in the anthology are \\"Weaver of Dreams,\\" \\"the Prince of Ebon Rih,\\" \\"Zuulaman,\\" and \\"Kaeleer's Heart.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Weaver of Dreams\\" is a brief history of the creation of the Spinner of Dreams, spiders.  The evocative, rich, mythological inspiration for Draca's relationship to the spiders is fascinating to read about. <br /> <br />\\"The Prince of Ebon Rih\\" is Lucivar Yaslana and Marian's story.  Many of the customs of Eyrien race are explored along with the intricate love between Lucivar and Marian.  This story takes place at the conclusion of Heir to the Shadows. <br /> <br />\\"Zuulaman\\" is the story of the lengths Hekatah went to try and control Saetan. We learn a great deal about Hayll's Hundred Families and how Saetan became the ruler of the Dhemlan Territories.  This story of treachery shows just how far Hekatah was willing to go to get her way. <br /> <br />\\"Kaeleer's Heart\\" is the long awaited story of what happened after the conclusion of Queen of Darkness.  Janelle is healing, but not fast enough for Daemon.  The real question is if Janelle wants to be all that she once was.  Also addressed is the significance of Twilights Dawn, the jewel Janelle now wears.  Many of the vibrant characters seen in the Black Jewels Trilogy make appearances in the story. <br /> <br />Dreams Made Flesh is a nice addition to the Black Jewels Trilogy.  \\"Zuulaman\\" explains much of Saetan and Hekatah.  \\"Kaeleer's Heart\\" puts a wonderful spin on the ending to the Queen of Darkness and gives a much more satisfying end to the series.  The weakness of this anthology is that is not a stand alone.  This book is primarily for fans of the series. <br /> <br />Anne Bishop is the author numerous fantasy books, the Black Jewels Trilogy; Daughter of the Blood, Heir to the Shadows, and Queen of Darkness.

Hamilton <br />[...] <br />Publisher:  Ballantine Books  <br />ISBN:  0-345-44357-8 <br />Release Date:  April 12, 2005 <br />Format:  HC <br />Pages:  366 <br />Price: $23.95 <br />Cover Artist:  Judy York <br /> <br /> <br />A Stroke of Midnight is Laurell K. Hamilton's fifth installed in the Merry Gentry series.   While the plot-line moves forward in the series, A Stroke of Midnight is not a strong piece on its own.   <br /> <br />At the conclusion of Seduced by Moonlight, Merry and her guards have survived numerous assassinations, violent encounters with other Fae, and lots of sex.  Merry should be ready for sleep, but instead she is the focus of a press conference.  It would appear the media is very interested in her life - each and every titillating tidbit they can glean from Merry herself and those around her.  During the press conference, a double homicide occurs - a lesser Fae and a human reporter.  Merry insists that a human investigation be done, and manipulates Queen Andais to this end.  The importance of this investigation is never completely clear, other then as a way for Merry to avenge her father's murder.   <br /> <br />A Stroke of Midnight has a great deal going on when the characters are not engaged in sexual encounters.  We learn much about Merry's father and how his death affected her.  With each Fae that Merry brings into godhead, the Sithern Farie Mound begins to regain its power and renew life.  The story takes place during one night, but the Sithern has altered time so one night lasts a very long time.   <br /> <br />In the scope of the book, A Stroke of Midnight is much stronger then Seduced by Moonlight.  The plot is continued, but much is left out.  Too many characters are introduced with not enough time for the reader to become attached to them.  The sex scenes are less numerous then previous books, but they are not erotic.  Merry is a woman who can do things a Tijuana whore would beunable to do.  While I recognize this is fantasy and hence anything can happen, I wish for a little more realism.  The sex acts themselves dominate so much storyline, it is impossible not to wish for more character development.  A Stroke of Midnight will satisfy those Hamilton fans that have embraced the sexual tone of her recent works. <br /> <br />Laurell K. Hamilton is the St. Louis author of twelve Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series books and four novels in the Meredith Gentry series; A Kiss of Shadows, a Caress of Twilight, Seduced by Moonlight, and A Stroke of Midnight.  She has published numerous short stories and novellas in various anthologies along with a novel which was recently re-released, Nightseer.   <br />	2005-04-28

I highly recommend this wonderfully imaginative series. <br /> <br />The Autumn Castle introduces use to a group of artist who are currently working under a fellowship which allows them to live at the Hotel Mandy Z. in Berlin, Germany.  The fellowship is through a very eccentric artist, Immanuel Zweigler whom everyone calls Mandy Z.  Jude, one of the artists, lives with his girlfriend, Christine Starlight.  Christine is an American who lived in Berlin as a child.  The artists are rounded out by Gerda, Pete, and Fabiyan. <br /> <br />Christine has had a very difficult life.  While living in Berlin, she befriended a neighbor child everyone called little May.  May and Christine were inseparable.  One night, May disappeared and was presumed dead.  Christine and her parents moved back to America shortly after May's disappearance.  In 1989, she lost her parents in a horrific car accident that left her with horrid injuries.  The car accident was caused by another driver who never even paused to see if anyone survived.  Life was bleak for Christine until Jude appeared in her life like a knight in shinning armor. <br /> <br />Mandy Z. is a very complex and creepy man.  He is a world renowned sculptor and is also color blind.  Along with being incredibly wealthy, he is also an insane sociopath.  He is secretly working on a bizarre sculpture he calls the Bone Wife.  This sculpture is not made of marble or any other stone, but of fairy bones.  Mandy Z. has a unique gift that allows him to know when a person is really a Fairy.   <br /> <br />One fateful day, Christine injures herself and is transported to Ewigkreis, Fairyland.  In this strange land, Christine encounters a talking fox named Eisengrimm and the Fairy Queen.  Queen Mayfridh is Christine's childhood friend, May.   As children, they preformed a `blood bond' that allowed Christine to enter Ewigkreis.One characteristic of Fairyland is residents forget about humans and our world once the seasons change.  Queen Mayfridh is amazed and intrigued to be reunited with her friend Christine.  After Christine returns to the real world, Mayfridh longs for all she lost when she entered Ewigkreis.  Soon a plan is hatched to allow Mayfridh to visit the world she left as a child. <br /> <br />The residents of Hotel Mandy Z. are on a collision course with Mayfridh.  She brings out many dark secrets and tempts Mandy Z. to commit unspeakable acts.  Mayfridh's visit brings all these horrors and more to pass.  Christine, Jude, and the rest are never the same again. <br /> <br />Kim Wilkins has created an incredible tale of morality and madness to delight.  Her characters are rich and multidimensional.  The plot does seem to lag at times, but that is a result of dealing with character development.  We get to know the residents of Hotel Mandy Z. and Ewigkreis very intimately.  The twists and turns created in the plot are amazing in their ingenuity.  This is not a typical Fairytale nor is it a typical fantasy.  At the end, Wilkins treats us to a real Fairytale that closes the plot in such a way that you crave more. <br /> <br />Kim Wilkins lives in Australia and is the author of numerous books.  Her Europa series continues with the Giants of the Frost - available in Australia, and the Snow Witch - to be released July, 2005 in Australia.

Hendee's third book in the Noble Dead series.   Once again, we join Magiere and Leesil on their journey for the truth - no matter where it takes them.  Wynn, an apprentice sage, and Chap, a Fay spirit in dog form, round out this intrepid traveling group. <br /> <br />Magiere is a dhampir, half-human and half-vampire.  She is a hybrid created for unknown reasons.  In Dhampir, Magiere was introduced to Welstiel Massing, a Noble Dead (vampire) who told her she was created to kill other Noble Dead.  In Thief of Lives, Welstiel is unmasked and Magiere learns his true intentions - to force her to find an artifact that will allow Welstiel to become human again.  Needless to say, Magiere is not one to appreciate being manipulated and has vowed to never help Welstiel in his quest. <br /> <br />At the conclusion of Thief of Lives, Magiere and Leesil have decided two different treks are in order.  Leesil, half-elf and half-human, has just found out that his elvish mother, Nein'a is still alive.  Leesil has vowed to find out her fate.  He believed his parents were executed after he deserted employment as an assassin to a powerful lord.   <br /> <br />Magiere seeks to find out why she was created.  Her mother, Magelia was impregnated by a Noble Dead with Magiere the result.  Magelia died shortly after Magiere's birth and she was raised by her Aunt Bieja in the small village of Chemestúk in the country of Droevinka.  Life was hard for Magiere as the other villagers never accepted her.   <br /> <br />Leesil and Magiere decide to head to Chemestúk first as it is closer.  This decision brings about much knowledge and even more questions.  The events around Magiere's birth are even more complex then anyone had previously considered.  The journey is arduous for all and much is revealed. <br /> <br />Sister of the Dead is a wonderful addition to the Noble Dead series.  While certain mysterious are answered, even more are created.  Leesil and Magiere's relationship deepens.  We learn more about Chap and what his intentions are.  Sister of the Dead leads us on an amazing adventure that will keep you engrossed until the final chapter.  <br /> <br />The Noble Dead series is a mix of high-fantasy and traditional vampire fiction.  This makes the series unique and interesting.  The fantasy elements are interwoven with the vampire lore.  Magiere is a hybrid and as such struggles with her nature.  Leesil has similar struggles as he is also a hybrid.  The two together present both sides of the mixed genres.  This is a series that will appeal to both horror and fantasy fans. <br /> <br />Barb & J.C. Hendee are a husband/wife pair of writers. Dhampir is the first in the Noble Dead series, followed by Thief of Lives, and Sister of the Dead.  Traitor to the Blood, fourth in the series, is scheduled to be published in January, 2006.

Cast is a wonderful follow-up to Cast's first novel, Goddess by Mistake.  Elphame's Choice is set in the same world, Partholon about 125 years after the events in Goddess by Mistake. <br /> <br />Elphame, the great-granddaughter of Rhiannon and the daughter of Etain, the current Goddess Incarnate is struggling to find her way.  Born part-human and part-centaur, she is worshiped by the people of Partholon and she hates it.  Elphame is a woman - not a goddess.  Epona, the Goddess, has never directly spoken to Elphame.  As a matter of fact, Elphame has never experienced anything magical except her hybrid looks.   <br /> <br />MacCallan Castle, according to Goddess by Mistake was the site of a terrible atrocity.  The Fomorians, vampire-like demons attacked the castle, murdered all the men and used the woman as incubators for their children.  Fomorians had lost the ability to reproduce and had discovered that human woman could be used for children.  These women died a horrible death at the birth of these Fomorian off-spring.  With the help of Rhiannon and Epona, the Fomorians were defeated and driven into the Wastelands.  MacCallan Castle was destroyed when it was used a funeral pyre for the dead. <br /> <br />Elphame has decided MacCallan Castle should be rebuilt.  She hopes those who join her endeavor will accept her just as a woman and not a goddess.  To assist her in rebuilding the castle are her brother, Cuchulainn, Danann, Stonemaster and centaur, Brighid, a Huntress and centaur, Brenna, a Healer, and many others.  This band of young people are hopeful that MacCallan Castle will be a place for them to start over and have a better way of life. <br /> <br />The Fomorians are not done with Partholon.  While the original Fomorians have long since died off of a plague, their children have survived.  Epona, in her infinite wisdom, allowed some of the mothers to survive.  These mothers loved their children, even though they where fathered by Fomorians.  These hybrid children raised by loving mothers fight a constant battle to retain their humanity.  Lochlan, their leader, believes in a prophecy told to him by his mother - the hybrid Fomorians will gain salvation from madness with the blood of a dying Goddess.  Lochlan believes this to be Elphame - who is also his lifemate. <br /> <br />P.C. Cast has created a wonderful and rich mythology for Elphame's Choice.  The intricate characterizations make the book very interesting to read.  This is not just as standard romantic fantasy.  There are no buxom heroines in distress.  Elphame is strong in both character and body.  While some parts of the story are traditional romance, most is not.  The storyline has a few twists that are not anticipated.  The fantasy element of the book is what dominates the storyline.  The ending will even surprise most.  It is not your typical `happy ever after.'  I enjoyed reading this book.   <br /> <br />P.C. Cast is a professional teacher and speaker.  Her first book, Goddess by Mistake won the Holt Medallion in the category of best paranormal romance, The Prism Award, and the Laurel Wreath Award for Excellence in Published Romance Fiction.  Goddess by Mistake will be re-released by Luna entitled Partholon by Mistake in the fall of 2005.  Her other works include Goddess of Spring, Goddess of the Sea, and Goddess of Light.

The world of this duo is a future Cincinnati which has survived a genetically engineered tomato plague that has exposed `supernaturals' to the world.  The supernaturals have staked out a community called the Hallows.  To humans, the Hollows is like Vegas or New Orleans during Mardi Gras - a definite walk on the wild side and tourist trap. <br /> <br />Rachel is back with a vengeance along with Jenks, her pixie sidekick, and Ivy, the living vamp.  The story begins about a month after the conclusion of Dead Witch Walking.  Rachel is still struggling to earn her half of expenses at the church with Ivy.  Rachel's new association with FIB - the Federal Inderlander Bureau, police force for humans, finally pans out.  On the surface the case appears simple - Sara Jane's warlock boyfriend has disappeared.  Normally IS, police force for supernaturals, would handle the case, but they have a 72 hour waiting period.  Rachel jumps at the chance to be involved for the money and Sara Jane is Trent Kalamack's secretary. <br /> <br />As normal, nothing is as it seems.  Dan, Sara Jane's boyfriend, may be one in a string of grisly murders of ley line witches.  Ley line witches tap into the Ever-After using ley lines for their power.  Rachel is at a disadvantage as she failed the ley line witch class she took in college.  She is also very leery of the Ever-After due to the demon attack in Dead Witch Walking and the death of her father.  Rachel finds many links to Trent, but is unable to find hard proof to satisfy Detective Edden of the FIB.    <br /> <br />The Hallows is the incredible world created by Kim Harrison.  The alternate world of the Ever-After with a demon city is very interesting.  Rachel finally takes us to Pizza Piscary and we get to meet the master vampire Piscary himself.  Kist and his motorcycle are back to torment Rachel.  During the course of the novel, we finally get a much clearerpicture of what Trent Kalamack is and what his motives are. <br /> <br />The Good, the Bad, and the Undead far exceeded my expectations after Dead Witch Walking.  The storyline branches out in many directions that are unexpected and thrilling to read.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ride and am anxiously awaiting the third installment, Every Which Way But Dead due out in July of 2005. <br /> <br />Kim Harrison describes herself as born in the Midwest.  She has been called a witch, among other things, but has never seen a vampire (that she knows of). She loves graveyards and midnight jazz, and wears too much black.

We are once again immersed in the world of our empathic heroine, Holly-Anne Feather.   <br /> <br />Holly-Anne and her human boyfriend Ryan have decided to take a trip to Charlotte to visit Ryan's cousin Drew.  As usual, strange creatures and events seem to look for Holly and anyone with her.  Michele, the Vampire Holder of Charlotte and a male, embroils Holly in a dispute with the Elves of the Shamorah.  This dispute threatens to destroy Charlotte and many people that Holly holds dear. <br /> <br />In Tainted Blood, Holly is forced to find a way to come to terms with her abilities and her status as the Companion of Lucien, Vampire Holder of Edwards.  This is not easy for such an independent, feisty character as Holly.  She finds herself drawn into the vampire world of Lucien and Michele and is not happy about it.   <br /> <br />Tainted Blood introduces us to many interesting characters.  Ryan's cousin Drew is over the top neurotic metaphysical spiritualist.  We meet various different elves; Pren, King Tashae, Queen Aisling, and Princess Saeling.  Holly even picks up a bodyguard named Leigh who is a Nymph.  Last but not least is the vampire Ted who befriends Holly. <br /> <br />Tainted Blood is interesting to read, but does have some problems.  It is too bad this book was not picked up by a major publisher.  What is needs is to be very thoroughly edited by professionals.  It is written in a first person narrative that works for the most part.  Unfortunately, the narrative reads as Holly thinks in her mind.  The result is many run on sentences and grammatical errors.  The book contained a continuity error that made one section of the book frustrating to read.  Tainted Blood is a vast improvement over Bonnefoux's first novel, Blood and Mind, but still needs more attention.   <br /> <br />The story line and the characters are all very interesting and entertaining.  Comparisons can be made to Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series and Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series.  This is a series and author to keep a look out for.  I am certain a major publisher will take notice in the near future. <br /> <br />Melanie Lee Bonnefoux is a `lover of things that go bump in the night' and the author of Blood and Mind.

Somewhere in the world, nuclear warheads where launched escalating into war.  Everyone was glued to the television with TV announcers giving us 20 minutes until the end of the world.  Then they appeared on TV with an offer no one would refuse - We will save Earth from destruction if you allow us to study man-kind.  The Observers got what they requested with no resistance. <br />Zara Mitchells is just a small town owner of a dinner trying to make ends meet.  After her parents died, she was forced to support her younger brother.  When the Observers first appeared on TV that fateful day, Zara's life became a nightmare.  She began sleepwalking with horrid nightmares.  Zara is convinced the Observers have nefarious designs on humanity, but no proof.  Everyone in the small town Zara lives is convinced she is crazy.   <br />Life is just beginning to get easier.  Zara is finally able to move on - an application to the local community college awaits her at home, the diner has enough staff to allow her free-time, and her brother is currently in college.  Then in walks an Observer, a silvery eyed alien.  Everything in Zara's life changes once again.   <br />The Observer, Caelan is convinced Zara is the fulfillment of a prophecy and he will do anything to gain her compliance.  Zara is very confused.  She doesn't know if she can trust Caelan.  Everything in her life has been destroyed in some way by the Observers.  How can she trust a being whose existence caused her so much pain?  Why is another Observer trying to kill her? <br />Thus begins The Silver Spoon by local Chicago author Stacey Klemstein.  The storyline slowly evolves with a mystery woven into the story that has some unanticipated twists and turns.  Klemstein sets a pace that allows the reader to become involved in the storyline.  Caelan and Zara are very likable characters who have many layers to theirpersonalities.  Zara has a wonderful sense of humor that comes out in her dialogue.   <br />While it would be easy to classify The Silver Spoon as a romance, that would vastly underrate the book.  The book has a romance element, but it is more of an entertaining science fiction adventure.   <br />	2004-12-21

The Otherworld series is a world not much different from our own, but includes demons, deities, vampires, werewolves, witches, sorcerers, shaman, druids, necromancers, clairvoyants, and much more.  The supernatural world lies just under the surface of the known world and definitely has nasty teeth.

Since Lucas is estranged from his father, Paige was never supposed to be approached by Benicio.    <br /> <br />Benicio is not to be denied his meeting with Paige.  It would seem he has a case he wants Lucas to take.  Someone is killing Cabal children.  The latest victim is Dana, a homeless teenage witch.   <br /> <br />Paige and Lucas want nothing to do with the Cabals; especially after Savannah's father of the Nast Cabal tried to take custody of her in Dime Store Magic.  Kristoff Nast paid with his life for this, but Paige lost everything she held dear; her house, her reputation, and most of all, her coven.  A trip to Miami is taken to politely refuse Benicio and set clear boundaries with the Cabal regarding Paige.   <br /> <br />The adventure begins to unfold in Miami as Lucas and Paige struggle to keep clear of Benicio's manipulations and still help the supernatural children being targeted.  Nothing is ever as it seems in the world of Cabals.  This case pits Lucas and Paige against the killer and the Cabals.    Wequickly realize why Lucas wants nothing to do with Benicio and the other Cabals. <br /> <br />Many of our favorite characters from previous novels appear in Industrial Magic - Elena, Clay, Jeremy, and Cassandra.  We meet a new character, Jamie - a TV personality who talks to the dead and just happens to be a necromancer.  Jamie really livens things up for Paige and Lucas.   <br /> <br />Industrial Magic is a book not to be missed.  The action is fantastic and the drama is very intense.  Kelley Armstrong creates such fun characters that really jump off the pages.  The book is fast paced with lots of unexpected turns.  Like the other books in the Otherworld series, I wanted more after finishing Industrial Magic. <br /> <br />Kelley Armstrong is the Canadian author of four books in the Otherworld series; Bitten, Stolen, Dime Store Magic, and Industrial Magic.  The fifth book in the series, Haunted is to be published in the Spring of 2005.  Available on her website, [...] , are three online novellas that further the werewolves' storyline. <br />	2004-10-31

Very little about the legends are true - except that a magical place exists called the Summer Country.  James Hetley has taken a modern fantasy tale and reminded us that happy endings never happen in the real world.  Winter Oak is a wonderful follow-up to the Summer Country.   <br /> <br />At the conclusion of the Summer Country, Maureen had come into her own as a witch by killing Dougal and defeating Fiona.  Maureen rescued Brian from his half-sister Fiona's twisted binding and found a way to free her sister, Jo and David, Jo's boyfriend.  Maureen suddenly finds herself in possession of a castle with slaves, a boyfriend, a very pissed-off dragon, powers she is just beginning to understand, and benefactress of a forest with unknown delights and dangers.  <br /> <br />Winter Oak starts with Jo and David's return to the real world and all its troubles.  Time has elapsed and Jo and David cannot just return to their lives as if nothing has happened.  Too much has happened for all to be as it was.  David and Jo must find a way to face all the changes and to decide if they do indeed love each other. <br /> <br />Childhood sexual abuse and other abuses have scarred Maureen and negatively effected Jo.  Each finds a sort of solace and succor in a bottle.  Of course alcohol only provides temporary relief and creates more problems.  Jo is forced to reckon with her parent's relationship - the outcome of which will change everything for Jo and Maureen. <br /> <br />Maureen is haunted by all around her.  She cannot accept Brian's love nor can she fathom why he remains.  The bottle provides a means to deaden all the pain in her mind.  Luckily, Maureen has the forest to support and love her unconditionally.   <br /> <br />Brian finds himself thrust into a web of deceit and betrayal involving the Pendragons.  He is unwilling forced to leave Maureen and in order to hang onto his own life.  Muchis revealed in his struggle to return to Maureen. <br /> <br />The wicked black witch Fiona lends a macabre presence in the Summer Country.  Having impregnated herself with her own half-brother, Brian, she plots to destroy Maureen and Jo.  Fiona crafts magic and science to bring ruin to those she feels threatened by.  Fiona lies in wait, probing for weaknesses she can use to destroy Maureen, Jo, and Brian. <br /> <br />After reading Winter Oak, I was stunned by the depth of the continuing story started in the Summer Country.  The dark, twisted, urban fantasy only expanded to another level while allowing us readers to enjoy the ride.  Maureen is so burdened by all her problems that it is easy to understand how hopeless she feels.  The addition of alcohol makes the scene that much more depressing.  Maureen's descent into alcoholism is incredibly realistic and painful to read.   <br /> <br />The realism of Jo and David's difficulties further validates James Hetley as not your average fantasy author.  While most fantasy books rely on the fantastic to convey interesting stories, Hetley relies on the underbelly of what we all have come to believe in as real.  Reality is gritty and has teeth.  The Winter Oak is earthy, dark, and yet redeeming all at once.  Each character plays a part in their own redemption.  No one waves a wand or casts a spell that suddenly makes all their unhappiness and pain go away.  Instead, magic only enhances their abilities to survive and to heal.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-21
US	33132208	R3OEEEEQI4WZ5C	0425198243	55431338	Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake Vampire Hunter)	Books	4	52	94	N	N	Avid Reviewer and Reader	Incubus Dreams is author Laurell K. Hamilton's latest installment in the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series.  After 11 books in this series, Hamilton still manages to surprise the reader with new material. <br /> <br />Incubus Dreams opens at a wedding - Tammy and Larry's.  This is not a church event as the blushing bride is not only a cop, but a witch as well.  Not to mention that the groom raises the dead for a living.  It would seem a Halloween theme has been somehow made to fit for a wedding - orange bridesmaid dresses, orange and black decorations, and so on.  Thankfully, Anita is on the groom's side and allowed to wear a tux as a `groomsman.'  The Anita we know has been forced into many a bridesmaid dress - but the orange creations for this wedding are horrid in every way.   <br /> <br />As with any event in Anita's life, a murder takes place and she is forced to leave the wedding to fulfill her duties as a consultant to the Regional Preternatural Investigation Unit and a Federal Marshal.  The murder is almost tame after the murder scenes visited in Narcissus in Chains and Cerulean Sins.  Just a dead stripper.  Only twist is that this stripper seems to have been drained dry by multiple vampires.  While Anita is positive none of her lover and the vampire Master of the City Jean-Claude's vampires would commit this crime, others are not convinced.  Anita must face many prejudices and find ways to fit into the cop mentality once again. <br /> <br />To add more spice to the murder storyline, Anita, Jean-Claude, and Richard - werewolf and Ulfric, enter into a new power level.  This creates many conflicts within Anita's life.  Not only must she embrace Richard's beast and her own, but into this comes her `vampire servant' Damian's loneliness, everyone's rage, Jean-Claude's blood lust and ardeur to round out the mix.  Everything in Anita's life hinges on her ability to be flexible and accepting.  These are not two characteristics that Anita has been known to posses inthe past.   <br /> <br />Incubus Dreams delivers to more then just a die hard Hamilton fan.  The mystery/murder is interesting and allows us to experience the horror of the monsters.  Anita has just enough friction from her fellow investigators to remind us just how sexist and bigoted the old boy's school mentality can be.  Her new powers enhance her skills in the investigation, but also hinder her with their baggage.  Nothing is every straight forward with Anita and her powers. <br /> <br />While many consider the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series to be nothing more than erotica, they are vastly underrating the series.  Incubus Dreams does contain many explicit sexual encounters.  Some of these encounters are not pleasant to read - nor do I think they are meant to be.  The powerful sexual incubus that Jean-Claude has inadvertently shared with Anita is not amiable.  It is a driving force that she must feed or face the consequences.  This dilemma gives rise to the sexual acts.  The sexuality is not gratuitous in nature and has a purpose in the story arc of the entire series. <br /> <br />Incubus Dreams allows the reader to see that Laurell K. Hamilton is still able to produce amazing characters in mind-blowing situations.  The story line of the mystery/murder and Anita's life is continued, but more complete then any of the previous books.  Hamilton has allowed herself to write until she has completed the story and it shows in the 658 pages of Incubus Dreams.  I look forward to the next installment of Anita Blake. <br /> <br />Laurell K. Hamilton is the St. Louis author of twelve Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series books and three novels in the Meredith Gentry series.  She has also published a number of short stories along with another novel recently re-released, Nightseer.   <br />	2004-09-28

Subtitled as \\"an erotic tale of love and vengeance\\" like no other, Mortal Companion delivers.  Patrick Califia has created a world where everything is possible and nothing is taboo.  This world is opened up to the reader layer by layer - chapter by chapter - until the final climatic end which leaves us panting and waiting for the sequel.<br /> <br />Mortal Companion introduces us to Ulric, a very depressed vampire.  Life, as he experiences it has become drudgery.  Nothing gives him pleasure - even feeding leaves him wanting.  One evening, in an unknown small town, Mary Beth Wolcott reveals herself.  Ulric is immediately smitten and begins a sensual assault that Mary Beth is unable to resist.  Ulric wins her heart and soul and makes her his mortal companion, renamed Lilith.<br /> <br />Lilith and Ulric begin a journey to San Francisco and to Ulric's past.  Lilith learns how Ulric was the victim of the Germanic Knights of the Sepulcher.  He was made a vampire by rape of the mind, body, and soul.  This horrific beginning culminated in the rape and a feeding from Adulfa, Ulric's own half-sister.  Adulfa swore vengeance on Ulric for his rape and forcing vampirism on her.  <br /> <br />Adulfa is more then just a vampire.  She began life as a shapeshifter.  She is a reckless woman bent on seeking pleasure through domination of the body and mind.  She has been planning her revenge against Ulric for hundreds of years and nothing will stop her.  Lilith is her ticket to making Ulric pay for violating her.  <br /> <br />Lilith and Ulric are aware of Adulfa's rage, but are so caught up within their insulated world they have a false sense of security.  Ulric introduces Lilith to the BDSM community and a sex slave is born.  Lilith gives herself over completely to Ulric.  This trust is pivotal in what is to come.  <br /> <br />Mortal Companion is an interesting and entertaining book.  While the sex is explicit and violent at times, it has a purpose.  Lilith and Ulric continuously switch roles.  Neither is completely dominate over the other.  It is clear that complete domination is not love, but sharing roles gives Lilith and Ulric a true, heart wrenching, undying love.  While it can be argued this their undoing, it is beautiful to read of that kind of bonding.  Each chapter switches character point of view effortlessly, giving the reader a voyeuristic journey.  Each perspective - male/female - top/bottom - draws the reader further into a San Francisco most have only heard of.  <br /> <br />My favorite characters by far are the vampire cats; Luna, Anastasia, Charley, and Hecate.  These cats guard Ulric's house in San Francisco and play a very important role in the ending of the book.  Califia has created the cats with individual personalities and separates voices.  Luna speaks so eloquently that her words are like poems within the book.<br /> <br />Parts of Mortal Companion have appeared is various anthologies.  Author Patrick Califia has written many different short stories and books on sexuality and Lesbian issues.  He currently suffers from fibromyalgia and lives in San Francisco.  When he is not reading other people's vampire stories, Patrick is spoiling his kitty cat or disciplining deserving masochists. He says, \\"Cats, unlike people, are innocent.\\"	2004-07-20

Not only do you not know who you are - but you have no clue if you are dead or alive - in heaven or hell.  Then others begin arriving in the same condition.  So starts the Shivered Sky by Matt Dinniman.      The world of the Shivered Sky is not heaven or hell - it is another existence altogether.  Cibola, the city of Angels has been overrun with demons from other worlds.  The billions of Angels are caught unawares and the city is lost one fateful day.      The war is over and the Angels are trying to just survive.  Our wayward humans; Indigo, Gramm, Dave, Ricco, and Hitomi find themselves thrust into this war without knowing whose side to fight on.  The Demons attack them, but the Angels treat them like slaves.  Confused about all this, our gang realizes nothing is as it seems.  Luckily, this group has been given possession of an awesome weapon, periscepters.  These weapons look like a simple flashlight, but the light blasts from them disintegrate any Demon in its path.  Periscepters have `true light' which destroys Demons but is harmless to Angels and humans.  The war between the Angels and Dominion controlled Demons escalates with our human's caught in the middle.      Shivered Sky is not what it seems.  This Dark Fantasy is extremely engaging with an original story line.  Each chapter brings more understanding of the world and its inhabitants.  The ending is climatic and a complete surprise.  Cibola is an amazing city with incredible buildings with unknown characteristics.  Dinniman has created a diverse, imaginative world that will entertain you just with its descriptions.      Another interesting aspect of the Shivered Sky is that God is missing.  The book is not about any religious theology, but about the struggle to survive and learn from past mistakes.  God is missing for a reason that will become apparent towards the end of the book    According to the author's website, Matt Dinniman currently resides in Tucson, Arizona with his wife and family. He is the senior editor at Artichoke Down Press, and has had many occupations throughout his life. He has worked as a pizza delivery driver, a security guard, an EMT, a private investigator, an editor, a telephone psychic, and an obituary writer--and that's just the beginning.

Readers who enjoy fantasy with a hint of romance will enjoy this unusual first novel.  This fantasy is a fun read with an interesting and unusual heroine, Lady Angarred Hashan.  <br />Angarred, a fiery red-head, is a lady of the realm, but she has grown-up far from court.  Her father was banished from court by the King many years ago.  Her mother died around the same time, leaving Angarred to the care of her bitter, power obsessed father. <br />One fateful day, Lord Hashan is killed while hunting with hangers-on, leaving Angarred with a decrepit, poor inheritance.  Angarred travels to Pergodi, the capital of the realm, to seek out the King to gain vengeance for her father.<br />All is not well in Pergodi.  Angarred fights an uphill battle to gain access to the King and to unravel the mystery of her father?s death.  Court intrigue is alien to Angarred and she finds few friends to help her.  <br />All this takes a backseat when Angarred learns of the stone ? the King?s magician wants it along with other kingdoms and races want it for the power it can wield.  The stone has many secrets that Angarred and her magician friend, Mathewar must unravel.<br />Daughter of Exile slowly evolves as the story progresses. Angarred is a feisty, young woman who faces many adversaries.  She is an interesting character ? not your normal heroine in a fantasy.  There is nothing ?soft? about Angarred.  Mathewar is another interesting puzzle to unravel.  He is a sattery addict and therefore, not your typical leading man/love interest.  Angarred and Mathewar are somehow fated to find the stone and bring peace to the realm.	2004-07-06

Hetley is a wonderful first novel not to be missed.  <br />Maureen Pierce is a very troubled young woman.  She was sexually abused as a child, and as a result feels damaged.  She feels like she wears a psychic chastity belt as a result of the years of abuse.  Maureen is unable to trust any man and has allowed her fears to push her into an existence that she loathes.  Her sister, Jo has just stolen the man Maureen has spent the past two months allowing to get close to her - David.  The betrayal she feels erodes any sense of self-esteem she has fought for. <br />One fateful evening, Maureen is attacked in an alley by a very strange being - almost looks like a troll.    Maureen's worst fear has come true - someone is attacking her.  To the rescue comes a knight in shinning armor - Brian Albion - a Pendragon Knight.  Brian dispenses with Maureen's attacker and then continues to explain to Maureen that she is not a normal woman.  She is a carrier of the `Old Blood' and unaware of its power.    <br />The Old World is literally the old world of magic.  It's called the Summer Country and is home to magical beings of all kinds.  Maureen's power is very desirable to the residents of the Summer Country.  Most of the residents of this Celtic Otherworld are sterile.  Maureen is not and that makes her a target.  Women in the Summer Country are either sorceress or slaves.  Dougal MacKenzie has decided Maureen is his perfect mate and he will do anything to posses her and her future children.  <br />Brian has been sent to protect Maureen as best he can.  The Pendragon Knight's are all that stand between the Summer Country and the `real' world.  Maureen does not play the damsel in distress and fights any protective measure Brian takes.  <br />The Summer Country is a very fun book to read.  It deals with many dark emotions, but is tempered by true love and friendship.  The characters are well written and diverse.  Maureen is such a wonderfully damaged person who decides to live and overcome her demons.  <br />Charles de Lint says it best - \\"Like an old Irish whiskey - dark and smoky, abounding in flavor and detail .... All the tings a good novel should be.\\"<br />The Summer Country is James A. Hetley's first novel.  The sequel, the Winter Oak will be published in November, 2004.  According to the author's website, he is an architect and retired Kempo karate instructor who lives in Maine. He also served three years in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, and has worked such diverse jobs as electronics instructor, trash collector, and operating engineer in a refrigeration plant.

While the back cover sounds interesting, the book itself is not enjoyable to read.<br />Fisher of Devils reinvents the bible as seen through Steve Redwood's mind.  God created Adam with a dangly and wobblies.  Adam questions God about this appendage and God shows Adam how to `pleasure' himself.  The Adam from the Fisher of Devils is not the Adam of the Bible.  He is whinny, self-centered, and very jealous of the Angels.<br />After much complaining from Adam, God created Eve.  Eve was God's epiphany.  He created her with a snuggly similar to what the Angels saw when they visited the world corrupted by Satan.<br />Fisher of Devils continues on with its interpretation of the Bible all the way to the Apocalypse.  While some of the stories are humorous - most are difficult to read.  I did not enjoy this book.	2004-06-21

Rose lives in Mexico in a post-apocalyptic Earth where people just disappear regularly.  Rose learns that her mother and the rest of the World Council have entered into an arrangement with aliens called the Domain.  In return for technology, Earth provides slaves - innocent human lives.  Through treachery, Rose finds herself in a cube hurtling through space as a slave.<br />Solians, as humans are called by the Domain are greatly desired as pleasure slaves.  It would seem as though the aliens of the Domain have lost the ability to be spontaneously sexual.  They have lust cycles that are dictated by the race of the alien.  Solians are able to be sexual at any time and this makes them ideal as sexual slaves.<br />Rose is not happy with her enslavement and does everything she can to escape.  Lucky for Rose, she meets Ash, a hir and hermaphrodite slave.  Together, they have a chance at freedom, but have no idea what to do once they are free.<br />The Domain has enslaved many different worlds.  One world that is trying to fight back is Qin.  Qin is mired in political apathy that seems insurmountable.  S'jen, a Qin battleship captain has decided the time is ripe for the Qin to strike directly at the Domain.  This strike places Rose and Ash together and changes the entire tactics of the Qin.  <br />The Domain, Qin, and the Solian slaves begin a war that takes many prisoners and has a huge cost in life.  Nothing will ever be the same for Rose and all her comrades.  <br />Slave Trade is an interesting read, but does not contain any titillating sexual encounters.  They story is more of a space-opera/action adventure in genre.  The beginning of the book is a bit on the boring side as each player is meticulously introduced and we are given a glimpse into their motivations.  Once the action starts, things get interesting.  <br />According to her website, Susan Wright writes science fiction novels and nonfiction books on art and popular culture.

The Piaculum is difficult to categorize as it has many different levels to the story.<br />The Piaculum is set in a future, post-apocalyptic Earth.  We follow the story of Cearl, a young man with a white-mark and a Mone.  The Mone are non-violent farmers, who value family and religion.  They are poor farmers who eek out a living in a desert-like landscape.  The white-mark Cearl has is rare.  It is similar to an albino.  He has pale skin compared to the dark color of the other Mone.  <br />Cearl is an inquisitive young man.  His father is atypical of the Mone in that he fosters his son's ability to think for himself.  The Mone have a version of the Bible called the Book of Testaments.  Cearl is encouraged to read the Book of Testaments and to interpret it himself.  This background is crucial for the upcoming trials Cearl must face.<br />In contrast to the Mone are the Kathe.  They are more prosperous city-dwellers who are religious fanatics.  The Kath have a much different interpretation of the Book of Testaments.  To them, Christ gave his only son for crucifixion in order for all to ascend to heaven.  In order for a Kathe to receive salvation, he must consume the blood of a white-mark male who is a living, walking, and crucifixion - a Piaculum.  Only a Piaculum as a living God can grant salvation.  <br />Every 12 years the Kathe send out armies to search out all young males with the white-mark.  These children are horribly tortured by a series of ascensions which result in metal chassis being integrated into their bodies.  The Kathe have no mercy for a Piaculum as the pain and suffering they carry allows others into heaven.<br />The Kathe restrict reading to only a chosen few and by doing so ensures the fervor of it's citizens.  In contrast, Mone families read the Book of Testaments every night together.  This crucial difference is pivotal to the story-line.<br />According to Richard Gray, the Kathe are modeled after Mormons.  It is easy to insert most any religious fanatics who rule by restricting knowledge into the Kathe.  Cearl's father instructed him to also read and interpret the Book of Testaments for himself as no one can be completely accurate in interpretation.  Everyone should read and think for themselves.  <br />Through history mankind has produced many horrors that are the result of someone's interpretation of the Bible.  One only needs to turn on the television to be reminded of the political and religious upheavals of the Middle East.  The violence man commits in the name of religion is horrendous.  Think of the Palestinian suicide bombers.  How can one gain salvation by killing others just because they are a different religion?  While reading Piaculum, I was reminded of the Romans who thought early Christians should be destroyed.  The Romans believed the body and blood of Christ was a true act of cannibalism.  Today, most would not think twice about this, but back in time it was a true outrage.  <br />The Piaculum is a deeply moving book that will keep the reader thinking long after finishing it.  It is a commentary on Christianity that can be applied to today's turbulent and violent religious sects.<br />The Piaculum is Richard Gray's first book.  According to the author's website, he was born in Utah where the local landscape inspired much of his writing. He is a scientist, writer, and artist. He earned his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Utah and is currently living in upstate NY while working toward his Ph.D. at Cornell University.

I highly recommend this series as both entertaining and thought provoking. <br />At the conclusion of Grass For His Pillow, Lord Otori Takeo and Lady Kaede Shirakawa have married without permission. Takeo lives under a death threat from the Tribe, a ninja-like group of assassins and spies. Kaede is trying desperately to retain her inheritance of Maruyama and heal from her ordeals. Lord Arai has taken over the Tohan and is waging war on the tribe. As one of Kaede's relatives, Lord Arai is outraged by her marriage to Otori Takeo without his permission. <br />Takeo is troubled by many things. He feels he must avenge his adopted father, Lord Shigeru, who was betrayed by Otori Lords. Takeo is further burdened by the tribe, Kikuta, who have claimed him as their own. Takeo is the son of the Kikuta's most infamous assassin, who was murdered after attempting to leave the family tradition and one of the Hidden. The Hidden are a Christian-like religious group who are persecuted. Lastly, Takeo is driven by his love for Kaede. He loves her in every sense of the word -- carnally, emotionally, and spiritually. <br />In Grass for His Pillow, Takeo is gifted and burdened with the following prophecy: <br />Three bloods are mixed in you. You were born into the      Hidden, but your life has been brought into the open and is no longer your own. Earth will deliver what heaven desires. Your lands will stretch from sea to sea, but peace comes at the price of bloodshed. Five battles will buy you peace, four to win and one to loose. Many must die, but you yourself are safe from death, except at the hands of your own son. <br />The prophecy weighs heavily on Takeo and he finds himself falling into despair at the bloodshed his revenge is causing. It takes a very special man to inspire other to their deaths. Those who die by Jato, his sword, and those he could not protect haunt him. Takeo must find a way to seek revenge without the loss of his soul or his love, Kaede. Tales of the Otori is a wonderfully written work of fantasy that is enjoyable on many levels. The story itself is not simply a story of familial revenge. Takeo cannot just kill those who have killed his family. Their deaths are a result of betrayals that run much deeper. That betrayal never ends and is like a weed. You can cut the head off, but the roots run very deep. In the end, Takeo must decide how ruthless he will be in order to seek the vengeance his soul cries out for. That vengeance comes at a very high price in blood.	2004-06-03

The world Kim Harrison has created is marred by tomatoes.  In our search for genetically engineered food and medicine, we created a nasty virus in tomatoes that has nearly wiped out mankind.  This virus has exposed paranormal races to the world as they are immune. Society has splintered with all the upheaval and paranormal races have set-up residence in the Hallows.  The Hallows can be compared to a Las Vegas for the paranormal.  `Day-trippers' frequently take a walk-on-the-wild side to meet and mingle in the Hallows with werewolves, vampires, witches, and so on.  <br /> <br />Rachel Morgan is a witch and an I.S. runner - similar to an FBI agent but for the paranormal world.  Her career is going nowhere.  It seems as though she can do nothing right and is given the lowest assignments available.  Each day and night of work has become drudgery and Rachel is looking for a way out.<br /> <br />Dead Witch Walking quickly immerses the reader in a vibrant cast of characters.  We meet Ivy, a living vampire; Jenks, a pixie with a lot of children; Trent, a businessman who may or may not be human and is believed to be dealing in Brimstone, a nasty drug, and so on.  <br /> <br />Dead Witch Walking is a paranormal mystery that can easily be compared to Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden series or Laurell K. Hamilton's early Anita Blake novels.  Rachel Morgan is a charming character that is very easy to like.  She certainly has her issues, but she has none of the angst or brutality of Anita Blake.  <br /> <br />Kim Harrison has created a fun book with laughs that are unexpected.  The story line is not completely predictable and has many different twists and turns.  I hope this is the beginning of a new series.  <br /> <br />Kim Harrison describes herself as born in the Midwest.  She has been called a witch, among other things, but has never seen a vampire (that she knows of). She loves graveyards and midnight jazz,and wears too much black.

Bumper Crop and High Cotton are a definitive collection of Lansdale's short stories.<br />The author's introductions to each story alone are worth reading the book.  Lansdale advises us that many of his stories are the product of his wife's popcorn.  Most of the stories are reprints from Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone, The Horror Show, and other publications.  <br />Bumper Crop is appropriately titled as most of the stories have some food or food intake as a major theme.  These stories are not for the feint of heart or for the easily frightened.  \\"Chompers\\" in particular gave me nightmares.  The idea of cannibalistic dentures is fairly disturbing to dream about.<br />Each story has a definitive twist to them.  From razor inspired to murderous teeth to prehistoric sharks and on, this collection is one you will not easily forget.  One theme repeated in the stories is that inquisitive children, who find out why curiosity killed the cat are not likely to forget the lesson.  It is easy to imagine the mongoloid, albino banjo player from Deliverance to be serenading in the background.  <br />Bumper Crop is Joe Lansdale at his finest.  I purchased High Cotton to complete my addiction to these `catchy' little stories.<br />Joe R. Lansdale is the author of over 20 books and has received numerous honors for his work.  He currently resides in Texas with his wife, Karen.	2004-06-01

While it certainly is a horror novel, the graphic sex and thriller-suspense aspects make it a unique and fascinating book to read.  It is no wonder this book won the Bram Stoker award for best first novel in 1995.<br />Our heroine, Val, is most definitely damaged, but we certainly can relate to her.  Her mother, Lettie starts the novel off by gouging out her eyes with a spoon.  This act sets the tone of the book and foreshadows what is to come.  <br />Val leads a very nomadic life.  She travels from one city to another, from one bed to another, in search of a `new' thrill - something that will fill the void inside of herself.  From whispers and gossip, Val learns of a place called the `City,' a place that makes Sodom and Gomorrah look like Little House of the Prairie.  Val becomes obsessed with finding this place and sampling all it has to offer.<br />Entering into this tangle of characters is Breen, a cross between Hannibal Lector and Jeffrey Dahmar.  Breen is one scary person and has set his sties on obtaining and killing Val.  Nothing will stand in his way and he will do anything to posses her.  <br />The Safety of Unknown Cities is not just about graphic sex and violence.  It is also about the loss of childhood and innocence.  Lettie damaged Val and as a result, Val seeks out the thrills that dominate her life.  Val is unable to truly love and to receive love in return.  She recognizes a part of herself that is capable of committing heinous acts in the pursuit of pleasure.  Val is afraid redemption will mean the loss of sexual fulfillment.  <br />As the story progresses, the sex becomes more graphic and less appealing.  In the beginning of Val's journey the sex acts seem to be enjoyable and titillating to read.  Further into the novel, they clearly becoming more like a bodily function you wish no one would mention.  In the `City,' everything and anything goes.  Nothing is taboo.  Lucy Taylor shows us glimpses of sexual depravation that creates images in your mind you will wish you could forget.<br />I was very ambivalent writing this review as the subject matter will not be appropriate for a large number of readers.  This book was hard to read.  The sexual acts become very disturbing and gave me a few nightmares.  This alone is testament to Lucy Taylor's wonderful skills as a writer.  After much thought, I decided the book has a great deal of value in our world today.  In America, sexual images are everywhere.  This overload of sexuality is a key element in the Safety of Unknown Cities.  How do you find love and fulfillment in a world that promotes depravations and promiscuity?  At the conclusion of the book, we are left to ponder this and many other questions about love.<br />Lucy Taylor is the author of numerous novels and short stories.  Spree and Dancing With Demons, a novel of erotic horror, are two of her more recent works.  She has won a number of Bram Stoker awards of the years.	2004-05-02

At the conclusion of Stolen, Elena, Paige, and the rest of the supernatural interracial council rescued Savannah and destroyed the facility that was kidnapping supernaturals. Savannah had been kidnapped with her mother, Eve. She was murdered shortly after the kidnapping, leaving Savannah alone and at the mercy of Isaac, an evil sorcerer and Leah, a half-demon Volo. <br />Dime Store Magic begins a year after Stolen. Paige, a coven witch, has custody of Savannah, a 13-year-old angry witch. Paige has her hands full trying to guide and protect Savannah, who is experiencing teen-angst with an unhealthy dose of rage.<BR> <BR>Leah, the half-demon Volo has decided to join forces with a Cabal, a high ranking sorcerer who is also CEO of a large corporation. This particular Cabal, Nast, is very powerful and also Savannah's father. The fight for custody is more then a legal matter. Nast wants Savannah for her power and will do anything to acquire her. <br />Paige finds herself fighting not only Nast, but also everyone else in her life to protect Savannah. Paige's once uncomplicated life becomes a living hell that seems to have no end in sight. To make matters worse, Savannah, at 13, is very immature and full of rage. She is angry about everything and is prone to using her powers in a reckless manner. Consequences are something Savannah does not understand. <br />Dime Store Magic is a wonderful, fun book to read. The Paige who was introduced in Stolen gains a great deal more depth and is a great heroine. She deals with these betrayals and attacks with a strong moral outrage and strength of character. She is not about to back down and shows her true feisty nature. What makes this book work is Paige's voice. It is unique and interesting. Kelley Armstrong did a wonderful job creating the Women of the Otherworld. <br />Kelley Armstrong is the author of Bitten and Stolen, the first two books in the Women of theOtherworld series.

With the introduction of the Kurians and their deadly Reapers, mankind reverts to its roots. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there and no one is safe from the Reapers. Each Kurian lord controls a group of Reapers, a vampire-like being that kills by absorbing a person's life force or aura. The Kurians use the auras that the Reapers steal as a means to achieve immortality. Humankind is now a farm animal for the Kurians. Hope is not lost. Lifewavers, enemies of the Kurians, have come to Earth to recruit humanity to fight their war with the Kurians. The Lifeweavers have a process of enhancement for humans referred to as &quot;turning up the volume.&quot; These enhancements give humanity the ability to fight back and reclaim Earth. <br />Choice of the Cat is E.E. Knight's second book in the Vampire Earth series. The book opens with Lt. David Valentine commanding a group of Wolves, a military designation for his unit, on a reconnaissance mission. Valentine has gained a great deal of maturity since Way of the Wolf. The young man, part Sioux, with a chip on his shoulder struggles to make a difference. Valentine has become a true officer who puts his men first. No one, not even the commanding officer, is going to use Valentine's men as cannon fodder. Of course, this attitude is not conducive to advancement with Southern Command or with his commanding officer. <br />With the help of Alessa Duvalier, a Cat or spy, Valentine embarks on a new journey. From the Ozarks to Denver with a final showdown in Omaha, a city devastated by nuclear war, Valentine and Duvalier set out to find the Twisted Cross. Valentine will need all his skills as a warrior and his innate ability to sense Reapers to survive. <br />Choice of the Cat is not burdened with the creation of the Vampire Earth world introduced in Way of the Wolf. Action starts immediately and does not stop until the last line of the book. In Way of the Wolf, Valentine started on a journey originated by his father. The young man comes into his own in Choice of the Cat. Valentine is a killing machine with a conscience and a moral identity. He will not leave anyone behind, no matter what the cost to himself. Through all the betrayals of his fellow man, David Valentine is able to be a true hero. I found myself rooting for him on page one. <br />The episodic nature of this series reminds me of anime. Each twist in the plot deepens our understanding of Valentine and his world. This world created by E.E. Knight will be the source for many more adventures to come and many hours of enjoyable reading.	2004-04-25

Living Dead in Dallas introduces us to the various political goings on in the vampire world.  Sookie and the Vampire Bill have been invited to Dallas.  The Dallas Vampire's need Sookie's telepathic skills and she is drafted by Eric, the Viking vampire sheriff of Area 5 to help them.  Sookie feels obligated to Eric as he has recently saved her from a very nasty creature with a venomous bit.  Off to Dallas she and Bill will go.<br />Of course things are not as they seem.  With a very scary group of religious nuts and a suicidal vampire, Sookie is soon overwhelmed with all that is happening.  To complicate life even more, back in Bon Temps one of Sookie's co-workers meets a grisly end.  Life will never be simple for Sookie and Bill, but Sookie never expected this much action.<br />Living Dead in Dallas is another fantastic adventure created by Charlaine Harris.  From page one we are thrust into Sookie and Bill's world and the action does not slow down much at all.  I loved the description of Dallas with its vampire airline and hotel.

She has the ability to read other's minds.  This ability is not an asset when working in a bar.  Image if you could `hear' someone's thoughts, worries, dreams, their most intimate feelings.  How is a girl supposed to find a boyfriend in the backwater of Louisiana when she is acutely aware of all his thoughts?  Sookie has found a solution - the Vampire Bill.  Vampires where `outed' some years ago after the invention of artificial blood.  Sookie is unable to read the minds of vampires and finds great comfort in the arms of Bill.<br />Sookie begins her adventure with a chance encounter with the Vampire Bill and the `Rat' couple, some local trailer park trash.  Things quickly escalate as Sookie faces a series of murders that - surprise, surprise - appear to have been committed by a vampire.<br />Dead Until Dark is a hilarious adventure from start to finish.  From Sam Merlot, the bartender with secrets of his own, to Jason, Sookie's brother and all around stud-muffin with a fancy pick-up truck, all the characters are colorful and entertaining.  While Dead Until Dark is not dark, heavy, horror, it is entertaining and engaging.<br />Many have compared the Southern Vampire series to Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series.  While both series focus on human/vampire relationship, the similarities are few.  Sookie lacks the predatory aspects of Anita Blake.  Sookie is also very naïve, while no one would ever consider this of Anita Blake.  Anita is very angst driven.  In contrast, Sookie is just a nice, hard working girl who happens to have some gifts or disabilities depending on your point of view.  Dead Until Dark does share the mystery elements Laurell K. Hamilton focused on in the early Anita Blake novels.<br />Charlaine Harris is the other of three more Sookie novels; Living Dead in Dallas, Club Dead, and Dead to the World, to be published May, 2004.

Sookie is very unhappy with the Vampire Bill.  It would seem she is being dumped, but no one knows for sure where Bill is and what he is doing.  What is a girl to do?  Just accept some financial settlement or try and stake the cad who left her without even a goodbye?  While Sookie is nursing her broken heart, it would appear the Vampire Bill has met some foul play.  With Eric and Bubba for back-up, Sookie heads to Shreveport to try and find Bill.  <br />Sookie has one major clue to find Bill, Club Dead.  With the help a very sexy werewolf, Alcide, Sookie gains entrance to the illustrious club that caters to vampires, shifters, and other oddities.  As usual, things do not go as planned.  <br />Club Dead widens Sookie's group of admirers and brings a great deal of conflict with them.  How could a girl choose between the Vampire Bill, Eric the Viking Vampire, and Alcide the very warm werewolf?  The politics of the vampires make Sookie's head spin - let alone the addition of werewolves and shifters.  <br />The first two books in the series, Dead Until Dark and Living Dead in Dallas really just introduced us to the full cast of characters. In Club Dead, Charlaine Harris shakes up Sookie's world and gives her more perspective on life.  Sookie is finally able to see Bill's weaknesses and decide for herself if she wants to try and work through them.   <br />Club Dead is a very fun book to read.  Charlaine Harris has a wonderful sense of wit with a tongue in check approach to the story line.  How could anyone keep a straight face with the image of Bubba, Elvis has not left the building, and his cat fancy?  The Southern Vampire series is one of my favorites for its humor and characters.  My only complaint is in regarding the ending.

The journal suggests that Van Helsing was a real man and that many of the events in the original Dracula are fact and not fiction.<br />Van Helsing was a doctor and a scholar from Amsterdam.  A trip to the Balkans to visit a colleague was his introduction to the plague of vampirism.  Much to Van Helsing's horror, the vampires became very interested in his activities.  This journal chronicles his adventures and the terror wrought by vampires.<br />The Journal of Professor Van Helsing is presented as the supposed scholarly documentation written by Van Helsing himself and preserved by a friend.  According to the author, Allen C. Kupfer, the journal fell into his hands by accident.  The journal is laced with commentary by Kupfer's grandfather and himself.  This commentary gives the journal 20th century references and gives the impression of authenticity.  <br />The writing style of this book was difficult to delve into.  The language was very proper with descriptions that left out many of the more titillating aspects of vampires.  As I have not seen the movie this book is tied into, I do not know if this work will enhance it.  I found parts of the journal to be interesting - but the vast majority was written in a narrative that left me wanting more.<br />Allen C.

She has a great job as a journalist, a nice apartment in Toronto, a very attentive boyfriend, and a serious problem.  She is a werewolf.  The only female werewolf in existence.<br />So starts Bitten, Kelley Armstrong's first book in the Women of the Otherworld series.  Elena is summoned by her old pack's alpha, Jeremy to return to Stonehaven, his estate.  With much trepidation, Elena embarks on a journey that will alter her life once again.  The pack represents all that Elena resents - male domination and treating women like dirt.  In addition, there is Clay - who longs to posses Elena completely once again.  <br />Kelley Armstrong's werewolves are feral and strong.  They hunt and run at will.  These beasts are wild - but still retain a trace of humanity.  There are only two ways to become a werewolf - by bite or heredity.  Only males can inherit the werewolf tradition.  The werewolves spend a good amount of time procreating with only interest in their male progeny.  <br />Nipping at the heals of the pack are the mutts - usually lone werewolves who challenge the stability of the pack.  Mutts have been known to indulge themselves in killing humans and the pack does its best to guard against this.  This indiscriminate killing has the potential of exposing werewolves to the world.  Elena finds herself drawn into the pack once again and as she struggles to accept her nature.<br />Bitten is a wonderful, fresh look at werewolves.  The pack is like a close knit family unit with all different types.  Elena is written as a strong woman and werewolf.   Yet Elena has many emotional barriers that do not allow her to evolve.  She is unable to truly let others care for her.  She fights her feral instincts and tries to conquer them.  <br />Throughout the book, Elena is in constant struggle with Clay.  This relationship is very complex and wonderful to read about.  While reading the book, you find yourself wanting Elena to give into Clay - atother times you want Elena to cause bodily harm to him.  This seesaw of emotions is laced with love, bitterness, lust, loneliness, and so much more.  Upon finishing this book, all you want to do is read the next installment, Stolen.<br />Kelley Armstrong has published three books; Bitten, Stolen, and Dime Store Magic.

In Bitten we are introduced to Elena and her fellow werewolves.  Stolen introduces us to other supernaturals; witches, vampires, demons, voodoo practitioners, shaman, and so on.  <br />Someone is kidnapping supernaturals and they are never heard from again.  Elena, Jeremy, and Clay are invited to a `United Nations' for the supernatural world in an attempt to stop the kidnappings.  Unfortunately for Elena, the council is unable to stop her abduction.<br />Elena finds herself alone, cut-off from the pack, and held captive for study.  An unstable, megalomaniac man with money has decided it would be `fun' to study supernatural beings and when the study is completed - to have a little hunt.  Elena must draw on all her resources to find a way to protect herself physically, mentally, and emotionally.  As the hunt draws closer, Elena struggles to free herself and the other captives.<BR> <BR>Stolen is one huge adrenaline rush that can be addictive.  As the story unfolds, it brings us into the supernatural world deeper and deeper.  We learn about demons and their offspring in our mists.  While werewolves have many advantages over other supernaturals, they are still vulnerable.  Each supernatural has abilities that must be harnessed for survival.  This blending of beings evolves into a partnership and friendship between groups that have never cooperated with each other before.<br />The supernaturals of Stolen are written with a great deal of care.  Each being is unique and strong in their own manner.  Kelley Armstrong has created a world where everyone is a mixture of good and bad -  only a few are truly evil.  Elena may be feral and a killer, but she is a moral sentient being.  Her outrage at captivity allows the reader to identify deeply with her.  <br />Werewolves have considered themselves too strong to be held captive.  Their experiences in Stolen show them just how vulnerable they are.  Elena, Clay, and Jeremy are forced to rely on others, in contrast to their nature.  <br />Kelley Armstrong has published three books; Bitten, Stolen, and Dime Store Magic.  A fourth in the Women of the Otherworld series, Industrial Magic is to be published late in 2004.  She has an extensive website at [...]   On her website are two novellas from the Women of the Otherworld series.	2004-03-26

All the raw materials of a great book are present - it just needs some more refinement.<br />Our heroine, Holly-Anne Feather is not your average co-ed.  She posses incredible PSI abilities and is an empathy.  Because of these powers, she is noticed by the local vampire community.  Lucien, the vampire `Holder' or master, takes a very keen interest in Holly.  Of course, Holly is torn.  Lucien is technically a dead man - reanimated flesh.  These facts are not very appealing.  Instead, Holly finds herself lusting after Lucien.  Into this mix comes Ryan,  a fellow student that is also interested in Holly.<br />Then the bodies start to appear.  Edwards University students are being murdered in a very gruesome, ritualistic manner.  Holly finds herself at the epicenter of the murder investigation and her love-life only gets more complicated.  <br />Blood and Mind is a fun book to read.  Holly-Anne is a wonderful, strong characterization.  She has sass and fire with a tinge of very sarcastic, acerbic wit.  Holly is the girlfriend we all want to know.  The ending of the book held some twists that were unexpected and very daring.  My main criticism of the book was the very poor copy editing.  The numerous spelling and grammar errors made it difficult to read the book.<br />Blood and Mind can be compared to Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series.  While there are similarities, Melanie Bonnefoux incorporated many unique aspects to her story that sets it apart.  Bonnefoux's vampires are described as an alien species with unknown beginnings.  <br />Melanie Bonnefoux is a first time author and a `lover of things that go bump in the night.'  She is currently working on a sequel to Blood and Mind.  Please visit her website for more information [...]	2004-03-25

This book is not for the faint at heart as the sex is very explicit.  It is a refreshing look at vampirism.<br />Ryan is an 800-year-old vampire with an amazing history.  She currently masquerades as the mysterious Lord Wolf, a Scottish noble.  Ryan dresses and acts as a man to allow her to function in the male dominated 1800s.  Ryan has a very long history with the descendants of her first love, Bryn.  Carissa, a descendant of Bryn, becomes Ryan's companion, lover, and vampire child.  As the story progresses, Ryan's history catches up with her.  All her secrets are revealed and Carissa is the ultimate price in her game for revenge.<br />While I would not generally recommend this book due to the explicit sex, it was very well written.  Ryan is a very powerful, intelligent, cunning protagonist.  Her story takes us on a journey from the Celts of the twelfth century, to the royal court of thirteenth century France, and finally to Scotland of the 1800s.  Each auxiliary character is involved in the plot intimately.  The primary focus of the book is female orientated, but men are included. Heterosexual men are generally weak or evil with a few exceptions.  The book is interlaced with mystery and erotic tales.<br />Diana Lee is the author of numerous novels and textbooks.  She has been published by numerous magazines and is the editor by NOLOSNE News, the quarterly publication of the National Organization for Lesbians of Size.	2004-03-22

The Amazons of legend are reborn here as a tribe of women in the time of Alexander the Great.  These women live a nomadic, female dominated society.  Queen Hippolyta, the current ruler has just given birth to a child.   <br />The story is told through the eyes of Selene, an Amazonian warrior and seer.  Selene is bound to the current Queen's daughter called Etta.  Etta is a soulless child.  She does not have a spark of life in her.  Her actions are instinctive and animal like.  One morning, Etta slips away from the encampment on a journey.  Selene, Queen Hippolyta, and a group of Amazons follow Etta on what they believe is a Goddess guided journey.  Etta is drawn by an unseen force and eventually leads to Alexander the Great, the King of Asia.  Selene, Queen Hippolyta, and Etta are forever changed by their exposure to Alexander and his male dominated world.  <br />This epic story has all the lyrical elements of a classic. Love, karma, fate, and political upheaval all come together in a climactic ending sure to be a surprise to the reader.  The story transcends the male/female clash and instead focuses on the idea that our souls are genderless.  <br />Judith Tarr is the author of numerous historical fantasies.

Hamilton is the third book in the Merry Gentry series.  While this book is the weakest in this series, a Hamilton fan will enjoy it.<br />Seduced by Moonlight begins a few weeks after the end of Caress of Twilight.  Merry and her guards have moved onto the estate of the fey actress Maeve Reed, who is pregnant due to fertility rites preformed by Merry and Galen.  Public interest and political intrigue seem to be weighing down all her guards and Merry herself is frustrated.  King Kurag figures prominently as he attempts to thwart his alliance with Merry.  Assassination attempts affect Merry and her guards in ways never imagined.  <br />Seduced by Moonlight does have some problems.  It does not appear to further the storyline arc started in Kiss of Shadows and continued in Caress of Twilight.  Merry seems to have discontinued her PI work and no mystery plot was worked into the story line.  I was disappointed to find the early plot development to be of little or no importance to the ending.<br />While Seduced by Moonlight does have some problems, many things are done extremely well by Hamilton.  The characters do develop deeper emotionally and it was very refreshing to read about strong male leads that are also eye candy.  Hamilton has an amazing imagination that is thoroughly explored in Seduced by Moonlight.  While I found the ending to be a let down, I did enjoy Merrys triumph of power.  It was very moving to experience Merrys emotions as she faced some of her worst fears.  Queen Andais also experiences an emotional change not hinted in the previous two books.<br />Laurell K. Hamilton is the author of two other books in the Merry Gentry series, Kiss of Shadows and Caress of Twilight.  She is also the author of the highly successful Anita Blake series.  The twelfth book in the series, Incubus Dreams is due to be released in October 2004.  Be sure the visit the authors website at [...]	2004-02-13

Then you would enjoy what the Hendee's have created.  <br />Dhampir, published in 2003, was our introduction to Leesil and Magiere.  Our heroine is not your typical simpering, scantly clad woman.  Magiere caries a falchion, a very bid sword, and a wicked set of canines.  No need to fear her unless you are an undead.  Magiere is a \\"dhampir\\", a child born of a mortal and an undead.  Using the gifts given to her by her undead father, she is able to wage war against vampires.  Her sidekick and partner is Leesil, a half-elf with dangerous skills and even more dangerous secrets.  Leesil is a troubled man.  His exploits typically involve copious quantities of booze and gambling.  While not the typical leading man/hunk/piece of meat one expects, many of use would gladly volunteer to be Leesil's nursemaid.  To round out this group is Chap, who appears to be a dog, but appearances are deceiving.  Chap can scent the undead and has a bite that the undead fear.<br />This unlikely trio embarks on a new adventure in Thief of Lives, published in January 2004.  At the end of Dhampir, Magiere has discovered what she is - a dhampir.  Manipulation makes her leave the Sea Lion, her and Leesil's new comfy tavern to save the village of Miiska.  Magiere, Leesil, and Chap sail to Bela to rid the city of its undead and collect a hefty bounty.  This time each of the three will discover how hard killing the undead can be.  Myths and folklore don't hold the truths necessary to accomplish the task.  To add to the mix, Leesil and Chap finally divulge a few of their secrets.  <br />The story is complex and will keep you guessing until the end.  Each character is finely crafted like the weapons they carry.  The Noble Dead series is sure to please both fantasy and horror fans.  Its unique premises keep your interest level up and nothing is rushed.  My only complaint of the book is the cover art.  Leesil is my mind should look like Orlando Bloom in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Also, the clothing worn on the cover is completely different from the descriptions set in the book.  Too bad authors do no have more input on cover art.  <br />Barb &amp; J.C. Hendee are a husband/wife pair of writers.  Barb Hendee is the author of another vampire novel titled Blood Memories in 1999.  Both authors have written many short stories published.

The next installment will be released January of 2005, Sister of the Dead.	2004-01-18

Aliens who call themselves Kurians have taken over Earth.  The Kurians are not harmless and have very sinister designs on humanity.  Each Kurian controls a group of Reapers - a vampire like wraith who prowls the night stealing a human's lifeforce or aura.  The auras are the means with which the Kurians remain immortal.  The Kurians have some of humanity in league with them.  Many people have agreed to help the Kurians by selling out their neighbors.  Most of humanity is now a farm animal for the Kurians.  <br />David Valentine has had to grow up very fast.  His entire family died a senseless death.  It wasn't Reapers - but humans.  Valentine was forever changed that day.  When Southern Command, the remnants of the military protecting everyone from the Kurians,   comes calling for volunteers, Valentine is intrigued.  His father was a Wolf, an elite military unit that engages in guerrilla warfare.  By becoming a Wolf, Valentine is driven to find a way to defeat the Kurians and salvage what is left of humanity.  <br />Way of the Wolf is the first of the Vampire Earth series.  As such, much of the book is spent creating the post-apocalyptic Earth and setting up Valentine as our hero.  Valentine is very well fleshed out and likeable character.  He endears himself to the reader.    The story line of Way of the Wolf is slow to start, but once the action begins, it does not let up.  The action is gripping and enthralling.  The dichotomy of an `elite' group with immunity from the Kurians and all the other `sheep' presents many opportunities for the story line to take unseen twists.  Who is more devious and deadly?  The Reapers or your neighbors?<br />Way of the Wolf is E.E. Knight's first book.  The sequel, Choice of the Cat will be published in May, 2004 with a third novel, titled Tale of the Thunderbolt to follow in 2005.  Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: The Lost Cult, an adventure in the Tomb Raider world will be published in August, 2004.  E.E. Knight has a very extensive website at [...]	2004-01-14
