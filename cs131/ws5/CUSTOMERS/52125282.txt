With this audio, I found myself sitting in the grocery store parking lot, wanting to get through a scene before I turned off the motor.  Her easy writing style includes an in-depth lesson about winemaking and a string of family crises that will have you wondering how this family endures.  But that's just it.  They are a strong family that works through their troubles only to come out stronger still.  There is no wasted detail in the telling of this story and no room for guessing the outcome.  You'll have to read it... or listen to this audio.  The reader was excellent.	2002-04-04

Books	5	3	4	N	N	Fantasy Island with a twist	Without going into a long synopsis of the story line (which you can read on this page), let me just say that this is a book worth buying.  The idea of being able to go someplace where a personal fantasy can come true is intriguing in itself.  But each of our main characters have their own agenda, and each of their hidden fantasies are fulfilled, putting a twist into the ending.  Yes, you know where the story is going, but Ms. Denison's weaving of the story is masterful.  The visual images are clear, and, at times, I felt like I was right there with them.  Hot, yes.  Unnecessary?  Uh uh.  Not a bit.  The love scenes were crucial to the progression of the story.  He was a heel, but we were privvy to feeling his metamorphosis into a caring man, one who recognized his error and did something about it.  I like that in a man.  Spend some time with Jackson and Alexis, and smile when you've finished reading this book.  Oh, then be sure you share it with a friend, but only on loan.  This one is a keeper.	2001-05-22

Travis and Dee, our beauty's parents, fell in love in the first story, and now we see how their parenting has paid off.  Their oldest daughter, Keeley, is a sweet, intelligent, ambitious young woman who has yet to find her equal in a man.  Her horse sense combines with a determination to do some good things with her riding school, and she is strong-willed in her direction.<br />Keeley's father, Travis, hires a trainer fresh from Ireland, a man who is as strong-willed and connected to horses as Keeley.  He is the Irish Rebel, one who not only finds his equal in Keeley, but a man who intrigues her and piques her interest.  His ability to train champions with patience and understanding brings him recognition and reward, Keeley's heart among his prizes.<br />The visuals in this story are strong.  You'll think a movie is running in your head.  And if you haven't read Irish Thoroughbred, it's a keeper just like this one.  Enjoy!	2001-05-22

The steamy sex scenes were way too graphic for my taste and the verbage chosen to portray these scenes was obscene and unnecessary.<br />I've read regency novels before and always understood them.  It seemed that the author of this book tried to outreach the reader's intelligence by using language the average reader couldn't understand, or even imagine its meaning.  Really slowed me down, almost quit reading it twice.  When I got to the last page, all I could say was, &quot;Humph.&quot;  Funny thing was, the ending had the best descriptive scene of all.  <br />If you understand the English language of the mid-1800's, give this book a try.  Otherwise, choose another one.	2001-05-15

I liked this one, perhaps because it invited me into a bit of a stretch at the beginning (which also was used to end the story).  Nobody makes love without waking out of a sound sleep, but, given that bit of fantasy as true, the rest of the story moved along.  This story could have been twice as long, so I have to commend the author for clipping it here and there to the basic storyline.  It could have dragged -- it didn't.  Instead I got two love stories intertwined.  Nicely done for what the author was trying to do.	2001-04-22

I found myself sitting  in the car in the garage or in the parking lot of the market just to finish a passage.  This was one special story:  suspenseful from beginning to end,  well-structured, and easy to follow over a long period of driving  to and from work.  There was just the right touch of romantic tension in the story to not be distracting from the main story line.  And Enid Graham, the reader, is to be commended.  Her talent for reading different characters added so much to the story.<br />An absolutely superior story.  An absolutely superior audio.	2001-04-14

His daughter, Jill, searches for answers with the help of her ex-husband Dan Santini (who handily used to be a homocide detective, now turned teacher).  Together they delve into the real truth surrounding Simon Bennett's death, but discover some very interesting and shocking secrets.<br />I bought the audio version produced by Durkin Hayes Publishing Ltd.  The reader's voice was mundane and distracting.  Also, this is a story with so many facets that you must have longer lengths of time to listen to it.  Otherwise, if taken in spurts, it becomes hard to follow.<br />Nice story, a five-star, but buy the book rather than the tape.	2001-03-29

But I must say, this is one of the absolutely best written novels I've ever spent time with.  <br />Quinn's style is smooth, stylish, in vogue of the times for which it was written without being laden, and witty.  Her story line in this novel is fresh, interesting, believable and very well paced.  Nowhere did the story drag.  And I loved the author's note at the very end.

I listened to the audio of this book and have to say two things:  First, it is a six-star story.  It's funny and fun, with a hanky needed toward the end.  Story details aren't really necessary -- it's a wonderful example of Debbie Macomber's work.  Basically, two people who live next door to each other take the long way around to discover that they are perfect for each other.  They start out as friends, and discover love along the way.<br />The second thing is that I have listened to a vast collection of audio books while driving to and from work over the years and have found NONE read better than Paula Parker read this one.  The  young children in the story are a key element, and her voices for the characters are perfect.<br />You will enjoy this story and its presentation.  Highly recommended.	2001-03-17

A single audio tape tells this story, read by Linda Dano in a wonderfully animated way.  <br />Not all love stories are about young women.  This story is about a second chance.  This wonderful tale reminds us to be open to the possibilities that pop up in unexpected places.  Laura Parsons, a college professor, teaches composition to students who need some extra help, and she finds among her new students for the semester a retired intellignece officer who enrolls in her class to solicit her help with a book he has been commissioned to write.<br />The story is about the decision to court once both characters decide they share a mutual attraction, along with other common interests.  They settle on the goal of marriage first and the short story ends as they leave for their first date, already having determined their goal of marriage, and now wanting to learn everything there is to learn about each other.    <br />An interesting perspective, a pleasant story.

She runs into Justin O'Niall, the man who cared for her in her tragedy, and finds him darkly brooding and moody, yet compelling.  There is mystery behind their first encounter that follows them into their second.  Unable to deny their strong passion for each other, they rekindle a relationship that years before seemed wrong.<br />I was disappointed in this book for several reasons.  The author uses a Scottish brogue instead of an Irish one.  Big boo-boo.  The two major characters are constantly fighting (when they aren't making love), which is contrary to sweet romance.  They simply seem to never find a common plane on which they can both survive -- and this problem is never resolved believeably.  And some passages are repeated several times unnecessarily.<br />I closed the book feeling dark and moody myself and would not recommend it to anyone just for that reason.  Good points?  Some interesting Irish history, perhaps, but when told with a Scottish brogue, very contrary.<br />Nope.  If you want to read a love story set in Ireland, stick to Nora Roberts or Lisa Hendrix.  They are feel-good stories.  This one is not.	2001-03-09

This Debbie MacOmber story is a pleasant revisit to the Heart of Texas series.  It is wonderful to visit old friends and meet some new ones.  If you haven't read Debbie's first six books about Promise, Texas, you must put them on your wish list.<br />In this story, like the others about Promise, commitment and trust are woven into love and respect.  Family is important and so are friends.  I recommend all seven of these Promise books for younger readers since the heart and soul of these stories leaves the love scenes to the imagination.<br />Enjoy!

Kathryn Jensen has a fluid, easy writing style that draws the reader into the story and doesn't let go.  I have already ordered the books about this earl's middle brother, Matthew, &quot;The American Earl,&quot; and about their oldest brother, Thomas.  &quot;The Earl Takes a Bride&quot; is his story.  Can't wait to read more about the charming Smythe brothers.<br />A wrong turn takes Jennifer and her tour guests to the wrong castle in Scotland.  But the Earl of Winchester, a known playboy aristocrat, is fascinated by the American woman.  Christopher Smythe is reluctant to say good-bye when her tour is over and she must return to the United States, but he denies his feelings for her so that she will not pine for him once she is home.  He honors a secret that will not allow him to live elsewhere, but he finds he cannot live without Jennifer.  He follows her to the U.S. and convinces her to come back to Scotland with him, to live at Castle Donan.  She gets involved in restoring the castle with him and eventually finds out his secret.  When it becomes her secret as well, she vows to do something about it.  Christopher throws her out of his home when she tells him she has taken steps to resolve his tortured soul.  He comes to the U.S. once again to apologize when he finds out just what she has done for him, and tell her that he understands that she loved him enough to sacrifice her own happiness for his.  He realizes what real love is and that he has loved her from the moment she took a wrong turn into his driveway.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It's a wonderful love story told in a wonderful style.  You'll enjoy it.	2001-03-04

Although the abridgement of this book in audio form left some holes in the story and I found myself rewinding it toward the end to see if I had missed something, I must say that the reader, Mel Harris, was absolutely top class.  The storyline was captivating from the start, although toward the end, it got a little confusing (chalk that up to the abridgement).  The charming part of this story was watching (or hearing) Samantha discover herself in the big city of New York.  The hero has an interesting connection to his new tenant and Michael's caring for her, both as her new guardian (interesting since she was in her late twenties) and as her new and only friend in the big city, lends a sweetness to both characters.  Mike's powerful connections and money play well to Sam's transformation into a butterfly.  And eventhough Sam had been married for a short time once before, it is Mike who teaches her what true love really is all about.  A romantic love story and an intriguing mystery are a winning combination for the author.  I can also recommend this audio version to younger readers.	2001-02-17

Johnston's weaving of the story line of this charmer was captivating.  Couldn't put this one down.  Minor characters play an important part in this story and keep the hero and heroine on the right track.  <br />I disagree with Penny Griffin's analysis almost word-for-word.  It is apparent she didn't read the same book I read.  The hero and heroine and the baby are all critical to each other.  The heat that built between Reeve and Polly was very real and believeable.  The doubts they both had that held them back were eventually satisfied and the true nature of their deep commitment to each other could not be denied in the end.  I thought the author's resolution was clever and unpredictable.  But no fair reading the last chapter first!  <br />I'd like to recommend this book even to younger romance readers.

After 8 years, they find themselves again working the same dangerous underwater salvage operation, one that would eventually bring them great wealth, international fame and the return of a nagging villian.  The good guys finally win, but not without a good fight. And a long-dead Angelique finds just revenge for her curse and peace for her spirit.  Good adventure story.	2001-02-04

Bax's  solution is a good one, but she remembers her ex-fiance's reaction being  similar and revolts.  As soon as her ankle is healed, she's leaving, and  that's that.  Wrong. <br />Nice storyline, but the narrative about their  attraction and how they fought it was so repetitive, by the time they got  together, I was almost past caring.  Without the unnecessary and repetitive  sexual tension, the book would be half as long.  We got the point in  Chapter Two.  <br />Character development was scarce, not only with the main  characters, but definitely with the secondary characters.  I had to go back  to the beginning and find the passage that explained some family  relationships.  The writing lacked meat to it; the author missed some  obvious chances to make the town and the people more interesting.<br />Worth a  read anyway.	2000-05-15

The author had a good story outline, but added some very sloppy scenes that should have been crafted to enhance the story.  Our heroine, being very sophisticated, would never have been so submissive right off the bat.   The couple's first &quot;encounter&quot; almost made me throw the tape  away.  And it got worse.  Her captivity in the cabin was not at all real,  not for the sophisticated upbringing she supposedly had, and not for the  fiery rebel she was supposed to be.  How stupid and submissive the author  made her out to be.  Nope, didn't buy it.  What a shame to ruin such an  interesting story line.	2000-01-22
