US	53066437	R120GFTNE5O3H0	1567205038	361297788	From Autogiro to Gyroplane: The Amazing Survival of an Aviation Technology	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Comprehensive and complete, perhaps too much so.	The book is superbly researched and seems to include every scrap of autogiro history from the beginning right up through the ultra-lights of the present day. Each period is given it's due and no enthusiast will be disappointed by the coverage of his or her special interest. Excellent bibliography and further reading suggestions as well. <br /> <br />Having said that, reading the book from cover to cover is slow going. And the interweaved tales of various autogiro developments in various times and locales makes some sections almost unreadable. For example you'll be reading about some invention progressing from 1926 to 1939 and then be abruptly jerked back to 1927 to start the next thread of development. When this happens 4 or 5 times in two or three pages you loose all sense of what happened when. But I'm not sure how you'd fix that except to edit out some of the material.	2005-10-07

The author has done an amazing job of making an exciting subject boring. He appears to have done his homework, digging into the family history back several generations. This, in fact, is the problem with the book; he's done too much research and can't bear to edit any of it out. The first half of the book passes without any tiger being stalked, and that is all Corbett is famous for. The only portions of the book with any drama are those hunting tales he re-tells from Corbett's own books. <br /> <br />He also spins in a tremendous amount of speculation about the motivations of Corbett and his family members and friends. He tries to support these speculations with his research, but it's largely unconvincing. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time on this book.	2005-08-10

It is not a complete biography of Curtiss, it does spend a LOT of time be-littling the post-1903 Wrights, and I'm not sure he knows his technical airplane stuff 100%. However, this book is highly enjoyable and very easy to read. You'll be hooked and read it through in one or two sittings. The more you read about those early years of aviation, the more you learn. I've read a ton of books on the Wright Bros. early years, but their attempts to scuttle Curtiss in their later years were new to me. They hated Curtiss PERSONALLY! By contrast, the story of Curtiss's adventures at the dawn of aviation are great fun to read and you'll find yourself daydreaming about hanging around his shop to chat with him... not something I've ever wanted to do with Wilbur and Orville.	2005-06-17

The authors' idea of a \\"project\\" is buying some off the shelf gadget and plugging it into your PC. I don't need a book to explain THAT. <br /> <br />Oh, and if you don't know what an MP3 file is, HERE ARE ALL THE DETAILS. What rubbish. Of the 14 \\"projects\\" maybe 3 or 4 are easier with this book, but the chances of you're being interested in one of those seems poor. <br /> <br />If you get the chance to look this thing over before buying you'll quickly know if it's for you.

I really enjoyed reading this book. I don't know if it's because the people it describes were so interesting or if the author has picked out their most charming and fascinating characteristics to write about. This is the story of Lawrence Sperry, the son of the Sperry who invented the gyroscopes used in ships the world over. The family was well to do by the time Lawrence (or \\"Gyro\\" as he was called) was a boy. From the beginning Lawrence was irrepressible.<br /><br />Upon reading of the Wright brothers' success he proceeded to build an airplane of his own in the basement and attic of his house... while his parents were away on vacation. He was something like 15 or 16 at the time. He wound up cutting a hole in his parent's 2nd floor bedroom wall to get the wing outside. The plane later flew both as a towed glider and with an engine.<br /><br />From the book's description, the family sort of adapted to Lawrence's bursts of energy and devotion to flying, and let him escape from the drudgery of attending college.<br /><br />Ultimately Lawrence invented most of the instruments pilots still rely on today: autopilot, turn-and-bank indicator, articifical horizon, the seat-bottom parachute, etc. All by the time he was 26.<br /><br />This is a charmingly written book about the early years of aviation, which may lead you to read other books about this period.	2005-05-02

You don't know whether some incidents happened before WW2, during, or after, etc. Unfortunately, \\"Hostage\\" suffers somewhat from the same problem. Gann follows various threads of his own life, sometimes back-tracking in time to start a new one. This can be awkward. <br /> <br />The second problem is the book is overlong. His early childhood is told in way-too-much detail. It's all interesting and well-written, but I found myself slogging ahead at times waiting for him to grow up. <br /> <br />It turns out that aviation formed only a small part of his life, so aviation enthusiasts beware. In fact I recognized several incidents he flits over in \\"Hostage\\" that had whole chapters in \\"Fate\\". Mostly Gann seems to have been an amateur fisherman, sailor, anything to escape from his wife and kids.  <br /> <br />What I found as a revelation is how many books, screenplays and movies this guy wrote. WOW. In his later years he was cranking out best-sellers like clockwork, although some of the movies seem to be tied up in John Wayne's estate and aren't viewable any more (\\"The High and The Mighty\\", \\"Islands in the Sky\\"). \\"Soldier of Fortune\\" is a staple on TV, and \\"Fate is the Hunter\\" with Glenn Ford shows up sometimes too (not nearly as good as the book). \\"Twilight of the Gods\\" is on often too. <br /> <br />Overall, if you have no special expectations and plenty of time this is a good book to read. If you were hoping for an inspiring life story or lots of aviation stories, you'll be disappointed.	2005-03-02

She writes well though, and the book is a good read.<br /><br />Piskiewicz's book is also highly readable, although for the most part he seems to rely on secondary sources (often Lomax's book). He concentrates mainly on her wartime experiences, and seems to have found sources of information in fellow test pilots that Lomax failed to get. As the book progresses you see the author forming his own opinion about Reitsch, her flying skills, and her claim of ignorance about Nazi wrongdoings.<br /><br />Lomax's book is the most complete, but also the most detached. She relates in interesting detail Reitsch's life in it's entirety. WW2 ends about 2/3 of the way through and the book follows her on through her experiences in India and Ghana. It's fascinating reading, and often gripping.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Lomax never offers her own assessment of Reitsch, nor does she give us enough info about her contemporaries to make our own analysis. Clearly Hanna was a Nazi sympathizer, and not only naive but in denial about the Nazi party's real nature. But just how guilty was she of aiding the Nazi cause? And how reformed was she afer the war? Lomax won't commit.<br /><br />It would have been nice to know about other prominent German technologists who use this same line of defense when quized about their aid to the Nazis. Von Braun, Kurt Tank, etc. Lomax also fails to identify some of Hanna's associates (Rudel) as the ardent, extreme Nazis they were.<br /><br />So once comes away with the same conclusion you reach reading about the other famous female Hitler protege: Leni Reifenstahl: A talented ego-centric in denial about the net effect of her own life's work.ffect of her own life's work.	2005-02-15

Some were depicted in a movie of the same name, but the book reveals much more. While Coward's life in the POW camps was not unlike that described in other books on the subject, his description of life in the POW camp next door to Auschwitz is really incredible. I've never read anything about the Holocaust as evocative as his description of sneaking into the death camp itself for one night. It was almost unbelievable, even to him, as he sat in the dark of the barracks crammed in with the soon to die prisoners. You won't forget this chapter after you've read it. <br /> <br />Coward's other escapades are more in the vein of other POW books, with the exception that he succeeded in far more sabotaage than I've read about elsewhere. He not only escaped and was recaptured many times, but while in captivity he had a knack for comitting acts of sabotage that could not be traced back to an individual. Stuff like loosening nuts so rail cars would fall apart AFTER they left the camp.  <br /> <br />An inspiring story, and try to catch the movie too. Dirk Bogarde does a fine job of recreating the indominitable spirit of Coward. <br /> <br />You will want to learn more about Coward after reading this book. I know I do.	2004-12-09

For one thing, Hillary was just an immature kid when he lived through much of the book, and only slightly more mature when he looked back upon it when writing the book. Too much of the book is like listening to two not very bright freshman debate religion or politics.  <br /> <br />I do agree that he paints a vivid picture of the early days of the Battle of Britain, when the kids didn't really know that most of them were going to die. On the other hand, Hillary doesn't seem to actually relate to all those others who had already died in France before his turn to fight came. Too busy rowing at Oxford it sounds like. <br /> <br />The actual air combat portion of the book is brief, the hospital recuperation details only a bit longer. The rest of the book is his attempt to describe the growth in his own understanding of himself (i.e. \\"growing up\\"?). <br /> <br />I much prefer books by grown-ups, where they've had time to develop a keener insight into their own past. There are plenty of better books by other RAF pilots from later in the war.	2004-11-16

At any rate, the book is really excellent. What impressed me most was the simple design of the tools employed, from the hot wire cutter to the vacuum bagger, all appear to be buildable from stuff at the local auto parts store, junkyard, and hardware store. Things like a cheap auto battery charger, old refrigerator compressor, etc. Nothing exotic. <br /> <br />Not only that, but after describing how to build wings from templates, he gives an explanation of how to draw the templates, with details on a half-dozen popular wing shapes. Like everything else in the book, he takes you through it step-by-step, leaving nothing out. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this must be one of the best \\"how to\\" books I've ever read.	2004-10-21

Most of the obvious fighters and bombers from the US, Britain, Japan and Germany are included, along with a few pre-war types and trainers such as the Fairchild PT-19. I don't see any transport types however. <br /> <br />And doubtless any selection of only 37 will leave out one of your favorites. The photos are all black & white, the reproductions of the drawings are generally good, although I wonder if they were intended to be printed out in an 8x11\\" format. <br /> <br />The text includes matters of general interest, as well as specifics which bedevil modellers, like insignia size and placement, and how many variants of a certain plane were available. <br /> <br />Overall, a nice source of information for anyone modelling planes of this period.	2004-10-02

I've been disappointed in other guide books that omit older planes. In my area, older planes and even biplanes are the most interesting things flying out of the small fields. It's also helpful that it doesn't try to cover the European types we just don't see here. The organizational scheme is also good. Some books try to group planes by the number engines, wing type, etc. But that approach puts huge and tiny planes in the same section. THIS book does it properly, seperating out the airliners from the private types.	2004-08-20

Each section averages about 3 pages, some more, some less. Typically there are 2-3 small photos and 3-4 paintings (some large) per story. There are about 60 such sections, each on a famous flyer or flight. This a much more international selection than you're used to seeing. <br /> <br />While the stories are fascinating, it's the paintings that will draw you back again and again to this book. They appear to be a mixture of oils and watercolors I think (I'm no artist!). Many are beautiful action scenes; all show great detail. <br /> <br />This is the kind of book that will inspire you to go buy a cheap set of watercolors and see if you can capture some of this magic yourself! <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2004-08-16

In practice, this means a lot of modern small jets and private planes are included as well as the commercial jets. Unfortunately, no coverage whatever is given to any classic planes (pre-1960?), nor to some of the models frequently seen overhead here in the US. It does include many planes I have never seen in my life. These must be part of the UK scene.<br /><br />So overall, this book is of no use to me, but might be just the ticket if you want to spot 747's or corporate jets or Piper Cherokees.	2004-08-10

I'll paraphrase the intro from the front of this book: &quot;This book consists of a bunch of short essays written for magazines like AOPA and other amateur pilot publications. Some of the stories were written a long time ago and are not well-written but I have not updated them.&quot;<br />In many respects, that sums up my take on this book. Many poorly written stories about how smart amateur pilots feel after doing something stupid and not getting killed. I guess you have to be a pilot to buy into this. I am not a pilot.<br />Reading this book is like being on a Greyhound bus for 9 hours next to a Cessna salesman. It's all about &quot;clear air&quot;, and &quot;God's skies&quot;, etc. You're not alive if you're not flying. Gimme a break.<br />I recommend you go read Ernest K. Gann's &quot;Fate is the Hunter&quot;, about professional pilots who spend their whole lives in the air and still get killed, or nearly so, because of circumstances they have no control over.<br />Just drop this book off at the General Aviation office at your local airport and give those guys something to read till the weather clears.	2004-07-15

This is a wonderful book on the history of kites, with photos and stories you won't find in any other place. Modern kites are surveyed in color photos and plans. He also includes detailed diagrams of some great kite reels and other kite equipment. No, it's not a How-To book with any step-by-step insctructions.

You follow along as Adams revisits many of the places where the Wright Brothers went. Just like any such visitor, he revels in the little things he finds that match up with some bit of the legend, like finding a building where they stayed; or the hospital where Orville was laid up after the first fatal crash. He also finds evidence of the huge impact Wilbur made in France where he was hailed as a hero. Who'd have thought there was a &quot;Wilbur Street&quot; in France?<br />No, this is no substitute for those blow-by-blow accounts of each innovation, but it fills in the gaps and adds some chronolgy that others lack. For example, he mentions how Orville's crash happened while Wilbur was in Europe, and how long it had been since Orville had last flown. <br />This is a fine book, and if you've ever gone on your own trek to try and get a sense of history by &quot;being there&quot;, you won't be able to put it down.	2004-06-25

There's a good explanation of electric motor characteristics, requirements, etc., always put into a context that peopler new to electrics can relate to. The explanations of theory are just what you need to know, with no useless charts like some other books. He also steers clear of wasting space on specific manufacturer's motors, sticking to useful generalities and a few examples.<br />There are also useful sections on ducted fans and appropriate model selection. Instructions on soldering and building your own battery packs are clear and precise with good photos.<br />The only drawback is that Li-Po batteries were just on the horizon when this book was written, so his comments on them are somewhat speculative.	2004-04-08

It's Nevil Shute's non-fictional account of his years as an airplane designer prior to becoming a full time author. Over a third of the book relates his experiences as a junior engineer on the R.100 zeppelin construction project. Led by Barnes Wallis, the R.100 was built as a commercial project, simultaneously with the infamous government-designed R.101 which crashed with much loss of life on it's maiden voyage. This disaster put paid to the R.100 as well as it was never flown again.<br />After that, he helped found the Airspeed airplane company. His tales of keeping the start-up afloat are reminiscent of many of the dot-coms during recent years.<br />Shute writes very smoothly, and the book has the feel of a long conversation. If there's a flaw, it's that he doesn't talk much  about the other people he met. It would be nice, for example, to see a few sentences on Barnes Wallis, designer of the R.100, the Lancaster bomber, and the dam busting bombs used in WW2.<br />That said, there's plenty to read here and this is one of those books you can't put down once you start.	2003-10-20

I haven't read it cover to cover, but the chapters I have read leave something to be desired. The two most obvious deficiencies are that it is a re-write of a very old book, and that's it written for a British audience. <br />I was mystified by constant references to &quot;obechi&quot; wood and &quot;dura&quot; metal, until I read that obechi was used as a substitute for balsa during WW2, andt is rarely used today. So why does he keep talking about it? <br />British sports car enthusiasts may deduce that &quot;dura&quot; is slang for &quot;duraluminum&quot;, an aluminum alloy used in MG brake cylinders, etc. But the author never tells you this. I reckon we just call it ALUMINUM here in the States.<br />Some of the pictures (the ones I needed most) are too dark and muddy to see anything (wire landing gear). I could find no information on &quot;how to fly&quot; an R/C airplane.<br />Don't get me wrong, there's lots of information in this book, but you'll definitely need to buy a modern book, written for your own continent, as well.	2003-06-30

The early chapters tell of housecats, the middle chapters about lions and bushmen, the ending chapters about pumas in N. America. In fact, it turns out that parts of this book are from a collection of articles that had previously appeared in the New Yorker.<br />I found the middle portion about African lions, bushmen, and their disappearing habitat un-interesting. The sections on domestic cats and pumas, were much more interesting to me. She does include a LOT of her idle speculations about why cats behave as they do, but I liked that. <br />I can only whole-heartedly recommend this book to people with a special interest in house cats, Kalahari bushmen, and pumas.

The text details how to build your own metal lathe with a minimum of ready-made parts, based primarily on aluminum castings you make yourself (as shown in Book #1 of the series).<br />I did not build the lathe, but I did read this and his &quot;How to Build A Milling Machine&quot; book. The author takes the approach of using 19th century techniques and designs, showing how to emulate them with today's hardware store components. Sadly, the books lack any color photos. There are tons of drawings, and a couple of moderately clear black and white photos.<br />While interesting, the machines seem to appear VERY home-made when complete. It is also clear that many, many hours are required in the construction.<br />Although I did find the author's &quot;can do&quot; approach encouraging, I think you'd be better off saving your money for a ready-made lathe...	2003-01-25

It begins with a brief survey of Charles Babbage, which is generally accurate. Followed by some excellent information on Hollerith and the history of punched cards. Agar then covers Konrad Zuse in much more detail than I've seen elsewhere. (Zuse is one of those computer pioneers who was lost to history for a bit and now rediscovered. He built computers in his living room to help design Nazi airplanes.) There follows a whirlwind tour of early American efforts by Aiken, Atanasoff and Mauchly.<BR> <BR>Then things get strange as Agar jumps to an in-depth explanation of the basis of modern mathematics (way over my head) with a discussion of Hilbert, Godel, Riemann, Cantor, etc. The book then winds up with a discussion of Turing's contributions to mathematics and code breaking, with an overview of British code-breaking efforts and post-war computer development. All of this overlaid with some peculiar attempts to philosophize on the nature and future of computers. <br />Whew! You can't do justice to all this in a 150 page paperback, and he doesn't. But the book is well-written and travels down some less-traveled roads, so it's a fun read for computer folk.	2003-01-10

The story of Baker's family (his brother Samual was a famous African explorer) and his own personal travails is told against a backdrop of life in the British Army from the Crimea to Khartoum. Readers of other works on the individual battles will the find the whole story told here with a unique sense of continuity. The various adventures of British forces in the Crimea, Turkey and Egypt were not unrelated events but part of a foreign policy as complex and tortured as our own today.<BR>  Baker's own personal story is also fascinating, and his interaction with other famous figures of the time (the Prince of Wales, General Wolseley, Gordon, Gladstone, etc.) shows them in a very revealing light. Their relationship with Baker reveals their personal side, something lacking in  most history books.<BR>  The only unfortunate thing about the book is that the author does not identify her relationship with the Baker family. One assumes she is somehow related to the subject of the book, based on it's dedication to her husband &quot;Valentine Edward Baker&quot;. It would help to put the tale in perspective if we knew a bit more about her point of view.	2003-01-04

It's all a bit mysterious, but it tells a classic tale of the British upper class at war. It's kind of a cross between \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and \\"Guns of Navarone\\", but with a lot less violence. Exactly what organization the author works for, and what context it all takes place in is lacking. But the chase across Crete and the author's insights into the locals kept me glued to my chair reading until I had read from front to back. See also the 1957 movie of the same name with Dirk Bogarde. For another book in the same vein find a copy of F.S. Chapman's \\"The Jungle is Neutral\\". Another WW2 \\"way behind the lines\\" story, this time in Malaya.	2002-12-23

Ahhh, the fascinating story of Charles Babbage. For 100 years he was a footnote to mathematical history, for the next 40 years his story was a required paragraph in the preface of every Computer Science text book. In the last few decades there has finally been  serious study of his work. Now with this book we have a highly readable compendium of his life and work, with the added excitement of a modern day adventure.<br />The first 210 pages provide the best description of Babbage's life yet. All the bits and pieces I've read in numbers of other books on Babbage are here, as told by a modern expert who puts  it all in perspective. That perspective is essential, as Babbage's life was filled with controversy and conflict.<br />The last 100 pages of the book tell the story of building one of Babbage's planned-but-never-built calculating engines in the museum where the author works. It is this personal experience with building a working machine from the 150 year old plans that adds the magic &quot;hands on&quot; touch to the author's analysis of Babbage's tale.<br />This is a highly readable and fascinating book and undoubtedly the best single volume on the legacy of Charles Babbage.	2001-11-05

It tells the story of Samuel Cody from his days as a cowboy out West through his life in England as a &quot;wild west&quot; showman and his improbable role in the history of aviation. The book is fascinating reading both because Jenkins writes so well and also because he has done enough research to fill in the story with lots of detail. By the end of the book you'll be on the edge of your seat following Cody's incredible exploits. You'll also come away with a real feel for the dangerous and exhilirating world of aviation in those first few years of it's existence. It's a shame Cody and the other very early kite-to-airplane pioneers have been so overshadowed by the aviators who survived into the 20's.	2001-10-01

It starts out with a fascinating history of kites and winds up with actual kite plans. The history section includes lots of interesting facts I've never heard before. It begins with the ancient origins but includes the 19th and early 20th century inventors (Cody, Bell, etc.) in enough detail to understand what they were really doing. The history section winds up with the inventors of the hang glider (1948) and parafoil (60's). Lots of rare photos and drawing are used to illustrate their work.<br />After that there are sections on kite flying, kite construction, materials, plans, etc. The text here is terse and to the point, with sufficient detail and scaling information to build the kites whose plans are included (or so it appears, I didn't try to build one). A wide variety of kite plans are included, from traditional designs to unique ones; with enough airflow theory thrown in here and there to make you think you could design your own.<br />It's lavishly illustrated, but the small format prevents this from being a &quot;coffee table&quot; book. I can't recommend this book highly enough for adults or inventive teens.	2001-08-20

Sieber is memorialized on Crook's monument in Arlington and also inspired the Charlton Heston character in the movie ARROWHEAD. Basically Sieber's job was to help the Army put Apaches back on the Reservation when they strayed off it. He did this by using Apache scouts, whom he dominated by out-thinking, out-fighting, out-riding and out-shooting them, all the while treating them with respect and scrupulous honesty. The book covers his life from his immigration to the US from Germany on through his retirement working at the Indian Agency, insuring that the Apaches weren't cheated by the white men sent out by the Indian Bureau. The only flaw in the book is that Siber never strayed far from Globe, and the story doesn't either. You're left wanting to find biographies of Crook, Geronimo and the other characters that pass through Sieber's life.	2001-01-25

Books	3	2	10	N	Y	Okay introduction to a questionable language	Despite the somewhat annoying &quot;humor&quot; and slang-filled writing style, this book does give a painless introduction to the Rebol language. However, after reading most of the book you still won't find any real reason to USE Rebol. It just has no advantage over Perl, which is much more widespread. Rebol does appear to have a smaller &quot;footprint&quot; and is supported over many platforms. If that's what you need, Rebol is an interesting option. For any platform where Perl is available, Rebol is a poor 2nd choice. The Rebol website also has a ton of stuff, but I think this book is a much easier way to survey this unusual language.	2000-12-06

You know, the kind that lists the objects, then their properties and has a good index. At first glance this book appears to fill the bill, but after using it for some time I find  myself going back to Goodman's &quot;Javascript Bible&quot;. There is something half-baked in the organization of this book that makes it hard to find anything when I'm looking for it. In short, this is not the definitive guide, but merely one of several books you'll need on hand to program in Javascript. *Sigh*	2000-09-26
