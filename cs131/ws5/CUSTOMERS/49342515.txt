Therefore, these readers will conclude that a book about running efficient meetings is of no use to them.  If these readers take the plunge and read \\"Running a Meeting That Works\\" by Robert Miller and Marilyn Pincus, they will most likely consider things they should have done differently.  With much pragmatism, Miller and Pincus explore possible pitfalls that can occur throughout the meeting's lifecycle.	2005-09-21

Our political leaders and business community generally no longer invest enough in future technology development due to an over-focus on the short-term, consumption frenzy and the absence of any rational competitiveness policy (pp. 107, 118-19, 123, 134-35, 171, 209-11, 217-18, 251, 255-56).<br /><br />Furthermore, many of our manufacturing companies have often squandered their initial technological lead at the profit of foreign competition without much of a fight in the face of adversity unlike for example European, Japanese and South Korean companies (pp. 113, 119, 126, 129, 137-39, 184, 200, 250).<br /><br />2) The combination of low labor costs, financial incentives, and a pro-business environment has proven to be a powerful combination to attract new investments in some foreign countries (pp. 55, 57, 71-72, 75, 103, 126, 132, 142).  Furthermore, tax holidays, dumping, and currency manipulation have kept some foreign competitors alive and driven costs down (pp. 55, 75-76, 123-24, 181).  Competition is not just against foreign companies, but also against foreign countries (pp. 131-32, 138, 251, 256).  In 2003, China took the lead position in attracting foreign investments (p. 61).  U.S. investment is only 19% of GDP compared to over 40% of GDP for China (pp. 73-74).<br /><br />Many of our CEOs and venture capitalists, who are no \\"Benedict Arnolds,\\" would like to invest here but end up investing abroad due to the lack of a compelling investment package on top of high costs (pp. 71, 148, 165-66, 211, 256).  These people also have children and grandchildren (pp. vi, 149, 203).  Their first duty is to most of us, both shareholder and consumer (pp. 77, 187, 194).<br /><br />3) Increasingly, countries are reducing their dollar holdings due to our astronomical trade and budget deficits.  Unless we get serious about significantly reducing these deficits through a mix of select tax increases and spending cuts, the fate that befell the golden standard and British pound could befall our dollar sooner rather than later (pp. xii, 164-73, 187-94, 245, 256-58).  Deficits matter in the real world (pp. 173, 190).  In contrast, the weak dollar does not matter because we no longer have the productive capacity to response quickly to a weaker currency (pp. 213, 251).<br /><br />Globalization has to be leveraged, not resisted blindly. Our world is increasingly integrated economically and technologically because of outsourcing, off-shoring, and contract manufacturing/services (pp. 46-55, 82-84, 90-101, 145, 168, 175-76, 196, 201-06).  This integration is sending the traditional theory of comparative advantage by David Ricardo packing to the museum of antiques (pp. 180, 183-85, 210-13).  Businesses think in absolute terms (p. 187).<br /><br />A competitiveness policy supportive of free trade requires among other things:<br /><br />1) The introduction of a special tax regime for manufacturing centers of excellence at the federal level after the example of coordination centers well-known to U.S. and foreign multinationals (pp. 182, 268-69).  This regime should complement existing regimes at the state level (pp. 197-98).  Too many of us do not understand that technological innovation and leadership result from a cluster of inter-related (manufacturing) companies, universities, government institutions, bankers, and lawyers (pp. 107, 127, 130-32, 147, 183, 201, 210, 251, 268-70).  Leadership is built not on making commodities faster and cheaper than the competition, but on developing talent, tools and techniques so advanced that there is no competition (pp. 131-32, 139-41, 144).<br /><br />This new \\"manufacturing partnership with America\\" could bring (back) select high-tech jobs and reduce our trade deficit as political entities such as Japan and the European Union have demonstrated with success (pp. 56-57, 70, 78, 126-27, 140).  Similarly, a special tax regime for distribution and service centers of excellence could also be considered at the federal level.  This system of tax incentives could be financed through higher taxes on the consumption of some non-essential goods and services (pp. 261-62).<br /><br />2) The creation of a specialized cell within the U.S. Department of Commerce to systematically track the existence and changes to investment packages abroad, and make recommendations about how to bring much needed job-creating investments to our shores and keep as many of existing jobs as possible on our territory (pp. 268-69).<br /><br />3) Computer science and engineering scholarships should be granted on a wide scale to boost enrollment in these disciplines in the short term (p. 266).  The current number of us obtaining science and engineering degrees is small and declining (pp. 132, 249-50).<br /><br />4) The current regime of visas, especially the strategic work visas, should be made business and visa holder friendly (p. 266).  Unsurprisingly, this system feeds a fast-growing reverse brain-drain, which is detrimental to the future of our economy (p. 133).  Brain drain has brought much needed talent, who has played a key role in the emergence of the U.S. as a superpower.<br /><br />The growth and higher living standards of tomorrow rest on rather our productive investments than on our tax and monetary castle of sand that is built on top of a housing bubble, inflation and credit driven consumption frenzy (pp. 67, 126, 129, 165-66, 173-74, 191, 208, 261).  A country gets and remains rich by saving, investing, exporting, and consuming with moderation (pp. 27, 54, 61, 66, 68-69, 73, 171, 174, 177, 214, 219, 261-62).companies, universities, government institutions, bankers, and lawyers (pp. 107, 127, 130-32, 147, 183, 201, 210, 251, 268-70).

And How Companies Create Them (Revised and Updated)	Books	5	22	24	N	Y	The Rise of the Super Smart Consumer	Michael Silverstein has written a built-to-last business book about a global phenomenon that is not going away unlike so many other business fads.  Trading Up and trading down has a transformational effect on more and more categories, retailing and markets. Silverstein clearly explains that the increasingly sophisticated consumers of the critical \\"middle market\\" have been key to drive a polarization of the product and service offering to the high and low ends of the price spectrum.  Woe be to the businesses which continue to offer conventional goods and services getting \\"stuck in the middle.\\"  Think for instance about the Big Three of Detroit, traditional airline companies, and some chains of department stores.<br /><br />Although Silverstein focuses on trading up in this book, he mentions elsewhere that in 2004 in the U.S. alone, trading down was at $1 trillion almost twice as big as trading up.  The \\"savings\\" that consumers get from an increasingly efficient economy can be re-injected in even more consumption.  This consumption frenzy has resulted in abysmal saving rates that will haunt the U.S. when ongoing demographic changes will start to undermine the financial stability of complementary sources of income as Peter Peterson correctly points out in \\"Running on Empty.\\"<br /><br />In the meantime, smart entrepreneurs and companies have reinvented their marketplace by making \\"massstige\\" or mass prestige products available to an ever-growing proportion of the critical middle market.  These products command a price premium over conventional offerings, but are priced well below super-premium or old luxury products.  Furthermore, these mass prestige products are pretty resilient in a downturn economy.<br /><br />Trading up is driven by changes to both demand and supply.  On the demand side, changes to the role of women as economic agent, the decline of the traditional family, a modified perception of consumption, higher home ownership, more discretionary wealth, and the \\"savings\\" passed on to American households by large discount retailers have fuelled the stratospheric rise of the New Luxury market.<br /><br />On the supply side, Silverstein clearly shows in one product category after the other that the New Luxury trend-setters have been keen to meet that demand.  These leaders have made their creed to observe the following eight best practices:<br /><br />1. New Luxury trend-setters assume that their target customers are very smart.  Under no circumstances should these customers be underestimated.<br /><br />2. New Luxury trend-setters disprove the traditional economic truth that when price goes up, volume necessarily goes down.  New Luxury products often embody the 20/40/60 rule.  These products regularly account for up to 20% of the category's volume, 40% of its revenues and 60% of its profits.<br /><br />3. New Luxury trend-setters create a ladder of real benefits.  They not only offer a product with a superior technology and/or design that result in a superior functionality, but also, and more importantly, engage their customers emotionally in an uncertain and fast-paced world.  Silverstein has identified four powerful emotional drivers, i.e., taking care of me, connecting, questing and individual style.<br /><br />4. New Luxury trend-setters do not rest on their laurels in terms of innovation, quality and a flawless experience.  The ever-faster cascading effect of innovation, quality and flawless experience from top to bottom in more and more categories obliges New Luxury makers to be restless and paranoid in these areas.<br /><br />5. New Luxury trend-setters reinvent the price range and positioning of their brand by building an aspiration escalator that leads the consumer from the low-end to the high-end with a clear mix of features and benefits at each step.<br /><br />6. New Luxury trend-setters customize their value chains to deliver what they promise to their target customer segments.  Control of the value chain is considered more important to New Luxury trend-setters than its ownership.  Like a film director, they have become very good at synchronizing the different actors who help them to be successful in meeting the wants and needs of their target audience.<br /><br />7. New Luxury trend-setters not only use traditional consumer-research methods, but also spend more time to understand the wants and needs of their target customers.  The cultivation of brand apostles and word-of-mouth are critical to develop the desired buzz and viral marketing for maximum leverage in the marketplace.<br /><br />8. Finally, New Luxury trend-setters consider themselves outsiders rather than insiders.  They know that their success today will be just a temporary illusion if they do not continue to set new standards for innovation, quality and a flawless experience.<br /><br />To summarize, Trading Up is relevant not only to marketers, but also to any consumer who wants to become even smarter in an increasingly sophisticated marketplace.Like a film director, they have become very good at synchronizing the different actors who help them to be successful in meeting the wants and needs of their target audience.      7.

The cold war's raison d'être was to discredit Communism though the spread of globalization under our leadership after WWII (pp. 31, 296).  We considered the further spread of globalization in the decade following the end of the cold war in Europe our peace dividend (pp. 31, 33).<br /><br />We deployed our military overwhelmingly in the Non-Integrating Gap to put out fires in this decade (pp. 23, 81, 145).  At the same time, the Pentagon was bracing itself for the confrontation with an emerging Big One (read China) (pp. 3-4, 62-63, 91, 101, 108, 274, 317, 381).  Barnett makes an interesting link between the 1990s and the Roaring 20s by stressing that both periods were just a little too good to be true (pp. 27, 31, 157, 309).<br /><br />Barnett wrongly dismisses the threat of a potentially aggressive Big One completely under the pretext that the globalization process is on the march (pp. 4, 62-70, 149, 172, 229, 302, 339).  First, China and Russia remain a source of concern to the Integrating Old Core because they have not yet fully embraced the tenets of Liberalism (pp. 54, 113, 121, 130, 225-26, 241-42, 263).  Furthermore, the Modern State aims to be as efficient as possible to wage war when the opportunity arises to maximize its chance of survival and prosperity.  Finally, the current liberal hegemony cannot be taken for granted because of the presence of nihilist forces who do not offer any workable alternative to Liberalism.<br /><br />Barnett reasonably claims that 9/11 was a blessing in disguise, even if it was well hidden (pp. 34, 96-106, 282-83).  We cannot rest on our laurels in spreading globalization (pp. 50, 82, 105, 298, 307).  Barnett rightly recognizes that we have not been very successful in selling our new security rule set (preemption strategy, global war on terrorism, etc.) as a policy by which the New and Old Functioning Core is trying to expand its stable security rule set into the Disconnected Gap (pp. 31, 40, 46, 52-55, 143, 167, 171-76, 231, 278, 294, 335-36, 354-57, 363-64).<br /><br />Barnett correctly observes that the enemy is neither a religion (Islam) nor a place (the Middle East), but a condition (disconnectedness) (pp. 49, 54-58, 83, 122-137, 161-66, 177, 187, 205, 239, 288).  Barnett also stresses that we are increasingly dealing with individuals, not states, behind mass violence while our traditional economic power and competition are progressively moving from the state to the system (pp. 85-88, 93, 261, 271-72).<br /><br />Barnett is not always consistent when he generally states that transnational terrorism and poverty could be eliminated totally one day by closing the gap (pp. 40, 53, 110, 158-60, 178, 193, 291).  Terrorism and poverty can be at best reduced to a marginal phenomenon because miscalculation is in the human DNA (pp. 225, 333, 347-48, 353-54).<br /><br />Our apparently piecemeal approach to our lofty war against terrorism and poverty is haunting us for several reasons:<br /><br />1) We are not leveraging enough the financial/technical help we provide to non-democratic regimes, especially in the Middle East, to drive security, economic and political changes for the better (pp. 184, 186, 218, 283-87).<br /><br />2) Unsurprisingly, some local populations perceive us as being the close collaborators of their undemocratic and unaccountable governments (pp. 185, 187, 216-17, 238, 293).<br /><br />3) We are too often isolating instead of engaging rogue states such as Iran, Syria and North Korea without showing any significant results for our pains (pp. 83, 171-73, 330).  We won the cold war because we not only contained but also engaged the former Soviet Union to drive changes for the better.<br /><br />4) We are sometimes generating much bad blood even among some of our closest allies (pp. 143, 177, 243, 291).  For example, the states next to the rogue regimes are not in a hurry to hold the bag in case of their sudden collapse due to undesirable population and security flows.  Barnett repeatedly overlooks the consequences of his recommendations when he pleads for taking the \\"bad guys\\" down (pp. 43, 215, 289, 305, 314, 320, 334, 379-80).  In addition, we need some of these rogue states to stabilize both Iraq and Afghanistan (pp. 290-92).  Finally, some states do not want to see their energy flows cut because of their over-reliance on fossil energies (pp. 223, 230, 312).<br /><br />Barnett correctly points out that we need realistic visionaries to turn the tide (p. 43).  The war against terrorism and poverty requires that:<br /><br />1) We better coordinate our efforts, whenever possible, with those of our close and not so close allies to exercise enough pressure on illiberal regimes, being rogue states or not, to drive economic, political and security changes hopefully for the better (pp. 177, 190, 199-204, 244-45, 308-13, 319, 369, 376).<br /><br />2) We encourage multinationals of both the Old and New Core to create or leverage an existing forum to negotiate with illiberal regimes changes to their security, economic and political rule set for facilitating local investments.  Barnett rightly points out that many developing countries cannot self-finance their development.  It is up mainly to the private sector to reduce disconnectedness (pp. 186, 360).  This forum could also be a helpful conduit for us to liaise with the rogue states.<br /><br />3) We leverage anti-terrorism best practices of other theaters to encourage the political wings of terrorist organizations to participate in the life of their (future) states.  This effort could help create a schism between \\"mainstream\\" and \\"hard-core\\" terrorists as it happened within the IRA, the military wing of Sinn Fein.<br /><br />To summarize, Barnett has some good ideas about how to reduce the Gap.  However, Barnett also entertains other ideas that cannot be implemented at a reasonable cost.91).  For example, the states next to the rogue regimes are not in a hurry to hold the bag in case of their sudden collapse due to undesirable population and security flows.

US	49342515	R8DEYKV6Y5NJI	0385721382	122896159	The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History	Books	5	77	81	N	N	Complex Interaction of War and Peace in Modeling States	In \\"The Shield of Achilles,\\" Philip Bobbitt has realized an impressive tour de force in studying in great detail the intimate interaction of law, strategy and history between 1494 and the contemporary era.  Bobbitt correctly points out that there is no state without law, strategy and history because they complement and influence one another (p. 6).  There can be a state only when the governing institutions of a society have an acknowledged monopoly on the legitimate use of violence at home (law) and abroad (strategy).  History relates the account of the stewardship of a society over time that in turns influences law and strategy.  Contrary to the conventional wisdom, Bobbitt convincingly shows that the history of the Modern State did not begin at Westphalia in 1648, but in the North of Modern Italy in 1494 (p. 805).<br /><br />Bobbitt clearly demonstrates that the Modern State was put together when it proved necessary to create a constitutional order that could wage war more efficiently than the feudal and mercantile orders it replaced (p. xxv).  Bobbitt spends most of his time covering the pattern of epochal wars and state formation, of peace congresses and international constitutions in Europe.  The Modern State was indeed born and went through successive mutations in Europe before spreading to the rest of the world.  Bobbitt gives his readers a nice pictorial representation of the six constitutional conventions of the international society of states at the end of Book I dedicated to the State of War (pp. 346-347).  Book II focuses on the States of Peace.<br /><br />To his credit, Bobbitt does not reduce war to a pathology that could one day be eradicated totally.  War is as inevitable as death because the Modern State aims to be as efficient as possible to wage war when the opportunity arises to maximize its chance of survival and prosperity (pp. xxvii, 819).  Contrary to the popular wisdom, Bobbitt rightly construes war not as the result of a decision made by an aggressor, but as the reaction of a state which cannot acquiesce to the legal and strategic demands of the aggressor (p. 8).  Operation Iraqi Freedom is one of the most recent applications of this recurring observation.<br /><br />Bobbitt also makes an interesting comparison between the assassination of Kitty Genovese occurring in New York in 1964 in the presence of multiple passive witnesses and the wide indifference of the international community to the plight of Bosnia for years in the early 1990s (pp. 411-467).  The international community will find in this chapter a well-articulated argumentation for doing little or nothing in the naïve or vain hope that such problems as the on-going genocide against certain groups of population in Darfur, Sudan will disappear as if by magic.<br /><br />Furthermore, Bobbitt rightly draws the attention of his audience to the importance of the Peace of Paris of 1990 that ended what he called the Long War starting in 1914 (pp. 24-64, 609-663).  The Peace of Paris celebrated the triumph of the parliamentary democracy as the winning nation-state model at the successive expense of fascism and communism.  Bobbitt is probably at his weakest when he launches himself in scenario analysis about the future of the three competing constitutional forms of the market-state that is taking the place of the nation-state (pp. 717, 728).  The international society of states has indeed the choice among the entrepreneurial market-state (e.g., the U.S.), the mercantile market-state (e.g., Japan and China) and the managerial market-state (e.g., the European Union) (pp. 670-676).  Each incarnation of the market-state has its pros and cons.<br /><br />As Bobbitt points out elsewhere in his book, Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda could be considered a fourth, malevolent version of the market-state that is a common threat to the other three versions (p. 820).  For the first time since the birth of the Modern State, a state structure is no longer necessary toconstitute a lethal threat to a society (p. 806).  The market-states will have to cooperate with one another for example to contain WMD proliferation, cyber-terrorism against their critical infrastructure, which is increasingly privatized and internationalized, or environmental threats to the planet (pp. 785-797, 800, 806).<br /><br />Bobbitt states that there is no certainty that the first three constitutional forms of the market-state can coexist peacefully (p. 781).  Bobbitt enumerates the ten constitutional conditions that will facilitate the peaceful coexistence of market states (p. 802).  Unlike the three constitutional forms of the Nation-State, i.e., parliamentary democracy, communism and fascism, the three constitutional forms of the Market-State could coexist peacefully in the long run.

Ms. Kaufman does not try to prescribe a one-fit-for-all approach to challenges and opportunities occurring in your life.  She correctly stresses that creating and keeping a good attitude is a habit to practice, one small step at a time and one day at a time.  With some training and/or coaching, it becomes easier to have and keep the right attitude.  Attitude is how you physically and emotionally interact with yourself, others and your surrounding environment.  Attitude, not weight, looks, brain or luck, will have the greatest impact on how your life plays out.  If you have the opportunity, I recommend that you first listen to Ms. Kaufman at one of her appearances before buying her book.  Her passionate testimony about her successes and failures in both her private and business life will not leave you indifferent.

Humes gives his audience 21 tips that he has identified through a meticulous examination of some memorable quotations attributed to famous politicians and writers.  Speakers can stand out in front of a crowd or among a small group of people by applying these tips to their presentation.  Why bore an audience by telling a lengthy joke at the beginning of a speech, inviting the audience to fall asleep though a windy talk and busy slides or ending a presentation on a flat note?  Instead why not speak about a personal experience to which the audience can relate, energize a talk by the use of a memorable bon mot or end a talk on a strong note?

Herman clearly shows the essential role that the Royal Navy played in propelling Britain to the poll position in the concert of nations between the 16th and 20th centuries.  Herman skillfully weaves into his narration the life and achievements of a wide cast of well-known Britons such as Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, Queen Elizabeth I, Horatio Nelson, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.  At the same time, Herman shines the limelight onto colorful individuals who have sunk into oblivion, despite their essential contribution to the world leadership of the Royal Navy.  One can think for example about John Hawkins, John Fox, Samuel Pepys, Edward Hawke and Edward Vernon.<br /><br />Without the Royal Navy, Britain would have been unable to break the back of such strong personalities as King Philip II of Spain, King Louis XIV and Emperor Napoleon I of France.  Without the same strong naval forces, Britain would not have been capable to secure most of its conquests around the world and played the role of international policeman.  The Royal Navy also fulfilled a major role in the propagation of the ideas that have conquered the world: free markets, democracy, Anglo-Saxon culture ... and Pax Britannica (now Pax Americana).<br /><br />In the 20th century, Imperial Britain and its Royal Navy lost their global leadership due to a lack of means to checkmate the world ambitions of Imperial Germany and Japan.  In that century, a Pax Americana superseded the Pax Britannica.  American sea power has kept the world's sea lanes open.  As Herman rightly reminds his audience, the sea remains the pillar upon which most of today's global trade system rests.  Close to 95% of trade that crosses international borders is waterborne, as is 99.5% of the weight of all transcontinental trade.  The U.S. Navy has an essential role to play not only for keeping sea lanes open, but also for deterring any irrational exuberance, especially in Southeast Asia, and bringing help to people in need after natural cataclysms or man-made disasters.f all transcontinental trade.

Chalmers Johnson, a pessimist, attempts to convince us that the U.S. is moving too far in the direction of militarism and empire-building, which is disadvantageous for four reasons:<br /><br />1. Johnson predicts a state of perpetual war, leading to more acts of terror against Americans whatever their location in the world.  Perpetual war is in fact nothing new because the world has probably never been at peace completely with itself since man has existed.  Johnson also forecasts that in order to keep America at arm's length, some countries will feel an increasing need to possess weapons of mass destruction.  As Natan Sharansky points out in the Case for Democracy, one of the key techniques that the fear society uses to keep itself in power is to export terror outwards by creating external enemies and disguising its domestic failures in the process.<br /><br />Johnson rails against the policy of preemptive war or anticipatory self-defense in the war against terror, because this policy gives an undesirable impression of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  Johnson wrongly draws a parallelism between our reaction after 9/11 and the surprise attack of Imperial Japan against Pearl Harbor in December 1941.  Johnson confuses the aggressor and the victim with one another.  Furthermore, Johnson seems to underestimate the promises of soft power combined with hard power to overcome the lasting legacy of the apparently desirable, falsely attractive status quo in dealing with some states, which have shown little concern for Democracy and the Rule of Law both internally and externally.  Alliance-building within the free world will remain one of the essential tools for convincing some societies to adopt capitalism and democracy, which is in the best interest of their leadership and populations.<br /><br />2. Johnson also complains that militarism and imperialism are increasingly undermining our democratic institutions.  Johnson points out that the Executive, and especially the Pentagon and the associated military-industrial complex, is growing in power at the expense of the Congress and the Judiciary.  To Johnson's point, the Executive has admittedly committed some errors since the beginning of our organized counterattack against domestic and international terrorism.  However, Johnson seems to underestimate the strength of our institutions.  The Congress and the Judiciary are far from public stooges of the Executive and have repeatedly reminded the Executive about the limits of the exercise of its power in time of uncertainty.<br /><br />3. Furthermore, Johnson associates militarism and imperialism with the manipulation of the truth through systematic propaganda, disinformation and official lying.  Johnson gives several unconvincing examples in an attempt to make us believe that we get closer to a fear society.  The author seems not to know the multiple differences existing between a free society and a fear society.  Whoever has ever spent some time in multiple fear societies, will not be convinced by such argumentation.  No democratic government, including ours, can be totally transparent for security reasons.  However, the fourth power, the Press, which is far from being subservient to the Executive, has regularly obliged our government to disclose information that it did not feel comfortable to tell in the first place.<br /><br />4. Finally, Johnson fears that militarism and imperialism could lead to economic bankruptcy, the least dangerous of the four sorrows in his mind.  This is probably Johnson's best argument because the Congress and the Executive are going to be faced with tough choices down the road.  Defense and homeland security expenditures are expected to increase at the expense of almost everything else.  Changing demographics are compounding the complexity of these delicate budgetary arbitrages.  Johnson also points out that unlike Imperial Britain, the U.S. does not run huge account surpluses.  Our trade deficit was US$617.7 billion in2004, an increase of close to 42% over our trade deficit of US$435.2 in 2002.  Johnson rightly estimates that this deficit represents a disturbing economic statistic for our country with its global outreach.  Perhaps, the Federal Reserve should drop the words \\"measured\\" and \\"accommodative\\" and raise its official interest rates at a faster pace to bring traditional and asset-driven inflation under control as well as boost savings and investments in productive assets.  Economic growth and a weaker dollar alone will not be enough to reduce the twin budget and trade deficits significantly in the coming years.  Overdependence on foreign credit to feed our seemingly insatiable appetite for goods and services from overseas ultimately shifts economic power abroad.004, an increase of close to 42% over our trade deficit of US$435.2 in 2002.

Segev makes his account of the events especially moving by describing the life of ordinary Christians, Jews and Muslims besides that of the better known actors of this tragic comedy.  Segev challenges the commonly-held view that the British were pro-Arab.  Although the British made vague promises of sovereignty to the Arabs in exchange for their support against the Ottomans in charge of Palestine until 1917, they almost systematically promoted the Zionist enterprise at the expense of Christians and Muslims according to Segev.  The British both feared and admired the Jews.  The British tended to subscribe to the anti-Semitic view that the Jews were in control of history and should not be offended in their capacity of useful ally against common enemies.  The proclamation of the Balfour Declaration and the support given to its implementation are deemed to reflect this pro-Jewish bias.  To the surprise of many 21st century observers, some British sincerely believed that the aspirations of Jews and Arabs were compatible.  Other British feigned to subscribe to this view.  Most of the remaining British shared Segev's point of view that the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine could not happen without diminishing the standing of the local Arab community.  The contradictory interests of both communities resulted first in local atrocities on both sides and then in the first war between the reborn Eretz Yisrael and the neighboring Arab nations in 1948.	2005-02-07

At the bottom of the pyramid are the men and women, who have the privilege to live free in a democratic society.  In the middle are their leaders who unlike dictators ultimately depend on the popular will to be voted in or out of power through periodical, free elections (pp. 74, 78-81, 160).  At the top of the structure is the commonwealth of free societies, which represents the free world.<br /><br />Sharansky rightly reminds his readers that many people who have never lived in a fear society, take for granted what is at best a distant dream in many dictatorships (p. xiii).  In a free society, the key challenge is acquiring the moral clarity to identify evil (p. xxii).  The respect for the right of dissent, which is more important than its content, is one of the key ingredients of a well-oiled democratic society.  People can eventually lose sight of what unites them by comparing their fellow citizens, who do not share their convictions, with the henchmen of fear societies and by sympathizing with dictators (pp. xiii, 193-226).<br /><br />In a fear society, the courage to dissent is the first human quality to confront evil, which guarantees all others (pp. xxii, 11).  Fear societies ultimately sap themselves by investing much energy to keep true believers happy, turn apparently loyal double-thinkers into reliable subjects and crush dissent (pp. 8-9, 39-64, 102-105, 132).<br /><br />Sharansky deplores that in the name of the status quo, the struggle for peace and security in the world is rarely associated with the promotion of democracy (pp. xix, 3).  Rhetoric of the free world too often falls short in practice in the name of realism (pp. xxi, 67-71, 232-265).  The realpolitik is based on strategic interests alone and excludes any move towards moral considerations (pp. 69-70, 80).  In the free world, the realists consider the champions of exporting democracy elsewhere, at best naïve and at worst dangerous (pp. 15, 19, 68, 70).<br /><br />The usual reasons given for excusing d&eacute;tente are: 1) A suspected lack of enthusiasm for democracy in certain cultures and civilizations, 2) the apparent predictability of fear societies that unlike democracies do not unleash chaos and instability, and 3) the little leverage that the free world seems to have for facilitating change in fear societies (pp. 5-6, 14-17, 26-37, 62-70, 92-95, 107-108, 143, 154, 163-164, 269-271, 277).<br /><br />Unfortunately, supporting fear societies today in the name of stability will often be rewarded with blood and tears tomorrow as 9/11 and other past events have clearly demonstrated (pp. 14, 92-95, 107, 152, 167).  One of the key techniques that the fear society uses to keep itself in power is to export terror outwards by creating external enemies and disguising its domestic failures in the process (pp. 14, 82-88, 191-192).  Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Iraq under Saddam Hussein and Afghanistan under the deposed Talibans are just a few examples in the recent history of humanity (pp. 21, 24-26, 68-69).<br /><br />Sharansky wants to convince his audience that what was done previously could be replicated to democratize and liberalize the Middle East (pp. 4, 13, 154, 188-189, 279).  President Ronald Reagan and Senator Henry Jackson believed that the deliquescence of the crumbling Soviet tyranny could be accelerated through a confrontational approach instead of seeking accommodation with \\"moderate\\" non-democratic regimes (pp. 5, 9, 11-12, 19).  Jackson and Reagan were convinced that the people behind the Iron Curtain could one day enjoy freedom as much as their counterparts in the free world.  Unlike their predecessors who linked their countries' foreign policies to a fear society's international conduct, Reagan and Jackson would link America's policies to the Soviet's domestic conduct (pp. 112-123, 132-143).  The Soviet dictatorship was put under domestic and international pressure to become increasingly free (pp. 12-13, 123-143).<br /><br />Like their predecessors who overestimated the durability of the Soviet tyranny, today realists are convinced that democracy and Islam are largely incompatible.  To convince their detractors, realists point to the absence of separation between church and state, the treatment of women, underdeveloped civil societies, a small middle class, widespread poverty and rampant illiteracy in most of the Islamic world (pp. 32-37, 97-99).<br /><br />Realists should keep in mind that the most anti-American regimes in the Middle East such as Iran have the most pro-American populations because of these regimes' anti-Americanism.  Reversely, the most pro-American regimes in the Middle East such as Egypt and Saudi-Arabia have the most anti-American populations because of these regimes' pro-Americanism (pp. 60, 69, 88, 91, 159, 172-173, 249).<br /><br />With the help of other capitalist democracies, the U.S. should muster the will to combine the \\"security hawks\\" with the \\"human rights camp\\" by for example modulating through a system of trading points the annual financial aid granted to non-democracies in the region (pp. 143, 274).  The more freedom these countries grant to their populations, the more economic privileges they get in the form of for instance increased foreign direct investments and access to new export markets (p. 278).  Sharansky makes clear that the free world should resist the eventual oil blackmail that some Middle Eastern regimes could be tempted to use for inspiring fear (p. 275).  To paraphrase President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in opposing tyranny, the only thing the democracies have to fear is fear itself.  Over time, the financial aid given to these countries could be gradually reduced because of their greater political and economic stability and of the enhanced purchasing power of their populations.  To summarize, Sharansky is right to link freedom to peace and tyranny to terror in domestic and international relations (pp. 76-81, 88-92, 276).t, Reagan and Jackson would link America's policies to the Soviet's domestic conduct (pp. 112-123, 132-143).

II	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Delicate Balance between Fiction and Reality	Unlike \\"What If? 1\\", which was entirely about military counterfactuals, \\"What If? 2\\" has the additional merit to consider military and non-military counterfactuals.  To his credit, Robert Cowley manages again to put together a \\"dream team\\" of historians.  As Cowley correctly points out in his introduction, events manipulate great men and women probably as much as great men and women manipulate events.  Over time, men and women unfortunately tend to drift from one extreme to another in their approach to history.  Action or inaction of great men and women, the impact of the environment on their behavior as well as broad social, economic and political trends are ultimately equally important in understanding history properly.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, readers will probably perceive the counterfactual essays to be of uneven quality in both volumes of What If?  Some history buffs could blind themselves to their supposed knowledge of specific events about which speculation is made.  The participating historians are usually efficient at first explaining to their audience what really happened and then exploring counterfactuals.  This approach generally has the merit of making history accessible to a wide audience.  In evaluating each essay on its merits, readers could follow the advice that Geoffrey Parker gives in his contribution about the counterfactual victory of the Invincible Armada in 1588 to \\"What If? 1\\": 1) Only small and plausible changes should be made to the actual sequence of events and 2) After a certain time, the previous pattern may reassert itself (pg. 151-152).<br /><br />As a side note, Cowley and his team of historians could eventually write a \\"What If? 3\\" which focuses on the Middle East.  Some thought-provoking topics that they might consider could be for example:<br /><br />1) What if the Spanish Umayyad dynasty had been able to contain the Christian Reconquista?<br /><br />2) What if the Mongols had not taken Baghdad?<br /><br />3) What if the original U.N. plan for the partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into two apparently viable states had been implemented successfully?<br /><br />4) What if a viable Palestinian state had evolved into the \\"Costa Rica\\" of the region?<br /><br />5) What if Reza Khan had followed the example of Mustafa Kemal Atat&uuml;rk?<br /><br />6) What if one side had won the war waged between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s?<br /><br />7) What if the coalition had invaded Iraq in 1991 instead of 2003?<br /><br />This new \\"What If?\\" sequel could serve two different but complementary purposes: 1) Look at an alternative course to past events and 2) Influence the shape of the future from thinking out-of-the-box.

The area that the much-diminished, anachronistic Ottoman Empire occupied in 1914 was one of the few territories that the European empires had not yet shared among themselves (pg. 24, 32).  The European powers did not wait for the fall of the Ottomans before arguing about their respective zones of influence in the region after the war.  Statesmen such as Lloyd George, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Kitchener, T.E. Lawrence, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin played leading roles in re-shaping the region.  Winston Churchill - at times unintentionally - had the most enduring impact on its cartography (pg. 19, 25, 73, 385-388, 493-529, 558-567).<br /><br />After losing the patronage of Britain against Russia, the weakened Ottoman Empire, anxious to pursue its modernization while living in fear of Western powers' designs, convinced Germany to become its partner in 1914 (pg. 33-50, 75, 142).  Fromkin convincingly demonstrates that Churchill was not to blame for pushing Turkey into the arms of Germany (pg. 54-76).  Britain and allied powers believed that the Ottoman war would be a sideshow that could be easily managed (pg. 83, 115, 119-123) but they were repeatedly proven wrong (pg. 200-203, 215, 248, 289, 301).<br /><br />The poorly executed attack on Turkey at the Dardanelles could have considerably shortened the duration of the war (pg. 127, 264).  Churchill was the scapegoat for the fiasco and was demoted within the government (pg. 128, 154, 159, 161-162, 233).  After resigning and spending a few months in the wilderness, Churchill, who was perceived as dangerous across the board, was brought back to the government at the insistence of Lloyd George, the new British Prime Minister (pg. 166, 234, 265-266).<br /><br />Kitchener and his Lieutenants acting on his behalf in British Cairo imposed their design on government's policy towards the Middle East at the expense of the India Office (pg. 88-95, 106-110).  Britain would rule the region indirectly after the fall of the Ottoman Empire (pg. 85).  Like the French, Kitchener and his men wrongly assumed that the Moslem Middle East would be glad to be ruled by Christians (pg. 93-94, 102, 106).  The British looked at Hussein, the Sherif of Mecca and its Emir, as the ideal candidate for the position of \\"Pope\\" of Islam (pg. 105).  The British leadership wrongly believed that Islam was a single entity and that temporal and spiritual authority could be easily split (pg. 96, 104).<br /><br />The Arabs misled the Allies about their true strength to fight the Ottoman Empire. This cost Britain dearly because their core competency was only guerilla warfare against the Turks, until the capture of Jerusalem (pg. 186-187, 219-222, 309, 313, 377-378, 396).  Over time, the British became disillusioned with Hussein.  However, they supported two of his sons in the fulfillment of their ambitions (pg. 326-329, 506-512).<br /><br />Britain entered into negotiations with France, Russia, and later Italy that ultimately resulted in the cursed Sykes-Picot-Sazanov agreement and other secret treaty understandings to share the spoils of victory in the Middle East (pg. 189-199, 267, 287, 330, 334-335, 342-344, 373-379, 391-402).  The Allies had no intention to pay the price Hussein demanded for his support to the allied cause (pg. 186, 227); only lip service was paid in the field to the nominal pro-Arab independence policies of London during and after WWI (pg. 325, 345).  The French and Russians showed similar contempt for Arab and Islamic aspirations of independence in the Middle East inthe same period (pg. 378, 435-440, 463-490).<br /><br />Much to their dismay, the Americans discovered the existence of all the secret arrangements of the Allies to partition the region after the overthrow of Tsarist Russia in 1917.  As Colonel House and Arthur Balfour presciently remarked, these imperialistic arrangements were sowing the seeds of future wars in the region (pg. 257, 400).  Similarly, President Wilson predicted that peace would be illusory if its terms were not basically fair to all sides (pg. 399).<br /><br />To the surprise of some 21st century observers, British leaders in London first anticipated no negative reaction against the Balfour Declaration from their Arab Allies.  Like some prominent Jews, they believed that there was no essential incompatibility between the Arab and Zionist ideals (pg. 283, 321, 324, 444, 519-520, 527).  British leaders had seen France as their only obstacle (pg. 292-293, 297).  The local British administration was to some extent supporting Arab violence against Jewish settlements.  They sowed doubts about the feasibility of a Jewish homeland cut out of Palestine that was encompassing present Jordan, in the minds of some enthusiastic pro-Zionists (pg. 445-448, 504-505, 513-529).  The uncompromising position of Amin-al-Husseini and his successors greatly harmed the Palestinian cause (pg. 517-518).<br /><br />Iraq was another British creation that has not shown much stability since its beginnings in the 1920s.  The recently terminated Sunni Arab dominance over the other population groups has cast a long shadow over the inter-ethnic relationships in this fragile country  (pg. 449-454, 503-506).<br /><br />Similarly, the French did not fully realize the risks when they carved Lebanon out of Syria and put the Maronite minority in charge of the new country.

US	49342515	R3JJNLL4FVGTE9	1581824130	919003541	Character and Greatness of Winston Churchill: Hero in a Time of Crisis	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Work without Faith is Doomed to Failure	To his credit, Stephen Mansfield illustrates the decisive importance of religious faith in the life of Winston Churchill since his encounter with his influential nanny, Mrs. Elizabeth Everest (pg. 41, 50, 192).  The vision of death that Churchill experienced when he was a teenager could also have fortified his faith (pg. 212).  Too often, Churchill's faith is downplayed in the abundant literature available about his words and deeds (pg. 34, 221-227).  Churchill was a strong-willed nonconformist who rarely chose the well-worn path for which he sometimes paid a heavy price in his life as Mansfield correctly states (pg. 43, 99-100, 203-206).  Randolph Churchill, his emotionally distant father, had no much faith in his son until his premature death in 1895 (pg. 160).  Randolph Churchill thought that Winston was just good for a military career, not clever enough to go to the bar (pg. 47, 96-97).<br /><br />During his military service in India, Churchill realized that he had huge gaps in his learning in contact with men of his own age who benefited from both breadth of knowledge and ease of discourse.  Driven by curiosity and ambition, Churchill embarked on a demanding program of readings on his weakest subjects.  This eager pursuit of knowledge was a turning point in Churchill's life (pg. 54, 99-102, 161-162).  It marked the end of youth and progressively revealed Churchill's emergence as an exceptional man (pg. 101).<br /><br />Churchill probably best summarizes his life's philosophy in a three-tier question and answer in Savrola, his only novel:<br /><br />1) Would you rise in the world?  You must work while others amuse themselves (pg. 57, 131).  To merely exist was no better than death (pg. 134).  Churchill's high talent and amazing energy were both praised and criticized (pg. 69-70, 85-86, 120, 129, 178, 188-190).  Churchill could not stand the routine and the tedious.  He was never idle.  History transfixed Churchill and fed his vision of the world (pg. 70, 108, 139-141, 144-145, 209).  Churchill deeply believed in action; he had a goal, a plan and an iron will to get things done (pg. 109-110).  Churchill possessed an almost mystical knowledge in knowing the facts and seeing them as they were, as a critical step towards ultimate triumph (pg. 144). As Mansfield correctly points out, Churchill's weapons were his words, passionate words loaded with faith and vision (pg. 84, 147-150, 174, 179).<br /><br />2) Are you desirous of a reputation for courage? You must risk your life (pg. 57).  Churchill had little regard for his personal safety, was not concerned with criticism where his principles were involved, and regularly stood firm before the most determined opposition (pg. 77, 79, 82, 120, 123-126, 130, 195-198).  Churchill, however, was open to genuine self-criticism (pg. 155-158, 160).  Unsurprisingly, Churchill was perceived as a political opportunist, a maverick without deep loyalty to any political party as he switched back and forth between Conservatives and Liberals between 1904 and 1924 (pg. 66).  Furthermore, Churchill regularly flirted with death first during his military career and then in politics (pg. 57, 104-106).  Yet behind the public persona that radiated an aura of power and confidence, Churchill could sink in periods of depression that reminded him of his weaknesses (pg. 155-156, 171, 213).  Churchill acknowledged that without the help of the Almighty, he could have never succeeded (pg. 64, 72, 84-85, 115-117, 152-153).<br /><br />3) Would you be strong morally or physically?  You must resist temptations (pg. 57, 132, 161).  Churchill only asked of others what he required of himself (pg. 57, 106).  Churchill never gave in except to convictions of honor and good sense (pg. 151).  Churchill was not ashamed to show his emotions and compassionate nature (pg. 163, 172, 184).  Churchill's happy marriage to Clementine Hozier is a testimony of their faith in each other, despite the many differences existing between them (pg. 119-122, 135-138).  Churchill and his wife had to show much fortitude when dealing with the troubles of three of their four children (pg. 138, 153-154).<br /><br />Churchill's character was forged in adversity.  Churchill often learned the hard way.  This rich experience he gained progressively turned him into a towering presence that could see farther than most people did.

In March 1921, Winston Churchill, the newly appointed Secretary of State for the colonies and his advisers re-mapped the Middle East at the Cairo conference to primarily advance British interests in the region from the ruins of the disintegrated Ottoman Empire (pg. 125).<br /><br /> The imperial, pan-Arabic ambitions of the Hashemite family, bone fide senior descendants of Prophet Mohammed, also played a key role in modeling the region (pg. 47, 50-51, 102, 123, 129, 143, 156).  The ill-fated Sykes-Pico Agreement made in 1916 between France and Britain to contain Tsarist Russia in the region became meaningless after the fall of the Russian imperial government in 1917 (pg. 56, 64).  However, this agreement was not far from the minds of conference participants.  The Sykes-Pico Agreement has been perceived in some quarters as both a self-inflicted curse on the British and a betrayal to the Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule (pg. 42-43, 53, 61-62, 78-79, 122).<br /><br />In addition, events outside the direct control of conference participants were shaping the outcome of this conference.  The war-weary and very battered British Empire faced severe budgetary constraints following the ruinous Great War.  Furthermore, the war between Greece and Turkey waged after the end of WWI represented an additional constraint placed on conference participants, and especially on Churchill whose position in the cabinet depended solely on the goodwill of Lloyd George, his political boss (pg. 107-108, 161).  Churchill strongly opposed the disastrous pan-Hellenism of Prime Minister Lloyd George that ultimately resulted in the fall of the government by the end of 1922 (pg. 38-39, 60-61, 80, 198).  Churchill sensibly believed in the appeasement of Turkey to avoid a widespread Muslim rebellion in some British colonies, one of the many ironies of his long political life (pg. 70, 82, 98).<br /><br />One of the legacies of the Cairo conference was the creation of Iraq, the result of the amalgamation of the Ottoman provinces of Basra, Baghdad and Mosul.  This creation had disastrous consequences for the Kurds until the instauration of the no-fly zones in 1991 and for the Shia Muslims until the toppling of former President Saddam Hussein in 2003 (pg. 26, 92, 106-107, 125, 135-136, 150, 221-224).  At the insistence of Feisal, a Sunni Arab and the first King of Iraq, the British integrated the predominantly Sunny Kurds into Iraq to better balance the Shia Muslim majority in Southern Iraq with the Sunni Arabs in the center (pg. 26).  The British wrongly assumed that nationalism was stronger than religion (pg. 229-230).<br /><br />As Catherwood correctly points out, the real problem was ultimately how to square imperial designs of France and Britain in the region with President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, and especially with the policy of self-determination described in the fifth point (pg. 66, 112, 172-173).<br /><br />Britain had to do as if the Iraqi people had acclaimed overwhelmingly Feisal, while pulling the strings behind the scene to get the desired result (pg. 96, 124, 131, 151-152, 163, 170, 188).  However, the British wrongly underestimated Feisal's determination to become his own man in the eyes of his new subjects (pg. 153, 171, 176, 185-190, 197).  Unlike the French, the British did not, however, use force to get rid of Feisal but left him on his throne as the best deal available to them to preserve their interests in the region (pg. 142-144, 174-175).<br /><br />To the British, having an Arab King in Iraq and having some form of indirect British rule there were not incompatible objectives. The British Empire was largely built on indirect rule that turned out to be a cheap way to run an empire (pg. 58, 142, 212).  Surprisingly from the vintage of 21st century observers, oil was the missing factor in British political establishment's decision to become embroiled in Iraq (pg. 66-68, 113).  In contrast, the British generals and Americans were not oblivious to the future potential of Middle Eastern oil (pg. 75, 178).  However, the British ultimately stayed to obtain the oil of Iraq (pg. 205).<br /><br />British overreach around the world after WWI and the disastrous British policy in the war between Greece and Turkey pushed Churchill to sensibly privilege budgetary considerations above anything else (pg. 69, 95-96, 116-118, 169, 182).  Empire building on the cheap by propping up a friendly regime with the help of the sole Royal Air Force met the fierce resistance of the military establishment and their paymasters who were not enthusiastic about deep cuts in the Army's budget (pg. 72, 77, 101, 137, 165-169).  At the same time, Churchill knew that he was weakening the Empire's capacity to crush any eventual rebellion against British interference in the new country as subsequent events proved him right (pg. 74, 81-83, 94).  These contradictory considerations about how best to manage an occupied territory for the time needed to foster a friendly regime (read a capitalist democracy) are of course not foreign to the ultimate success of the Operation Iraqi Freedom (pg. 87, 133, 154).<br /><br />The map of today's Middle East and the problems still associated with this map owe their nature to the decisions made by Churchill and his advisers at the conference of Cairo (pg. 109, 227).  A successful transition to a Shia-dominated federal Iraq that preserves the rights and freedoms of Iraqi minorities could be one of the key factors to help isolate the most hawkish Iranian powerbrokers and ultimately facilitate the beginning of a serious dialogue involving Israel, the U.S. and Iran (pg. 227).  Furthermore, this successful transition in the core territory of Shia Islam could further foster tolerance between the two ancient branches of Islam in the countries of the region to the benefit of everybody (pg. 227-230).urprisingly from the vintage of 21st century observers, oil was the missing factor in British political establishment's decision to become embroiled in Iraq (pg. 66-68, 113).

Nasr explains in plain English how the different Islamic communities came to life, spread and evolved over time (pg. 18 - 24).  Nasr's journey through Islamic history usually shines through both its brevity and clarity (pg. 115-152).<br /><br />Unlike Bernard Lewis in his superb book \\"What Went Wrong? The Clash between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East (pg. 96-116),\\" Nasr does not always explain clearly to his (non-Islamic) readers why Islam, unlike Christianity, has not experienced the need to separate the spiritual from the temporal (pg. 26-28, 110-113, 173-177).  Nasr rightly reminds his readers of the unique contribution that Islamic science made to the development of Western science (pg. XXI - XXII, 121, 126).  Regularly, this immensely important contribution of Islamic scientists through their own observations, experiments and ideas, is ignored.  For example, in his otherwise excellent book, \\"The Essential Drucker,\\" Peter F. Drucker mentions the contribution of China, but not that of Islam, to the development of the West's technological lead by the end of the Middle Age (pg. 338).  Unlike China, Islam at its apex created a world civilization: poly-ethnic, multiracial and intercontinental as Lewis states (pg. 6).<br /><br />Nasr does a good job at illustrating the rich interdependence that exists among the Qur'an, the art of calligraphy and architecture (pg. XIX, 40, 121 and 126).  Nasr clearly explains which relationship the Prophet had with Allah and his human nature and how the Qur'an came to life through Divine guidance given to its Messenger (pg. 37-43, 62-64).  Nasr goes on in showing how the Hadiths and their codification happened over time and which role the Shariah fulfills in an Islamic society (pg. 54-58, 75-80).  Nasr also expands on the Schools of Islamic Thought and their history (pg. pg. 153-172).<br /><br />Nasr rightly reminds his audience that the Qur'an has codified from the beginning a number of women's rights that were unheard of for a long time in the West, a point that is often conveniently forgotten (pg. 67-70).  The further emancipation of women in the Islamic world, unfortunately, is not perceived as modernization but as westernization that amounts to a betrayal of true Islamic values in some Islamic quarters.  Unlike Lewis in his book mentioned above (pg. 101-102), Nasr apparently does want to acknowledge that the Holy Law of God, promulgated by revelation, has evolved in practice under the guise of tradition and reasoning (pg. 80).  Muslim rulers have added or subtracted rules over time.<br /><br />Nasr also illustrates the six pillars of the Islamic faith: Declaration of faith and acknowledgement of Muhammed, the Messenger of God, praying, fasting, pilgrimage, almsgiving as well as the widely misunderstood and abused jihad in the Islamic societies (pg. 3, 91-110).  Nasr's overview of Islam is ultimately an invitation to better know one of the major faiths whose influence is still far-reaching.ience that the Qur'an has codified from the beginning a number of women's rights that were unheard of for a long time in the West, a point that is often conveniently forgotten (pg. 67-70).

The Islamic world developed several centers of excellence that innovated and took over the leadership in most artistic and scientific disciplines for centuries (pg. 7, 78-79, 119, 139-140).  Muslims rightly perceived Medieval Europe as an area that had not much use to them, except in terms of slaves and raw materials (pg. 4).<br /><br />However, this complacent, condescending attitude of Islam towards other barbarian, infidel civilizations and a loss of interest in new learning progressively sapped the leadership of the Islamic world at a time that the Europeans started innovating again on a large scale, even before the Renaissance (pg. 7, 79, 81, 125).  This attitude is not so surprising when one knows that Christianity and Judaism have been perceived as imperfect precursors of Islam (pg. 36).  By that time, China stopped exploring the world behind its borders and entered a period of stagnation that lasted until the 20th century CE.<br /><br />Although the rise of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries CE slowed down the loss of influence of Islam in arts and sciences, the writing was on the wall (pg. 4-21).  Not only was the West progressively recovering more and more territories lost to Islamic rulers in the previous centuries, but more ominously regained its prominence in the marketplace (pg. 8, 15).  The Western trading companies and their subsequent colonial offspring des-intermediated the Islamic world and started their conquest of Islamic lands (pg. 31).  However, the weak Ottoman Empire was kept alive for centuries behind its useful time span.  It was not until the 19th century that the West started slicing and dicing the Empire thoroughly (pg. 33).  Western powers previously had no interest in the emergence of a Hapsburgs' superpower in Central and Eastern Europe.  Furthermore, these Western powers wanted and obtained from the Ottomans that the Western merchants could do business as they saw fit in this part of the Islamic world (pg. 19, 35).<br /><br />The Renaissance, the Reformation and the technological revolution went largely unnoticed in Islamic territories due to a prevalent attitude that nothing good could come from Barbarians and Infidels as Lewis rightly reminds his readers (pg. 7, 145).  However, the technological innovation of the West in the military area caught the attention of Muslims (pg. 12, 20, 39, 133-136, 141-143).  The Ottomans were the main adopters of European military know how after receiving the blessing of the leaders of the ulema, the Doctors of Holy Law; necessity knows no law (pg. 13, 25, 43).<br /><br />Unlike Europeans who traveled in increasing numbers through the Islamic world, very few Muslims ever visited the West during this to better appreciate the added value of the Western modus operandi to their respective societies (pg. 25, 40).  The ulema actively discouraged such travel except for the infidel minorities living in Islamic lands or Western adventurers offering their know how to Islam (pg. 26-29, 36-37, 44, 48-50, 147).<br /><br />Some dissenting voices stressed the need for broader reforms to modernize the Ottoman Empire, but were largely ignored or eliminated until the 19th century CE when it was basically too late (pg. 13, 28, 56-61, 70-71, 76-78, 95).  At best, knowledge was perceived as something to be treasured, not as an asset to leverage and expand (pg. 39).  This prevailing attitude was in sharp contrast to the modus operandi of medieval Islamic scientists who rose to worldwide prominence due to their openness to both foreign and domestic influences (pg. 79).  Others pushed for a return to the past, Islamic and Ottoman, to reverse the ongoing decline of the Islamic civilization (pg. 23, 164-165).  This debate is still raging (pg. 23, 63).<br /><br />To some extent, the French revolution and English parliamentary monarchy started changing this close-minded attitude by exposing Islam directly to Western ideas without the filter of foreigners and minorities (pg. 44, 55-56, 130).  For the 19th century and most of the 20th century CE, the Middle East focused its attention on both economics and politics to try to catch up with the West, but had limited success (pg. 46, 151-160).<br /><br />Lack of economic diversification, fast-growing population, insufficient local investments with the proceeds of energy exports, undemocratic regimes, woman's minority status and absence of separation between religious and political authority have left most of the region impoverished and open to extremism due to a lack of opportunities (pg. 47, 53-54, 61-63, 66-67, 73, 96-116, 129, 151-160).  In contrast to most countries of the region, Turkey drew the correct lessons from its past and embarked on an accelerated program of modernization under the leadership of Mustapha Kemal Atat&uuml;rk and his successors to catch up with the West (pg. 72-73, 76, 107-108, 143-144, 149-150). Similarly, East and South Asia have accepted and internalized Western achievements (pg. 148, 152).<br /><br />Most of the Islamic world is not condemned to its current destiny.  Capitalism and democracy are open to any country that wants to espouse modernity without sacrificing its rich cultural and religious heritage (pg. 151-152).  Islam can peacefully regain its greatness which should not have ever been lost to complacency, condescendence and later on to grievance and victimhood (pg. 151-160).  The Spanish Umayyad dynasty with its capital in Cordova and the Abbasid caliphs with their capital in Baghdad were world-renown centers of excellence in the arts and sciences in sharp contrast with the predominantly backward and intolerant West (pg. 33-34, 114, 139-140).  Perhaps, the Islamic genius lies dormant in the heart of many Muslims, just waiting for a constructive, creative spark to unleash their talent, energies and resources for rebuilding Islam which would stand for peace to remain truthful to its essence.  Muslims should be sold with conviction on the merits of capitalism and democracy as a viable alternative to illiberalism (pg. 160).This debate is still raging (pg. 23, 63).   <br /> <br />To some extent, the French revolution and English parliamentary monarchy started changing this close-minded attitude by exposing Islam directly to Western ideas without the filter of foreigners and minorities (pg. 44, 55-56, 130).  For the 19th century and most of the 20th century CE, the Middle East focused its attention on both economics and politics to try to catch up with the West, but had limited success (pg. 46, 151-160).   <br /> <br />Lack of economic diversification, fast-growing population, insufficient local investments with the proceeds of energy exports, undemocratic regimes, woman's minority status and absence of separation between religious and political authority have left most of the region impoverished and open to extremism due to a lack of opportunities (pg. 47, 53-54, 61-63, 66-67, 73, 96-116, 129, 151-160).  In contrast to most countries of the region, Turkey drew the correct lessons from its past and embarked on an accelerated program of modernization under the leadership of Mustapha Kemal Atatrk and his successors to catch up with the West (pg. 72-73, 76, 107-108, 143-144, 149-150). Similarly, East and South Asia have accepted and internalized Western achievements (pg. 148, 152). <br /> <br />Most of the Islamic world is not condemned to its current destiny.  Capitalism and democracy are open to any country that wants to espouse modernity without sacrificing its rich cultural and religious heritage (pg. 151-152).  Islam can peacefully regain its greatness which should not have ever been lost to complacency, condescendence and later on to grievance and victimhood (pg. 151-160).  The Spanish Umayyad dynasty with its capital in Cordova and the Abbasid caliphs with their capital in Baghdad were world-renown centers of excellence in the arts and sciences in sharp contrast with the predominantly backward and intolerant West (pg. 33-34, 114, 139-140).

US	49342515	R1YM785UTP0HKO	006093574X	710556265	Essential Drucker, The	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Perennial Wisdom from the High Priest of Management	The Essential Drucker is an excellent introduction to the Peter Drucker's writings on management.  Some readers, understandably, complain that the book is so general on some topics, that its practical value is sometimes limited.  Ultimately, this recapitulation of Drucker's essential thoughts about management is an invitation to rethink some commonly accepted views on management.  If one needs convincing on this point, consider the following ten examples:<br /><br />1) Contrary to popular belief, management and entrepreneurship are not opposite, but complimentary (pg. 8, 136-143, and 161-188).  An established company that does not innovate, is regularly doomed to what Joseph Schumpeter called creative destruction.  As Clayton Christensen demonstrates brilliantly in The Innovator's Dilemma, innovation is sometimes not even enough to avert business failure.  Similarly, a poorly managed start-up will often end up broken (pg. 144-160).<br /><br />2) One of the three tasks of management is managing social impacts and social responsibilities.  The recent wave of corporate scandals unfortunately illustrates this point too well, often with disastrous consequences for their authors and the stakeholders who have a key interest in the success of the organization (pg. 16-20).  Profit is not the explanation, cause or rationale of business behavior and business decisions, but rather the test of their validity as Drucker states (pg. 18).<br /><br />3) Neither is there a separate ethics of business, nor one is needed.  The ethics of responsibility is plain, everyday honesty.  The issue is one of moral values and moral education of the individual.  As Drucker bluntly points out, all that is needed is to mete stiff punishments to those - whether business executives or others - who yield to temptation (pg. 63-64).<br /><br />4) Few organizations reach at least 30% of all potential customers in any market.  And yet few organizations know anything about the non-customers (pg. 85).  To start changing this, organizations have to understand what existing and potential customers really value in a product or service.  This desired value is not necessarily what the supplier sells (pg. 86, 111, 148, 186).<br /><br />5) Each manager should have the information he needs to measure his own performance and should receive it soon enough to make any necessary changes. Yet in most organizations, the results of the audits do not go to the managers audited, but to the top management who then confronts these managers with the audit of their operations (pg. 121-122).  Management by self-control is more productive than management by domination to achieve excellence.<br /><br />6) Most executives do not perform very well when they promote or hire.  By all accounts, only one-third of such decisions turn out to be right; one-third are minimally effective; one-third are outright failures.  In no other area of management is such dismissal performance tolerated (pg. 127).  Drucker also reminds his readers that it is not intuitively obvious to most people that a new and different job requires a new and different behavior (pg. 132, 211).<br /><br />7) Few people realize that many people make decisions within organizations.  Knowledge workers who are considered partners rather than employees, can only be helped.  The close supervision of knowledge workers is often illusory because of their unique expertise.  Only effectiveness that focuses on contribution, transforms intelligence, imagination and knowledge into results (pg. 192-193, 196, 207).<br /><br />8) Warm feelings and pleasant words are meaningless, if there is no achievement in what is, after all, a work-focused and task-focused relationship. An occasional rough word will not disturb a relationship that produces results and accomplishments for all concerned according to Drucker (pg. 213-214).<br /><br />9) Many business policy statements contain no action commitment.  No wonder that the people in the organization tend to view these statements cynically because they do not reflect top management's true intentions (pg. 249).<br /><br />10) Leadership has little to do with leadership qualities and even less to do with charisma.  Leadership is a means that is mundane, unromantic and boring.  Its essence is performance (pg. 268).  The key characteristics of leadership are hard work, clear and legitimate  goals, responsibility, trust and integrity (pg. 269-271).le in the organization tend to view these statements cynically because they do not reflect top management's true intentions (pg. 249). <br /> <br />10) Leadership has little to do with leadership qualities and even less to do with charisma.

Chaleff also examines the interaction among followers within the leadership team in their relationship with the ultimate leader of the organization (pg. 14, 32).<br /><br />Like Peter Drucker in The Essential Drucker, Ira Chaleff acknowledges right away that leadership may be informal and distributed throughout an organization (pg. 14).  Knowledge workers, who are considered partners rather than employees, can only be helped.  The close supervision of knowledge workers is often illusory because of their unique expertise.<br /><br />Chaleff is conscious of the potential negative baggage associated with the word follower by making clear that a follower is not the same as a subordinate (pg. 15).  Chaleff recognizes that being a courageous follower can be a risky proposition.  Contingency plans are in any circumstances a necessity, whether the follower is courageous or not, in a fast-changing global economy (pg. 20-21, 163-165).  However, a respectful individual who is not afraid to speak and act on the truth, despite the inequities in the relationship between employee and employer, is a force to be reckoned with (pg. 20, 25).<br /><br />Not everybody is called upon to become and remain a courageous follower.  Chaleff divides followers into four profiles that he calls respectively, implementer, resource, individualist and partner.  Only the partner, who sooner rather than later dares to challenge on a regular basis the orthodoxy of the leadership team in a constructive, non-confrontational mode, can be counted on as a courageous follower (pg. 40-43, 51, 66, 103-104, 147-148).  Readers cannot conclude from this assessment that the contribution of the remaining profiles should be downplayed.  However, working closely with an existing or new leader open to the feedback from courageous followers is on its own an excellent growth opportunity (pg. 45, 217-218).  Chaleff reminds his audience that well-balanced professionals should take ownership of their career and look for growth opportunities both inside and outside their organization (pg. 45, 47-48).<br /><br />Reasonably, Chaleff recommends that the follower take an incremental, step-by-step approach to becoming a courageous follower (pg. 22).  There is no silver bullet for developing the profile of a courageous follower.  Credibility must be earned during the process.  As Chaleff states, service is an art and art is developed through commitment and discipline (pg. 85, 150-152).<br /><br />Passion for the job, initiative, buy-in, loyalty, trust, open mind and communication skills are some of the key ingredients in the establishment and development of a relationship based on courage (pg. 29, 48-50, 53, 62-63, 74, 84, 157).  These ingredients take on an even greater importance when a conflict arises between different leaders.  Often, these adversaries put pressure on their respective constituencies to build a strong alliance against the \\"enemy (pg. 81-82).\\"<br /><br />Courage cannot lead to disobedience unless special circumstances such as the preservation of life and the respect of the law are deemed important enough to supersede the human tendency to follow orders (pg. 101-103, 170-171, 178-181, 183-185).  Leaving the organization will sometimes be the only option left to the courageous follower to maintain his/her integrity after having exhausted other options (pg. 155-187).  However, courage does not need to be absolute.  The courageous follower could decide to stay after trying in vain to convince the leadership team or leader about the perceived right course to follow (pg. 185-187).<br /><br />Courageous following is a two-way street. A great leader is not afraid to develop courageous followers because of his/her sense of self-worth (pg. 29, 50, 106-116, 125-128, 189-212).  Similarly, the courageous follower is willing and able to directly or indirectly comfort and confront the leader, at the right time and at the right place (pg. 61-62, 97-98).  The courageous follower should not abuse his/her access to the leader.  Otherwise, access will diminish over time (pg. 64).  Developing this talent pool can be critical to the success and/or survival or an organization because of the dangers of groupthink, self-censorship and lack of concern for legal niceties (pg. 99-101, 122, 130-131, 189-193).  Unfortunately, a common response is to devalue the individuals taking the stand with potentially disastrous consequences as the recent wave of corporate scandals convincingly demonstrates (pg. 215-217).<br /><br />Courageous followers, conscious of the importance of buy-in, are flexible enough to see their ideas tested on a small scale with good measurements before a full-blown implementation is considered (pg. 55-56).  Furthermore, courageous followers offer if possible at least three different options with their respective pros and cons to get this buy-in (pg. 74-76).  Acting along these lines encourages consensus building in pursuing success.<br /><br />Although leaders receive much value from courageous followers, leaders also need to keep their channels of communication open with their peers as Chaleff rightly points out (pg. 76).  A leader's peers, especially those who do not belong to the same professional circles, can provide him/her with an extremely valuable service in further refining the leadership skills in a multitude of settings (pg. 76-77).  Alternatively, an outside facilitator can be called in to coach the leader (pg. 139-140).<br /><br />Changing a leader's behavior is usually more challenging than altering his/her policies for these people gravitating around the leader (pg. 87, 93-94, 132-134, 145-147, 183-185).  In all these interactions, the negative feedback should not be directed at the leader himself/herself in order to keep communication channels open (pg. 94-95).  When genuine transformation happens, it should be acknowledged and celebrated (pg. 152-153).g. 29, 50, 106-116, 125-128, 189-212).

Ferguson does not downplay at all the sins of the British administration in its colonies: e.g., eager pursuit of slavery in the 18th century, brutal crushing of failed rebellions against British rule in the 19th and 20th centuries and mismanagement of famines in the 19th century.<br />However, the British Empire played a key role in the spread of the ideas that have conquered the world: free markets, democracy, Anglo-Saxon culture ... and Pax Britannica (now Pax Americana).  As Michael Mandelbaum reminds us in his masterpiece about the ideas that conquered the world, free markets tend to promote democracy and enrich most of their economic agents over time.  And democracies are inclined to conduct peaceful foreign policies.<br />Before WWI, Britain was the most fervent advocate of free trade.  Furthermore, British imperial power relied on the massive export of capital and people.  The U.S., heir and adopter of many best practices of the British Empire, however, became a convert to free trade only after WWI.  Furthermore, unlike the British Empire, the U.S., currently at the apex of its power and influence, is a massive importer of capital and people.<br />Ferguson rightly points out that the British Empire had a self-liquidating character.  The British Empire learned from the American Independence that granting self-government to the most advanced colonies (read White Dominions) was key to its survival.  Nonetheless, the British Empire was clearly ambivalent about self-government beyond its White Dominions.  The British Empire understood that this ambivalence was not even sustainable: e.g., India was granted Dominion status in the 1930s.  The crippling price that the British Empire paid in defeating the partisans of Illiberalism in both world wars accelerated its inevitable decline due to a lack of resources to meet the growing challenges and opportunities of globalization.<br />Ferguson also reminds his audience that the failed de-colonization in many Third World countries clearly shows that the achievements of the British Empire cannot be taken for granted.  Although guns, germs and steel have played an important role in the fates of these human societies as Jared Diamond rightly points out in his best seller, civil wars and lawless, corrupt governments are today the ultimate culprits for their failure.  Without free markets, a country is condemned to remain at the doorstep of the world and sink in both oblivion and irrelevance unless it is a dangerous failed state.  Without the exercise or at least the threat of (soft) power, there cannot be globalization that ultimately benefits most human beings.  The network of bases and informal spheres of influence are some of the tools that the U.S. has at its disposal to further the advancement of the current liberal hegemony that cannot be taken for granted.  Sometimes, the temporary occupation of the most dangerous failed states is key to facilitate the ultimate advent of democracy that Winston Churchill nicely describes as the worst form of government except for all the other forms that have been tried from time to time.zation. <br />Ferguson also reminds his audience that the failed de-colonization in many Third World countries clearly shows that the achievements of the British Empire cannot be taken for granted.

US	49342515	R1SI1GD1NN03Z8	0375760741	88544726	The Lessons of Terror: A History of Warfare Against Civilians	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Fairness of War: Subjective Assessment	In The Lessons of Terror, Caleb Carr artificially separates international terrorism from domestic terrorism.  Terrorism does not know borders and has disciples almost everywhere.  Carr, however, is right to depict terrorists not as ordinary criminals but as warriors who deliberately target civilians with the purpose of undermining their determination to support either leaders or policies that these warriors oppose.<br />Carr uses historical precedents that aim at showing that terrorism is a spectacularly failed tactic, what is not always true or proves to be correct only a few centuries after the facts.  Some victimized civilian populations such as the survivors of Carthage after the Third Punic War, the Amerindians at the end of the 19th century or the civilians of the Axis Powers after WWII had no longer the capacity and/or willingness to retaliate.  Other victimized civilian populations such as the direct witnesses of the atrocities of the Roman Empire or Crusaders were long dead before their nemeses were finally defeated.  Furthermore, the victors could have shielded their own terrorists from justice because they were perceived as patriots and heroes, not as criminals.  In these circumstances, perpetrators of these atrocities against civilians have been answerable for their crimes only after their own death.<br />Unlike Carr, Victor Hanson in Carnage and Culture clearly shows that the real atrocity for the Westerner is not the number of corps, but the manner in which soldiers and civilians died and the protocols under which they were killed.  The West believes that only war waged through open and direct assault is fair, regardless of the frightful losses inflicted on the adversary.  The West has never accepted the logic of far fewer killed through ambush, terrorism, or the execution of prisoners and noncombatants as the current situation in Iraq convincingly demonstrates.  However, Carr has a point that the West has not always practiced what it has been preaching on this subject.  The Nazis and their allies come prominently to mind in their systematic disregard of the rules of Western civilization that did not save them from ultimate defeat.<br />Although Carr praises the military campaign that the U.S. launched against Afghanistan in the aftermath of 9/11, he is very negative in his appraisal of domestic efforts to prevent a repetition of this tragedy.  Carr also harshly criticizes the Bush Junior administration for asking Americans to go about their lives and business as usual.  Carr apparently does not want to acknowledge that a capitalist, democratic society is by definition an open society that thrives on exchanges within its borders and with the rest of the world.  Vigilance and awareness rather than paranoia are required.  Otherwise, one plays the game of terrorists and turn one's life into a prison.<br />Interestingly, Carr wrote his book before the launch of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Carr states that fighting terrorism requires at times force against terrorists and the states protecting them, at other times diplomacy conducted with the states that are willing to mend their ways.  Ultimately, Carr correctly pushes for the adoption of an international convention that should outlaw terrorism after the model of previous conventions banning for example piracy, slavery and genocide.  Carr, however, wrongly downplays the importance of the political dimension of terrorism.  No one can vanquish terrorism as long as its breeding ground is not drained.  Bombarding a swamp can kill a few mosquitoes, but not their capacity to be born again and haunt their future victims.<br /><br />Although Carr scores some points in describing some shortcomings of the DOD, the CIA and the NSC, he does not seem to acknowledge the difficulty of their task.  Whoever has ever been involved in intelligence gathering and assessment knows that sometimes it can be extremely difficult to get a complete picture of an existing or potential threat.  Intelligence is both an art and a science that is just as good as its imperfect human practitioners.  Furthermore, the choice of allies sometimes requires association with dirty friends in order to fight dirty enemies.  A carrot and stick certification policy is in place to minimize the risk that these dirty friends metamorphose into dirty enemies.  In addition, waging war has never been a clean business because of inevitable civilian casualties that are sometimes euphemistically referred as collateral damage.  Finally, as Max Boot reminds his readers in Savage Wars of Peace Small Wars and the Rise of American Power, the U.S. military should continue to nurture its different branches with the same care so that it can fight any type of war, including terror against civilians, with equal efficiency.at.

Hanson's originality and genius lies in his systematic (to some readers ad nauseam) demonstration that the military superiority of the West mirrors larger social, economical, political and cultural practices that at first glance have not much relevance to the art and science of warfare.  Unlike most historians, Hanson rightly believes that this superiority of the West is not merely due to superior weapons.  Only the Western culture has had the discipline, morale and sheer technology expertise in perfecting its killing know-how over time as Hanson efficiently demonstrates through his narration and analysis of nine landmark battles.  Hanson makes clear that he has not selected a few battles that by coincidence or sheer luck prove his point.<br />Hanson also drives the point home that he does not downplay the courage that adversaries of the Western armed forces have often displayed for naught on the battlefield.  Sometimes, the West was outsmarted temporarily but ultimately regained its supremacy over its Non-Western enemies because of its cultural institutions.  Hanson convincingly shows that not even battlefield inexperience, lack of courage, outnumbered troops or poor command has had any lasting impact on Western dominance in battle.  Citizens systematically turn out to be history's deadliest killers.  Reaction, innovation, initiative and individualism have often outweighed the merits of method, consensus and adherence to hierarchy and protocol.<br />Furthermore, Hanson states that the West was not naturally smarter than the rest of the world.  Unlike some historians, Hanson rightly does not believe in a deterministic approach to Western military superiority based solely on biology, geography and guns.  In his examination of the Battle of Tenochtitlan, Hanson however acknowledges that disease and hunger helped Hernan Cortes and his men finish the job and overcome the resistance of Amerindians.  However, the victory of Spain over Mexicas was primarily due to the military brilliance, ruthlessness and courage of Cortes and his main lieutenants in 1520-1521.<br /><br />Evolving capitalist and democratic institutions, free inquiry as well as rationalism, have often given Western capitalists and scientists a pragmatic and utilitarian umbrella protecting them from religious fundamentalists, state censors or stern cultural conservatives.  The West has not hesitated to incorporate the best military practices of its adversaries into its wars of annihilation or improvise on the battlefield with deadly effect.  Western military forces have almost always been interested first in the decisive crushing and destruction of their adversaries, and then in social recognition, religious salvation and cultural status.<br />Hanson shows that Alexander the Great discarded Western rationality in favor of Asian theocracy during his Asian conquests in the fourth century BC that ultimately resulted in plutocratic god-kingdoms, unstable Hellenism in Asia and the destruction of embryonic democracy in Greece.  Unsurprisingly, the Roman Republic truthful to Hellenic politics, civic militarism and decisive shock-and-awe warfare destroyed these degenerated god-kingdoms across its way one after the other in the next three centuries.  Other dynasts fell victim to this Western dual idea of free citizen/soldier in the following centuries without ever getting it before Rome crushed them decisively.<br />Despite the ultimate destruction of the long-lasting Roman Empire, this Western tradition of warfare was not lost in Europe.  Islamic armies got a bitter taste of these warfare strategies and tactics at the decisive land battle of Tours-Poitiers in 732 and at the sea battle of Lepanto in 1571, despite their fighting spirit.<br />Hansonalso reminds his audience that the West generally has a dislike of wars waged in jungles, stealthily at night and as counter-terrorists to combat enemies who avoid direct and open confrontation with it.  The frightful losses inflicted on western civilians and soldiers are considered cowardly and do not reflect the open and direct warfare style that the West deems fair on the battlefield.  Non-Western men and women have often joined Western armies to help neutralize other Natives due to a perceived fairness of Western conquerors.<br />Finally, Hanson observes that many adversaries of the West have realized that merely possessing Western weapons is not enough to ultimately be victorious.  These adversaries have often made the historic error to assume that Western democracies, slow to anger, are somehow weak and timid.nson also reminds his audience that the West generally has a dislike of wars waged in jungles, stealthily at night and as counter-terrorists to combat enemies who avoid direct and open confrontation with it.

Books	4	2	4	N	N	The Ever-Lasting Appeal of Churchill	John Lukas clearly states at the beginning of his short book that his collection of essays is neither a biography nor a scholarly study of Winston Spencer Churchill (pg. xiii).  Therefore, potential readers of Lukas' book who do not know anything about the key milestones in the life and career of Churchill should not start here.  These readers can read books such as \\"Churchill a Life\\", \\"Churchill a Study in Greatness\\", \\"Clementine Churchill The Biography of a Marriage\\", \\"Winston and Clementine The Personal Letters of the Churchills\\" or \\"The Wit & Wisdom of Winston Churchill\\" to fill in the most glaring gaps in their knowledge of Churchill for that purpose.<br />Lukas writes to the attention of an audience who has an unquenchable thirst to know more and more about an individual who remains a source of inspiration to many men and women who stand in the way of barbarity and illiberalism around the world.<br />Although Lukas is generally sympathetic to Churchill, he is not blind to his major shortcomings: impetuosity, impatience, stubbornness and fancifulness (pg. 4, 154).  Furthermore, Lukas reminds his audience in his essay \\"His Failures.  His Critics\\" that Churchill had accumulated errors and mistakes that Churchill critics and detractors were attributing to his flawed character (pg. 129).  For example, Churchill's futile fight against granting Dominion status to India from 1929 to 1935 was perhaps compatible with his imperialist credentials but certainly a clear blemish on his record.  As a very experienced politician and knowledgeable historian at that time, Churchill should have known much better (pg. 14-15, 24, 135-136).  Therefore, Lukas' collection of essays should not be construed as a shameful hagiography.<br />Furthermore, Lukas reminds his audience in \\"Churchill's historianship\\" and \\"Churchill the visionary\\" that Churchill was generally cognizant of the lessons that he could draw from past events to articulate his often-visionary policies while reflecting on and shaping history on his turn (pg. 1-18, 47).  Churchill was not only a spectator, but also a key actor and play writer of human comedy (pg. 102).<br />Lukas also explores the ups and downs that Churchill had in his relationships with other history shapers such as Charles De Gaulle, Dwight Eisenhower, Adolf Hitler, Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin (pg. 19-20).  Lukas convincingly explains that Churchill was facing an unpalatable choice between a Europe entirely ruled by Nazi Germany or half of Europe dominated by the Communists in case of allied victory (pg. 11, 27-28, 35).  Churchill rightly first gave top priority to successfully fighting Hitler to death before trying in vain to stop Stalin in 1944-1945.  Unlike some unimaginative people, Churchill understood right at the birth of the Soviet Union that the Bolsheviks should be stopped immediately before they grew into a gathering threat to the world.  War-weary, the victors of WWI, unfortunately, gave only half-hearty support to the White Russians in their desperate fight against the Soviets (pg. 23).  Once again, long-term pains were the reward for short-term gains.<br />Some (American) readers will not be very pleased while reading Lukas' unflattering portrait of Eisenhower and the men around him in \\"Churchill and Eisenhower.\\"  As mentioned above, Churchill was definitely right to try to thwart in 1944-1945 the apparently irresistible advance of the Soviets in Central and Eastern Europe.  Churchill clearly understood that geography and territory mattered, not ideology (pg. 42).  For that reason, the British army met the Russians east of the entry to the Danish peninsula at the request of Churchill in 1945 (pg. 45).  Unfortunately, the American leadership did not want to hear anything about it at that time (pg. 35-40, 46).  Some European regions such as former East Germany and the Czech Republic should have been eventually spared the murderous and inefficient rule of the former Soviet Union (pg. 43).  TheGreeks should continue to be very thankful to Churchill for saving them from a communist tyranny (pg. 41, 48).<br />In his famous, visionary Iron Curtain speech in 1946, Churchill expressed his concern with the murderous, inefficient embrace of Communism in the European regions under Stalin's control.  American reception of this historic speech was at best lukewarm (pg. 47).  Churchill knew better and was predicting at the end of 1952 that time was not on the side of Communism (pg. 48, 79).<br />After the death of Stalin in 1953, Churchill, Prime Minister again, could not convince his friend Eisenhower, who in the meantime became President of the U.S.A., of finding some kind of accommodation with the new Soviet leadership (pg. 70, 73-74).  Subsequent events proved that Eisenhower was right when he saw no difference after Stalin was gone (pg. 71, 77).  Contrary to what Lukas thinks, Eisenhower should not be described as a leader without any vision under the nefarious influence of men such as John Foster Dulles (pg. 79-80).  Many western leaders shared Eisenhower's views on this subject (pg. 81-82).  The former Soviet Union was not yet in sufficient decline in the early 1950s to negotiate in a position of force with it as world leaders such as President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher understood very well in the 1980s.43).

Free markets, through their workings such as constitutionalism, civil society, the rule of law, property-protecting and contract-enforcing state, entrepreneurship, competition and mass consumption, tend to promote democracy and enrich most of their economic agents over time (pg. 11, 234-237, 257, 268-274, 289-295, 313-318, 394).  A responsible social safety net, however, is key to stability of free markets (pg. 299-304, 340-341, 402).<br />2. Democracies are inclined to conduct peaceful foreign policies (pg. 11, 237).  Popular sovereignty, constitutionalism, civil society and political habit of compromise are key drivers of peace and minority protection (pg. 249-250, 259, 269).  Furthermore, defense dominance and weapon system transparency are built on the recognition that the problem of collective security can only be solved through systemic cooperation nurtured over time (pg. 113-114, 129-131, 231).<br />The common denominator of free markets, democracy and peace is their focus on the individual (pg. 31).  Illiberalism such as Communism and Fascism stresses the strength of the state through group cohesion and solidarity rather than the welfare of individuals (pg. 254, 336).<br />Before WWI, this set of liberal ideas was not firmly established in the British Empire and the U.S. from which it came.  Britain was the most fervent advocate of free trade but was clearly ambivalent about self-government beyond its White Dominions and dismissal of any limit to power projection.  The U.S. was protectionist rather than a convert to free trade, was an impire rather than an empire until the 1890s and had not yet granted the benefits of democracy to all its inhabitants in spite of its unequivocal constitution (pg. 33, 87).<br />At the Conference of Paris in 1919 just after WWI, President Woodrow Wilson could not convince the victorious empires how closely related were the rise of free markets and the devaluation of war.  The high price of war to the victors and perhaps more importantly poor salesmanship from President Wilson himself in the U.S. and abroad ultimately led to the rise and dismissal of an emasculated League of Nations and disastrous economic protectionism in the 1930s (pg. 20-24, 359, 363, 393).<br />The emergence of Fascism and Communism, two new murderous, inefficient rivals to Liberalism, was the bitterest legacy of WWI, the Conference of Paris and subsequent peace conferences (pg. 33, 41, 54-55).  Liberalism succeeded in defeating and discrediting Fascism at the end of WWII in 1945 and Communism at the end of the Cold War in 1989 (pg. 253).<br />The liberal theory of history has found its historical validation for example in the successful conversion of fascist Germany and Japan to Liberalism in the decades after their crushing defeat in 1945.  These successful conversions to Liberalism demonstrate which way the lagging peripheral countries should go to ultimately emerge in the limelight (pg. 6, 79-86, 174-181, 279-280).<br />Mandelbaum also reminds his audience that in the post-cold war era, the core countries have lost much interest in what is going on in the periphery (pg. 96, 198-199).  China, Russia and the Middle East are three major exceptions to this loss of interest in the periphery (pg. 7).  Core countries legitimately fear that undesirable developments in some peripheral countries, especially failed states, if left unchecked, could have a negative impact in their backyard (pg. 182-187).<br /><br />The Middle East is of interest to core countries due to its reserves of oil, the existence of weapons of mass destruction and the presence of fearsome terrorist networks on its soil (pg. 97-99, 199-230).  Operation Iraqi Freedom is an expression of this interest in the region on behalf of a well-understood Liberalism (pg. 403-412).<br />China and Russia remain a source of concern to the core countries because theyhave not yet fully embraced the tenets of Liberalism (pg. 306-307, 390-391).  Like Germany at the beginning of the 20th century, Russia and China are not satisfied with their military place in the world today and can become a source of instability tomorrow (pg. 160-174).  Furthermore, both countries harbor powerful economic ambitions (pg. 160).  The inability of economic socialism to be productive enough and meet the wants and needs of its economic agents behind the military sphere has made a gradual transition to economic liberalism vital to the survival of the Chinese and Russian nomenklatura (pg. 48, 52, 66-67, 99-104, 261-265, 291, 309).  No Communist regime in the 20th century came to power through a coup d'etat staged by an impoverished, mobilized and ideologically committed working class (pg. 233).<br />The current liberal hegemony, which is not per se irreversible, does not make everybody happy.  Some of its most determined opponents include Middle Eastern terrorists and the western-inspired anti-globalization movement who do not offer any constructive, workable alternative to Liberalism (pg. 38-39).<br /><br />The United States, spiritual successor of the British Empire, has a key role to play in the successful spread and survival of this Wilsonian triad (pg. 7, 88, 327, 358, 381-382, 404).  The  technological, economic, military and cultural leadership of the U.S. requires that Americans bear a higher burden than their fair share in the maintenance and development of Liberalism (pg. 88, 153, 364-365, 389).  The harshest critics of the U.S. for example in Europe and Asia should keep this in mind instead of taking it for granted (pg. 153, 363-365, 388-390).<br />Passing interest in the (most dangerous) failed states is a recipe for disaster (pg. 193-199).  In too many places around the world, democracy and capitalism are foreign transplants that must be cultivated long enough to take deep roots (pg. 259-260, 297-298, 311-313, 386-387).

US	49342515	RB6IC6UG44MKE	046500721X	758212963	The Savage Wars Of Peace: Small Wars And The Rise Of American Power	Books	5	7	14	N	N	The Art and Science of Waging Small Wars	In Savage Wars of Peace Small Wars and the Rise of American Power, Max Boot has written an authoritative treatise about guerilla warfare or small wars in which the country has been involved almost since the beginning of its existence.  Contrary to the popular myth, the U.S. military has fought numerous small wars in its history to promote the country's interests overseas, often without a prior declaration of war.  Boot masterfully explains how the country was first a commercial power before becoming a great power in the 1890s and then a superpower in 1941.  Boot guides readers around the world and brings back to their memory some American heroes that are sometimes almost completely forgotten in the general public.<br />Boot also clearly shows that the U.S. military progressively lost its hard-won expertise in waging small wars after WWII with disastrous consequences in some small wars overseas that resulted in the birth of the Powell Doctrine (pg. 318-319).  Boot reminds his readers that the U.S. military has to use the Powell Doctrine as a benchmark because of the sui generis nature of small wars (pg. 318-320, 336-341, 352).  The U.S. military should continue to nurture its different branches with the same care so that it can fight any type of war with equal efficiency (pg. 331, 350-351).  Boot also looks at the Body Bag Syndrome and its nefarious consequences on the deterrence power of the U.S. military in the world (pg. 327-330, 347).  Under-commitment and lack of confidence are as dangerous as imperial overstretch and hubris (pg. 352).<br />Most importantly, Boot's masterpiece contains some life-saving lessons very useful to the duty-bound Coalition accomplishing its mission in Iraq:<br />1. The massive development aid, which could make ordinary Iraqis increasingly receptive to the coalition efforts, is a long-term project.  The most immediate need is to provide Iraqi cities and villages with security against the irregulars who tax locals for food, shelter, intelligence and bodies (pg. 304).<br />2. Thanks to the nurturing of mixed, well-trained infantry units stationed in all places not yet pacified, coalition troops know from past experience that they can rapidly improve their urban-jungle-warfare skills (pg. 305, 331). Because of their vulnerability, small outposts in Iraqi cities and villages should be perceived as able to count on massive support, if necessary (pg. 306-307).  The Iraqi police are not the right candidate to populate these units due to a lack of both proper training and equipment.  No restive place such as Fallujah can be off-limits to the combined action platoons (pg. 307, 311); nor can rebel sanctuaries outside Iraq be tolerated (pg. 316-317).  Otherwise, the cancer rapidly metastasizes (pg. 350).<br />3. An efficient program should be developed or further improved in conjunction with law-abiding Iraqi citizens to identify and neutralize the irregulars after the example of the efficient Phoenix program (pg. 310).  By interacting in a friendly manner with the native citizens, the mixed fighting units will be able to win their trust and confidence and gain invaluable intelligence supplied by friendly informants about enemy intentions and movements (pg. 305-307).  Furthermore, the close involvement of coalition troops in the daily life of ordinary Iraqis gives them a stake in the war (pg. 306).  In addition, slow rotations of key members of coalition forces are essential because building trust and confidence is personal and requires time (pg. 306-307).<br />4. Some coalition soldiers who independently operate from their Iraqi counterparts have limited friendly interaction with ordinary Iraqis mainly due to linguistic and cultural barriers as well as their isolation in their fortified compounds.  Their efficiency in the field is not always optimal for these reasons (pg. 306).<br />5. The large-scale search-and-destroy strategy alone often is a counterproductive attrition strategy in guerilla warfare due to its futility and high costs (pg. 304, 316).  This strategy will repeatedly fail to win the hearts and minds of ordinary Iraqis due to the prohibitive costs they often incur.  Furthermore, this same strategy is squandering public support for the operation Iraqi Freedom in the coalition countries due to the failure to deliver long-term, visible results (pg. 307-308, 316).  Coalition forces have to restrict their operations because guerilla warfare requires the utmost discrimination in neutralization (pg. 289, 314, 348).<br />6. The continuing presence of coalition forces is necessary for many years after the transfer of sovereignty back to the Iraqis until the future apolitical and federal army can defend itself and the capitalist, democratic and peaceful regime its serves against the enemies of progress.  Countries such as former West Germany and South Korea have shown the efficiency of this policy (pg. 312, 314).  In too many places around the world, democracy and capitalism are foreign transplants that must be cultivated long enough to take deep roots (pg. 349).  Premature withdrawal severely limits effectiveness by encouraging coalition foes to wait for its withdrawal (pg. 337).  Furthermore, it often leads to a return to ineffectual dictatorships due to the absence of strong enough institutions (pg. 251, 324-325, 344-346, 349, 351).<br />After waging a conventional war successfully, the Coalition should remain optimistic about its chance to defeat the insurgency in Iraq.  Despite the almost mystical aura that the word guerilla has won, most guerilla campaigns fail miserably (pg. 314).due to its futility and high costs (pg. 304, 316).

If one needs convincing on this point, consider the following examples:<br />1) Hodge states on pg. 29 that, in modern times, the discovery of oil has turned the Arabian Peninsula into a very developed region.  Unfortunately, most countries in the Arabian Peninsula still have a sub-optimal economic performance compared to the most developed regions of the world, to say nothing of politics.<br />2) Hodge writes on pg. 185 that to many in the West, jihad is associated with such images as hordes of Muslim armies offering the conquered nations Islam or the sword.  For example, conquering Islamic armies in France were not being tourists or peacefully converting locals to Islam before Christian King Charles Martel and his Frankish army routed them at the decisive battle of Tours-Poitiers in 732.<br />3) Hodge states on pg. 192 that Muslim leaders and individuals all over the world express condemnation and outrage when innocent people are the victims of acts of terrorism.  Unfortunately, many moderate Muslims do not speak out often enough or loud enough to condemn terrorism in unequivocal terms.  All too often, extremists dominate the stage.<br />4) Hodge writes on pg. 194 that all over the world, women are engaged in a constant struggle for their God-given status and rights.  Unfortunately, most Muslim women still have a subordinate status compared to women in the most developed regions of the world.<br />Islam, one of the most influential faiths that has ever existed, deserves a much better coverage than this apologetic and biased representation of this major religion and its practitioners.  The Everything Understanding Islam Book renders a big disservice to an honest interfaith dialogue that is more necessary than ever.	2004-04-11

Cohen masterfully discusses the normal theory of civilian control and how Abraham Lincoln, Georges Clemenceau, Winston Churchill and David Ben-Gurion breached the theory.  All four men were four great democratic leaders at war for the survival of their respective nations.  Cohen also looks at the civil-military relations in the current war against terrorism and WMD proliferation that our country is waging.  The normal theory of civilian control posits that the civilian leadership take the back seat after defining the overall strategy.  It is then up to the military leadership once given a mission to get near total discretion in its execution.<br />Cohen persuasively demonstrates that Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill and Ben-Gurion rightly believed that war was too important to be left to the generals.  Unsurprisingly, they were all embroiled in conflict with their respective military establishment.  They were accused of being \\"micro-managers\\", making some blunders here and there to be truthful to their records.  Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill and Ben-Gurion were all somewhat open to influence, and practiced what Cohen calls an unequal dialogue with their generals - a dialogue in which both sides expressed their views bluntly, eventually offensively, and not once but repeatedly.  Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill and Ben-Gurion made very clear to their generals that the final authority of civilian leadership was unquestionable.  Interestingly, in their book \\"Execution The Discipline of Getting Things Done\\", Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan come to a similar conclusion.  The most effective business leaders are not out of touch with day-to-day activities but are deeply involved with all aspects of execution.<br />Although Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill and Ben-Gurion lived in different times and dealt with very different sets of problems, Cohen brilliantly demonstrated that they were remarkably very similar on several key points:<br />1) Mastery of Detail: Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill and Ben-Gurion demonstrated a measure of intuition and genius that stands well above the norm in human affairs.  They all shared a capacity for integrating a vast amalgam of constantly changing information coming from many sources and an ability to synthesize and comprehend how a multiplicity of factors were interacting with one another.  The eye for - indeed, the fascination with - detail displayed by these four men was not a mere irritating trait on their part but an essential element of their art and science of war.  Furthermore, these four great statesmen were all not only well read in history, politics and literature but also the most gifted orators and authors.<br /><br />2) Ruthlessness: Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill and Ben-Gurion were very good \\"butchers\\", the first requirement for success as a prime minister to quote British Prime Minister, William Gladstone.  These four statesmen, who had an exceptional ability to judge other men, strikingly had an unusual hardness in dealing with their enemies, wavering allies or internal opposition.<br />3) Fascination with Technology: Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill and Ben-Gurion had a great interest in new technology and were great learners who studied war as if they felt compelled to know in many ways as much as their generals did.<br />4) Obstinate, Unyielding Determination: The resolution Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill and Ben-Gurion personified was the hard will of men who dealt with the greatest task of their lives, who had seen much and who did not make themselves illusions about the potential lethal outcome of their enterprise.<br />5) Moderation: Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill and Ben-Gurion displayed moderation totally compatible with their steely determination.  The emotional state of these four statesmen was in deep contrast with that of those around them because of their unusual courage.<br />6) Courage:  Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill and Ben-Gurion were blessed and cursed with the ability to see things as they are, without illusions.  They persevered despite disappointments and perils behind and ahead of them.<br />Survivors of terrorism, whose only \\"crime\\" was perhaps to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, know better than most people that the WMD and terrorist threat should be, under no circumstances, underestimated.  Usually far from public sight, some victims of terrorism and WMD attacks are expected to continue to pay a heavy price until the end of their life on earth.  Democracy will once again prevail over barbarity, regardless of the price that will be paid in the meantime.  Hopefully, terrorists, WMD peddlers and their sponsors will realize it sooner rather than later in their best interest.<br />As a side note, Cohen could write a book about exceptional stateswoman such as Joan of Arc, Margaret Thatcher and Golda Meir and compare their leadership style with the four above-mentioned statesmen.ability to see things as they are, without illusions.

Curzon was born and raised as an aristocrat at a time that the British Empire was at its apex in the decades before WWI.  Unlike the rest of his family, Curzon was very ambitious and determined to leave his mark in history.  Gilmour makes a judicious use of Curson's writings to show us how extraordinarily well-traveled Curzon was for a man of his time.  Curzon had a first-hand knowledge of many foreign issues, his undeniable specialty, unlike such luminaries as Lloyd George, A. J. Balfour, to name a few.  Curzon was a work alcoholic, self-centered person who sounded condescending at times and was unable to delegate much because of his very exacting standards.  Furthermore, Curzon often did not display much emotional intelligence in his relationship with others, including his own family.  Unsurprisingly, Curzon's peers and superiors in politics found him regularly unbearable in Parliament, during his viceroyalty in India and as a member of different cabinets in the last decade of his life.  Chirol summarized it very well when he told Hardinge that Curzon had the knack of saying the wrong thing, or even, when he says the right thing, of saying it in the wrong way, is quite extraordinary.  I can recall no instance of a man whose personal unpopularity has to the same extent neutralized his immense abilities and his power of rendering great services.  Gilmour shows very clearly how Curzon could be well ahead of his time in fields such as foreign policy and protection of old monuments and at the same time be so backward in such areas as women's rights and his attitude to nationalism.  Overworked for most of his life, Curzon died prematurely at the age of 66.  However, Curzon left some built-to-last monuments to posterity: think for instance about the impressive restoration of at one time decrepit Taj Mahal in India, the negotiation of the Lausanne Treaty that formalized the existence of Modern Turkey or Remembrance Day, a fitting tribute to the Fallen Heroes.e of Modern Turkey or Remembrance Day, a fitting tribute to the Fallen Heroes.	2004-01-23

Furthermore, the Ottoman State was undermined internally by increasingly restive minorities that no longer accepted their subservient condition, as well as, by part of the elite that was dissatisfied with the perceived backwardness and incompetence of the Ottoman ruling class.  Born in Salonica in today's Greece around 1880 in a Muslim, Turkish-speaking and middle-class family, Atat&uuml;rk early on made up his mind to join the westernizing army and thereby discard the external signs of oriental life.<br />Mango narrates with mastery the steady progress that Atat&uuml;rk, a successful and popular student, made during his military education.  Work was all that mattered to Atat&uuml;rk.  Atat&uuml;rk became a politically savvy professional soldier while studying hard during his years of military education in Istanbul, the imperial capital.  After his admission to the prestigious Staff College at 21, Atat&uuml;rk kept in touch with his military friends who were assigned elsewhere, a circle that would reveal its greatest usefulness in the accession of Atat&uuml;rk to the highest post of Modern Turkey two decades later.  Because of his subversive political activities, Atat&uuml;rk was assigned not to Europe but to the Near East after finishing his studies in 1904.  Mango does a great job in giving background information, which helps readers understand the environment in which Atat&uuml;rk was bound to as a soldier while he actively remained involved in politics through his connections in the empire before, during and after WWI.  In 1908, the Society of Union and Progress, of which Atat&uuml;rk became a member, served as the launching path for the Young Turks in their successful military coup.  Atat&uuml;rk understood very fast that the Young Turks, even with the help of Germany later on, were not up to the task to save the empire from its ultimate downfall after the end of WWI.  Atat&uuml;rk was still too junior to play a key role in the new administration.  As usual, Atat&uuml;rk was critical of the new ones on top because he alone deserved to be leader.<br />From 1911, Atat&uuml;rk, still an obscure officer, progressively rose to preeminence.  Atat&uuml;rk first tried to quell rebellions in the disintegrating empire before WWI.  Atat&uuml;rk then illustrated his military superiority when he decisively helped ruin the allied venture at Gallipoli in 1915.  After a new promotion in 1916, Atat&uuml;rk, very resentful of the Germans for continuously meddling into military operations from the beginning, spent two agitated years in the Near East where he did what he could to slow down the advance of the allies until the end of WWI.  Officers who ultimately played a key role in the War of Independence were placed under his command during these two years.  After the armistice in 1918, Atat&uuml;rk proved to be the most effective of all Ottoman officers who refused the diktats of the victorious allies and thwarted their efforts to carve up the territory of Modern Turkey into pieces.  Mango clearly explained how with the help of other nationalist officers, Atat&uuml;rk turned Anatolia into a redoubt of resistance while accommodating the decadent rule of the sultan in the short term.  Atat&uuml;rk also progressively centralized all military and political levers of power in his hands through shrewd maneuvering.  Mango is brutally honest about the enlightened despotism of Atat&uuml;rk.  Modern Turkey needed a strong regime to impose its legitimacy both internally and externally.<br />It took Atat&uuml;rk and his army several grueling years before they couldfinally defeat the Greeks militarily and thereby commanding the grudging respect of the remaining divided allies.  The signature of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 was a personal triumph for Atat&uuml;rk by making the humiliating Treaty of Sevres of 1920 associated with the discredited old regime almost totally obsolete.  As George Curzon, a British imperial statesman, noted at the end of the conference: \\"Hitherto we have dictated our peace treaties.  Now we are negotiating one with an enemy who has an army while we have none, an unheard of position.\\" The Treaty of Lausanne, still in existence, has been the most successful and the most lasting of all the post-war treaties.  Atat&uuml;rk was 42 years old when he became the first president of Modern Turkey.  He assumed this position until his premature death in 1938.  Mango never bores his audience when he overviews the successful and not-so-successful revolutionary reforms that Atat&uuml;rk enacted during the successive terms of his presidency.  Unsurprisingly, Modern Turks still revere Atat&uuml;rk for westernizing and modernizing at high speed their country at its creation in 1923.<br />In present times, the adhesion of Turkey and United Cyprus to the European Union should be a fitting tribute to western-bound Kemalism.  In addition, this adhesion should help engineer a historic reconciliation between Greece and Turkey, two key U.S. allies.  On top of that, Turkey is called to play a key role as a bridge between the European Union and a would-be Islamic Union.

Possibly frustrating some readers, Margaret MacMillan rightly chose a thematic approach to the issues that the Big Three had to address during the Conference of Paris.  MacMillan does a good job making the necessary connections between the chapters so that readers do not lose sight of the big picture.  Each theme is so complex that it could be the subject of a book on its own.  Paris 1919 can entice readers to know more about this period.<br />MacMillan clearly shows the disconnect between a peace conference and happenings in the field.  Despite the best intentions of the U.S., Britain and France, these countries were often inconsistent in the application of some key principles such as auto-determination and territory swaps, in their desire to reward the victors and punish the losers.  Furthermore, the U.S., Britain and France tended to focus on short-term gains without considering long-term implications.  Whoever needs convincing on this point can think about Palestine, Iraq, former Yugoslavia and Hungary, to name a few.<br />Paradoxically, the Treaty of Lausanne that almost complelety wiped out the punitive Sevres Treaty (one of the aftermaths of the Conference of Paris) towards Modern Turkey has been the most successful and the most lasting of all the post-war treaties.  Modern Turkey, one of the defeated nations at the end of WWI, successfully rebelled against the respective diktats of the victorious nations and humbled them one by one first on the battlefields and then in the diplomatic arenas.  As George Curzon, a British imperial statesman, noted at the end of the conference in Lausanne: Hitherto we have dictated our peace treaties.  Now we are negotiating one with an enemy who has an army while we have none, an unheard of position.<br />Iraq is a current example of how difficult making peace can be compared to winning war.  Fair elections, though possibly subpar if organized in the short term, could promote peace in Iraq.  These elections could send a strong signal to Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds alike.  To the Shiites by making clear that the unjust, past rule of the Sunni minority is over.  Elections would help convince the Sunnis and Kurds that in a federal structure they will be their own masters in a wide range of matters.  Of course, each community will have to guarantee the basic rights of minorities in their respective entities.  The Coalition and Iraqis should find some very useful inspiration in the Belgian Constitution and its implementation laws.  The Flemish-speaking majority has coexisted peacefully with the French and German-speaking minorities for many years in a federalist structure while deciding on its own destiny in a wide range of matters that do not interfere with the viability of the Belgian federation.  Similarly, the French and German-speaking minorities can preside over their respective future in the same matters without endangering the existence of the Belgian federal state.example of how difficult making peace can be compared to winning war.

Thomas was, after all, a multi-media professional.  Thomas sometimes took liberty with his subject such as how he recalled his first meeting with Lawrence (pg. 1).  At other times, Thomas indulged in histrionics (for example when he grew emphatic about the most brilliant and spectacular military operation in the world's history) (pg. 179).<br />Despite these shortcomings, \\"With Lawrence in Arabia\\" has the merit and talent to make a complex man accessible to the great majority of people.  \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\" by Lawrence himself, though a literary masterpiece, is not an easy read compared to Thomas's recollection of Lawrence's exploits.  Furthermore, Thomas has defended himself with conviction when he reminds in his foreword that he has not created the myth of Lawrence of Arabia (xiv).  Lord Beaverbrook put it nicely when he commented on vain attempts to smear Lawrence's reputation: Every great man is subject to vicious, venomous attack.  There are no exceptions.  The one who will suffer will be the author (xviii).  Lawrence had admirers such as Winston Churchill, Field Marshal Viscount Allenby and Viceroy and Viscount Halifax, to name a few, who knew Lawrence's strengths and weaknesses from personal experience.  Most Lawrence's detractors did not know him at this level.<br />Most importantly, \\"With Lawrence in Arabia\\" gives contemporary readers valuable insights into the Middle East.  The last chapters are probably the most fascinating and also the most actual of all.  Thomas recalled how Lawrence helped his old friend, King Feisal, become king of Iraq after being kicked out of Syria by the French.  Media-savvy, Lawrence convinced the British Empire to come to the realization that the occupation of Iraq was a burden both to the Imperial Exchequer and Mesopotamia (pg. 230-234).  The Coalition in Iraq knows it very well and is working on a transition plan to help Iraqis regain their sovereignty.  Probably elections will be held across Iraq in the near future to accommodate the concern of the Shiite community.<br />After these elections, the mandated framers of the new Iraqi Constitution could proceed as follows:<br />I. On Iraqis and their rights<br />The U.S. Bill of Rights could serve as a source of inspiration to govern the relationships between Iraqi citizens and the state.  However, the wording of some constitutional amendments should be slightly amended to be fully understandable to a 21st century audience.  Although the predominantly Islamic character of Iraq could be stressed in the Fundamental Law as a concession to the Muslim clergy, the separation of religious institutions and state should be made very clear to preserve the rights of religious minorities.  Finally, the incorporation of economic, social and cultural rights and their corresponding obligations into the Fundamental Law could be considered as well.<br />II. On Power<br />Separation of powers and checks and balances should define the legislative, executive and judiciary powers and their respective competences.  The Constitution should also promulgate that the Iraqi federal authority only has power in the matters that are formally attributed to it by the Fundamental Law and the laws carried in pursuance of the Constitution itself.  Finally, the Iraqi presidency could be modeled after the provisions of the German Fundamental Law because of the recent dictatorial past of the country.<br />III. On Federal Iraq, its components and its territory<br />The Belgian Constitution could serve as a useful model to regulate the relationships between the center and the regions as well as between regions in Iraq.  Unlike other regions such as former Yugoslavia, Rwanda or Northern Ireland, to name a few, Belgium, sometimes branded as an \\"artificial state,\\" has been very good at making possible for different communities to live at peacewith one another for many years.  The \\"Belgian compromise\\" could work wonders in a country under stress of centrifugal forces.<br />IV. Energy-revenue management<br />Because easy money encourages corruption in most energy-producing countries, Iraq should set up a fund after the example of Norway.  Part of the money should be reinvested to modernize the aged Iraqi infrastructure; part of these funds should be redistributed directly to Iraqi citizens based on census data to strongly discourage manipulation of the fund.<br />As Lawrence himself put it, \\"whether the (Iraqis) are fit for independence or not remains to be tried.  Merit is no qualification for freedom.  Freedom is enjoyed when you are so well armed, or so turbulent, or inhabit a country so thorny that the expense ... is greater than the profit (pg. 234).\\"  Light at the end of the tunnel, hopefully, is in sight for Iraqis to rebuild their country with success after decades wasted by a variety of ineffectual dictators.e with one another for many years.

Bamford, Benjamin Gomes-Casseres and Michael J. Robinson have put together an interesting collection of essays about the life cycle of alliances and the people in charge of these alliances.  Rightly, the authors emphasize alliance strategy rather than strategic alliance.  The essays are grouped around four themes: designing alliances, managing alliances, competing in constellations and building an alliance capability.  Practitioners can reflect on their own alliances to see what they eventually can do better to further improve their performance in each of the four areas.  The authors close their treatise by looking at some master builders.  The authors correctly point out that there is no one solution for all.  What works in one company can fail in another.  Corporate culture plays a key role in making difficult to successfully borrow alliance best practices from other companies for another organization usage.  As a side note, \\"Building, Leading and Managing Strategic Alliances\\" by Fred A. Kuglin is a good complement to the topics covered in \\"Mastering Alliance Strategy.\\"	2003-11-30

Humes gives his audience an excellent opportunity to conjure up a mental picture of Winston Churchill and his legacy.  As a renaissance man, Churchill was more than a skilled politician and a gifted soldier.  Perhaps more importantly, Churchill was a man of inspired words, whose work was ultimately crown by the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953.  Churchill often was far from politically correct and did not hesitate to say, write and do what he thought was right.  Churchill's bluntness did not make him dear to everybody.<br />Humes first brings to light many of the great thoughts of Churchill in \\"Observations and Opinions.\\" Humes classifies key words alphabetically without giving context so that readers can easily find a quote of their liking about a specific subject.  Some readers might get frustrated about it if they are not familiar with the key milestones in the life and career of Churchill.  These readers can read books such as \\"Churchill a Life\\", \\"Churchill a Study in Greatness\\", \\"Clementine Churchill The Biography of a Marriage\\" or \\"Winston and Clementine The Personal Letters of the Churchills\\" to fill in the gaps in their knowledge of Churchill for that purpose.<br />Humes forges ahead in a similar way in \\"Orations and Perorations\\", \\"Coiners of Phrases\\", \\"Saints and Sinners\\" and \\"Escapades and Encounters.\\"  In these sections, Humes is usually very good at giving his audience the context so that readers better understand where Churchill was coming from.  Hours of fun and laughter are virtually guaranteed, especially in \\"Escapades and Encounters.\\"<br />Churchill's witticism, wisdom and oratory probably reached their climax in the faithful summer of 1940 when Britain stood alone against the Nazi monster.  Churchill galvanized by his words and actions the civilized world to soldier on when the horizon seemed hopelessly bleak.  As President Franklin Roosevelt said to his aide Harry Hopkins after listening to one of Churchill's radio broadcasts during that period: \\"As long as that old bastard is in charge, Britain will never surrender.\\"  The words of Churchill will continue to resonate for a long time in the heart and soul of humanity.  Churchill's words will further shine like diamonds in the night when humanity loses hope from time to time.oadcasts during that period: \\"As long as that old bastard is in charge, Britain will never surrender.\\"   The words of Churchill will continue to resonate for a long time in the heart and soul of humanity.

Heidi Collins rightly reminds her audience that the enterprise portal should be designed around and be implementing the organization's knowledge management strategy.  The enterprise portal is key to manage and communicate knowledge within an organization and to eventually share part of it with strategic external constituencies.  Collins briefly describes the existing four portal categories: enterprise information portals, e-business and e-commerce portals, mobile commerce portals and Internet portals.  Over time, a portal could metamorphose itself into a hybrid creature that offers the functionality of different portal categories to meet the needs of multiple constituencies.<br />Enterprise portal is gaining increasing acceptance because there is great value in having a single repository for all the information knowledge workers need to do their job.  Knowledge workers should not waste their precious time locating information or answering questions again and again that could be addressed on the enterprise portal.  In the process, innovation could get a definitive boost by facilitating both internal and external collaboration.  Enterprise portal strategy should not be separated from alliance strategy for that reason.<br />A portal reporting team made up of cross-functional members from diverse business functions should be identified to get widespread buy-in.  The portal reporting team could meet resistance or deal with skepticism from entrenched interests that are happy with the status quo.  An executive sponsor is key to deal with these eventual obstacles effectively.  A budget roadmap should also be defined to keep track of costs associated with the project and facilitate ROI calculation.<br />Portal components should be defined and organized around work processes and then prioritized.  Data and/or applications needed to support portal components should be determined and documented.  Data should be scrubbed, mapped and validated to guarantee credibility.  Security and confidentiality should not be overlooked in the process.<br />When the portal is ready to be launched, one individual or a dedicated team should be identified as the single contact responsible for managing the portal and keeping its content fresh and relevant to the target audience.  Before making the portal widely accessible, a portal pilot is advisable.  Usage should be tracked.  Furthermore, the pilot audience should be surveyed on a regular basis to foster acceptance, document key learnings and tweak the portal wherever necessary.<br />The portal management should keep in mind that the portal is a collective effort that requires buy-in from multiple constituencies to avoid stall content.  Roles and responsibilities should be clearly delineated to insure accountability on that point.  Ultimately, a portal is dynamic because its objectives are associated with corporate strategy and vision.<br />As portal project manager and administrator in addition to my marketing roles and responsibilities in a large company, I have only one regret about Enterprise Knowledge Portals.

Lawrence narrates with passion and in his peculiar style the years he spent in the Middle East, first as archeologist before WWI then as \\"free agent\\" of the British government in its fight against Turkey and Germany during WWI.  Lawrence knew from the beginning of the Arab campaign that he was a \\"fraud\\" because of the duplicity of the French and British.  Lawrence rightly perceived that if the Arabs won the war against Turkey and its German ally, the powerbrokers of that time would steal from the Arabs the fruit of their victory.  Promises of self-government afterwards would be dead paper.  After the end of the hostilities, Lawrence skillfully advised King Feisal and his delegation to get as many of the spoils of war as possible from the victors at the Conference of Paris.  After the conference, the French could largely be blamed for undermining the regime of King Feisal in Damascus and pushing him to ultimately leave for Baghdad.  The contemporary Middle East could have been very different from what it is now.  History has the annoying habit of repeating itself over time because of the widely shared inability of mankind to learn from past mistakes.<br />Despite Lawrence's disclaimer in his introduction, his \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom A Triumph\\" offers valuable lessons to a contemporary audience to better understand the enduring complexity of the Middle East.  Whoever has had the chance to journey through the Middle East can vividly remember at least some locations that Lawrence describes.  The Middle East is one of the cradles of the Western civilization.  Its cultural heritage is almost unmatched.  The ancient law of hospitality is not an urban legend, but remains a reality of which Semitic people can be proud.  Lawrence understood very well that condescending attitude towards Semitic people could only backfire.  Treating its inhabitants with respect and understanding earned him their enduring trust.  For those who have not had the opportunity to crisscross the region, Lawrence's narration provides a rare opportunity to gain valuable insights into the minds of Semitic nations.  For example:<br />Lawrence observed that Semitic people were not inclined to compromise, pursing the logic of their respective incompatible opinions to absurd ends, without perceiving the incongruity (pg. 38).  Does it not sound familiar for example in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict today?<br /><br />British forces won battle after battle against the Turks in Iraq until they reached Ctesiphon, where they met pugnacious enemy troops, and were abruptly checked.  They fell back, dazed.  Until the end of WWI, the British in Iraq remained an occupying force, with the local people passively neutral or sullenly against them (pg. 59-60, 636).  Does that assessment not sound similar to the experience of the Coalition forces in Iraq today?  Working tirelessly by both indirect influence and education rather than by forceful direction is key to avoid becoming or remaining a target practice.<br />Extreme patience was another lesson to Lawrence of what native leadership meant (pg. 122).  Lawrence felt that Semitic people were looking for a stranger to lead them, one whose supremacy should be based on an idea: illogical, undeniable: which instinct might accept and reason find no rational basis to reject or approve (pg. 234).  Would this not ring true to the ears of the architects of the road map to peace?  External will power exercised on all sides with the same strength is necessary to get out of the current impasse in the Middle Eastern peace process.<br />The dream of both Lawrence and King Feisal is not dead.  One day, the Middle East will be united in an Islamic Economic Community, precursor of an Islamic Union that has Islam, democracy and economic liberalism as its three founding pillars.  There is no need for an old-fashioned caliphate.  The capital of the future Islamic Economic Community could be, for example, in Amman or Dubai to avoid unhealthy rivalries between the larger and more powerful Semitic nations.  Israel and the would-be Islamic Economic Community could be linked peacefully after the relationship existing between the European Union and The European Free Trade Association.lries between the larger and more powerful Semitic nations.

Davis courageously offers unvarnished, uncomfortable and, at time, disturbing coverage of Islamic terrorism and its underlying factors (pg. 9).  Davis helps her American audience better understand Islamic militants and their rationale in order to develop policies that could lead to the militants ultimate defeat (pg. 22).<br />Terrorism finds a favorable breeding ground in the swamps of cultural deprivation, misery and hopelessness (pg. 26).  The rampant human suffering in the Middle East can turn some Muslims into economically, emotionally, and/or spiritually vulnerable targets for terrorist headhunters (16, 104, 119, 131-133, 152-154).  Many moderate Muslim scholars consider that suicide bombers who kill and maim the innocent are not justified according to the Quran (pg. 5, 20, 94, 110-111, 141, 202).  The concepts of terrorism and martyrdom are not exclusive to Islam and the Middle East (pg. 23-24, 192).<br />At the same time, however, there is widespread understanding of suicide bombers and their actions among many moderate Muslim leaders and citizens across classes in the Middle East (pg. 10, 182, 194, 202).  Many Muslims think that the U.S. is to be blamed for blindly supporting Israel and having double standards at their expense.  The U.S., they argue, garners international support against Islamic countries like Iraq and Iran at the U.N. while conveniently ignoring U.N. resolutions against Israel (pg. 36-37, 109, 122, 143, 159).  Furthermore, many Muslims criticize the U.S for propping up their undemocratic, unaccountable governments both financially and militarily (pg. 5, 12, 90, 165, 169, 192-193).  The regimes in control have marginalized their secular opponents and have been unable to eliminate the religious-based opposition groups or the underground militants (pg. 11-12, 165-166, 170).<br />Although Islamic militants are not closer to their goals than they were at the birth of Israel in May 1948, they still cling to the hope that they can achieve them militarily (pg. 14, 43-44, 148).  Islamic militants want to make clear to every settler that they have no future in Palestinian territories (pg. 102, 157).  Islamic militants remind that Israelis unilaterally withdrew from the South of Lebanon under repetitive attacks by Hezbollah (pg. 70-71, 157).  Similarly, the Israeli government is convinced that diplomacy and negotiations lead almost nowhere, and that the military option is the only one to deliver results (pg. 167, 171-172).  Some analysts underline that Prime Minister Ariel Sharons tactics have not stopped the violence against Israelis and are actually encouraging terrorism (pg. 167-171).<br />The security fence, also called wall, that Israel is building along or close to the green line is an implicit recognition that the military option alone and Jewish settlements policy in the West Bank and Gaza are to a large extent sub-optimal (pg. 168-169, 172).  Many critics say a wall will not keep terrorists out of Israel totally (pg. 172).  One knows from personal experience gained over thirteen years ago that walls do not protect against a terrorist attack.  Furthermore, the fence could lead some Israelis to grow complacent about their own security as most French did about their Maginot Line before the launch of the blitzkrieg in the West in May 1940.  A surprise suicide WMD attack in Israel that some terrorists are rumored to plot could drive the point home very hard (pg. 160).  Furthermore, Iran could one day become a nuclear power and step up the pressure on Israel to pull out of the occupied territories (pg. 61-62, 64).  Hopefully, a nuclear Verdun will not be necessary before a just peace can be achieved.<br />Terrorism cannot be eradicated without also draining the swamps that feed it (pg. 26).  The road map for peace in the Middle East should aim at:<br />1.  Gradual transformation of monarchies and one-party States in the region into respectively constitutional monarchies and Western democracies to avoid chaos (pg. 118).  The U.S. should continue to prod these regimes into action to go beyond current democratic cosmetic changes to significantly expand the legitimacy of their authority (pg. 182-184).  Fighting the Coalition in Iraq will slow down the advent of a more representative Islamic society.  For all their flaws, Turkey and Israel are currently the only working democracies in the region.<br />2.  Metamorphosis of the Gulf Cooperation Council into an Islamic Economic Community, precursor of an Islamic Economic Union, that has Islam, democracy and liberalism as its three founding pillars.  The IMF and World Bank could give the region financial assistance to smooth the transition from a mainly bankrupt socialist economy into a working market economy.  Otherwise, the peace dividend will remain illusory in the Middle East (pg. 12, 185).<br />3.  Unconditional recognition of a viable Palestinian State that encompasses the West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem as its capital (pg. 66).  Territory swaps and/or compensation could be considered on a case-by-case basis to deal with the issue of Jewish settlements in occupied territories.  No responsible Muslim leader will ever recognize a Palestinian state without sovereignty on Haram al Sharif (pg. 65-66, 99-100, 149).  Israelis should get superimposed sovereignty on the underlying remains of Solomons Temple for a similar reason (pg. 149).  The acknowledged but not exercised right of former Palestinian owners to return should be compensated financially (pg. 149).<br />4.  Unconditional recognition of the existence of the State of Israel.  Islamic extremists feed only the anxiety of Israelis to be driven into the sea (pg. 22).  There cannot be a Munich Agreement at the expense of Israel for the sake of making peace with Islamic countries.  Jews do not forget how their ancestors were persecuted and slaughtered by millions under the widely indifferent eye of the international community in the previous centuries.<br />5.

By the time children reach adulthood, they have watched over a thousand violent deaths on television, yet they have no concept of what is involved in the dying process (pg. 94).  No surprise, death education is ignored and has replaced sex as the forbidden topic (pg. 76).  Most doctors are not emotionally much better equipped than laymen to cope with the angst of death (pg. 15, 53).  As patients near death, their doctors spend less time at their bedsides (pg. 52, 68).  Doctors like to think that they are in control (pg. 68).  They regard death as a sign of personal failure (pg. 15).<br />More than a century ago, most people died at home in the presence of a multigenerational family and loved ones (pg. 97).  Society has replaced that traditional deathbed scene with the loving lie, in which the involved actors are invited to deny the reality of the situation (pg. 60, 77-79, 86).  Today, most people die alone in hospitals (pg. 56, 97).  They are more likely to be surrounded and sustained by machines than by their family and friends.  People eventually do not have access to a priest, minister or physician (pg. 79).  They are heavily sedated, resuscitated and medicated until even the most pugnacious doctors have enough, and the body is permitted to die (pg. 55-56, 63, 75-76).  The physician's dilemma is where to draw the line (pg. 55).<br />When patients experience pre-death visions, doctors often repress them with medication and then flee to the comfort of their other, less sick patients (pg. 63).  Patients are convinced that they have had bad dreams (pg. 93).  Children intuitively feel that if they ask questions about death, people will visit them less (pg. 79).  The nursing staff, however, tends to have a different response, probably because they spend more time talking and listening to patients than brusque and hurried doctors usually do (pg. 17, 93).  Pre-death visions contain a message of hope for the patient and his family and the discussion of these visions can significantly facilitate the healing process for the living (pg. 63, 65, 73-74).<br />Unsurprisingly, most doctors consider near death experiences (NDE) a freak hallucination that can be dismissed as \\"supernatural\\" or be put in the same category as UFO sightings (pg. 15, 16).  Their reasoning is: If you do not understand NDE, you cannot explain it (pg. 56).  These doctors prefer to ignore it (pg. 85).  Paradoxically, many researchers in the medical profession feel, deep down in their hearts, that there is a soul (pg. 111).  The mentally sound children that Melvin Morse, a respected pediatrician, interviewed at his initiative had most often not told their parents about their NDEs.  And none told doctors or nurse unless it slipped out while they were semiconscious (pg. 25, 47, 157).  When children shared their NDE with adults, they were sometimes ridiculed or referred to a psychiatrist or diagnosed as temporarily insane (pg. 37, 156, 182).  To NDErs, that attitude is not surprising due to a widespread ignorance of death.<br />Morse systematically demonstrates with brilliance that NDEs cannot be denied.  NDErs should not be upset that Morse uses science to better understand NDEs.  NDE doubters are dealing with an increasing body of scientific evidences in favor of its existence (pg. 9, 101, 202-203).<br /><br />Morse first debunks the claim that NDEs are hallucinations that result from a variety of drugs, psychological phenomena, or physiological stress (pg. 116-117, 170-171, 214-226).  Morse successively looks at LSD, morphine, heroin, \\"recreational\\" drugs, anesthetic agents, ketamine, transient depersonalization, memories of birth, autoscopic hallucinations, endorphins and hypoxia.  Morse then explains that the sylvian fissure, an area close to the right ear, when electrically simulated, produces the out-of-body experience that about 25% of NDErs he has studied, experienced during their NDE in childhood (pg. 116, 118-119).<br />Neuroscience has not been able to account for the Light, the key element of the NDE, that nearly every near-death experience of children has (pg. 117, 131-132, 152-153).  As the brain starts its dying process, there is a collapse of the visual fields and tunnel vision results (pg. 134).  Furthermore, if the Light were simply a spasm of rigor mortis in the optic nerve, patients would simply say that they saw a blinding bright light (pg. 153, 154).  The Light gives these children an unmatched sense of peace, love and understanding (pg. 129, 153, 197).<br />Strikingly, NDErs are fairly casual, and the actual telling about their NDE is very brief. Furthermore, NDErs do not change or embellish the story after years of retelling the event (pg. 188-189).  The major difference between almost all adult and young NDErs is logically the lack of a life review because they do not yet have much of a life (pg. 34, 161-162, 164).  The Light is almost always one that encourages knowledge.  NDErs believe that the Light has given them the power to transform their life and that of the people around them (pg. 190-191).  Furthermore, NDErs do not carry the burden of fear with them that many people have about death (pg. 170, 179).  They know that life is precious and must be fulfilling (pg. 179).<br />The Light, however, is nothing new.  The Light fuels religious awe and has the power to transform (pg. 144).  It has been well documented over time and across culture (pg. 86-92, 191).  The Bible itself contains many references that support the existence of the Light.  For example, in the New Testament (2 Cor. 12:1-4), Paul describes the NDE that he had (pg. 9).  The source of this Light may forever remain a mystery (pg. 130).<br /><br />PS.

US	49342515	R1WOLSQIP55VWZ	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Justice Rendered to Under-estimated Overachiever	David McCullough masterfully extracts John Adams from the oblivion into which he has sunk.  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, towering figures of the American Revolution, tend to overshadow John Adams.  For that reason, some people are inclined to downplay Adams's key contribution to the birth of the United States of America and its nascent development.  McCullough follows Adams from his beginnings in Massachusetts to his move to Philadelphia where he quickly took a leading role in the War of Independence against Britain in 1776.  Adams, persuasive, hardworking, obstinate and upright, was uncompromising about the need to cut all ties with Britain.  In Congress, Adams was the most forward thinking about the risks and opportunities that independence entailed.  Abigail, his witty and faithful wife and confidant, was as strong-minded and politically savvy as Adams was.  Abigail supported him in his endeavors here and abroad to advance the cause of independence, despite her personal hardship and long absences from her beloved one.  McCullough describes with much verve the peregrinations of Adams through Europe to secure money and military support for defeating Albion.  Overseas, Adams tirelessly and efficiently worked on the promotion of the American Revolution, often without much guidance from the home front.  Benjamin Franklin and John Jay were the other key actors who were involved in that foreign enterprise that ultimately culminated in the Paris Peace Treaty in 1783.  After the recognition of the American Independence, Adams served primarily in Paris and London, and occasionally in Amsterdam.  Franklin and Jefferson served in France.  To his credit, McCullough systematically brings to life the tumultuous, complex relationship between Adams and Jefferson over a period of more than fifty years through a judicious use of their correspondence.  Readers clearly understand how different and similar both men were.  Like Adams, Jefferson was a \\"true blue\\" patriot and family man and could not live without books.  Unlike Adams, Jefferson was socially sophisticated and was often not practicing what he was preaching: e.g., slavery, economy, and party politics.  McCullough then narrates the two-term vice presidency that Adams assumed under the leadership of President Washington first in New York and then in Philadelphia after his return from Europe in 1788.  Adams rightfully found his new, ceremonial position too passive after being in the crux of action for more than a decade.  During Adams's second mandate, John Quincy, his favorite son, was nominated minister to the Netherlands where Adams had booked his first success abroad.  Quincy, who was not yet thirty years old, was more widely traveled and more fluent in both French and Dutch than any American diplomat yet sent to Europe.  McCullough then draws the attention of his audience to show how tight the contest between Adams and Jefferson was for the presidency after Washington's withdrawal.  Adams narrowly defeated Jefferson in the Electoral College and became the second President of the nation in 1797.  Adams became the first President to serve in Washington after starting his presidency in Philadelphia.  Jefferson was elected his Vice President and reduced to a ceremonial role that he did not enjoy at all.  However, Jefferson, a skilled political operator, was systematically undermining Adams by playing party politics behind the scenes.  Furthermore, most of Adams's closest advisors, whom he inherited from the previous Washington administration and kept too long against his better judgment, were plotting against him.  Adams's greatest achievement during his presidency was neutralizing bellicose Alexander Hamilton and avoiding war with both Revolutionary France and Spain in 1800, despite domestic pressure to the contrary and warmongering attitude of his former French ally.  On the home front, Adams had the vision to nominate John Marshall, probably the greatest Chief Justice thatthe country has ever had.  The low point of Adams's presidency was his signature of the unconstitutional Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 whose inspiration was a rampant fear of an internal \\"fifth column.\\"  Adams got tired of party politics, above which he stayed during his elected mandate.  Adams did not bother to vigorously deny the calumny of treacherous Hamilton and fight full-strength against intriguer Jefferson during the next presidential election.  Adams was duly defeated.  Shortly after his victory, Jefferson stopped any epistolary exchange with Adams for eleven years.  In 1801, Quincy came back with his family to the country after a successful diplomatic career in Europe.  Quincy quickly entered politics and successfully followed in the footsteps of Adams.  Benjamin Rush, common friend of Adams and Jefferson, helped smooth their strained relationship after convincing Adams to restart a rich correspondence with Jefferson in 1812.  Besides writing letters to his friends, Adams read, wrote his autobiography and enjoyed the family life on his ancestral grounds for the rest of his life.  Abigail preceded him in death in 1818.  Quincy, on his turn, became President in 1824 after a brilliant diplomatic and political career here and in Europe.  Adams finally died on July 4, 1826, a few hours after Jefferson succumbed on the same day.  By 2016, the nation will hopefully be mature enough to elect a woman as exceptional as Abigail - likely first to the vice presidency and then to the presidency of the United States of America.  It is now up to the Republican and Democrat parties to show vision once again and remain truthful to both the letter and spirit of our Declaration of Independence that promotes among other things equality between men and women.t the country has ever had.

Quinlan first reminds her audience of the importance of listening in marketing, especially when one keeps in mind that women influence the purchase of or buy 85% of all products and services.  Some marketers have preconceived ideas about marketing to women at their own peril as Quinlan successfully shows through her punchy listening checkup.  Quinlan then goes on to stress the otherness or focus on the others that many women display.  Women are often their worst enemy because they feel that they need to be superwomen: i.e., a perfect woman, hybrid being, unique crossbreed of \\"executive woman\\", \\"supercharged mother\\" and \\"femme fatale\\": perfect in all respects to quote Mich&egrave;le Fitoussi in her entertaining \\"Le ras-le-bol des super-women (superwomen's dissatisfaction).&quot;  Marketing stress-reducing, life-simplifying products and services that internalize women's wants and needs then makes perfect sense.  Marketers can also take a leaf out of \\"Simplicity Marketing\\" by Steven M. Cristol and Peter Sealey for these purposes.  Furthermore, Quinlan demonstrates that women, who rely on multiple sources of information, are both procedural and disciplined in their decision-making process.  Women more regularly take a more holistic view of the researching/shopping experience than men who tend to compartmentalize their attention.  Quinlan also draws the attention of her readers about the importance of how women are portrayed in advertising and communications programs.  The perceived image of women that a brand carries, consciously or unconsciously, influences women's inner and outer beauty dialogue.  In addition, Quinlan addresses the interaction between women and technology and its pitfalls.  Quinlan then proceeds to look at the disrespect that some marketers show towards women due to their lack of listening skills.  Women often put themselves last in line.  However, they also crave for being taken care of.  Quinlan explains to her audience how smart marketers are responsive to women's wants and needs in terms of self-comfort and restoration.  Finally, Quinlan assists marketers in developing a listening action plan to better meet women's desires.  As a side-note, readers can find some very useful information about marketing to women in the references that Quinlan mentions in her notes.ains to her audience how smart marketers are responsive to women's wants and needs in terms of self-comfort and restoration.

Roosevelt, who leveraged President Monroe's doctrine, turned the United States of America into a superpower on the global scene.  The other great powers of that time duly took note of Roosevelt's expeditions in the Americas and Asia and his key role in bringing the Russo-Japanese war to an end.  On the domestic front, Roosevelt has left an enduring legacy as his contributions to the development of national parks, anti-trust legislation ... and the Teddy Bear have revealed.  Roosevelt progressively liberated himself from the influence of the Republican Party by pursuing an increasingly progressive legislative agenda to the discontent of some fellow Republicans.  To the chagrin of some readers, Morris does not spend too much time discussing Theodore's beloved Edith, their children and the rest of his family.	2003-04-26

Covey has developed a compelling argumentation and methodology about the relevancy of knowing oneself before knowing others.  Covey's treatise on the human condition reflects the perennial Greek philosophy that has been articulated around three sequential concepts: ethos, pathos and logos.  Ethos is one's character built on integrity and competency.  Pathos is all about one's emotion-driven relationship with the outside world.  Logos is the logic side of one's relationship with the surrounding environment.  One cannot achieve success, a relative concept in the eyes of his/her beholder and his/her fellow humans, without first adopting an inside-out approach that is based on the best possible understood balance between mind and body.  That balance that one projects into his/her interaction with the outside world influences the perception of others and bounces back to him/her.  To his credit, Covey gives a seven-step methodology that allows the able and willing to eventually change without prescribing an illusory one fit for all as an answer to arising challenges and opportunities.	2003-04-26

Wreden then debunks such die-hard branding myths as awareness equal to branding, overrated first-mover advantage, overestimated impact of the Internet on human behavior and business fundamentals, and disproportional relevancy of pricing to branding.  Wreden clearly demonstrates through his book that a brand is all about creating a set of positive expectations that generate trust, commitment, loyalty, respect, and satisfaction based on the ability to deliver constantly what is promised to the target audience.  Wreden concisely explores the evolution of branding through the ages of the Mass Economy, Customer Economy, and Demand Economy.  To his credit, Wreden not only emphasizes customer equity (lifetime value of customer) and accountability, but also operational excellence.  What is indeed the value of a brand if operations cannot deliver what marketing and sales promise?  To summarize, FusionBranding brings a breeze of fresh air into branding that keeps its paramount importance in convincing the target audience to take a ride and hopefully make a journey together until death separates them.	2003-04-26

Everitt regularly quotes Cicero's correspondence to his friend Atticus and other works to give more relief to his troublesome hero without boring his audience.  Cicero's writ, writing and oratory skills and boastfulness made him many enemies by defending his clients in the Forum and by serving the Republic against the repetitive assaults of tyrants like Caesar, Catalina and Clodius.  Until his assassination in his sixties, Cicero made several successful comebacks from total irrelevance.  Unlike men like Caesar and Octavian, Cicero sincerely believed almost to the end of his life that the Republic could be saved without reforming it thoroughly within the limits of the Constitution.  To his credit, Cicero was not only a brilliant orator and political operator, but also a man of letters.  Cicero's speeches and philosophical writings have gained him a deserved place in the Pantheon of human civilization.  Persecuted people around the world can still find in Cicero a source of inspiration to oppose tyrannical forces, which are doomed to be overthrown sooner or later.	2003-03-25

Brands masterfully breathes life into a complex, self-made Renaissance man who clearly deserves much more than the anecdotal remembrance that unfortunately stills exists today.  Benjamin Franklin, though as imperfect as any human being, progressively spanned his wings to give full measure to his genius.  Not only was Franklin an astute businessman and gifted writer but also an able statesman and brilliant scientist.  Despite his evident flaws as a family man, Franklin was perhaps and foremost a humanist whose quest for knowledge and progress could not be satiated.  Readers can only marvel at Franklin's inquisitive mind that could sometimes propel him so far ahead of his time as had done Leonard De Vinci's mind during his lifetime.  Franklin was often wise enough to defer to others when he felt that he was not the best, most apt man.  For these reasons, Franklin needs to be remembered as one of the key founding fathers of the nation.	2003-03-04

Garten concisely reflects on past and present partnerships between governments, businesses and other players to provide business leaders with a roadmap in areas where he perceives their lack of involvement.  Garten rightly fears that 9/11 and corporate scandals can lead to over-regulation that is detrimental to economic liberalism and its underlying benefits.  Some business leaders probably do not have the time and resources to go way beyond their core mission: i.e. focus on the competitiveness and profitability of their companies.  Other business leaders can better optimize existing resources at their disposal within or outside their organizations to keep themselves apprised of these macro issues thoroughly.	2003-01-25

Think, for instance, about the ongoing power struggle between youth and authorities in Iran (pg. 248-249).  The obsession of these elites is nothing new (pg. 21).  These elites regularly use Anti-Americanism as a convenient scapegoat to escape from their responsibilities ... and failures (e.g., pg. 24, 58-59, 91, 114, 129).  Woe be to all who put that scapegoat on the side as Jean-Marie Colombani experienced after writing his memorable article \\"We Are All Americans\\" in the aftermath of 9/11 (pg. 254-255).<br />The two most striking characteristics of anti-Americanism are evidence selection and internal contradiction of the indictment (pg. 26, 241-242, 257).  Some political, cultural and religious elites refuse to contemplate the role that their countries have played in the emergence of the only remaining superpower.  The economic, technological, military and cultural leadership of the United States of America results not only from the drive and creativity of Americans but also from the sum of some failures overseas.  One can think, for instance, about the emergence and fall of the two worst dictatorships on earth, the worldwide bankruptcy of economic socialism, pauperization of one continent and sub-optimal higher education in some places (e.g., pg. 24, 37-42, 45, 58-59, 80-82, 91, 114-115, 129, 200-202, 300).  The USA, however, is not the first civilization that has enjoyed such an indisputable pool position.  Athens, Rome, Italy during the Renaissance, France and the United Kingdom were once the leading powers (pg. 32-33).  One can add to that list Egypt, Mesopotamia or Spain under the Mores, to name a few.  The USA, however, is the first civilization to lead on a worldwide basis what makes some people squealing (pg. 37, 45).  The leadership of one nation has not led to uniformity but to cross-fertilization of competing civilizations (pg. 87, 192).  One is thus far from the (cultural) rolling mill that some people have recently denounced (pg. 198).  At best, everybody but the elites pays for the cultural exception that is only crass and vain protectionism, the lifelong enemy of progress (pg. 185, 189-190, 193-195, 209).<br />Revel gives a number of other examples to demonstrate to his audience that the sermonizers are often pious hypocrites.  Anti-internationalists, who are almost all the primary beneficiaries of globalization, amalgamate the USA with economic liberalism that apparently has nothing good to offer (pg. 271).  President George W. Bush recently observed with much pertinence that anti-internationalists are most often the enemies of the third world (pg. 70).  Developing countries indeed ask for less protectionism and more liberalization to catch up with the first world (pg. 70-71, 135).  Opponents of globalization should also remember what happened between the two world wars when what they are asking for came true: i.e., the 1929 crisis, massive unemployment and rise of the worst dictatorships that humanity has ever known (pg. 41, 80-81).  Furthermore, adversaries of economic liberalism should keep in mind that fear increases quickly when economic growth in the USA stalls.  Almost everybody hopes that the chief bogeyman turns around the situation ASAP (pg. 61, 245).  One can naively hope that in the future anti-internationalists will ask for more globalization on behalf of the poorest countries if they do not want to suffer one day the fate of their predecessors, the Luddites.<br />Furthermore, Revel shows with much efficiency the illogic of the same elites who have criticized the USA for both unilateralism and isolationism.  Furthermore, these elites have been fast to claim credit when things go right and put the blame squarely on the USA in the opposite scenario (pg. 21-22).  Think, for example, aboutAmerican intervention in Europe during and after both world wars (pg. 22), Vietnam (pg. 20-21), call for economic help to \\"arrogant\\" America all the time (pg. 75), tough stance of the Reagan Administration against the Evil Empire (pg. 219, 294-295), America cleaning the European mess in the Balkans (pg. 42-43), American policy towards Iraq (pg. 236-237), North Korea (pg. 232-235) and Palestine (pg. 260-265), 9/11 reward for American unilateralism (pg. 131-134, 240), economic protectionism (pg. 241-245).<br />Revel also clearly demonstrates that some political, cultural and religious elites have tried to blacken the USA, symbol of democratic liberalism, as the exclusive epicenter of a materialistic, unfair, racist, dirty, violent, and fascist society for exempting themselves from any criticism (pg. 30).  Think, for instance, about such myths as money the only driver of the American society (pg. 142, 193), absence of any social security and solidarity (pg. 44-45, 145-146), broken democracy (pg. 45-50), unequal criminality (pg. 149) and America, the unique obstacle to a clean environment (pg. 52-56).  Anyone staying for a while in the remaining superpower, imperfect as any human creation, will realize quickly that the USA shares, mutatis mutandis, challenges such as racism, inequality, violence, pollution, and corporate misbehavior with many other nations.  Most Americans are conscious that their country is not perfect and can always do better as their media regularly point out (pg. 147-151).  However, not many countries can brag about the absence of any dictatorship during their entire history (pg. 45-50) and a working melting pot (pg. 165-179), to name a few.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the USA feels that it is invested with a universal, moral mission to be in the driver seat because of a perceived lack of pertinence and rationality in the rest of the world (pg. 61-62, 82-83, 297, 299-300).  Ignorance and bath faith, unfortunately, are die-hard obstacles to progress against which humanity seems to be doomed to fight forever because of the free will that it ultimately enjoys.<br />PS Hopefully, Jean-François Revel's masterpiece will be available in English soon on Amazon.comut American intervention in Europe during and after both world wars (pg. 22), Vietnam (pg. 20-21), call for economic help to \\"arrogant\\" America all the time (pg. 75), tough stance of the Reagan Administration against the Evil Empire (pg. 219, 294-295), America cleaning the European mess in the Balkans (pg. 42-43), American policy towards Iraq (pg. 236-237), North Korea (pg. 232-235) and Palestine (pg. 260-265), 9/11 reward for American unilateralism (pg. 131-134, 240), economic protectionism (pg. 241-245).<br />Revel also clearly demonstrates that some political, cultural and religious elites have tried to blacken the USA, symbol of democratic liberalism, as the exclusive epicenter of a materialistic, unfair, racist, dirty, violent, and fascist society for exempting themselves from any criticism (pg. 30).

Morris narrates, with much clarity and verve, the metamorphosis of a sick child into a driven man whose life, at times, has sounded like a legend, a myth.  Theodore Roosevelt, successively or concomitantly, was a distinguished ornithologist, historian, state assembly man, lover and husband, rancher, police commissioner, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, soldier, New York's state governor, Vice President ... and finally President to name a few.  The cursus honorum that Theodore Roosevelt followed, gave him plenty of opportunities to show his creativity and drive and prepared him very well to ultimately assume the highest elected office in this country.  To his credit, Morris excels in giving life not only to Theodore Roosevelt, but also to other people who played a role in modeling him against the economic, political and social backdrop of their time.	2002-12-09

MacGregor Burns and Dunn show their audience how these three patricians left behind a relatively easy life to descend into the arena of politics. Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt had to overcome their prejudices about other classes, religions, ethnicities and races to get an understanding of the issues at hand and, at times make, painful compromises to get things done. MacGregor Burns and Dunn explain to their readers that the three Roosevelts have ultimately left an indelible imprint on the psyche of the nation by each setting an example of transformational leadership. On the domestic front, the country has been working on the best possible reconciliation of the respective interests of business, labor and consumers as well as the rights and duties of its respective races and ethnicities. Abroad, the country has weighed the pros and cons of an interventionist policy on a case-by-case basis to safeguard its vital interests, and to advance the cause of a world that espouses the values of responsible democracy and capitalism.	2002-11-26

Miller has made a decisive contribution by explaining to his audience how Abraham Lincoln became who he was by examining his words and deeds from his humble beginning in the Midwest to his ascendancy to the post of Commander-in-Chief in the nation's capital. Miller progressively helps his readers discover or rediscover how Lincoln's intellectual strength, tenacity and self-control developed over time made up the man who eventually became a legend after dying tragically at the apex of his destiny. To his credit, Miller does not turn Lincoln into a Saint. On the contrary, Miller paints a balanced portrait of a man who had to make compromises without losing sight of the big picture while embarking on what would ultimately become the fight of his life. Lincoln, the pragmatist, knew that even most of his allies were not ready to embrace full equality of all men and women born in this nation overnight. Like the builders of Rome, Lincoln needed time to build a case that would convince both foes and friends to become truthful to both the letter and spirit of the Declaration of Independence. Lincoln's premature removal from the national political scenery quickly ushered the nation back in an era of wasted opportunities to advance the cause of an egalitarian, tolerant and multicultural society that reflects the enduring greatness of this country. The legacy of Abraham Lincoln remains today as relevant as it was at his death in 1865. Many men and women still live in political, social and/or economic bondage around the world. Developing responsible democracy and capitalism and then exporting these precious assets to the rest of the world remains in the interest of the United States of America. That endeavor has been one of the most profitable investments that the country has ever done.	2002-10-29

Adenauer, staunch defender of the Catholic faith and strong German patriot, was born in a very modest family a few years after the proclamation of the Second Reich. After serving in the pre-war imperial bureaucracy, Adenauer gradually became the deserving, leading political figure in his native city of Cologne by the end of WWI. Adenauer assumed with cunning ability and efficiency the mayoralty of Cologne under the Weimar Republic before the Nazis obliged him to resign from his elected position in his late fifties. At that time, Adenauer himself thought that he was \\"kaput\\": he was a political liability in the eyes of the Nazis and close to financial bankruptcy. To his credit, Adenauer kept a low profile in Nazi Germany, put order in his finances with the help of (Jewish) friends and emerged with his political credentials relatively intact from the ruins of the Third Reich at the end of WWII. After neutralizing his political adversaries with ruthless efficiency and obstinacy, Adenauer was successively elected leader of the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) and then first post-war Chancellor of former West Germany with the approval of the occupying allies. To the victors and German internal opposition, Adenauer quickly revealed himself as a tough negotiator who was very good at dividing his adversaries by exploiting their weaknesses, in order to progressively restore the sovereignty and dignity of his beloved fatherland under the leadership of the CDU. Furthermore, Adenauer progressively overcame his parochialism by taking a leading role in the reconstruction of a unified, prosperous Western Europe at peace with itself on an equal footing with such personalities as Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Alcide de Gasperi and Paul-Henri Spaak. Although Adenauer died in 1967, his political legacy must remain a source of inspiration to his successors. Germany, aware of its not always glorious past and its long time pro-European stance, is called to take over the leadership in the further construction of a democratic, prosperous, and strong Europe to the chagrin of especially one nation. The center of gravity of the European Union will be moving eastwards in the coming years after the integration of Middle-European and Eastern European Nations. Future German chancellors will play a key role in the undertaking of eventually turning the dream of a United States of Europe into a reality in partnership with the United States of America. Only a Europe speaking with one voice in economic, military, political and social matters will be systematically taken seriously by the other great powers of this world.piration to his successors.

WSC himself was conscious of his extraordinary destiny early. As he famously mentioned at the age of thirty-two, \\"we are all worms, but I do believe I am a glow-worm (pg. 185 and 285).\\" Many of his contemporaries shared that insight quite quickly (e.g., pg. 172, 212, 285, 320, 329, 334, 533, 547, 556, 613, 616, 637, 685, 773, 774 and 841).<br />Describing WSC, however, is tricky. As one of his early conquests, Pamela Plowden, noted in 1905, \\"The first time you meet Winston, you see all his faults, and the rest of your life you spend in discovering his virtues (pg. 174).\\" In his final comments, Gilbert makes a short, penetrating portrait of WSC: Vision and foresight, humanity and sense of fair play, democracy and patriotism, formidable powers of work and thought ... and controversy, disappointment and abuse (pg. 959).<br /><br />Vision and Foresight: e.g. Nature of the future Great War, its development and devastating consequences (pg. 143, 235 and 281), perils of curbing Free Trade (pg. 147), distinction between criminal and political prisoners (pg. 212), anticipation of \\"Blitzkrieg\\" (pg. 383 and 562), warning about the dangers of Communism and prediction of its ultimate downfall (pg. 403 and 884), comeback of a humiliated Germany with a vengeance (pg. 403 and 464), unwavering support for the cause of Zionism that will ultimately lead to the creation of Israel (pg. 429, 902, 903 and 947), collective security mechanism to preserve peace in Europe, precursor of article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty (pg. 556), bankruptcy of appeasement policy conducted with Nazi Germany from weakness (pg. 480, 564, 596-599 and 632), unfolding of WWII and its destructions (pg. 593, 611, 658, 694, 697, and 701), construction of a post-war European Union around the French-German axis (pg. 731 and 872), use of nuclear arm to conduct a new strategic policy and call for a balanced and phased system of disarmament down the road (pg. 857, 884, 935 and 936), special relationship with the United States of America (pg. 869)<br />Humanity and Sense of Fair Play: e.g. \\"No political freedom without a measure at least of social and economic independence\\" (pg. 191, 206 and 231), perfectly conscious of the strain of his political life on his relationship with his wife, Clementine (pg. 207), scrupulous fairness to any man before WSC on a charge under his command in the Belgian trenches (pg. 343), fairness of his demobilization plan (pg. 406), his funeral oration in praise of Neville Chamberlain (pg. 683), his concern with the plight of German civilians at the end of WWII (pg. 816), \\"(His eyes) can be hard as he looks at you - or as tender as a woman's - they can weep easily\\" (pg. 858 and 859), his lack of pretentiousness and real charm to everyone (pg. 863), his acts of generosity towards his friends and family (pg. 887), his faith in the ultimate wisdom of humanity (pg. 945)<br />Democracy and Patriotism: e.g. Successful withdrawal of anti-Semitic Aliens Bill (pg. 165 and 167), resolute opposition against both Communism and Fascism (pg. 403, 426, 506, 575, 658, 866-869 and 884), servant of the Nation at war (pg. 724), establishment of a post-war 'United States of Europe' excluding Russia (pg. 731), essence of Churchill's political philosophy reduced to seven questions (pg. 790 and 791), importance of the right to vote in a democracy (pg. 802)<br />Formidable Powers of Work and Thought: e.g. \\"You inspire us all by your courage & resolution\\" (pg. 279), \\"Supreme quality which I venture to say very few of your present or future Cabinet possess, the power, the imagination, the deadliness to fight Germany\\" (pg. 320), \\"He has lion-hearted courage.

For that purpose, Bossidy and Charan convincingly analyze recent failures in execution within companies such as Xerox, AT&T, and Lucent. Bossidy and Charan then examine the three building blocks that execution-driven leaders must use to design, install, and operate effectively the people, strategy, and operations processes within their organization. Those building blocks are the distinctive modus operandi of execution-driven leaders, a culture that thrives on accountability and links rewards to performance, and the selection of the right people for the right jobs. To their credit, Bossidy and Charan have a jargon-free laser focus in reviewing the stumbling blocks that underlie the execution gap in those three areas. Bossidy and Charan indeed illustrate each of those stumbling blocks with relevant examples from their practice that makes it very enjoyable to read. Bossidy and Charan then explore the people, strategy, and operations processes that are built on the above-mentioned foundation for execution excellence. Bossidy and Charan brilliantly illustrate with clear examples the multiple links that exist among those processes and their interaction with the outside world. To summarize, \\"Execution The Discipline of Getting Things Done\\" is too valuable to take dust on readers' shelves. Any leader aspiring for execution excellence can indeed find an enduring source of inspiration in that reference book.	2002-06-06

Bingham expertly helps would-be and beginning runners make the jump, start running at their own pace with the right equipment, accept their highs and lows in their sport practice, and celebrate their big and small running accomplishments over time. Bingham's message is especially convincing because he had led an unhealthy lifestyle for many years before he discovered the joy of running. Bingham also reminds his core audience that running is a life philosophy that is based on the best possible balance to strike between mind and body. That quest is nothing new. For example, the Ancient Greeks and Romans respectively used the expressions \\"Nothing too much\\" and \\"A sound mind in a sound body\\" to describe the achievement of a harmonious state.  Bingham finally echoes the words of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games: \\"The essential thing ... is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not triumph but the struggle.\\" As a side note, would-be and beginning runners can also find inspiration in the movie \\"Chariots of Fire\\" and Vangelis' memorable accompanying music to keep faith in their performance, whatever it is.	2002-05-31

Cialdini concisely explores six strategies that persons with good and/or bad intentions can use in influencing others to do something or not to do it. These strategies are authority, commitment and consistency, liking, reciprocation, scarcity, and social proof. Cialdini convincingly demonstrates the power of each strategy with examples belonging to a wide range of disciplines. These stratagems often work because the target audience has been preprogrammed to react to specific situations in a certain way. Cialdini clearly explains which counter-strategies the target audience can use in defeating the six strategies mentioned above, whenever appropriate. To his credit, Cialdini refrains from using jargon that makes \\"Influence Science and Practice\\" a very enjoyable read that is easily accessible to a wide audience. As a side note, in \\"Simplicity Marketing\\", Steven M. Cristol and Peter Sealey explore the increasing need for shortcuts that businesses and consumers in the most developed economies have in making choices. Cristol and Sealey show with panache that marketers can use four strategies called the 4 R's -- Replace, Repackage, Reposition, and Replenish -- to simplify the life of businesses and consumers who are overwhelmed with choices in an increasing number of product categories.	2002-05-23

To their credit, Goleman, Boyatzis, and McKee do not downplay the dramatic impact of both intellect and cognitive skills in building a company to last. Goleman, Boyatzis, and McKee then explore the four emotional intelligence dimensions and their associated competencies: Self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Those capabilities are key to managing others successfully. After exploring each of these four concepts of emotionally intelligent leadership, Goleman, Boyatzis, and McKee apply them to the six types of leadership styles: Visionary, coaching, affiliative, democratic, pacesetting, and commanding. The authors convincingly demonstrate that emotionally intelligent leaders are flexible in their use of leadership styles because some styles are more appropriate than others in specific situations. Emotionally sub-optimal leaders who are willing to improve themselves can learn through self-directed learning and with the help of others how to fill the gaps that separate them from emotionally intelligent leaders. Goleman, Boyatzis, and McKee also explore how to build emotionally intelligent organizations. Ignoring how to deal with the realities of team norms and organizational culture often is a recipe for disaster as Goleman, Boyatzis, and McKee clearly show us. The result is indeed a toxic and rebellious environment that will have a negative impact on both customer and investor loyalty. Finally, Goleman, Boyatzis, and McKee examine the process for sustaining emotionally intelligent leadership over time. To summarize, \\"Primal Leadership\\" is a good read that brings an additional dimension of leadership to our attention.	2002-05-23

De Vincentis masterfully divide their examination of selling into transactional sales, consultative sales, and enterprise sales that coexist in many organizations.  Enterprise sales are also known under such terms as partnership and strategic alliance.  Rackham and De Vincentis concisely look at the key challenges that sales forces face in dealing with increasingly sophisticated buying consumers and businesses that are &quot;ruthless&quot; in the definition of their value scale and options.  Rackham and De Vincentis then examine the fundamental pillars that characterize each type of selling and how to be successful in each type of sales, even in times of drastic changes observed in the buying landscape.  Rackham and De Vincentis rightly warn their audience against the temptation to move up from either transactional selling to consultative selling or from consultative selling to enterprise selling.  Most consumers and businesses will not pay for what they perceive as beyond the value provided to them.  In their examination of the sales process, Rackham and De Vincentis stress the importance of removing boundaries from product management to technical support that stymie the efficiency of both transactional and enterprise selling.  In their analysis of the sales process behind consultative selling, Rackham and De Vincentis counter-intuitively but rightly observe that improvement lies in the creation of milestones reflecting results and not activities.  They logically note that salespeople tend to do what is compensated rather than what is effective.  Rackham and De Vincentis also help their readers rethink their channels of distribution for creating and capturing value as well as deal with channel conflict.  Finally, Rackham and De Vincentis explore how to change a sales force for improving its performance in each type of selling and how to migrate that sales force from one type of selling to another following changes in buying patterns.  Ultimately, the key value of &quot;Rethinking of the Sales Force&quot; lies in its mental combination with books like &quot;SPIN Selling&quot;, &quot;Major Account Sales Strategy&quot;, &quot;Managing Major Sales&quot;, and &quot;The New Strategic Selling.&quot; That combination is indeed powerful in devising a strategy that is actionable in the field to help differentiate one organization from its competition.ately, the key value of &quot;Rethinking of the Sales Force&quot; lies in its mental combination with books like &quot;SPIN Selling&quot;, &quot;Major Account Sales Strategy&quot;, &quot;Managing Major Sales&quot;, and &quot;The New Strategic Selling.&quot; That combination is indeed powerful in devising a strategy that is actionable in the field to help differentiate one organization from its competition.	2002-05-20

Rackham and Ruff first demonstrate with panache that selling smarter and not selling harder is key to optimizing the effectiveness of salespeople in large sales once they have established contact with their customers or prospects. Activity management to boost complex sales calls often has serious side effects that can eventually generate a negative return on the investment made for that purpose. Furthermore, Rackham and Ruff convincingly show which sales roles successful sales managers can adopt without undermining the stature and credibility of salespersons towards their customers or prospects. Rackham and Ruff then explore three types of analyses that sales managers can use to identify the skills and ability that their top performers display in their relationship with their customers or prospects. Once sales managers have clearly identified the skills and ability of these top performers, they can develop an action plan for coaching the rest of their sales force. Rackham and Ruff methodically examine strategy coaching, skills coaching, and their respective challenges. In addition, Rackham and Ruff examine the key motivating role that successful sales managers can have in boosting the sales productivity of their respective team. More specifically, Rackham and Ruff explore the effectiveness of setting targets, financial and non-financial incentives, and other motivational tools in boosting sales performance. Finally, Rackham and Ruff wrap up their analysis of managing major sales with a case study built on their research to put the concepts mentioned above into practice for the benefit of their audience. Both sales managers and salespersons can benefit from reading this in-depth account of how to best manage complex sales for their mutual benefit.	2002-05-15

To develop his major account sales strategy, Rackham has observed and analyzed a large number of high dollar value sales made around the world. Rackham convincingly shows that effective selling strategy is built on a thorough understanding of customers and the concerns they can have at each phase of a sale. Mastering that strategy, of course, requires, a lot of hard work and practice from salespersons determined to make the difference at the end of the day. Rackham successively reviews these phases that he has identified as: account entry strategy, recognition of needs, evaluation of options, resolution of concerns, sales negotiation, as well as implementation and account development.<br />1. In analyzing \\"Account Entry Strategy\\", Rackham successively explores the focus of receptivity, the focus of dissatisfaction, and the focus of power as well as the pitfalls associated with them. Because coaching, in our culture, has a positive connotation, few professionals will turn down the chance to demonstrate to a fellow professional their expertise and the usefulness of their connections. For that reason, successful salespeople identify, nurture, and leverage their sponsor(s) to ultimately get access to the different buying influences.  Because of possible shifts in the account on the buyer side, Rackham rightly recommends that no salesperson rely on only one individual to penetrate an account. Rackham also reminds his audience about the critical importance of uncovering implied needs to turn them into expressed needs. Successful salespeople make their contact(s) at the level of dissatisfaction aware of the urgency and severity of the problem(s) to be addressed so that these contact(s) eventually feel obliged to help them get access to the leverages of power.<br />2. In looking at \\"Recognition of Needs\\" and \\"Evaluation of Options\\", Rackham first briefly explores his SPIN questioning strategy that is explained in a luxury of details in his other book \\"SPIN Selling.\\" Basically, successful salespeople usually first ask the buyer situation questions, secondly problem questions, thirdly implication questions, and finally need-payoff questions to uncover implied needs for turning them into expressed needs that require action. Rackham also reminds his audience that successful salespeople prepare their sponsor(s) to help these sponsor(s) sell the sellers' solution in their own words if they are denied access to the focus of power. Furthermore, successful salespeople not only help the buyer identify needs but also influence him/her in the definition of the differentiation factors and their perceived importance to sort out the different options being offered to him/her. Rackham urges his audience to keep a broad definition of competition in mind. Finally, Rackham explores the three strategies that can help salespeople overcome their vulnerabilities and the dangers associated with these strategies: 1. Change the decision criteria (overtaking, trading-off, redefining, or creating alternative solutions), 2. Increase their strength through correction of misunderstanding or negotiation, and 3. Diminish the competition directly or indirectly.<br />3. In examining \\"Resolution of Concerns\\", Rackham reviews the hidden and expressed concerns that can push buyers to get \\"cold feet\\" in the decision-making process leading to an eventual purchase order down the road. As Rackham pertinently observes, price is often a convenient excuse that the buyer uses to hide his/her other, real concerns from the salesperson. Successful salespeople need to leverage their relationship with the buyer for uncovering the eventual areas of concerns, clarifying these concerns, and helping the buyer resolve them. Finally, Rackham warns salespeople about the three deadly sins of handling concerns: 1. Minimizing 2. Prescribing and 3. Pressuring.<br />4. In investigating \\"Sales Negotiation\\", Rackham first reminds his audience about the importance of making a clear difference between selling that tends to focus on buyers' perception of problems and negotiating that tends to concentrate on the cost of the solution. Addressing concerns about the solution with discounts will only weaken the position of the salesperson when the time of negotiation comes.  As mentioned above, price is often used as a smokescreen.  Rackham then reminds his audience that the only things successful salespersons negotiate during the Recognition of Needs or the Evaluation of Options phases of the sale are the needs or requirements of the buyer that they cannot meet in order to minimize the probability that they are out of the sale. Rackham finally observes that successful negotiators focus on areas of maximum leverage instead of over-concentration on price reduction, establish and narrow ranges, plan and use questions, separate understanding from agreement, and rigorously test for misunderstanding.<br />5. In dissecting \\"Implementation and Account Development\\", Rackham rightly reminds his audience that successful salespeople do not rest on their laurels after getting the order. They are deeply involved in the implementation of the solution adopted to increase the probability that the buyer successfully overcomes the motivation dip reflecting his/her evolving enthusiasm about that solution over time. Furthermore, Rackham pertinently stresses the importance of account development instead of account maintenance. Finally, Rackham also observes that successful salespeople document their successes, generate leads and references, reassess their understanding of customer needs, and influence future decision criteria.<br />Rackham wraps up his analysis of major account sales strategy with a case study built on his research to put the concepts mentioned above into practice for the benefit of his audience.<br />As a side note, a good strategic complement to the \\"Major Account Sales Strategy\\" is \\"The New Strategic Selling\\" by Stephen E.

To build the flexible, adaptable SPIN model, Rackham has observed and analyzed a large number of high dollar value sales made around the world. Rackham convincingly demonstrates that successful salespeople marketing high dollar value products and services do not rely on the sales tactics geared towards low dollar value sales that are traditionally taught to salespeople. Successful salespeople typically go through four stages that Rackham has identified as: preliminaries, investigating, demonstrating capability, and obtaining commitment.<br />1. In analyzing \\"Preliminaries\\", Rackham first warns salespeople that although first impressions count, they are less important that too many of them imagine. Furthermore, Rackham recommends that salespeople get down to business quickly and avoid talking about solutions too soon. Raising areas of personal interest with buyers can sound suspicious. Talking about the benefit of a solution before understanding buyer's needs and building value to satisfy these needs, can also be an invitation for trouble. Unfortunately, Rackham does not remind his audience enough that this approach to preliminaries, though perfectly appropriate in the American culture, can be perceived as offensive in others. Salespeople doing business abroad beware.<br />2. In looking at the critical \\"Investigating\\", Rackham advises that salespeople not only use situation questions and problem questions but also implication questions and need-payoff questions. Salespeople usually ask the first two types of questions to uncover implied needs unless their customers or prospects tell them upfront that they have an explicit need for a specific solution to their problem(s). In high dollar value sales, salespeople must leverage the uncovered problems to make them bigger by exploring their implications. Buyers can indeed perceive an imbalance between the price of the solution and the severity of their problem(s). Because that type of questioning can sound negative or depressing to buyers, salespeople must follow with need-payoff questions to make their customers or prospects feel good about the proposed solution to their problem(s). To his credit, Rackham reminds his audience that the SPIN model is not a rigid formula. The type of questions to be used and their relative importance depend on the circumstances of the specific high dollar value sale at hand.<br />3. In examining \\"Demonstrating Capability\\", Rackham makes the distinction among features, advantages, and benefits. Rackham convincingly shows that offering benefits is key to meet explicit needs expressed by customers or prospects. Selling only features can be a risky value proposition because that tactic potentially makes customers or prospects more price sensitive than they should be. Resisting that temptation can be particularly daunting in the high tech industry that sometimes suffers from \\"feature creep.\\" Selling only advantages can also backfire against salespeople because that tactic is eventually an invitation to objections raised by customers or prospects. To his credit, Rackham emphasizes objection prevention and not objection resolution by bringing customers or prospects to the insight that the product or service being offered meets the needs expressed by them.<br />4. In investigating \\"Obtaining Commitment\\", Rackham demonstrates with panache that there is an inversely proportional relationship between the number of closing techniques and the success of high dollar value sales. Traditional closing techniques such as assumptive closes, alternative closes, standing-room-only closes, last-chance closes, and order-blank closes can easily generate objections from customers or prospects who are not yet ready to act on their implied and expressed needs. Progress in high dollar value sales is measured in actions on which customers or prospects agree so that salespeople can eventually move on along the continuum stretching from lead to order. As long as customers or prospects do not commit to advancing in that process, salespeople are indeed condemned to stagnation at best, definitive loss of the order at worst down the road.<br />In Appendix A of his book (which is really worth of his audience's attention), Rackham is humble enough to recognize that a jump in sales following one of his sales trainings based on the four-step approach described above can be totally or partially attributed to other factors such as changes in people, changes in products, changes in pricing or changes in competition.<br />Finally, as a side note, a good strategic complement to the tactical \\"SPIN Selling\\" is \\"The New Strategic Selling\\" by Stephen E.

Kuglin makes a practical analysis about the conclusion and management of alliances during their lifecycle. Kuglin provides a framework to determine the need for an alliance that on its turn provides a roadmap to determine what type of alliances makes sense. Kuglin gives his readers a useful outline to draft the letter of intent, definitive alliance agreement, alliance business plan, and non-disclosure agreement. Each of these outlines is particularly useful for his readers who have already had the opportunity to take an in-depth look at these documents. To his credit, Kuglin repeatedly emphasizes the importance of involving internal and/or external counsels in drafting these documents from the beginning. Kuglin shares his experience with his readers about the working of alliances in different industries such as aeronautics, transportation, and telecommunications. Furthermore, Kuglin provides a roadmap that allows his audience to reassess the validity of keeping an alliance alive over time or not. Knowing when to disband/adapt an existing alliance is as important as making a new alliance. Finally, Kuglin builds on his expertise to define the critical success factors in establishing alliances and uses both General Electric and Cisco Systems of his &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; to illustrate them. In a second edition of Strategic Alliances, Kuglin could perhaps further elaborate on the first mover advantage in making an alliance or not. In their excellent Will and Vision, Gerard J. Tellis and Peter N. Golder debunk the myth of the first mover advantage by demonstrating that pioneers are rarely rewarded for their efforts at the end of the day. Is this empirical observation of both Tellis and Golder also true for the conclusion and management of alliances over their lifetime?	2002-04-09

Badaracco observes that society tends to think about leadership primarily in terms of heroic figures. His readers have been taught from their childhood to show respect for the efforts and sacrifices of great men and women. Often, his readers are not properly informed about the fact that most sung heroes like Winston Churchill or Mother Teresa worked, quietly and patiently, for years or decades, before their key contribution to society was widely acknowledged.<br />To his credit, Badaracco celebrates modest, unassuming men and women with their mixed and complicated motives. Like most of his audience, those men and women will probably never be in the limelight but make the world a better place through countless, small, often unseen efforts. Badaracco convincingly demonstrates that it is given to almost all his audience to learn and practice the simple virtues of quiet leadership, e.g.: Restraint, modesty, and tenacity.<br />Contrary to some wisdom, quiet leaders<br />1)  Buy time.<br />2)  Drill down into the political and technical elements of the problems they face.<br />3)  Invest their political capital wisely.<br />4)  Nudge, test, and escalate gradually.<br />5)  Find ways, when necessary, to bend the rules.<br />6)  View compromise as a high form of leadership and creativity.<br />In his recently published Good To Great, Jim Collins interestingly comes to the conclusion that the CEOs of great companies turning around good companies successfully are usually humble, modest, and tenacious. Is quiet leadership from top to bottom within any organization the future?<br />In a second edition of Leading Quietly, Badaracco could perhaps use both success stories and failures to illustrate each guideline for practicing quiet leadership. Often, failures are more valuable learning experiences than successes. Furthermore, Badaracco could perhaps further elaborate on white-collar criminality that can have an impact on quiet leaders as well. Quiet leaders at companies like Enron and Andersen could have been pressurized to violate the law and could eventually not simply walk away from their organizations because of their sense of duty and/or their responsibilities towards their family, especially in a downturn economy.at companies like Enron and Andersen could have been pressurized to violate the law and could eventually not simply walk away from their organizations because of their sense of duty and/or their responsibilities towards their family, especially in a downturn economy.	2002-04-01

Heiman, Diane Sanchez, and Tad Tuleja provide a practical, dynamic framework to approach complex selling from both a strategic and tactical point of view. Like a general, a salesperson must first master the art of planning his/her forces before being able to approach a customer/prospect effectively. Heiman, Sanchez, and Tuleja rightly recommend that their audience think about one complex selling situation that they have dealt with and analyse it using the six key elements to consider in a complex selling. The six elements are the following: buying influences, red flags/areas of strengths, response modes, wins/results, ideal customer profile, and sales funnel. Although the audience can first consider that exercise a chore, they will derive a lot of value from it by internalizing the author's framework. Heiman, Sanchez, and Tuleja correctly remind their audience that the salesperson needs to have a broad understanding of his/her competition. Competition includes not only direct competitive offerings and substitutes, but also customer/prospect's options such as doing nothing, in sourcing, or resource reallocation for other purposes. Furthermore, Heiman, Sanchez, and Tuleja recommend that their audience adopt a &quot;side&quot; strategy and not a &quot;face&quot; strategy by focusing first on customer/prospect's needs and not primarily on a narrowly defined competition. With a little bit of practice, the framework described above becomes second nature and allows the audience to eventually use it in a multitude of settings. For example, applying for a job is often similar to complex selling. The job seeker needs to make a mutually beneficial value proposition not only to the hiring manager(s), but also to the assistant (s), the receptionist and any other relevant persons who can make a difference in hiring him/her or not. Similarly, a fundraiser could use the above-mentioned framework to raise funds on behalf of his/her non-profit organization.	2002-03-21

Porras systematically explore what makes up a great company compared to a good company. A great company has a strong vision that encompasses both an immutable core ideology and envisioned future. That vision transcends the current leader of a great company because it has been institutionalized over time. Contrary to common wisdom, charismatic leadership can be very detrimental to even a great company. Furthermore, a great company nurtures its future leaders by promoting from within to preserve its essence over time. Collins and Porras demonstrate that bringing external \\"blood\\" to lead a (great) company in decline is often not very productive to turn around such a troubled company. In addition, a great company often commands a cult-like devotion from its staff. Disciplined people in thought and action are indeed self-motivated to help their company stay great. A great company also prospers by sticking to an evolutionary process that rigorously keeps the strongest ideas and lets the weakest ones die reflecting some BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) set previously. Although status quo is never perceived as satisfactory, vision is not lost out of sight. Collins and Porras show that both stimulation of change and preservation of the core are pursued at the same time vigorously. In Good To Great, Collins explains to his audience how to relate the above-mentioned concepts to the mutation of a good company into a great one.	2002-03-16

Leaders of great companies are rather humble than flamboyant. Furthermore, these leaders are persistent, disciplined, results-oriented, and entrepreneurial, debunking the myth that they and their companies usually achieve success through luck or sudden breakthroughs. In addition, leaders of great companies first hire and promote disciplined people in thought and action to focus on what be done to succeed. At the same time, they get rid of those who do not fit the bill. Leaders of great companies and their team also pursue their target market with passion, keeping a constant eye on the relevant drivers of their business. They are deeply convinced that they will ultimately prevail. Leaders of great companies and their team indeed act on the brutal facts they are facing with realism and steely determination. They see technology as an accelerator to reach their BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) and not as their creator. Finally, leaders of great companies and their team know how to manage the short-term expectations of Wall Street without losing sight of their long-term goals. Unfortunately, unlike Gerard J. Tellis and Peter N. Golder in Will and Vision, Collins does not emphasize enough the importance of financial commitment and asset leverage for a good company to become and remain a great company. Hopefully, Collins will explore those topics in greater detail in the second edition of Good To Great.	2002-03-15

Golder methodically and empirically demonstrate that pioneers are rarely rewarded for their efforts at the end of the day. The confusion between pioneers and current market leaders lies in the exclusion of failures (survival bias), tendency for managers to refer to their own firm as the pioneer (social desirability or self-reports bias), and self-serving market definitions (self-serving bias). For example, the Gillette Company is the oldest surviving firm in the disposable razor market. However, the Gillette Company was not the firm that first commercialized the razor. Similarly, Intel was not the firm that first brought the microprocessor or CPU to the market, even it has been perceived as the pioneer in that industry.<br />Tellis and Golder brilliantly build on over a decade of in-depth research to show that vision, persistence, relentless innovation, financial commitment, and asset leverage are the real factors that drive the superior performance of enduring leaders like the Gillette Company and Intel.<br />1. In their examination of \\"Vision\\", Tellis and Golder take their distance from the traditional definition of that much abused business term. Often, vision is indeed synonymous with broad mission statements used to excite and inspire stakeholders of an organization. In Counter-intuitive Marketing, Kevin J. Clancy and Peter C. Krieg concurred that most companies do not have much of a vision (See especially pg. 74 - 86). Vision has two key components according to Tellis and Golder: 1. A focus on the often-decried mass market with its dynamic and evolving needs and 2. A unique perspective of serving that mass market. For example, in contrast to its top competitors, AOL has stressed from the beginning convenience, ease to use, community, and ubiquity. Similarly, McDonald's has stressed from the onset quality, service, cleanliness, and value to build a worldwide network of mainly franchisees for bringing fast food to the masses. In Product Strategy for High Technology Companies, Michael E. McGrath gives a good complement to Tellis and Golder's definition of vision by explaining it as an answer to three key questions: 1.Where does a firm want to go? 2. How will the firm get there? And most critical 3. Why will the firm be successful? (See especially pg. 12, 306, and 317).<br />2. In their analysis of \\"Persistence\\", Tellis and Golder debunk the myth that enduring market leaders usually achieve their success through luck or sudden breakthroughs. In fact, visionaries have the will to persist in their efforts through seemingly insurmountable obstacles, slow progress, and long time efforts. The origin, early struggles, and ultimate success of Federal Express showed how important the vision and persistence of Fred Smith, its founder, made the difference at the end of the day. Similarly, the ultimate success of xerography after 13 years of research was due to the unwavering faith of former Xerox (Haloid)'s CEO, Joseph Watson in the underlying technology.<br />3. In their approach to \\"Relentless Innovation\\", Tellis and Golder remind their audience about the importance of firms not resting on their laurels. Technology and consumer tastes constantly change. Tellis and Golder rightly identify complacency with past successes, bureaucracy, managerial occupation with current customers and competitors, and fear of cannibalizing existing products as the four enemies of the relentless pursuit of innovation. For example, the earlier history of the Gillette Company clearly indicated that its success led to complacency and arrogance detrimental to its market leadership several times. Quoting Andy Grove, one of the founders of Intel, \\"Only the paranoid survives.\\" In Product Strategy for High Technology Companies, Michael E. McGrath gives a good complement to Tellis and Golder's examination of both time-based and cannibalization strategies (See especially pg. 219 - 234 and 257 - 271).<br />4. In their study of \\"Financial Commitment\\", Tellis and Golder demonstrate that visionaries show persistence in their ability and willingness to raise and commit financial resources whatever the obstacles in their way. For example, Federal Express was on the brink of bankruptcy for years before it finally took off. Similarly, King C. Gillette, one of the co-founders of the Gillette Company, struggled not only to launch the eponymous company but also to raise the capital necessary to commercialize his disposable razor for years.<br />5. In their dissection of \\"Asset Leverage\\", Tellis and Golder look at how generalized and specialized assets can be mobilized for dominating a product category. Tellis and Golder rightly identify the extent to which the new product category does or appears to threaten the old product category, a strict focus on costs, myopic view of markets, and bureaucracy as the four major hindrances to leveraging assets. Xerox squandered more than one opportunity to leverage its assets to adopt and commercialize the revolutionary discoveries of its Palo Alto Research Center for years. In contrast, Microsoft showed sacrificing several products in development as the way to catch up with the competition after it had initially misjudged the potential of the Internet revolution.<br />Tellis and Golder also remind their audience that the relative importance of the five factors mentioned above varies by firm and market characteristics: new firms, established firms competing in established markets, and established firms entering new, yet unrelated markets (See pg. 265 and 266).<br />To summarize, Will and Vision by Gerard J. Tellis and Peter N. Golder is like The Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton M. Christensen a major contribution to a better understanding of how markets really work.ancial Commitment\\", Tellis and Golder demonstrate that visionaries show persistence in their ability and willingness to raise and commit financial resources whatever the obstacles in their way.

McGrath rightly describes product strategy as a management process. Like any process, product strategy defines structure, timing, responsibilities, and skills. The process architecture reproduced on page 359 provides a practical framework starting with the definition of core strategic vision. Core strategic vision requires answering three questions: 1. Where do we want to go? 2. How will we get there? 3. And most critical Why will we be successful? Core strategic vision determines the criteria used for reaching a strategic balance in the product development process: Focus vs. diversification, short-term vs. long-term, current product platform vs. new product platform, business Alpha vs. business Beta, research vs. development, and high risk vs. low risk. Available resources influence the outlook of strategic balance.<br />Core strategic vision, strategic balance, core competencies, and competitive strategy are together the foundations on which the often-ignored product platform strategy is built. Product platform strategy is the lowest common denominator of relevant technology in a set of products or a product line. Product failures in high-tech companies frequently can be traced to an incomplete product platform strategy according to McGrath. Strategic balance, product platform strategy, and competitive strategy are together the foundations of product line strategy. Product line strategy is where specific product offerings are defined.<br />Core strategic vision also influences the competitive strategy that high technology companies must define. McGrath provides an in-depth, practical review of differentiation strategy, pricing strategy, and supporting strategies. Supporting strategies are first-to-market and fast-follower strategies, cannibalization, and global product strategy. McGrath's examination of both time-based strategies and cannibalization is particularly interesting because both subjects are rarely covered in such a luxury of detail.  McGrath finally examines the optional expansion strategy and innovation strategy. High technology companies only need them if they want to invest in expansion or innovation.<br />To summarize, Product Strategy for High Technology Companies is a practical guide to a management process from which even product managers from outside the high tech industry can draw useful lessons and more importantly apply them to their own product strategy.ause both subjects are rarely covered in such a luxury of detail.

Fortunately, I overcame my discomfort fast. I quickly enjoyed reading that thick epistolary volume about their political and personal matters. The personal letters of the Churchills revealed to me how influential Clementine was on Winston across the board. Their deep love and trust was the secret of their successful marriage, even if Winston was not always an easy husband and politician to deal with. Corresponding by written messages (today perhaps by email) with each other on a regular basis, even when they were together, proved to be an excellent way to help them keep their enduring flame for each other intact. Today, too many marital and extra-marital relationships get dissolved prematurely because of a lack of enough communication between both players. Life is after all a comedy in which men and women play their part and need to know or rediscover how to communicate their joys and pains to one another in order to increase the odds that they will be successful in their relationship.	2002-02-12

Hooks and Kristin A. Farry give their audience a clear methodology about how to eliminate rework and unnecessary features rooted in poor requirement definition for making product development or procurement faster and cheaper without sacrificing the better. Good requirement definition is more important than ever to especially fast-paced high-tech companies for which researching, developing, and commercializing products on schedule and within budget is key to be, become, and remain competitive. Interestingly, Hooks and Farry explain to their readers the profound impact that culture, education, and management have on requirement definition. Their critical examination of the &quot;seven cultural forces that define Americans&quot; in chapter 2 helps their (foreign) audience better understand why some (American) marketers have no time to do it right the first time, but endless time and a company bankroll to do it wrong over and over again to quote Kevin J. Clancy and Peter C. Krieg in their excellent Counter-intuitive Marketing.  Hooks and Farry remind their audience that nothing can change for the faster, cheaper, and better without a management commitment. Management must make very clear through their entire organization that quality products begin long before design and manufacture. These products find their genesis in quality requirements. To summarize, Customer-Centered Products is a must read for anyone involved/interested in product development or sourcing. The only weakness of the book lies in the concentration of examples from a few industries about which Hooks and Farry are very knowledgeable.	2002-02-12

Geisst gives a fair overview of US antitrust issues from a historical point of view.  Readers who are not familiar at all with the development, interpretation, and application of antitrust are introduced to the ambivalence about bigness in American thought over time. However, Monopolies In America is not an easy read because of a lack of coherence in the narration. Only a well-informed audience cognizant of the legal, economic, and social ramifications of antitrust can easily surf through the book and fully grasp the conflicting forces coming into play. Furthermore, Monopolies In America is a misnomer. Antitrust (law) issues cover a lot more than abuse of monopoly position. The Antitrust Paradox. A Policy At War With Itself by Judge Robert H. Bork is the definitive authority on the subject. His account is both comprehensive and scathing about the shared sub-optimal performance of the legislative, executive and judiciary branches of power as well as the practicing bar in making, interpreting, and applying antitrust rules. Judge Bork rightly attributes that shared sub-optimal performance to the too-often absence of a rudimentary understanding of market economics among the above-mentioned players.	2002-01-18

Businesses and consumers are often overwhelmed with the complexity of choosing goods and services available to them, many products are full of functions and features that only a small minority of users will ever utilize. To end the prevalent brand complexity, clutter, and confusion denounced above, Steven M. Cristol and Peter Sealey offer their audience four strategies called the 4 R's: Replace, Repackage, Reposition, and Replenish. Cristol and Sealey apply each of the 4R's to a multitude of situations in which the life of businesses and consumers can be made it easier at the profit of marketers cognizant of the importance of stress reduction, simplicity, and convenience. Cristol and Sealey correctly point out that only few companies are ultimately insulated from the 4 R's imperative. Cristol and Sealey also rightly draw the attention of their readers to the fact that the 4R's must be integrated into the brand and product strategy so that the product offered is perceived as part of the solution to the growing complexity of people's lives.	2002-01-18

The outcome of poorly crafted marketing strategy and tactics is often predictable: High failure rate in launching new products, dismal advertising, sub-optimal promotion, premature commoditization of brands, and poor financial results. Clancy and Krieg constantly urge their audience to go back to basics such as research-driven targeting and positioning. Clancy and Krieg also remind readers that good implementation may be more important than great strategy. The appendix in the book \\"Marketing in a Nutshell: The 100 Questions Every CEO Needs to Answer\\" is on its own a gold mine.

Building on extensive research conducted by The Gallup Organization, Buckingham and Coffman articulate their innovative argumentation around four traditional keys: Select a person, set expectations, motivate the person, and develop the person. Great managers are looking not only for skills and knowledge, but also more importantly for talent when they select a candidate for a position to fill. Furthermore, great managers are concerned first with the right outcomes expected from the selected person, and then eventually with the right steps to get to these outcomes. In addition, great managers are determined to leverage the person's strengths and work around her weaknesses in motivating her. They do not try to correct the weaknesses of the selected person. Finally, great managers help the selected person come to the insight that going up on the hierarchical ladder is not necessarily in her best interest. However, Buckingham and Coffman rightly draw the attention of their audience to the fact that corporate culture can make the innovative work of great managers in defining the four traditional keys difficult, even impossible.	2001-11-26

Bork gives a fascinating, though demanding, review of the most important antitrust issues in the United States. The central, pragmatic thesis of Bork is maximization of consumer welfare (also called economic efficiency) and not the protection of small businesses in addressing any antitrust issue. Unfortunately, the legislative, executive and judiciary branches of power as well as the practicing bar have not always shown consistency in making, interpreting, and applying antitrust rules. The main reason for their shared sub-optimal performance in that area is the too-often absence of a rudimentary understanding of market economics according to Bork. As a practicing marketer and lawyer, I agree with his observation.

The author does an outstanding job in switching back and forth between the Alsterufer Warburgs and the Mittelweg Warburgs, the two rivaling branches of the Warburgs.  Ron Chernow indeed vividly recasts the numerous actors of that saga against the economic, political and social backdrop of their time.  The author brilliantly helps his readers understand the painful dilemma that many German Jews, keener and keener on assimilation into Germany, faced especially under the Weimar Republic and then under Nazism.  Ron Chernow also underlines how several Warburgs emigrating outside Germany had a positive influence on the unfolding of some key domestic and overseas events.  Ironically, M.M. Warburg &amp; Co., the German cradle of the banking dynasty that Nazism and then internal infighting almost torpedoed with success, is the only one to remain independent today.  M.M.

The author narrates, with much clarity, the metamorphosis of JP Morgan into a powerhouse during the Baronial Age, the taming and breakdown during the Diplomatic Age, and its comeback with a vengeance during the Casino Age. Furthermore, Chernow excels in giving life to the characters of the House of Morgan, their allies as well as foes, against the economic, political and social backdrop of their time. The reader progressively comes to the understanding of how much the US financial system is indebted to the domestic and overseas tribulations of a single bank. No other US bank has been able to emulate the power and influence that the House of Morgan has exercised under its various legal disguises since its birth in the City. The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act does not offer the guarantee that JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the current incarnations of the House of Morgan, will one day be reunited again.

Rockfeller Sr., Ron Chernow goes beyond the myths surrounding one of the greatest capitalists that the world has ever known. Chernow gives a well-balanced portrait of a paradoxical man who perceived unbridled competition as nefarious to the development of the nascent oil industry and by extension his Standard Oil. Although John D. Rockfeller Sr. was a ruthless, efficient businessman, he progressively came to the insight that God had given him not only a gift to make a lot of money but also the responsibility to dedicate a significant part of his fortune to philanthropy in order to foster the well being of the society at large. Unlike most \\"robber barons\\", John D. Rockfeller Sr. did not feel the compulsion to be too ostentatious. He led a quite modest life for a man who could afford everything he wanted. The recent development of industry-led consortia such as Covisint and Exostar presents a striking similarity to the emergence of trusts such as the Standard Oil and Carnegie Steel at the end of the 19th century. Unlike a trust, an industry-led consortium is created by major competitors within one industry. Industry-led consortia are under close scrutiny of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. Their success is built on both liquidity (i.e. traded volume) and value generated through the supply chain of a specific industry. Because success feeds success, there is a high probability that an industry-led consortium will one day dominate an industry at the expense of independent exchanges, private exchanges, and any other consortia on one continent and eventually on a global basis. Will the major players of an industry belonging to an industry-led consortium be able to resist the Demon of monopoly power that proved so alluring to John D. Rockfeller Sr. and his Standard Oil?	2001-07-04

Sculley and Woods seem to share the idea that a B2B exchange first needs to concentrate on building liquidity by matching orders, and then on increasing value. On page 123, they write: &quot;Liquidity is king for exchanges, so it is essential to build trading volume as quickly as possible.&quot; Although increased pricing transparency that trading volume fosters, can be attractive to buyers and/or sellers, the ability to improve transparency and efficiency all along the value chain is the ultimate key to a massive buy-in from the industry. Therefore, the B2B exchange must work on reaching both goals in parallel. Otherwise, the B2B exchange will develop a value proposition and subsequently a pricing strategy that are unattractive to buyers and/or sellers.  Unsurprisingly, sub-optimal relationships with buyers and/or sellers lead directly to low transaction volume, an unattractive services bundle and ultimately an under-performing B2B exchange. Furthermore, Sculley and Woods stress very little the inertia of many suppliers and their customers, without mentioning the intermediaries whose job is eventually on the line... Evolution is usually better than revolution to build an industry solution, by industry experts, that benefits all of the industry. In addition, Sculley and Woods also overemphasize the importance of the first mover advantage. On page 121, they write: &quot;In true Internet pioneering fashion, the founders of a new exchange must plant their flag, declare victory and then run like hell.&quot; The debacle of many independent exchanges facing the competition of both private exchanges and industry-led consortia is a clear reminder that the first mover advantage is of relative, not absolute importance in many situations. Finally, Sculley and Woods are almost completely silent on the impact of legal regulations on the birth, development and death of B2B exchanges. For example, on page 9, they write: &quot;One market space is likely to dominate for each product.&quot; Sculley and Woods seem to forget that Microsoft had drawn the attention of both the Department of Justice and FTC for years, precisely because of the overwhelming dominance of its operating system and its perceived &quot;bullying&quot; tactics in pursuing market domination.lations on the birth, development and death of B2B exchanges.

Christensen thoroughly and systematically analyzes the impact of both disruptive and sustaining technologies on well-managed enterprises. The author shows us how these enterprises belonging to very different industries fail precisely because they do all the right things in developing and bringing sustaining technologies to the market, i.e. 1. Listen to their customers carefully; 2. Invest enough money in developing new technologies that meet or exceed customer expectations; 3. Research market trends thoroughly; 4. Excel in allocating resources systematically to innovations that optimize returns.<br />Christensen clearly explains to us why and how enterprises that are paragon of the above-mentioned approach to the market can lose their balance while dealing with the emergence of disruptive technologies. Well-managed enterprises ultimately fail because they ignore or fight the five laws of disruptive technologies that Christensen has identified for us, i.e. 1. Tackle the disruptive technology appropriately, usually by setting up an autonomous entity free of the influence of mainstream customers; 2. Penetrate small markets through the use of an appropriate vehicle such as an autonomous entity, even if those markets don't allow well-managed enterprises to reach their targeted growth rates quickly; 3. Practice what Christensen calls &quot;agnostic marketing&quot;, i.e. gaining first experience in using a disruptive technology, often made possible by watching how real people use it rather by listening to their wishes before making plans for implementation; 4. Pay due consideration to internal processes and values that make well-managed enterprises strong in one context and weak in another one; 5. Realize that mainstream customers are not necessarily able or willing to absorb any performance improvement that investing in sustaining technologies makes possible.<br />To summarize, The Innovator's Dilemma brings a fresh perspective to an intricate issue that well-managed enterprises need to address sooner or later in their life.anaged enterprises need to address sooner or later in their life.	2000-11-24

The author uses a lot of buzzwords and tired phrases to describe what is going on in the industry. Furthermore, Rhemann needs to pay better attention to the organization of her book. The author regularly repeats herself without adding much value to her message. Finally, Rhemann oversells her Texas-based consulting practice through the book to the annoyance of her readers.	2000-11-05

Jean Kilbourne does a very good job in drawing our attention to the fact that advertising influences us more than we think. Advertising is part of our environment. Most of us, however, dismiss the influence of advertising on our life because we often consider ads to be silly, trivial, fun, ridiculous. Advertisers even capitalize on our ego by insinuating that we are too smart to be taken in by advertising. The attitude of denial allows advertising to do its persuasive work. Kilbourne tirelessly warns us about the dangerous side effects of advertising. She illustrates her case with numerous ads. Kilbourne's central hypothesis is that advertising helps to create a climate in which certain attitudes and values prosper, such as the objectification of women, male violence, addiction normality. Furthermore, Kilbourne demonstrates with many examples that the emptier we feel, the greater consumers we are. That unease with our self can lead us to confuse addiction with freedom and conformity with rebellion. Advertising, of course, has a solution (read a product, a service) that can meet or fix each of our needs or problems instantly or at least quickly. Kilbourne also stresses the large impact that advertising has on the media that we consume via the suppression of material that would offend the sponsor and via the inclusion of editorial content that does not interfere with sponsor's business. In addition, Kilbourne reminds us that most industries logically fight hardest against taxes or any restrictions on advertising that have an impact on their bottom line or burden them with additional responsibilities. However, Kilbourne is not able or willing to accept that advertising is one of the key building blocks of a well-oiled capitalist economy. Advertising allows businesses to communicate the features/benefits of their product offering to their targeted market segment and to persuade that targeted market segment that they have the solution catering to their wants/needs. Furthermore, Kilbourne does not mention that more and more of us own shares in a growing number of enterprises and expect nothing less than the optimization of shareholder value. In addition, Kilbourne overestimates human nature. Most of us are not able or willing to be 100% rational all the time. Finally, Kilbourne does not stress enough that parents, schools, churches and other organizations have a key role to play in educating children and teenagers about the influence of advertising on their thoughts and behaviors.ermore, Kilbourne does not mention that more and more of us own shares in a growing number of enterprises and expect nothing less than the optimization of shareholder value.

Books	4	2	3	N	N	A fascinating lesson of humility	Robert McMath and Thom Forbes, though they mainly analyze consumer goods  failures, offer marketers valuable insight into why many products  ultimately fail.  Too many marketers seem to develop products for  themselves - and people like themselves - and not for their intended target  segment. Unsurprisingly, McMath and Forbes reveal to their readers that  more than 80% of new consumable products fail because those products bring  nothing new to their intended targets.  The failures are often me-too  products that offer no significant real point of difference, i.e.  effective, positive solutions to real problems.  Not surprisingly, the  multiplication of those products has contributed to the power shift from  manufacturers to retailers.  Those facts should invite marketers to think  about the poor usability and content of too many web sites. Too many  persons involved in defining the design and content of web sites ignore  good usability and content practices.  They design and write for their own  pleasure (or worse, the boss's pleasure) instead of trying to satisfy their  user's needs. Furthermore, McMath and Forbes observe that too many  marketers suffer from two illnesses: &quot;Corporate Alzheimer's&quot; and  &quot;Short-Termism.&quot; Those marketers are often not enough informed  about their brand's culture or heritage due to the lack of marketing  veterans who have been downsized or have moved to another job/company in  the meantime. Furthermore, those same marketers often have not enough  incentives to become visionaries and care about loyalty. Short-term  earnings are usually what matter most. McMath and Forbes also rightly  emphasize the importance of consistency in building a strong brand. Many  people are loyal to a particular brand of a product because they can make  basic assumptions about it time after time. Brand inconsistencies such as  price cutting gimmicks and conflicting product benefits will ultimately  undermine the unique value proposition of underlying products, especially  in maturing product categories. In addition, McMath and Forbes push  marketers to operate as if their marketing budget was their own money.  Their compensation should be aligned with the marketing goals. However,  honest failures should be rewarded. Launching new products assume that  marketers be willing to stick their neck out. To summarize, &quot;What Were  They thinking?&quot; offers marketers a unique opportunity to learn from  failures of fellow marketers. Marketers who are ignorant about the mistakes  of the past are doomed to repeat the same mistakes again and again while  their organizations lose a lot of money in the process.underlying products, especially  in maturing product categories.

Thomas Nagle and Reed Holden successfully demonstrate with practical  examples that strategic pricers are diplomats rather than generals,  contrary to common belief. Diplomats know that initiating price discounts  can undermine the profitability of their business. Price cutting unduly  focuses the attention of the customer base on their wallet rather than the  value of the product offering to their life/business. Diplomats will  carefully look not only at the short-term gain, but also at competitors'  long-term reactions to measure the impact of such a move on the bottom  line. Furthermore, diplomats do not share the misconception of generals  that the ultimate winner must meet every challenge. Diplomats will  integrate the product's relevant costs, the customer segments' price  sensitivity and the behavior of the competition in their marketing plans.  The analysis of those factors will then allow diplomats to weigh the costs  and benefits of competition and only fight battles for which the likely  benefits are greater than the likely costs. Nagle and Holden also stress  the importance of establishing pricing policies consistent with the plans,  especially when there is no fixed-price policy. Diplomats must give  salespeople incentives to make profitable sales, not sales for their own  sake. Salespeople will adapt their sales pitch to the different price  sensitivity of price buyers, loyal buyers and value buyers. Nagle and  Holden draw the attention of their readers to the fact that a product's  price influences the market's perception of its features and benefits and  those of other products with which it is sold, the effectiveness of its  promotion, and the interest it generates in channels of distribution. They  observe that the opposite is also true. Furthermore, Nagle and Holden look  at the impact of the choice of an independent channel of distribution on  corporate pricing policy.  Diplomats must be attorneys specializing in  legal pricing or at least hire one. They must consider not only what is  profitable, but also what is legal and ethical in establishing pricing  policies towards channels of distribution, end users, and competition.  Pricing is such a legal minefield that both authors dedicate one chapter of  their book to that delicate subject. Nagle and Holden also challenge  another idea that many marketers share: The key to profitability is to  achieve a dominant market share. Most companies in competitive markets try  to be all things to all people rather than excel in serving the needs of  particular customer segments. Both product differentiators and cost leaders  have demonstrated that targeting a segment of customers and focusing on  them pays off handsomely. A third edition of this book integrating the  impact of the New Economy on pricing should be a welcome update to that  masterpiece. To summarize, The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing is a must  read for anyone involved or interested in pricing. The content is so rich  that I am still discovering new aspects about pricing two years after I  read the book for the first time.ne.

Marketing With E-Mail is a quick reading that broadens your horizon by  giving you a concise, to the point overview of the different tools  available to market a company and its products/ services through e-mail.  Permission marketing is the mantra of Marketing With E-Mail and her author,  Shannon Kinnard. E-mail marketing, though important, is not a stand-alone  communication channel.  By offering your prospects and customers multiple  response paths, you increase the probability that they will respond to your  product offering. In addition, Marketing With E-Mail and the companion web  site refer to many resources that you can explore to get additional  insights into that new field of marketing.  Shannon Kinnard, however, does  not cover the economics of e-mail marketing thoroughly.  Case studies are  not usually backed up by any in-depth financial analysis that should  definitely convince you that investing in e-mail marketing provides a  sensible return on investment and positively influences customer lifetime  value. Hopefully, Shannon Kinnard will further share her (financial)  expertise with you in the second edition of Marketing With E-Mail that will  be released soon.	2000-08-06

The vast majority of companies do not know the cash value of loyalty because they  rely on traditional accounting tools that do not give them a complete  picture of costs and value attached to customers, employees and investors.  Loyalty leaders, though they consider profitability important, do not  pursue it as a short-term goal to be reached at any cost to please anyone  interested in their financial performance. They deliver superior value to  their customers, employees and investors by convincing them that loyalty  performs at its best when it is mutually beneficial over time. The loyalty  web that those firms spin is socially complex and thus likely to be costly  to emulate.  Competitors of loyalty leaders do not have a chance to achieve  superior performance if they adopt a piecemeal approach to loyalty.  Frederick Reichheld gives would-be loyalty leaders a framework to build  loyalty's leader strategy and tools to measure their progress on the road  to success.  However, like the builders of Rome, loyalty leaders did not  master their craft overnight.	2000-07-30

Barry Silverstein then covers seven different B2B Internet direct marketing strategies for increasing profits in a luxury of details.  The companion site is a good complement to the book for that purpose.  Barry Silverstein is very good at generating ideas that both beginners and  experienced marketers could use for building marketing programs.  The  author gives some ROI applications to illustrate his point. Unfortunately,  Barry Silverstein does not give screenshots of good and bad direct  marketing applications. To paraphrase Jakob Nielsen at the beginning of his  last book, &quot;Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity&quot;,  the reason to give those screenshots is not to criticize or praise specific  sites, companies, designers or marketers.  The screenshots are used to  illustrate direct marketing techniques because it is difficult to  understand abstract theory without concrete examples.  Unlike Arthur Hughes  in his last book, &quot;Strategic Database Marketing&quot;, Barry  Silverstein seems to limit his description of case studies to success  stories.  One of the main goals of a reference book is to help other  marketers avoid making the same mistakes again and again.  Despite those  shortcomings, Business-to-Business Internet Marketing is currently the  leading authority on the subject.	2000-07-02

Arthur Hughes introduces the reader to such key database marketing concepts as Lifetime Value, ROI, RFM Analysis and Profitability.  The author illustrates each concept with success stories, costly failures,  and last but not least...numerical examples.  This allows the reader to get  a practical, actionable understanding of those concepts.  Furthermore,  Arthur Hughes empowers the reader by giving her the opportunity to test her  understanding of the material.  He does this by offering an &quot;Executive  Quiz&quot; at the end of each chapter.  To summarize, Strategic Database  Marketing has effectively proven how to gain the most from your customer  base, while satisfying their wants and needs.	2000-06-16
