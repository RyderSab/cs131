US	52189073	RWBCPFRUWEHFN	1594200092	686377339	Alexander Hamilton	Books	4	2	2	N	N	An Excellent Biography, An Enjoyable Read	\\"Alexander Hamilton\\" by Ron Chernow is a fascinating, gripping biography of one of the most interesting and overlooked Founding Fathers. <br /> <br />Hollywood could have scripted Hamilton's life. His life began with his out of wedlock birth in the West Indies to a French mother and Scottish father; it ended forty-nine years later in a duel with Aaron Burr, then the Vice President of the United States. In between, he rose to prominence in the annals of American politics. He founded America's first bank, served as the country's first secretary of the treasury, and authored some of the most profound political treatises of his time or any other. Oh, and he became involved in this country's first really steamy sex scandal.  <br /> <br />At times, Chernow is a bit too much of an apologist for Hamilton. He creates near-cartoonish figure of Jefferson, Madison, Adams and Aaron Burr, when they challenge Hamilton. All of these founding fathers were brilliant and brilliantly flawed men. I wish Chernow could have showed better how somehow these individuals manage to rise above their weaknesses and merge their strengths to design the architecture of the US government. <br /> <br />Still, this is a great read. I highly recommend it to lovers of US history everywhere.	2005-02-27
US	52189073	R2N5KQRX7WDVVK	1400062314	9571448	Prep: A Novel	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Excellent Debut, Interesting Read (4.3 on a scale  of 1-5)	Prep rivets the reader from the first page until the last.   The narrator, Lee, is a 14-year old girl from a family in South Bend, Indiana, who enters the rarified world of a New England prep school. She goes from being a star in the classroom to a student of middling quality, from the middle of America to the middle of the Northeastern elite, and from middle class to the fringes of her new society. For middle class in this rarified milieu equals lower class.     Lee spends four years on the periphery of all of her class's cliques: neither popular nor unpopular, she simply exists. Yet her gift--her ability to observe the nuances of her own and her classmates behavior-is both extraordinary and unrecognized by nearly everyone (save for a perceptive individual or two) around her.     Sittenfeld tackles a subject that is almost anthema in our society: the one of class. She notices all the subtleties amongst the rich (there's dignified rich, and old rich, and simply over-the-top, laugh out loud rich). Small things--like who has flowers on their bedspreads--tell of great differences.     Not much happens in this book. Then again, that is the point. When one is in one of these small, precious, insulated and isolated environments, one thinks that this is life. Lee, at the end, realizes an entire world had gone on for the four years that she was at prep school without her realizing it. And that comforts her.     I highly recommend this book to lovers of contemporary fiction everywhere.	2005-02-20

It is also a wonderful read.  <br /> <br />In the 1990's, Nafisi, a professor in Tehran, cherrypicked her most gifted female students and formed a book club in her home. These women read and shared their insights on some of the most provocative works of American and British literature (e.g., The Great Gatsby, Pride and Prejudice, and of course Lolita.) <br /> <br />Of course, they took tremendous risks by participating in this book club: most works were banned and women were second class citizens, criticized at times for even eating an apple too seductively. Yet when they arrived at Nafisi's, most shed their scarves and their outer skins. The literature liberated them--and in many cases saved their souls.  <br /> <br />I do have a few criticisms. At times, Nafisi almost seems to forget herself and her narrative by digressing with pages long analyses of these works. (Hence my four star review.) The women in the group are sketches, slightly drawn, but for a reason: Nafisi did not want them to suffer persecution for her writing so she disguised them. Yet by disguising them so well, she sapped her narrative of powerful characters.  <br /> <br />Still I would highly recommend this book to those who enjoy contemporary political history and/or critiques of contemporary literature.	2004-12-10

Her insecurities have not left her and they wreak havoc on her life. She's panicked Mark will leave her for the lovely Rebecca, she's uncomfortable that he folds his underwear at night, she's struggling on the job...and this all leads to the inevitable break-up with Mark.  <br /> <br />I don't want to ruin the many twists and turns of the plots. Suffice to say, her adventures (and those of her friends Shazzer and Jude and of her parents) are even more laugh out loud funny the ones in the original. And all throughout the book, Bridget never loses her sense of vulnerability and her decency. She is a true heroine (or anti-heroine perhaps). <br /> <br />This book differs from the new movie. So even if you've seen that, you're still in for some surprises.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to Bridget lovers everywhere.	2004-11-13

Nigella Lawson's \\"Feast\\" is a fabulous cookbook for most people, not just those about to prepare a Thanksgiving Dinner (though it is great for them too).  <br /> <br />\\"Feast\\" celebrates Lawson's unique take on cooking and on life. She is a strong proponent of being comfortable in your own kitchen and at your own party. She eschews \\"perfectionism\\" (e.g., perfect flowers as centerpieces, exquisite appetizers) for good, home cooked food and comfort.  <br /> <br />Lawson's definition of a feast has breadth and depth. This book includes sections on the traditional Holidays both secular and non-secular (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Hannukah, Eid-Muslim, Halloween). However, she also has suggestions for a \\"One Person Feast\\" or a \\"Venetian Feast\\" (which would make for a great dinner party)and other such events. MOST notably, she includes a section on a feast for a funeral with thoughtful suggestions on food to bring to the home of the bereaved.  <br /> <br />Lawson's cookbooks can be read as books. In fact, I recommend that's how you begin with \\"Feast\\": read it from cover to cover. Her prose is witty, sly and friendly. You feel as if she's standing there in the kitchen with you. <br /> <br />Finally, the recipes are terrific. You'll find great soups that you can use anywhere (you may want to rename the Halloween \\"slime soup\\" but you can serve it in the summer), wonderful suggestions for roasts (e.g., roiled loin of pork cinghiale, Georgian chicken), side dishes (brussel sprouts with chestnuts and pancetta), and desserts ( a flourless chocolate orange cake) that can be used any day and any time of year, feast or no feast.  <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book enough to lovers of food and cooking everywhere.	2004-11-12

It reads like a great historical novel--and you have to keep reminding yourself throughout it that it is actually true. <br /> <br />The book centers on two men with two very different obsessions. Daniel Burnham, a Chicago architect, was the man responsible for the design and execution of the 1893 Chicago's World Fair. It was a tremendous undertaking and basically required an entire small city to be built in a very short period. He called upon the services of some of the finest designers, painters and architects of the time.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, another man in the city was also nursing a huge ambition. H.H. Holmes, a former doctor turned pharmacist, was building a hotel to service visitors at the World's Fair. Only his structure-filled with gas chambers and death traps--was built to ensure that some of his guests never left the city after their visit. <br /> <br />Many other characters fill the pages bringing this vibrant city in the 1890's to life in 2004. The reader learns not only about the history of the time but also of art, architecture, politics and culture.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to lovers of both non-fiction and fiction with a historical twist.	2004-11-12

Granted it is a work of fiction: but a work of fiction set among very real descriptions of actual events and periods. <br /> <br />The narrator, Amil, is a fortyish writer who lives in San Francisco. The book traces his journey from a priviliged upbringing in Afghanistan to life in the Bay Area's community of Afghanistan emigres. Throughout the journey, he has been haunted by his childhood friendship with Hassan, the son of a family servant. Hassan represented much of what was good and pure in the world to Amil. Yet Amil, due in part to class differences and due in part to a crisis which takes place early in the book, could not always treat Hassan with respect and dignity.  <br /> <br />Hosseini writes well-not quite brilliantly, but well enough--and embroiders his novel with so many descriptions of Afghanistan today as well as decades ago. You feel as if you are there. His plot, particularly towards the end, relies a bit too much on coincidence. Still it is a remarkable read.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly to individuals who love good, new fiction and to individuals who may want to learn more about Afghanistan.  <br />	2004-11-06

In Odessa, TX, the Permian Panthers, the local high school football team, are the only game in town. Their Friday night games are attended by 20, 000 fans, their players are local heroes, and the businessmen of the town fete the coach...when he wins.  <br /> <br />Bissinger introduces you to the young men on the team.  <br />There's Boobie, the star running back, who has overcome a series of foster homes and heartache at a young age just to make it to the playing field. When he suffers a career ending injury at the beginning of the season, he is discarded by the coaches and the town in a heartless, racist manner. Then there's Mike Winchell, the intelligent yet insecure quarterback, who mourns the loss of his father and shields his mother from life. No one visits him at his home. There's Don, the son of a former Permian star turned unstable alcoholic. Finally, there's Ben Chavez, the fiery son of a prosperous lawyer. Chavez's plans include attending Harvard and having a future beyond Permian football. He seems to be he only one who has thought ahead. <br /> <br />Even though they are only seventeen years old, in many ways their lives are ending and not beginning. The locals tell them again and again it will never be this good. And for many, it won't.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend \\"Friday Night Lights\\" to lovers of sports books everywhere and to those interested in learning more about one slice of American life. Even though the book was written in the late 1980's, its penetrating study of a town's relationship to sports resonates with readers today. <br />	2004-10-20

Her stories have entertained me for years about the parents who would say or do anything to get their children into the schools of their choice. And now Nancy Lieberman has nailed this culture in her book \\"Admissions.\\" <br /> <br />The plot of Admissions is straightforward and simple. Helen and Michael Drager, a lovely Yuppie couple in an exquisite apartment in New York, are applying their beloved eighth grade daughter to a number of private schools in NYC. The schools have names like \\"The Very Brainy Private Girls School,\\" \\"The Progressive School,\\" \\"The Very Fancy Girls School\\" and so on.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, at Zoe's private grammar school, known simply as \\"The School,\\" their admissions director Sara is undergoing a private hell of her own as she is besieged by applicants for Kindergarden. Sara's boss, Pamela, the Head of the School has remained indifferent to all of Sara's troubles as well as those of the eighth grade parents. No one is quite sure what she is doing: but they have a feeling it is not good, ethical or legal. But no one wants to blow the whistle on her during the Admissions process. <br /> <br />The book follows a six month period-from first call for application to the final letter of admission-in the lives of all of these individuals. While the characters are cartoonish, they are still very amusing. In addition, Lieberman embroiders her book with some very funny supporting characters--a TV talk show host modeled on Oprah with a \\"turkey baster\\" child, a gay couple with twins named after their favorite Russian Czar and Czarinas--who keep popping up throughout the book. She also has a poignant character, an eighth grade girl with a severe eating disorder, whose parents refuse to recognize her illness and keep pushing for her admission to their top choice. <br /> <br />This book is great fun. It's not much more: Lieberman could havedone a bit more with the plot and added a few more storylines. Still I highly recommend this book to lovers of chick lit, parents (of both sexes) everywhere who have children of this age (whether or not they are applying to private schools) and to individuals who simply enjoy an amusing satire of one slice of American life.	2004-10-19

In her book, you learn and eventually care about many of the colorful figures of this country. She introduces you to a former Taliban member who details the way he tortured individuals; a rising politician who is descended from Afghan nobility; the widow of the last individual executed by the Taliban who had her first child at the age of 14. <br /> <br />Lamb also takes care in noting the efforts of so many individuals in preserving the country's literary, social and political traditions in secret during the rule of the Taliban. The book's title refers to a group of female writers who kept meeting during the Taliban's time under the pretense of attending meetings of their \\"sewing circles.\\" <br /> <br />Lamb's book does have some flaws. \\"The Sewing Circles of Herat\\" is beautifully reported with many rich details which enliven her stories. However beautiful reporting does not necessarily translate to well written or a strong narrative. In many respects, the book is a series of disparate accounts of Lamb's encounters with various citizens of Afghanistan soon after September 11th. She does not weave overriding themes or carry one strong narrative viewpoint throughout the book.  <br /> <br />Still I highly recommend this book for individuals who wish to learn more about Afghanistan or simply want to read a well reported book on a very misunderstood country.	2004-10-19

Morgan is an approachable and accessible volume on the colonial revolutionary, scientist, diplomat, postmaster general and man about many towns.  <br /> <br />Morgan streamlines the many events and careers of this long-living individual into a manageable volume. You don't feel that you have to dedicate a significant percentage of your upcoming reading time over the next year to get to know Franklin better.  <br />He lays out and provides insights into the familiar path of Franklin's life: from runaway Boston boy in Philadelphia, to printer and author, to diplomat, to revolutionary and then back again to diplomat and finally to survivor. He opens up the book by stripping away one of the key images of Franklin: the bespectacled scribbler writing away at his roll-up desk. He takes Franklin outside and onto the playing fields of life.  <br /> <br />This volume may not be for everyone. It presupposes a little though not a lot of knowledge about Franklin. Likewise, if you know a tremendous amount about Franklin this book may not offer enough for you.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-14

His observations are as relevant in the early 21st century as they were one hundred years ago. <br /> <br />Clyde Griffiths is the hero and the anti-hero of the novel. Clyde grows up poor with parents who preach on the streets for a not very good living. He lives the American dream as he rises both economically and socially. He moves from the position of bellhop to factory manager through cunning, avarice, and hard work. He rises from social outcast to man about town using the same skills.  <br /> <br />Eventually he is forced to choose between two loves: his pregnant poor mistress and the wealthy small town social whom he dreams of as his wife. How he extricates himself from this situation causes his downfall and eventual ruin. <br /> <br />Through Griffiths rise and fall, and further fall, Dreiser weaves the themes of the importance of money and social class in America. His character has no moral compass, no conscience. Ultimately this leads to his annihilation. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to those who love American literature. It is not a book for the fainthearted. You need to dedicate yourself to this book when you read it. But your efforts will be rewarded by the gifts of an American masterpiece.   <br />	2004-10-09

Yes some of its mysteries could be deciphered early on; however, for me, that only contributed to the intrigue of the novel and not detract from it. <br /> <br />Two \\"digs\\" are ongoing in this book. The first is a traditional Egyptian archaelogical dig in the 1920's. Ralph Trilipush, an Oxford grad and Harvard professor, is conducting a dig on the site of an Egyptian King who had a sideline practice in  pornographic verse. Trilipush narrates his frustrating (and often quite humorous) efforts in his journal, his outline for his book, and a series of letters to his Boston based fiancee, an Opium addicted heiress whose father is financing the expedition.  <br />The other \\"dig\\" is conducted by Ferrell, an Australian detective searching for a client's bastard heir, who has landed in Boston on his journey and befriended Trilipush's fiancee. Ferell's adventures are recounted by him in a series of letter's to Trilipush's fiancee's nephew thirty years after the events.  <br />Neither narrator is reliable or truthful; yet both are highly readable and entertaining.  <br />Critics praised Phillips's writing style in his previous novel Prague. Here it is lower brow; yet he still has managed some beautifully wrought passages.  <br />An added bonus for the reader: Phillips recreates the world of 1920's Egypt from the vantage point of the priviliged British plunderers.  <br />I would highly recommend this book to lovers of good fiction everywhere.	2004-10-08

It was a wonderful surprise to find out that the daughter of Al Gore not only has a great sense of humor but can write.  <br /> <br />The plot resembles the standard plot of chick lit everywhere. There is our heroine in a glamorous job, in this case, a health care analyst on Capitol Hill. There is the dreamy Mr. Right who will turn into Mr. Terribly Wrong, in this case an aide to a rival Senator. And there is Mr. Terribly Wrong who may or may not be Mr. Right, in this case a Washington Post reporter.  <br /> <br />Gore enlivens the standard plot with some very real insights into life on Capitol Hill. She creates a very likeable, if a bit unrealistically neurotic, character who truly wants to make the world better. Her description of the character's reaction to the President of the United States, whom she does not like, was moving: she took it personally that someone unqualified would run the country.  <br /> <br />The plot does run all over the place: there are several health care bill detours, a Presidential race, an investigation into North Korean agents. In future outings, Gore may want to tighten up the journey of her heroine. However,she deserves many readers to \\"Sammy's Hill\\" because of her humor, her writing, and her sincere dedication to a moving heroine.	2004-10-08

However, you can enjoy this book without having read the Alcott version. <br /> <br />Meg (age 20), Jo (age 17) and Amy (age 15) Green are three lovely and accomplished young women who live on the upper West Side of New York in an enclave of liberal, educated privilege and wealth. Everyone wants to be the Green Family. Their father is a successful inventor, their mother is a beloved literature professor. Both parents set the highest ideals of family values for themselves and for their children. <br /> <br />Thus it comes as a great shock to the children when they find out that their mother has had an affair and their father has gotten over it. They can't. And so the children \\"divorce' their parents and move to New Haven where Meg is a junior at Yale.  <br /> <br />The book is at once idealistic and incredibly realistic. On one hand, it seems very difficult to believe that these children would endure such hardship for more than a few days because of their adherence to their principals. On the other hand, their life in New Haven-complete with gritty descriptions of the public high school, the homeless situation, the rundown apartment-ring true. The reader comes to care very much about these three sisters and their roommate Teddy, an orphaned Yale student who serves as a reality check to these children so willing to give up two living parents. <br /> <br />The book's \\"narrator\\" is Jo--with \\"reader's notes\\" from Amy and Meg. This device bothered some reviewers. I actually liked it and it made me think more about the art of novel writing. <br /> <br />Now if you have read \\"Little Women\\" (the Alcott version), you can enjoy this book on another level. The author basically riffs off certain elements of the earlier one. Some of her riffs are extended--Teddy, the roommate, is clearly a substitute for the beloved neighbor \\"Laurie\\" in the original. Some of her riffs are only one or two notes-but on perfect pitch such as Jo dealing with a Lesbian pass being made at her. In addition, the \\"readers' notes\\" from Meg and Amy may make more sense--Alcott based her characters on her sisters and Meg and Amy fared the worst in her version. <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly for lovers of good literature everywhere--even if you haven't read the original!	2004-10-04

Our narrator has managed to affect the carefree insouciance of the WASP moneyed elite even though he is a Jewish/Catholic scholarship student from Seattle. It's the fall of 1960, on the cusp of the election John F Kennedy, and our narrator's worlds-both big and small-are about to change.  <br /> <br />The heroes of our narrator and his schoolmates are the recent modern masters of literature of the time: Robert Frost, Fitzgerald, Ayn Rand, and most of all, Ernest Hemingway. Their more tangible heroes are their English teachers who serve as the conduits to these novelists. One teacher-Dean Makepeace-stands out as the greatest of the \\"masters\\" as he knew Hemingway in WWI.  <br /> <br />Throughout the year, a series of competitions are held which enables one student to spend quality time with a visiting writer (a group which includes, a bit unbelievably, Robert Frost and Ayn Rand). Each student gives his all in an essay to attract the attention of these greats. Our narrator tries and tries...until he eventually tries too hard.  <br /> <br />To say much more would ruin the plot. Suffice to note, the author raises large themes such as integrity, honesty, the meaning of heroes, and the authenticity of the written word in a mer 150 pages or so. He could perhaps do a better job of integrating all of the sub-plots; still he leaves the reader with much to think about for a long time.	2004-08-28

I found this entry darker and deeper than most and ultimately quite satisfying.  <br /> <br />In many ways, the book is a series of meditations on childhood. Not happy childhoods, of course (this is Martha Grimes)--but ones that are troubled, have undercurrents, or end suddenly and violently.  <br /> <br />The book opens with the murder of a five year old child. In the early part of the book, Jury links the murder to a home of pedophilia near the site. In an interesting twist, the alleged backer of the pedophiliac brothel has also lost his daughter through a suspected kidnapping several years before. Jury begins connecting the dots and his journey takes him to some seamy and sordid venues. In addition, Jury himself has recently lost his last relative, a cousin, who had challenged his memories of his sad, orphaned childhood in the near past.  <br /> <br />Jury's circle of eccentric friends--Melrose Plant, Aunt Agatha et al.--make all too brief appearances. The book is a bit too dark to have too much of their lighthearted banter.  <br /> <br />I definitely enjoyed this installment of the Jury series. At times, I felt Grimes could have linked the plots and the sub-plots better; however, overall, it is a very satisfying read.	2004-08-28

I have to admit: I enjoyed this book tremendously and I went back and reread favorite sections. However, I am a Jane Austen devotee and I am always interested in the opinion of others on  her various books.<br />And you get a number of opinions in \\"The Jane Austen Book Club.\\" Six Californians get together to read all six Austen novels. With five women and one semi-hunky man, complications are bound to ensue. And they do...though not necessarily in the way the reader might think originally. The six characters are all interesting and their stories are told in part. In many ways, it reminded me of being in a book club: you see one side of an individual, and not necessarily the side that the rest of the world sees. <br />I would recommend this book to Jane Austen fans. Fowler inserts all sorts of opinions on various texts. My favorite moment occurs when Fowler's book club members debate the sexuality of one of Austen's characters and wonder if Austen realized that she had created a gay character!<br />However, if you are not a Jane Austen fan or have not read much of her work, I believe that this would be a tough read.	2004-07-13

He preys on the weaker elements-in the form of dissolute young lords-as he climbs to greater heights in the social world. At the fringe of this social world, one also encounters people just trying to get by--the wife of a dead peer turning out hackneyed prose for example--as they cling to the appearances of respectability.<br />Trollope's description of this world in many ways evokes the Internet bubble of the late 1990's. You see the same types of behavior and meet the same types of characters in this world.<br />In this novel, Trollope has also created two very strong and memorable female characters. Hetta is the daughter of the &quot;lady turned writer&quot; and the sister of a very dissipated peer. Yet she somehow has a sterling character though less than sterling judgement in her suitors. Marie, the daughter of the shady financier Melmotte, is even more fascinating. At the start of the novel, she appears to be a weak little thing who is basically being auctioned off to the bidder with the most prestigious social credentials. However, after a disappointment in love, she finds the strength within herself to beat her father at his own game. Trollope develops characters so fully and with such depth that you feel as if they are living and breathing in front of you.<br />I would recommend this book to lovers of serious literature everywhere. Yes, at times the language is dated and there are some horrifying anti-Semitic passages. But the book is a fully realized portrait of a society that still has relevance to readers today.	2004-07-13

Her characters are always memorable, her writing style draws you in on the first page and the conclusion is very satisfying.<br />At the start of the book, the lovely Claire has been dumped by her husband for another woman a few hours after giving birth to their first child. She moves from their home in London back to her eccentric family in Dublin. Of course, all sorts of adventures, several romantic, ensue. <br />Keyes creates not only a strong, lively narrative voice--Claire is very funny, even her most desperate moments--but some great supporting characters. There is the hunky Adam, the snitty sister Helen, the flaky sister Anna, the slightly detached father and so on. Yes these characters hail from central casting but they are presented with a light and fresh touch.<br />I recommend this book to chick lit fans everywhere, particularly those who love their light lit with an English/Irish touch.	2004-07-13

She's living with her best friend who has a fabulous job yet she is just an assistant in a rundown hotel. She has a great boyfriend Luke who for some reason is just not cool enough for her. And she has a recreational drug habit which she thinks is no big deal...and her friends and family think is a big enough deal to send her away to a rehab in Ireland.<br />The novel chronicles Rachel's coming to terms with her drug problem--she is in deep denial at the beginning-and with the realities of her life. It is very, very funny in many parts. However, there are serious undertones. She thought that drugs would land her in the coolest circles in New York and not in a dingy rehab outside of Dublin.<br />I would recommend this book to chick lit fans everywhere--though they should note that this is chick lit with a serious message.	2004-07-12

Yes I too am a Bridget Jones junkie, like many of the other reviewers on this site. I too was disappointed in the book. It is not just that the character was not like Bridget Jones--but the plot, the pacing, the other characters, all seemed off. <br />HOWEVER, there are plenty of reasons to read this book on the beach this summer. Fielding creates a fun atmosphere as her heroine tries to become a &quot;Jane Bond&quot; and track down the man she believes is an Al Qaeda operative--and on whom she has a very big crush. Olivia dashes from Miami to LA to Egypt to just about everywhere in the world in a very short time and manages to meet everyone from gun wielding kidnappers to Brad Pitt. It's a wacky, fast paced read.	2004-06-26

The narrator, known simply as &quot;moi,&quot; is considered the &quot;champagne bubble girl of the moment.&quot; She and her best friend Julie Bergdorf, the perfect Park Avenue blonde, run around New York attending charity balls, restaurant openings, and high profile baby showers. They dress perfectly and eat nothing. They spend ample amounts of time with other perfect dressers and talk about clothes, the food they don't eat, and men.<br />While I liked this book and found the numerous anecdotes about Manhattan amusing, I was disappointed that the characters never grew. Perhaps that was point. <br />However, I would still recommend to lovers of chick lit everywhere (and those who read W and Vogue and Harpers) as the book goes into tremendous depth about a very shallow world. It is fun--and it is also a fast read.	2004-05-16

It's Good Friday, sometime in the 1990's, at Princeton University. All sorts of Princetonian traditions and rites--a nude runaround, the Ivy Ball, Easter services--are about to take place. In the midst of all this mayhem and partying, one student, Paul, with the help of his three roommates, is working on cracking the code to the Hypnerotomachia, a medieval text, for his thesis due the next day. And then someone involved in helping Paul turns up dead. <BR> The narrator, Tom, is Paul's roommate and the one closest to him on this project. However Tom's father was a scholar also involved in the Hypnerotomachia and it ended up killing him. Tom is torn between giving into the obsession of the text or maintaining his relationship with his girlfriend Katie. <BR>The book moves so fast in the first half that you're exhausted. One minute Tom is watching the sophomores run around naked; the next minute he is in the library helping Paul; then he is trying to reach his girlfriend;then someone shows up dead.<BR>The second half moves slower and is not nearly as good. However, you're still hooked. <BR>I would recommend this book not only to lovers of The Da Vinci Code (it's different but you've still got codes involved) and The Secrety History, but also to those interested in &quot;coming of age&quot; stories and F. Scott Fitzgerald's tales of Princeton. <br />This book mixes several genres--thriller, mystery, coming of age, tales of excess--not always successfully. However, it is still vastly entertaining and a very good read.	2004-05-16

She realizes that her training in politics can do little to help her survive the very political world of Hollywood. One minute she's ordering srippers (with small nipples please) for her boss's boss; the next minute she's running across the street to get coffee.<br />However, this book is more than just an entertaining read and a glimpse into the world of &quot;Cameron D.&quot; and Jen (who is married to Brad). Lizzie struggles to hold on to her integrity and to her sense of self throughout her attempt to climb Hollywood. To her surprise, she finds out she actually enjoys a lot of the work and decides that she too wants to produce. In addition, she feels tremendous sympathy for many of the character, and while she skewers them at times, she also notes their positive attributes.<br />I would recommend this book to fans of chick lit everywhere and to those who want an inside look at Hollywood...from the bottom of the ladder!	2004-05-16

Several nations-Britain, US, and France- had gained special status through a series of treaties and thus were allowed to conduct business as if the city were their own. And there were plenty of businesses to conduct--from the importing of opium to the exporting of tea and other goods. Each colonial group lived in its own area complete with its own customs and social hierarchies.<br />Likewise, with the increased affluence of the city, a wealthy Chinese class also emerged, though once again it tended to live and socialize only within its own boundaries. <br />With so many people making so much money and so few (legal) rules to follow, Shanghai eventually became a swinging city of sin. By the 1920's, the city became synonmous with sex, opium, jazz, brothels, and pleasure in just about any form. As Dong notes, while the sinners broke all legal rules, they still followed the social stratification of the city: the british patronized British brothels, the Chinese went to Chinese brothels and so on. <br />Of course, with the invasion by Japan and then the fall to the Communists, the good times  ended in Shanghai and most of the colonials left. I felt that Dong could have kept the reader more abreast of Chinese history in the earlier parts of the book to make the latter events (e.g., why the country was so open to communism when a city like Shanghai was not) more understandable. In addition, she introduces certain colorful Shanghai characaters-the writer Emily Hahn for instance-and then loses them. <BR>However, this book is a good, workmanlike introduction to a very interesting city in a very interesting time. I would recommend it to those readers looking for a general overview of the history of the city. If you want more depth, you may want to read this book in conjunction with more rigorous studies or simply look elsewhere.	2004-02-25

It provides a personal account of the Cultural Revolution in China that is both horrifying and inspirational.<br />Nien Cheng had lived a privileged life in Shanghai. The widow of the former General Manager of Shell, she too had worked there after his death until they left the mainland in the mid 1960's.<br />Soon after, she became a target of harassment for the authorities. She was brought in for questioning, her home was ransacked, she was under observation. Then she was put into solitary detention for six and a half years. Her description of her time in prison and of her ability to stand up to the authorities again and again is amazing.<br />This book put a human face on the cultural war and on suffering its citizens went through at this time. She almost dies several times in the book; the reader feels as if he or she is dying along with her.<br />I would recommend this book to those individuals who enjoy memoirs and historical biographies. You certainly feel as if you are a personal witness to history through Cheng's eyes.	2004-02-21

Alexander delves into the facts and the myths of the famous &quot;mutiny on the bounty.&quot; <BR>For those not familiar with the story: in the 1790's a british ship, captained by a William Bligh, was seized by its crew led by a Fletcher Christian. Bligh and some crew numbers were cast overboard in a small craft in the middle of the South Seas, basically left to die. Amazingly, they survived and made it to mainland. Christian and company returned to the paradise of Tahiti. Some crew members stayed there (and were eventually captured and brought back to England for court martial) while Christian and company (with the addition of some beautiful Tahitian women)sailed on to Pitcairn Island.<BR> History and Hollywood have embellished the story: Bligh was pure evil, Christian pure nobility. The crew wanted to return to Tahiti where they had found true love.<BR>Alexander debunks most myths. Bligh certainly was tough; however, no more so than most captains of his era. Christian was impetuous, likely borderline mad, and had been drinking heavily the night before the mutiny. Most interesting, Christian's family--and that of a fellow mutineer and Christian relative Peter Heywood-spent a tremendous amount of time and resources in the future decades defending their relatives' reputations and reshaping the story into the present day myth. (They were then helped by Hollywood.)<BR>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Alexander captured the tension of the mutiny and subsequent court martials brilliantly. I feel (like other reviewers) that she had a bit of bias towards Bligh (thus the four stars) and I almost wish she had just written it from his perspective.<BR>Still I would recommend this book to those who love historical stories, seafaring books (e.g., &quot;Master and Commander&quot;) and just plain old good yarns.	2004-02-15

At the onset of this time, Britain ruled the world, the Czar ran Russia, and the US was just an up and comer. At the end of this period, Britain's imperial ambitions were waning, Russia was now the Soviet Union, and the US had demonstrated its power through its presence in WW I.<br />Through the careful research and well thought-out text, the reader can see how the modern day nations of Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey were formed. You can see also see how their modern day troubles were created. It's all here: the beginning of Jewish-Arab troubles in Palestine, the shaky start to Iraq, the careless partioning of Lebanon and so on. <br />Many thing impressed me about this book but perhaps none more than the role that bad intelligence played in the formation of Britain's foreign policy. I know: it's unbelievably relevant in the world of 2004 also! However, Britain made a number of decisions throughout World WAr I and after based on information and analyses that were simply untrue. While much has changed since then in terms of the transmitting of information, still the problems of the gathering of critical intelligence one-to-one remains. <br />I would recommend this book to just about anyone who cares (or who should care) about Middle East politics. Before you voice your next opinion on American intervention in Iraq, you might want to read this book to sharpen your insights and arguments.	2004-02-08

When she died, at the turn of the last century, she left him with a lot of money and three attractive, willful daughters. <br />These three daughters-Irene, Cimmie and Baba-never did that much in their own rights (they were no Mitford sisters) but they did circulate in very interesting crowds. IN addition, their wealth gave them a tremendous sense of independence and ability to pursue their interests.<br />Irene, the eldest, never married. Her life was filled with men, foxes, and drink (not necessarily in that order). Cimmie, the middle, married the British fascist Oswald Mosley. She was deeply devoted to him and his causes-campaigning in her furs for fascism, for socialism, for whatever cause captured him-despite his many infidelities. She, like her mother, died young while her husband was embroiled in an affair with the beautiful Diana Mitford Guinness. Her two surviving sisters took her death as an excuse to wage out all war against Diana Mitford and her family. (Mitford did eventually marry Mosley.) <BR>Irene basically raised Cimmie's children. And Baba, the youngest, well she took her place in Cimmie's bed with Mosley despite her own marriage to the Duke of Windsor's best friend. <br />Much of the charm of the book lies in seeing certain historical figues-the Duke of Windsor, Wallis Simpson, Mosley-through the eyes of these sisters. These women certainly had interesting if not overly consequential lives.<br />I would recommend this book to Anglophiles, to lovers of social history, and to fans of the interwar period (if you liked the movie Gosford Park, you'll love this book). If you're looking for a serious examination of the time and the history, well look elsewhere. But if you want an interesting read that will give you a \\"feel\\" for the times-then \\"The Viceroy's Daughters\\" is your book.	2004-02-08

His final gift to her is a series of notes to be opened at the beginning of each month. Each note contains one suggestion to help Holly move on with her life. And each note is signed &quot;PS, I love you.&quot; <br />The book is quite moving as it depicts Holly's struggle to follow her husband's suggestions-give away his clothes, take a trip with her friends-and continue living. She realizes that her life had centered almost completely on her husband--not necessarily a good thing-and now, for the first time, she has to create a life for herself. <br />My only complaint with the book is that I found the writing amateurish at times. The plot, the characters and the ending were all satisfying and fully developed. However, I winced at some of the writing.<br />Still I would recommend this book to chick lit lovers everywhere.	2004-01-31

Yet it leaves you thinking about some very serious issues-apartheid, familial love, redemption-for a long time.<BR>David Lurie is the quintessential anti-hero. A 52-year old twice divorced professor in post-apartheid Cape Town, he exists instead of really lives. His job is at a dead-end (he is a Romantic Poets scholar who is teaching communications) and his so-called satisfying sexual relationship with a black prostitute recently has ended. Out of boredom or self-loathing, he seduces a student and ends up being booted from the University.<BR>He escapes the city to his daughter's smallhold in rural South Africa. His daughter represents much of what he would loathe in the world-she's overweight, very earthy, gay. But he loves her so much. And  it is this love for her that redeems him in the reader's eyes. After an afternoon of unimaginable violence, he goes to great lengths - and unsuccessful ones-to protect his daughter. <BR>I would recommend \\"Disgrace\\" to those who gravitate towards serious-themed (particularly racial) books.

At the start of the book, Colt describes taking his young family to the house for what may be the last summer. Alas, the extended family can no longer afford to keep the home and it must be sold.<br />The house has served as a center of gravity for this family, a place which pulls them back each summer to live out graceful and simple Boston Brahim traditions. The house also serves as a metaphor for the fading fortunes of this once wealthy, once socially prominent family whose entire caste-the Brahmins of Boston--has become irrelevant. <br />Through the prism of the house and its meaning to his family, Colt also delves into his family's history of mental illness, of marriages that become estranged, of boys that start out as golden children and end up tarnished old men. <br />He also recounts his own story. He began his adult life as a young Brahmin with disdain for his heritage. Now in mid-life and a New Yorker, he is deeply proud of the many traits (e.g., thrift, reverence for family) bred deep in his bones. <br />I would recommend this book to those who gravitate towards serious memoirs and thoughtful accounts of profound issues (e.g., meaning of family). It is a beautiful read.	2003-12-30

I thought that I knew everything about both men.<br />Well, I didn't. It's not that Jon Meacham provides that much new material in this book--though there are some new letters and previously unreleased documents-it's that he molds what has been out there into a fascinating study of the personalities of the two men. I may not have learned new facts about these men but I gained greater insight into not only their friendship but also their marriages, their characters, and their lives from this study. Both men became more fully realized, more human, more alive in this book.<br />&quot;Franklin and Winston&quot; follows a simple, chronological structure. It begins with a phone call from Roosevelt to Churchill (who was not yet Prime Minister) at the onset of WW II in Europe; it ends for the most part with the death of Roosevelt and Churchill's inability to attend his funeral. In between, yes, you see all the major events of WW II on the European front. But you also see a Churchill trying to woo Roosevelt-and through his efforts, the neediness in his personality, the boy trying to please. You also realize the tremendous feeling that Churchill had for his American forebearers (his mother was American) and the sincere emotion that he was capable of even at the most difficult of times. With Roosevelt, you see the caginess of his personality, the boy who was the center of his parents' universe and now really was the center of the world. You see in greater depth the feeling that he did have for his wife Eleanor, even though he was spending time in his last days with his former love Lucy Rutherford. You see his ability to charm Churchill--and then turn off the charm. You're never quite sure if he really loved Churchill or not-and then you realize he may not have been sure either.<br />I would recommend this book to those who enjoy history books and biographies, particularly of the WW II vintage. It is not the best place to begin a study of WW II or either man--the book presupposes a certain amount of knowledge. However, it is an excellent place to continue your studies.	2003-12-20

It is just so good...<BR>Cassandra, the 17-year old heroine, lives with her well-born family in near poverty in a castle in England. Her father, a true English eccentric, once wrote a bestseller--but that was a long time ago. Her sister, Rose, is a beauty with ambition--to marry well. Her stepmother Topaz, a kindhearted and beautiful soul, trudges into London to pose nude for artists and bring income into this colorful crew.<br />Cassandra dreams of becoming a writer. When two rich American brothers and their mother move in next door, well she believes that she has found her heroes and her story. And so indeed a story, actually several stories unfold into wonderful tales of adventure and romance in 1930's England. You see the world of well-born bohemians, subtle class snobberies, interwar London and lots of romance through the eyes of the young Cassandra. You also see-and feel-Cassandra maturing and growing into a woman through her experiences.<br />I would recommend this book highly to individuals (most likely women) who enjoy coming-of-age stories, romances, and English life tales in the interwar period. A warning: this book is very well-written, but well-written through the eyes of a 17-year old. That may not be your taste--other reviewers have found it a young person's book. Yes it is--but you don't have to be young in years to enjoy it.	2003-12-17

Robert Harris has perhaps achieved the impossible: he has turned a civil engineer into a sexy, swashbuckling hero. For that reason alone, he deserves four stars.<br />Marcus Attilius, is the new \\"Aquarius\\", the engineer in charge of the aqueducts, in the Bay of Naples circa AD 79. He comes from a family of honest engineers who have helped make the Aqueducts of the Roman Empire, the engineering marvel of their times. The description of these aqueducts and their structures is actually fascinating.<br />However, Attilius has a lot more to think about than how to build the next aqueduct. His predecessor mysteriously disappeared, he has had a run-in with the former slave who now runs Pompeii in the manner of Tony Soprano, he has fallen in love with this individual's daughter, and the water in many places has slowed to a drip. And we're not even getting into the fact that Vesuvius will erupt in a day or two.<br />Harris writes a thriller that is both fast-paced (Attilius traveling all over the area in a matter of hours) and SLOW-paced (to his credit, he makes you feel the excruciating pain as the lava dried second by second by second on individuals). He mixes true historic figures-Pliny the Elder, the Admiral/Poet, who wrote about Pompeii before he too was killed in the disaster-and fictional characters. <br />I would recommend this book to those who enjoy the historical thriller genre and don't demand too much (e.g., fully developed characters). It's a great read.	2003-12-07

The lease needs to be renewed and all three Dupayne children must sign it. One, the psychiatrist brother Dr. Neville Dupayne, does not want the museum to continue. He believes in living in the present and not the past. <br />Well, no surprise, he doesn't get to live in the future. Early in the novel, he shows up dead in his jaguar. Enter James's hero, Detective Adam Dalgliesh, the poet/murder investigator. As always he (and James) tries to solve the murder by digging into the souls of the suspects.<br />And what a cast of suspects...the two remaining Dupayne children include Marcus, a cold civil servant whose career didn't reach expected heights, and Caroline, the sister whose passion is the museum and the swishy boarding school that she leads in her spare time. There is TAlly, the kindhearted housekeeper, whose life of intellectual curiosity in the city of London (visiting museums, taking courses), is supported by her job and her free cottage on the museum's property. Plus Muriel Godby, the efficient and annoying, receptionist/administrator who lives for the museum. <br />Dalgliesh is obsessed by this mystery-as he has been by all in the past-though he is now juggling a love interest. I wish James had delved into this more in the book: she seemed to &quot;tack on&quot; a scene between the two of them as a satisfying way to end the book.<br />However, fans of the mystery genre should savor this book.	2003-12-07

Somehow if I sit down to read, I want to sink into a story that will last several hundred pages not ten.<br />\\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" proved to be a wonderful exception to my rule. Nine stories comprise this collection. Each story can be read and discussed on its own merits or the collection can be viewed and analyzed as a whole.<br />Several themes run through most stories: the traditions of the Indian heritage set against New England, the different mutations of marriage or partnership and the love for one's country either old or new and adopted.<br />My favorite stories included:<BR>\\"A Temporary Matter\\"--in which a young Indian couple in Boston, forced to live without lights for a week, plays a cruel \\"truth or dare\\" game with each other which effectively ends their marriage<br />\\"Sexy\\"--in which a young Midwestern, American woman who has moved to Boston becomes involved with a married Indian investment banker who finds her \\"sexy\\"<br />\\"This Blessed House\\"--in which a young, newly married, well-educated Indian American couple adjust to marriage in their new home which has a hidden trove of Christian memorabilia. Though they did date prior to their nuptial ceremony, their marriage was effectively an \\"arranged\\" partnership by their parents<br />\\"The Third and Final Continent\\"--so beautiful, a young Indian man who has emigrated to Boston lives with a 103-year old landlady who can't believe a man has just landed on the moon (it's 1969)<br />By the end of the book, you have a sense of traditions and sensibilities that comprise Indian culture. I know now the importance of fresh fish, the fact that an arranged marriage probably has as much chance of working-or not-as a non-arranged one, the emphasis on higher education at prestigious schools, the fact that married women of a certain caste paint the part in their hair with vermillion. <br />I would recommend this book to those who enjoy short story collections, who like modern fiction and female writers, who seek out books which focus on different cultures. I also would encourage all lovers of good literature-whether or not you are usually indifferent to short story collections--that this is a wonderful BOOK not just nine stories next to each other.	2003-12-06

Not shock in a titilliating, revolving bedrooms way. Though Mosley does leave her devoted husband in her early 20's for a serial womanizer who cheats on her until his death nearly fifty years later, sex plays a minor role in this book. Mosley, after her youthful adultery, remained a one-man woman for the rest of her years. No, the shocking part lies in the lifelong devotion, actually obsession bordering on psychotic, for her lover and then husband, Oswald Mosley and his cause (British fascism). And this obsession led her to embrace both Nazism and a friendship with Adolf Hitler, both of which she defended until her death.<br />Diana Mosley was one of the fabled Mitford sisters, born to a minor, eccentric aristocrat and his equally well-born wife. Blessed with a perfect \\"face\\" and considered the beauty of her generation, she married early and well at the age of 18 to an heir to the Guinness fortune. She had two boys almost immediately and became a popular London society hostess of the early 1930's. At some point her path crossed Oswald Mosley's, the heir to a British baronetcy and the founder and leader of the British Fascist Movement, and that was that. Even though Mosley was married (happily too despite the infidelities) and had said he would never leave his wife, Diana left Guinness, his fortune and the good opinion of many including her family.<br />Soon after, Mosley's wife died and her family hated Diana for the rest of their mutually long lives (Diana died in august '03, Mosley's last sister-in-law in '95.)<br />Mosley then launched an affair with one of his sisters-in-law while simultaneously romancing Diana. Diana, perhaps to impress Mosley in the beginning, traveled to Germany on many occassions, attended Nuremberg rallies, and befriended Hitler. Her sister Unity Mitford, usually considered the \\"Mitford\\" sister most associated with Hitler, was obsessed with the fuhrer in a stalking, almost pathetic way. Diana, cooler, better looking, and far saner, enjoyed talking politics with him (eventually she did negotiate on behalf of the British fascists for a radio wave). Hitler reciprocated the friendship by arranging for her to marry Mosley in secret in Goebbels living room. He attended.<br />Well, she paid dearly for this friendship and her love for Mosley-she and MOsley were imprisoned during most of WWII, they were snubbed by many for years, they eventually lived out of the country-yet she never recanted her love for one and friendship for the other. Not after the reveleations of the Holocaust, not after her husband's numerous infidelities.<br />De Courcy does an excellent job of describing all aspects of Diana Mosley's life: not just her politics but her lifestyle, her intelligence, her reading, her friendships, her family. De Courcy admits in the beginning that she loved MOsley but saw her flaws...and she is critical, though at times could have been harder.<br />Perhaps the most damning section of the book: de Courcy inserts Diana Mosley's exchange with a Prison Advisory committee during her imprisonment. In it, she cooly responds to questions about her friendship with HItler, her dislike of Jews, her criticisms of her cousin Winston Churchill, her belief in fascism. The book ends with this chilling transcript--a fitting endnote to her life.hetic way.

He does not play a major role in this book nor does it seem in their lives.) <br />These women lived, for the most part, amazing (though not admirable in all cases) lives: Nancy, the oldest, became a best selling novelist; Pamela, the \\"least interesting\\" (to the biographer and her family, though not necessarily the reader), lived a country life after a marriage to a brilliant man who married compulsively (six total); Diana, the society beauty, who left her husband for the fascist Oswald Mosley and who befriended Hitler; Unity, who became obsessed with Hitler and met him 140 times during a short period before WWII; Jessica, the rebel, who eloped at 18, became a communist, moved to the states, and became a best selling author on such topis as the funeral home industry; and Deborah, the youngest, who made the most brilliant marriage, to the future Duke of Devonshire. <br />This book details the eccentric but loving childhood of these sisters (though the father had murderous rages that seemed to have a lifelong impact on the children) and the diverse set of political causes and men that both brought them together and drove them apart over the years. Any book that affords the reader glimpses of Churchill as an uncle, Hitler as a \\"friend\\", Maya Angelou as an honorary \\"sister\\", is worth its price. Lovell presents her material in a straightforward manner. The book is thoroughly researched.<br />However, there are flaws. Lovell could probe further than she does into the psyches of the sisters. Three of them became obsessed with men in ways that bordered on the unhealthy and bizarre (Nancy had a lifelong infatuation for a count that would never marry her, the beautiful Diana dedicated her life to the unfaithful Mosley, and Unity's fixation on Hitlerwas downright psychotic.) And she lets Diana off the hook a bit too easily for her fascist and pro-Hitler views (Diana never repented.) She seems somewhat bewitched by Diana's external beauty-she met her at the age of 90--and doesn't focuse on the fact that it was external. (As obituary writers did this past summer after her death in August.) <BR>Still it is a great read particularly for those fascinated by the British upper classes between the two wars.	2003-11-28

It is also a portrait of a single, beautiful, no longer so young (29-it is the turn of the century woman) struggling to survive in this society. This book will break your heart.<BR>Lily Bart is nearly penniless, not an unusual condition for the heroine of a novel. However, in her case, she does not exist in the lower classes and is not struggling to make her way to the top. Instead, she has been born at the top and she lives in a world where breeding, beauty and money (preferably of an older vintage) matter the most. Bart possesses the first two attributes and she is using them to gain the third. <BR>Bart's only hope for survival in the world of Old New York society is to make an advantageous marriage and in her case it has to be to someone wealthy. The book details the various compromises she can make--basically, the coarser the person, the higher a price he is willing to pay for her breeding. <BR>Several themes run through this book: money, of course, and the various forms it takes in &quot;society&quot; (e.g., old money, new money, newer money); class (the book has many anti-semitic references to a wealthy individual who is Jewish--and who is willing to pay a high price for Lily initially); integrity (which basically belongs to those of such older families as Lily's); and finally, true love, which comes in the form of Selden, a young, poor but well bred New Yorker, whom Lily loves in spite of herself. <BR>Wharton depicts Lily's downward course in the world. In many ways, Wharton's heroine travels in the opposite direction of characters in books like Dreiser's: a dreiser character might begin in poverty, sacrifice her virtue and integrity, and rise up in the world. In Lily's case, the more she holds on to her integrity, the harder she falls in the world.<br />I would recommend this book to those who like 19th and early 20th century American and British fiction. IN addition, those individuals who enjoy women's books from all eras should appreciate &quot;The House of Mirth.&quot;	2003-11-21

From this vantage point, you view the different personalities and events of the War. <br />I have read many books on WW II; yet I learned many new things from this book. FDR's manipulative and controlling managerial style truly came through as you see different individuals trying to push their &quot;German plans&quot; through the political machinations of the administration. Stalin's brilliance and cruelty come through in the descriptions of his reaction to various plans. As other reviewers have noted, this book focuses a great deal of its attention on Henry Morgenthau, the Secretary of the Treasury, whose lapsed faith in Jewish traditions was restored by the horrors of the Holocaust. <br /> I would have given the book 5 stars; however, I felt that Beschloss could have discussed the Marshall plan and its impact on post War Germany in greater details.<BR> Still I would recommend &quot;The Conquerors&quot; to history and WW II buffs. Most likely, you will learn something new.	2003-11-19
US	52189073	RTIXOV0CPFPMV	0140088911	394767391	Money	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Brilliant Narrative Voice, "High Speed" Pace	\\"Money\\" mesmerized me. With his character John Self, Martin Amis has created one of the most memorable narrative voices ever in literature. While the content differs radically, I would compare the power of the narrative voice to that of \\"David Copperfield\\" or \\"Moby Dick.\\" You live the book as well as read it. <br />John Self, an English director of commercials, is embarking on a career in the movies. The time is 1981. Self compulsively pursues several simple needs: the need for sex (in a number of different forms), alcohol, drugs at times, companionship, and most of all, money. In these pursuits, he ricochets back and forth from london to New York, from the uptown NYC to downtown, east side to west side and so on. This book is not about the \\"High Life\\"--rather about how a lot of money can buy you the \\"low life.\\" <BR>Through Self's inebriated or hungover eyes, you see a lot of interesting characters. All have one thing in common: money. His \\"girlfriend\\" in London, Selina, cuckolds him for a wealthier man.His \\"alter ego\\" Martin Amis will write for him but for a price. His New York friend, Martina Twain,is married to a wealthy man. <BR>Amis wrote this in book in the early 1980's. He accomplished an amazing feat: he showed how the sexual and drug excesses of the 60's and 70's morphed into the materialistic excesses of the 1980's. And he did this at the start of the decade-not the end of it.<BR>Oh there are a few dated moments-but they only add flavor to the book. In the midst of Self's pursuit of hedonistic pleasure, he contrasts his \\"evil\\" with the purity of the royal wedding of Charles and Diana, which took place in July, 1981.  It's worth a few laughs.<BR>I can't say enough about the power of the narrative voice. You feel drunk. You feel hungover. You feel as if you're in the apartment of the seedy movie star who tapes her sexual encounters. It's quite a tour de force.<BR>I would recommend this book to those who like modern literature,particularly of an English provenance. One note:this book is raw and coarse. It is not for the easily offended. But if you can handle the language and situations, you're in for an amazing ride.	2003-11-18

Throughout he has insights (e.g., the clash is not between civilizations but within them, the US, in the case of Al Qaeda has waged war not on a country as is traditional, but a group) that every reader should take and debate with others. <br />His essay at the end contains his musings and his analyses of the current situation in the mid-east. Such analyses as that of the 9/11 hijackers-he lumps them into two groups, the &quot;thinkers&quot; and the &quot;muscle men&quot;-makes you realize that you are reading the first &quot;history&quot; of 9/11 and not just a lengthy newspaper column.<br />I would recommend this book highly to just about anyone who can read (and in my reviews I usually am very particular about recommending books to certain groups). It is a great read-and a great book.	2003-11-16

I have loved such diverse books with this theme as &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, &quot;A Wrinkle in Time,&quot; and &quot;Time and Again.&quot;<br />I was not disappointed by &quot;The Time Traveler's Wife.&quot; The book both moved me and challenged me to think about a number of deeper issues in life (most notably, the true meaning of love in a romantic relationship).<br />The underlying story concerns Henry, a librarian at the Newberry Library in Chicago, and Clare, his artist wife. Henry suffers from CDP (Chrono-Displacement Order) which whisks him from the present to another point of time (usually the past). One minute he may be in the stacks of the Newberry Library in 2003, the next minute he may find himself in a field (probably naked) in Michigan with his future wife as a child sometime in the early 1980's.<br />The author does an excellent job of sequencing the book. Even though Henry is shuttling back and forth in every chapter, she manages to move the plot forward. You do feel that you see Henry and Clare meeting, falling in love, starting a marriage and going through the stages of their lives. You do get to know their family and friends and see life happen to them.<br />However, I do feel that the author could have better developed all of her characters, particularly the supporting ones. I wanted to learn more about their close friends, Gomez and Charisse, and their troubled marriage. I felt that the landlady from Henry's child-whom he constantly visited in his time-traveling modes-was a sketch figure that could have been better developed. I wished that the author could have mined deeper into the inner feelings of Henry and Clare.<br />Still I would highly recommend this book to most readers. (If time-travel books bother you, this won't change your opinion.) It is a good, hard-to-put down read. And at the end, you're exhausted by all the travel!	2003-11-16

The couple live on the fringes of fashionable society, a world that they both care for deeply despite their unorthodox behavior. One woman, Anna, has recently taken on a wealthy lover to support their luxurious lifestle. The other, Claire, has recently become infatuated with a young woman (perhaps in retaliation for Anna taking a lover) and wants Anna to help her in her assignation. Meanwhile, both women delight in abusing their parlor maid, Catherine, whose name or nationality they never bother to remember.<br />Mamet's play sparkles because of its tart, crisp dialogue and brisk pacing. These women delight in tortuting each other, their lovers, their friends, and of course, their maid. Mamet neatly delineates the tremendous importance of class structure at this time: the women's snobbishness towards their immigrant help is absolutely appalling. Both women clearly crave acceptance by good society while at the same time flouting its rules. <br />I would recommend &quot;Boston Marriage&quot; to those who enjoy Mamet, female-driven books and theater, and modern plays.	2003-11-16

Instead of her usual cast of characters in England, she focuses on the vicious world of publishing in New York. <BR>The plot: a top NY publishing firm is dying-literally-to sign hot writer Paul Giverny. Giverny has one condition-the firm must give him their top literary editor and they must get rid of one of their finest, though not best selling, writers, Ned Isaly. Giverny simply wants to see how far the firm will go to get him-he has no grudge against Isaly. Nor does he want him killed. But the firm takes their job seriously and hires two of the most memorable hit men in history-two individuals who like to get to know their target, his world, and their employers before they make their hit. Grimes' caricatures of these two rivals &quot;The Sopranos&quot; for dark humor in the world of the mafia.<BR>The plot is an excuse to satirize the NY publishing world, its cast of characters, its watering holes, its evil. The book is basically a series of very funny scenes as the cast of characters live their lives with one of them a target for murder. When Isaly goes to Pittsburgh to discover his roots, everyone (hit men, Giverny, publisher, friends) follow him. And they are all lost away from New York.<BR>I would recommend this book to book lovers-it is an interesting look behind the scenes of the industry. I would caution mystery lovers-this is basically a satire and not a typical Grimes mystery. But it is a lot of fun.	2003-08-27

And he does this all at the same time. His victims include Fiona, a hardworking merchant banker; Natalie, a sharp journalist; Zillah, the mother of his two children and the only one who is totally on to him (and also his legal wife); and most memorably, Minty, an obsessive compulsive woman who works in a dry cleaning store. Various other sharply drawn characters surround the main ones including Fiona's married neighbors, an anorexic man and his obese wife.<br />The book focuses on the disappearance-and reappearance-of Jock and his subsequent murder. In many ways, despite his ne'er to do ways, he seems the most stable individual in the entire book. Much of \\"Adam and Eve and Pinch Me\\" is spent on the impact of his behavior on those around him and the choices these individuals are forced to make (Zillah, for instance, enters into a bigamous marriage with a gay politician to support her children.)<br />I recommend this book for those individuals who are fans of Rendell's and the English mystery genre. I caution readers that this is not your typical \\"Who dunnit?\\"--in many ways it is a \\"Why did he or she do it and who else could have?\\"	2003-08-10

Once a rising star, he has somehow never fulfilled his early promise in academia. However, he has fulfilled as his promise as a roue. <BR>The book begins with Jacob being informed that a committee is examining sexual harassments allegations against him. The time is the late 80's when sexual harassment is just started being taken seriously.<BR>The book then reviews Jacob's conquests (through his eyes) over the years: a beautiful PhD anthropology candidate who becomes his embittered wife (and later ex-wife), an anorexic student, a rising professor (who later becomes the Dean investigating the complaints against him), a poor little rich girl and so on. From Jacob's vantage point, all of these encounters were mutual, even though he was the one with power. Plus, in those days, no one had ever heard of sexual harassment.<BR>Bernays does an excellent job of coloring her story with grey shades. She shows how such a situation is not necessarily black or white: yet that is exactly how it is (or was) portrayed in the late 1980's. She also does an outstanding job of portraying the vicious vipers that exist in university settings.<BR>However, the book is dated. Anita Hill, Bill Clinton et al. had yet to happen-in some books, this would not matter. But this book is so tied to the times that it does make a difference.<BR>I would recommend this book to those individuals who want a well written fictional account of the atmosphere surrounding sexual harassment in the late 1980's. In addition, Bernays' book was a roman a clef about Harvard at the time: some people may want to spot their favorite (or least) professor and students.	2003-08-07

She has a secret assignment, which is to find out who is sending racial slur messages to the one black student. The school is filled with a cast of colorful characters: a way too preppy good boy/bad boy student, the Russian wife of the headmaster, an intense guru like professor and so on. The plot thickens when someone shows up dead in the school's annual bonfire. <BR>I always enjoy these books. However, I have found-particularly in this one-Hall throws out a lot of cliches. She does not offer much depth in her characters or in her story. For example, most private schools in New England today (even second and third tier ones) have more than one black student (many whose parents pay) as well as a number of Asian, Hispanic and other ethnic and religious minorities. Her depiction of Aleford,the boarding school, does not ring true in the early 00's. In addition, she loves to poke fun at the down-to-earth, Yankee frugality and sensibilities of her neighbors. Yes, her observations were true about 25 years ago. However, most New England towns are filled with a more diverse and sophisticated population in the early 00's than in her books. Finally, while she seems ever so concerned about political correctness throughout the novel vis a vis ethnic and religious minorities, she is beyond condescending to the blue collar female police officer. At the end of the book, Faith offers to help her with her makeup. Please, talk about noblesse oblige. <BR>Still, this book is an enjoyable read. Plus, you get some very good recipes at the end. <BR>I'd recommend this book to those who enjoy cozy mysteries and previous Page books. I wouldn't recommend this book to those who require too much depth in their mysteries (a la Elizabeth George) or books.	2003-08-07

He enlists the help of the Allcourt-James' and their promise to travel to Guernsey.<BR>The murder victim is Guy Brouard, a wealthy hotelier, who escaped the Nazis as a child. He lived with his sister Ruth in a mansion on Guernsey. His life was--and the book is--filled with an assortment of wives, mistresses, children, hangers-on, local friends. Plenty of evidence points to China: however, she is the only one who has no motive.<BR>George's book explores human relationships and dynamics in a way unknown to most mystery authors. The passionate yet challenging marriage of Simon and Deborah--with her numerous insecurities (she can't bear children due to an abortion, her father is his servant)and his embarassment over his crippled legs--is explored in depth. The loyalty that Ruth, the murder victim's sister, feels to her brother-despite her knowledge of his weaknesses--is woven masterfully throughout the book. Several other family relationships are also presented and worked through in the pages. <BR>Of course the mystery itself is great: plenty of twists and turns, a Nazi or two from the past, lots of atmosphere. <BR>I would recommend this book to fans of the mystery genre ( particularly English mystery), fans of Elizabeth George (she's back in form-I, Richard was a disappointment), fans of \\"english books\\" (A Place of Hidingis more than just a mystery). I would caution die hard George groupies-her two main characers, Barbara Havers and her partner, the aristocratic and dashing Inspector Thomas Lynley, are not featured in this book. (Lynley makes one or two perfunctory appearances but that's it.) Don't let that stop you-the book is still wonderful without them.	2003-08-06

From the words printed on the cover \\"On July 24, 1984, a woman and her infant daughter were murdered by two brothers...,\\" you have a difficult time putting it down. <br />Krakauer explains in the opening pages of the book his fascination with pushing the extremes-as in his earlier book on why a few mountain climbers out of millions of casual climbers push themselves to climb Everest, and in this book how a few individuals pushed the outer limits of the fundamentalist fringe of a mainstream religion and commit murder. <br />The book tells of the 1984 murders of Brenda Lafferty, a young mainstream Momrnon wife, and her baby daughter. They were killed by two of Brenda's brothers-in-law, excommunicated Mormons who had even been thrown out of their fringe fundamentalist Mormon group. The brothers, Ron and Dan, believed that God had revealed to them that they must kill Brenda, who had opposed them in their efforts to recruit her husband to their extreme views. (There were also several other people on their list who escaped by virtue of not being home or the brothers taking the wrong turn.)<br />The book intends to show how their beliefs morphed out of the more mainstream Mormon faith. It details impressively the early history of the Mormon church and the subsequent birth of fundamentalist off shots, most in reaction to the mainstream church's eventual rejection of polygamy. Then it shows how Ron and Dan Lafferty's theology-if you can call it that-evolved out of the fundamentalist fringe groups (which rejected them).Everything is fascinating: the early history of the Mormon church, the modern day polygamous cults, the details of the murders, and the detailed description of the re-trial of Ron. <BR>BUT<BR>I have several reservations about this book as a journalist. (I am not a Mormon.) First, while Krakauer mentions throughout the book that Ron and Dan Lafferty were ex-communicated Mormons, he stillblurs the lines at times. For example on the cover, the opening words, which conclude with the phrase \\"The roots of their crime lie deep in the history of an American religion practiced by millions....,\\" appear juxtaposed next to the phrase \\"A Story of Violent Faith.\\" Yes the violent faith is intended to be the violent, distorted views of the Laffertys, but (at least to me), it is also a double entendre on the history of the Mormon Church. Certainly the Mormon's Church history was violent-but so are the histories of just about every other mainstream religion. On the inside cover of the book, a map delineates Southern Utah, Northern Arizona and Western Nevada with a note \\"Mormon country.\\" Yet the book tells you that this is FUNDAMENTALIST mormon country not mainstream Mormon country. Finally, he could have pointed out more that the victims were MAINSTREAM Mormons and the Laffertys were prosecuted in a mainstream Mormon state and most likely with mainstream Mormons on the jury.<BR>Second, two different books appear crammed into this one. Krakauer admits at the end that he had started on a very different book: how the modern day Mormon church, which contains so many admirable citizens, reconciles itself with its past. Much of the research for that book-which is fascinating and well written-surfaces in this one. Yes I was riveted by the early history of the Mormon Church. However, as I have noted, most religions have violent histories. If Krakauer were to do justice to the subject, he needed to expand on this topic and perhaps note such historic events in other religions as the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, the reign of the Tudors in England, the current troubles in the mideast. At times, Krakauer will throw a fact out about the Mormon Church without expanding on it: for example, that women are barred from the priesthood. Women are barred from the clergy in other religions, most notably in Roman Catholicism. Finally, he goes on at length about the controversy overpolygamy, first in the Mormon Church and then in its fundamentalist offshots. Polygamy horrifies me. However, it has been and continues to be practied in other world religions and cultures. Krakauer never mentions this once throughout the book. <br />Finally, I think Krakauer could have expounded more on thr central story: the Lafferty murders. The two murdering brothers had more in common with other individuals who kill in the name of religion-the September 11th hijackers, Jim Jones, mideast terrorists-than they do with mainstream Mormons. I would have been interested in a thoughtful comparison. Krakauer also could have spent far more time on the individuals surrounding the murders. Allan Lafferty, the husband of Brenda and the brother of Dan and Ron, disappears in the book. What happened to him? How has he coped since then? Two individuals missed death at the hands of these brothers by twists of fate. How have they coped? <br />I would recommend this book to most individuals who enjoy non-fiction, true crime stories and/or Krakauer's earlier books. However, I would caution the reader: there are actually two incomplete books in here instead of one complete one.	2003-07-26

While the four main characters are African American, the book transcends all racial, ethnic and national boundaries. All four women share one problem universal to the entire female gender: men. <br />Savannah is a PR executive who is moving from Denver to Phoenix to be near her best friend Bernadine. Bernadine has just been told by her wealthy husband that he is leaving her for a white woman. Gloria is the owner of an upscale hair salon for black women in Phoenix and the single mother of a teenage son. Robin is a very smart woman at her job at an insurance company and an incredibly dumb woman with men. <BR>The book narrates (two of the stories are told in the first person, two in the third) the dating trials and tribulations of these women. Any woman who has ever dated in her late 30's will recognize the cast of characters: the married men who \\"plan to leave their wives,\\" the men who have no money and no credit, the commitment phobics, the men who discover they are gay...<br />I would recommend this book to fans of women's literature: both serious and lighter. If you're a guy, you should pick this book up with caution!	2003-07-23

I really love British chick lit (e.g., Bridget Jones, Shopaholic series). And I adore Kelly Ripa (this was a Ripa book selection).<br />However, I had huge problems with this book. The heroine-Katya-is downright despicable. Now, of course, that is the point. Yet at some point, you need to sympathize with her. And you never do.<br />The book chronicles, in Katya's voice, a year or so of her life. She needs to write down her daily activities for her accountant (in jail) in case of an audit by Inland Revenue (britain's irs). The plot-if you can call it that-centers on her downward spiral from successful ad copy writer to homeless freelance writer sponging off her friends. You see through her eyes various London worlds-the advertising community, the hippie/granola community, the gay community (of course, she has the standard gay male best friend) etc. The heroine is downright nasty about everything and everyone. Her addictive habits--too much shopping, drinking, gossipping-which are made charming in other chick lit books, are downright frightening here. <BR>However, there are certain redeeming elements to this book. IN a way, it is more realistic than the other chick lit books-addictions do push you downward in our society not into the arms of prince charming. And our heroine is really never redeemed, never has a moment of self realization, never becomes nice. In a way, that is refreshing. <br />I would recommend this to diehard chick lit fans with a warning: it is darker than any of the other books out there. If you're not a fan of chick lit, I don't think this book will change your mind.	2003-07-19

The heroine was-still is-as dry as a martini, sophisticated, intelligent,aristocratic and independent. In many ways, she is a version of Katherine Hepburn. <BR>However, in the past few years, the series has faltered. In part, I believe this is because Cross has kept her heroine contemporary (based on the original books she should be in her 70's or 80's but she is still in her 50s). <BR>The Edge of Doom is an enjoyable, if not the most enjoyable, addition to the series. Fansler finds out that she has a long lost father who has a shady past and present. Part of the book's mystery lies in unlocking that past and present-and dodging all sorts of evildoers out to get her-and part of the mystery lies in her unlocking her own family's past. As always, Cross's depiction of sophisticated Manhattan life adds plenty of favor to the book.<BR>I would recommend this book to die hard Amanda Cross junkies and to individuals who like books with dry and wry heroines. (Though if you've never read Cross, start with the earlier ones.) I wouldn't recommend this book to individuals who have been lukewarm on Cross in the past (this book won't change your mind) or who need action packed, adventure filled mysteries.	2003-07-15

By day, she is a TV financial journalist who delivers serious and sober advice on pension funds and the bond market. By night (and by weekend, by lunch hour etc.) she is a confirmed shopaholic who just can't stop herself from purchsing \\"just one more thing.\\"<BR>In this book, she and her rich, successful boyfriend spend a few weeks in New York as they decide whether or not to live there. While Luke (her boyfriend) spends his days in meetings, Becky \\"takes in the sights\\" (e.g., saks, Barneys,soho stores, etc.) and learns about the native customs (e.g.,sample sales, personal shoppers). She also is trying to establish her television career in New York and her descriptions of her meetings are very funny and actually spot on. <BR>Of course, her endless spesnding eventually causes her endless headaches and a day of reckoning with Luke...and you will laugh very hard on your way to and throughout the climax of the book.<BR>Kinsella has a tremendous gift in the way she manages to keep most of the book in the present tense-you feel as if you are with Becky in Barneys (or Prada or Saks) as she wrestles with her conscience on that one last purchase.<BR>Highly recommended for fans of chick lit.	2003-07-03

Light, fluffy: it doesn't take much to get through it. If you have ever picked up Vogue or Bazaar, you will get a kick out of the behind the scenes description at a fictional fashion magazine.<BR>The story is simple: Andrea Sachs, a recent graduate of Brown and an aspiring writer, takes a \\"once in a lifetime\\" job as an assistant to the famous (and infamous) Miranda Priestly, editor of Runway magazine. Miranda is the ultimate boss from hell-and human from hell-whose outrageous demands and bizarre habits drive our heroine insane. The book basically chronicles one incident (tracking down Harry Potter books before publication and sending them to Paris) after another. Most are very funny.<BR>However, other than a serious of very funny fictional anecdotes, there is little else to this book. There really is no plot, zero character development and no insight. The author never really questions why or how Miranda turned into a she-devil and tells you absolutely nothing about the other fashionistas who work alongside her in slavish devotion to the magazine. The other characters-a saintly boyfriend, an alcoholic roommate, a snaky hot shot writer-are all one dimensional. <BR>Still, if you're on a hot beach this summer-and you don't need to be challenged-you could do a lot worse than \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\"	2003-06-20

It is not a book to read on a quick airplane flight or to fill some time. It should be read slowly and treasured.<BR>The book tells the tale of Antonia, a young Bohemian immigrant in the plains of Nebraska, and her friendship with Jim, an orphan from Virginia who lives with his grandparents on a neighboring farm. The book delves into class structure: Jim clearly comes from a far higher, more educated class and even on the plains of Nebraska, such stuff matters at this time. <BR>&quot;My Antonia&quot; traces the dual lives of Antonia, both of whom embody different versions of the American dream. Antonia goes into service in a household, becomes a farmer's wife, and gradually sees prosperity after years of hard living. But she never loses her spirit-the spirit of the American immigrant. Jim attends university, first in Nebraska and then at Harvard, and ultimately leads the life of an East Coast lawyer. Both rise from their beginnings. But both never lose the spirit of the land.<BR>I would recommend this book for individuals who enjoy American literature. The word &quot;classic&quot; has become a cliche; however, &quot;My Antonia' is a classic. As I noted earlier, I wouldn't recommend this book for individuals looking for a light read. &quot;My Antonia&quot; is just too importan.	2003-06-18

In all honesty, it's not nearly as clever as &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; with Jones' allusions to &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot;<br />However, &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; is a lot of fun. The story (plot may be overstating it) concerns Becky Bloomwood,a young financial journalist in London. She can tell other people how to save money-and she does, for a living. Yet she can't curtail her own spending one iota. The trials and tribulations of her trying to stop her shopping sprees are very funny: for example, a self help book which encourages her to &quot;treasure and break bread with her friends&quot; (and bread ends up being at a very posh restaurant). Of course, she has the inevitable romantic entanglements-in her case with two of Britain's wealthiest bachelors. And thus, she has her integrity tested.<BR>If you like &quot;chick lit,&quot; you should enjoy this book. It's lighter and frothier than &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; or &quot;I Don't Know How She Does It&quot;; it's also a faster read.<BR>A great beach book...	2003-06-18

Kennedy, 1917-1963	Books	5	5	5	N	N	An Excellent JFK Biography	When I first picked up this book, I thought \\"not another JFK biography.\\" However, Dallek makes an excellent case for a new book. Two factors contribute to the need for this book now: the perspective of time (many if not the majority of the working individuals in this country were born after his death) and the opening up of new papers, in particular critical documents on his health.<br />This book is a straightforward biography: Dallek takes you from birth to death in chronological order. In many places in the book, he treads where so many others have gone: JFK's promiscuity from his early years on, his being overshadowed by his older brother, his father's pushing him into politics after his brother's death. However, Dallek does not dwell on the sensational-so many previous biographies focused on one area and dragged it out. Instead he is more concerned with JFK's development as a person and a future president. Everything in the book is viewed from this vantage point. For example, he spends little time on Jackie Kennedy: he explains how she fit into the picture of Jack Kennedy's life, why they married, how she helped him. And that's it-no extensive stories on spending sprees, White House decorating etc. <br />Throughout the book, Dallek weaves the incredible stories and accounts of JFK's numerous medical problems. Some (though not all) of this information is new and all of it is fascinating. How he managed to run for President with all of these issues-well, it's quite a story. <BR>I would recommend this book for individuals who like political biographies, history books, Kennedy stories. I also would recommend this book to younger readers who may not have read much on JFK. \\"An Unfinished Life\\" is a great place to start learning about this very interesting president. <br />Finally,I would caution lovers of the more lavish Kennedy books: this book is not particularly sensational (other than the medical information, which is dry) or gossipy. If you're looking for extensive reports on his sexual exploits, you will want another book.	2003-06-17

Wealthy men of leisure leave their beautiful townhomes for a night of pleasure in the numerous brothels of the city. This book focuses on William Rackham, a perfume magnate, who becomes captivated with Sugar, on one of his forays into the darker side of London. He first sets her up in her own home and then moves her into his as governess to his daughter. Eventually, she becomes his secretary and advises him on his business. All along the way-from the brothel to the home of the kept woman to the master's home-Faber creates memorable characters and delineates the class structure of England. Rackham's crazy wife, Sugar's evil mother who is also her madame, Caroline a prostitute friend of Sugar's who had once been a respectable wife and mother: all of these individuals are characters that are hard to forget. <BR>However, it's important to note that this book is very much of the 21st century and not the 19th. Faber's writing style differs from Dickens and the other great Victorians-not better, not worse, simply modern. In addition, he can be (and is) far more graphic about the sexual depravity of the time.<BR>I would recommend this book to individuals who like historical fiction, contemporary-styled fiction, and books about victorian England. I would not recommend this book to individuals who dislike graphic descriptions of poverty and sexual practices.	2003-06-16

The book is definitely an autobiography and not a memoir: no memories blurred together, themes carried throughout, events taken out of chronology. You cannot get more straightforward: one chapter on her early childhood, the next on high school, the next on college and so on. At times, you feel she (or whoever wrote it) simply strung verbs together based on the events in her diary on that day.<BR>However, it is well written and easy to read. She writes very evenly. While she does attack her enemies, she does it in a measured manner. Rosalynn Carter, Barbara Bush, and Nancy Reagan were more forthright. Then again, they weren't senators. <BR>I found the most interesting parts of the book to be those times when she strayed from controversial subjects. Her descriptions of her trips abroad and of the individuals she met (Yeltsin serving her moose lips, the Irish Prime Minister debuting his mistress to the public) or the sights she saw (a 12-year old prostitute dying of aids in the Golden Triangle, were moving. She candidly describes her father's early religious and racial prejudices and his evolution into a more forward thinking person. She details her mother's very tough childhood.<BR>Yet this book has little insight. For example, she talks throughout the book about her work on the impeachment of Richard Nixon-yet, almost glows in her description of him at the White House with her and her husband and never mentions the irony. She takes you through her chronology of the Lewinsky affair-but it starts with the public disclosure in January, 1999. She never notes in the chapters leading up to it-chapters which are rich with Bill praise and his activities at the time-the irony that this was the time of his involvement. (Or she could have mentioned it later.) <BR>I am glad that I read this book as I am always interested in how public individuals choose to represent their lives. I would recommend it to thosewho enjoy autobiographies of public figures. I also would recommend it to those who both hate and love Hillary; most likely, this book will reconfirm your view of her, no matter which end of the spectrum you're on at this time. <BR>Her most insightful remark in the book may be that she has never been as great as the image of her held by her most ardent supporters or as evil as the image of her held by her most vocal detractors. And I'd add-this book is neither as good as the 5 star reviews or as bad as the 1 star reviews.	2003-06-14

She weaves the stories of other female bulemics and anorexics throughout her own-and also of other women with deep obsessions and cravings that lead to such behaviors as promiscuity, alcoholism, spending wildly, and shop lifting. What are they really hunger for, she asks. Love, acceptance, security? She writes with grace and force. The reader confronts these issues with her, but she eases them into the debate. And then he or she is engaged.<BR>Knapp explores the emotional, psychological, and cultural reasons that drive American women to such behaviors. She has a softer, gentler voice than most feminists and she does not indict men for the most part. But she does blame society. It's interesting-most pop psychologists would diagnose some of the behaviors she describes as examples of an &quot;obsessive compulsive disorder&quot; (anorexia is a manifestation of it in many cases). Yet she doesn't use that term once in the book-in many ways, she digs even deeper for the causes than simply a diagnosis. She analyzes what triggers the disease.<BR>I would recommend this book for most women, even if you haven't had  an eating disorder. We all have appetites. I wouldn't recommend it for most men, except those who like women issue books or know someone who is anorexic.	2003-06-12

It is based on the true dante club, a group of scholars in Boston in the mid 1860's who met to translate Dante amidst much resistance from the academic and religious communities. These individuals-who included Oliver Wendell Holmes, Henry Longfellow, James Russell Lowell-come alive in these pages. Pearl has done a magnificent job in blending a number of facts about these individuals-for example, Longfellow's mourning over the death of his wife Fanny, his correspondence with a young woman he had met on a summer sojourn-into this book. You will learn a lot about these individuals.<BR>However, you will also learn a lot about Dante, about Boston and Cambridge and its rigid social structure, about the politics of Harvard University at this time. And it's all fascinating.<BR>The plot concerns the efforts of this group to track down a killer who has modeled his murders on Dante's Inferno. These murders are gruesome and grotesque. The \\"Club\\" realizes that they, and perhaps only they through their intimate knowledge of Dante, possess the power to solve them. And so they do with the help of the first African American policeman in Boston. <br />My problem with this book lay in the pacing and the awkwardness of the dialogue at points. Now I realize that he was trying to achieve a 19th century voice in this book; however, at times, it seemed as if he was trying to cram his research into the mouths of his characters. His narrative voice-as has been noted by other reviewers-also was uneven. I sometimes winced at the awkwardness of phrases even though all were well written.<br />I would recommend this book to lovers of Dante, of the Italian culture, of Boston history, of mid 19th century Harvard. I also would recommend this book to individuals who appreciate historical fiction-this book is a tougher read than The Alienist-but you should be able to appreciate his research. <br />I look forward to Pearl's future work andto his maturation as a writer.	2003-06-08

First and foremost, it is an outstanding cookbook with many wonderful recipes for summer food anytime of year. Certain of her recipes-pink soup, happiness soup, near-slut red raspberry-make you smile just at the title. Yet all (or nearly all) of her recipes are relatively easy to prepare and serve. As in previous cookbooks, she has a number of Italian recipes. Also in this one, she shows a more pronounced Middle Eastern strain. And, her recipes seem more low-carb than in previous books. <BR>Yet, \\"Forever Summer,\\" like Nigella's other tomes, is more than just a cookbook. Nigella is an entertaining writer who can reference English literature or American cinema (she opens with a quote from Singing in the Rain)on the same page. She opens each recipe with an anecdote about its origin or a comment about the ingredients or a story about how she got it. But what is great about Nigella-she also provides commentary throughout the recipe, so you feel as if she is standing right by you.<BR>And, \\"Forever Summer,\\" like Nigella's other books, is also about her philosophy, \\"her take\\" on life. One of her great quotes in this book is that safely guarded recipes usually die out-and for the right reasons. The best recipes are swapped, improved on, and then swapped again.<BR>I would recommend this book to those who have enjoyed Nigella's other books-this is an addition to and not a reiteration of her previous work. I would recommend this book to those who like intelligent cookbooks; you don't need to have been enmeshed in the Nigella world to enjoy this one. It stands on its own.

Allende tells the tale of a young Chilean orphan, Eliza Sommers, who follows her lover to California during the Gold Rush. She travels incognito and lives in a rough world of single men and ladies of the evening. Allende's far flung canvas captures mid 19th century Chile and California. Her world is one of raw beauty and rough living. <BR>Eliza makes both a physical and a spiritual journey as she eventually must decide what \\"following one's heart\\" really means.<BR>I enjoyed this book though I felt at times Allende lost her way. Overall though, I commend her effort.<BR>I would recommend this book to individuals who enjoy fiction on historical eras, particularly \\"woman themed.\\" (It was an Oprah Book.) I would not recommend this book to those inviduals who need plots and settings served up quickly and neatly. <BR>overall, it was a worthwhile read for me.	2003-06-05

One big doll encloses a slightly smaller doll, which in turn encloses a slightly smaller doll, until you make it to the tiniest and most perfect doll.<BR>This book is many things. It is part Gothic thriller, part science fiction fantasy (and I usually don't like scifi), part Romance, part family epic.<BR>The book opens with the death of the narrator's sister in a car crash. The narrator is an older, elegant (or formerly elegant) Canadian woman. She details the childhood and young adulthood of herself and her sister, a novelist whose masterpiece was published posthumously. Interspersed with her narration are excerpts from \\"The Blind Assassin,\\" a scifi story which involves two lovers who meet in sleazy hotel rooms. <BR>Sounds complicated? It is. <BR>But Atwood ties everything together near the end. There are two huge plot twists toward the end-and when you come to them, you say \\"Wow.\\" I would recommend to everyone to hang in there-it is so worth it.<BR>I would recommend this book to individuals who enjoy contemporary fiction, particularly female themed. While I found this book an amazing experience, I also know it is not for everyone. I wouldn't recommend it to individuals who are looking for straightforward narrativs or complex narrative devices.<BR>However, for the rest of us, it is a great time.	2003-06-05

They are so finely rendered that you can almost touch the velvet, the nub of the pearl, the satin. <BR>This book does justice to Vermeer's artistic skills.<BR>It is historical fiction at its best- a speculative piece of work based on a woman who  is the study of one of Vermeer's better known paintings &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring.'<BR>In Chevalier's novel, the &quot;girl&quot; is Griet, a young Dutch girl of the poorer classes who becomes a housemaid in the Vermeer household. Through her eyes we see the nuances of family life-Vermeer's ever pregnant wife, bratty daughter, mother in law- and we also view the somewhat rigid class structure of Holland in the 1660s.<BR>Griet is a gritty, gutsy girl, who is struggling to survive with her dignity intact in this world. <BR>I would recommend this book to those who enjoy historical fiction and character driven plots, particularly female-themed. <BR>It is a beautiful read.	2003-06-05

The story begins with a birthday party for a Japanese industrial titan, who will be serenaded by his favorite soprano. Then the terrorists pour through the air conditioning ducts and take over the party, the mansion and the lives of the guests. This is no quick-ending siege: it goes on for months, with the women guests (with the exception of the soprano) being taken away. <BR>Patchett paints a multi-lingual, multi-lyrical world. Lives and characters merge. Over the months, some terrorists see, envy even the lives of the hostages (one beautiful young female terrorist is stunned by the sheer luxury of the home). Likewise, some hostages begin seeing things from the vantage point of the terrorists. The Vice-President, the mansion's owner, finds out that he is an outstanding housekeeper. In this small world, there is love, laughter, music, and of course, fear and the threat of death.<BR>I felt the book's only flaw lay in the ending but I won't ruin it!<BR>I would highly recommend this book to individuals who enjoy such novels as \\"Atonement\\" or \\"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress.\\" It is top-notch contemporary fiction.

I read Hayek in my studies in college and I was fascinated by his theories. He was a man who thought and wrote on profound economic issues. <BR>This biography, while seemingly well researched, does a disservice to the man. I (and a book club for an ivy league college) found it poorly written and structured. Sentences, paragraphs and thoughts collide. <BR>I would only recommend this book to diehard Hayek groupies (though it may cause pain). Individuals who want to learn more about him might benefit from skimming through the book. However, I would caution those individuals who seek out intelligent biographies of interesting people-that despite Hayek's very interesting life, this is not an intelligent biography worthy of him.	2003-05-27

The story is told from the vantage point of Reuben, a young asthmatic in the midwest, who is being raised by his kind, Jesus-like father ( a former med student turned janitor).  When Reuben's brother commits a horrible crime (though for semi-justifiable reasons) and breaks out of jail, his family sets out to find him in the Dakotas. Their journey is beautiful and profound. The three main character-Reuben's father, Reuben, his younger sister Swede (a budding writer)-are in many ways reminiscent of characters in great Southern novels. Yet the setting is pure Northern midwest-and that is part of the charm. How often do you read fiction that takes place in the Dakotas? <BR>I would highly recommend this book to individuals who enjoy contemporary fiction, books with religious overtones (though it is not too heavy-handed), rural settings, and/or books in the genre of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or \\"Huckleberry Finn.\\" <BR>I would caution readers that the book starts slowly (I actually read the first chapter a few times before I got into it, that's why four stars) but it eventually rewards you.	2003-05-27

In many ways, it is a far more ambitious novel than her first. \\"The Lake of Dead Languages\\" seemed to me to be a semi-gothic page turner: it aimed to entertain and entrance the reader and not much more. For me, at least, it achieved those goals. \\"The Seduction of Water\\" appeared to me at times to be trying too hard. For example, the author inserted throughout the book references to an Irish fable-an allusion that reminded me of the story in Margaret Atwood's \\"Blind Assasin.\\" Only in Goodman's book, the technique didn't work for me.<br />There's plenty to enjoy in the storyline of \\"The Seduction of Water.' An ABD (all but dissertation) New York writer/teacher moves back to her childhood home,a grand hotel in upstate New York, to serve as its manager in the aftermath of her father's death. Years before, her mother, a beautiful maid turned bestselling authoress who had appeared one day mysteriously at the hotel, died in a hotel fire in Coney Island with her supposed lover. The plot follows the efforts of our heroine to unravel the mystery of her mother's death and her last lost manuscript and to find herself in the process. \\"The Seduction of Water\\" offeres plenty of entertaining characters: a NY literary agent, a hotel mogul, a former prisoner turned aspiring writer....<BR>There's plenty to enjoy in this book. However, I don't feel it lives up to a Margaret Atwood. Nor do I feel Goodman needs to strive so hard. She comes up with interesting plots and stories and she doesn't need to embellish.<BR>I would recommend this book for individuals (probably women) who like mysteries in big old houses (in this case a hotel) with colorful characters.	2003-05-27

In \\"Amsterdam,\\" he examines a promise between two London gentlemen that each will kill the other if he becomes too ill to live with dignity. <BR>The book begins with the memorial service of Molly, a good time London girl of the intelligentsia, which is filled with a number of her former lovers. Molly suffered from and eventually fell victim to a debilitating, crippling disease. Thus, the pact between the two London gentlemen.<BR>This book examines a number of series themes: mortality, fidelity, integrity, journalistic standards, loyalty, decency. McEwen uses his characters and his plot to explore and expand on these themes-not the themes to develop his characters. At times, that can be frustrating. While I admired his plumbing of such serious issues, I wanted more about the characters. <BR>I would recommend this book to those individuals who enjoyed \\"Atonement\\" and are looking for more McEwen. I also would recommend this book to those individuals who like contemporary fiction, particularly contemporary British fiction (e.g., Martin Amis). I would caution individuals who seek either extensive character and plot development or conversely, fun and easy reads, to think before they pick up this book.

He undid me with his first book, \\"She's Come Undone.\\" I could not believe that a man could write so persuasively from the vantage point of a woman, an obese, sexually abused one at that.<BR>In this book, he narrates from the vantage point of a man, but one with an almost unimaginable life. Our narrator has an identical schizophrenic twin, a mother who died of breast cancer, an abusive step-father, a father he never know (the twins were born out of wedlock), a four-week old daughter who died of SIDS, a best friend who serially cheats on his wife, a girlfriend who shoplifts, and an ex-wife whom he  stills love but who lives with another man. You learn all of this in the first few chapters-and there's still another 850 pages of trauma to go!<br />Lamb's story begins with a harrowing incident: Thomas, the twin brother of the narrator, cuts his hand off in a library as a protest to the Gulf War. The book tells of the incarceration of Thomas and his twin's efforts to come to terms with his illness, his life, and their shared family during this period.<br />The book is long, too long at times (I like long books but I felt some of this could have been pared)-but it still draws you in. A 900 page book can't be a page turner...actually, yes it can, with Lamb as the author. <br />I would recommend this book to those individuals who like gritty, gutsy contemporary fiction.  I would caution individuals who need some lighter shades in their reading palette that this is not always a comfortable read. Lamb writes raw. His characters live troubled, tumultuous lives. Brutality and evil appear throughout the book. If you like tough topics, you'll like this book. If you don't, perhaps you should look elsewhere.	2003-05-26

At first you think: cool upper middle class blonde marries much older(and shorter) King. Ah, a late 20th century Grace Kelly? An American Princess Diana? <BR>Far from it. Queen Noor, who began her life as Lisa Halaby, is and always has been a serious, thoughtful woman who chooses to live her life for politics, philosophy, her family (both her one of origin and by marriage), and causes. She does not and appears to have never been a woman consumed by clothes, jewelry, gossip, and glamour. (Though some of her detractors might argue differently.)<BR>This book traces her beginnnings in the upper middle and upper classes of American society. Her father, Najeeb Halaby, was a very successful Arab American who at various times ran the FAA and Pan Am. Her mother was of Swedish American descent. While Lisa/Noor appears to have inherited the looks of her Nordic ancestors, she clearly embraced her Arab American heritage far more enthusiastically as a child. Lisa, as she was then known, grew up in affluent sections of LA, Washington, DC, and New York. She was educated at the finest schools-westlake, national cathedral school, chapin and concord academy-and was a strong student and outstanding athlete (captain of the field hockey team). She took her studies and the politics of the 1960's very seriously and insisted on transferring from the apolitical Chapin to the more academically challenging Concord Academy. Eventually she lands at Princeton, in the first female class. After she receives a degree in urban planning, she moves from one international job to another and finally lands at an architecture firm in Jordan.<BR>And the rest, as they say, is history. Noor details her leap-from all American (albeit one of the upper classes) Wasp girl to Muslim wife to royalty-in a clear, elegant, understated way. She clearly believes that she found her soulmate not only with her husband, King Hussein, but with the country of Jordan and its people. <br />Mostof the book details the Arab Israeli conflicts of the 20th century from the vantage point of Hussein. I found these sections riveting. Certain incidents-for example, the assassination of Rabin after peace accords-took on an added poignancy through Hussein and Noor's eyes. She notes how difficult the American obsession with celebrity news-OJ, Tonya Harding-was for those in the Mideast struggling with the lives and deaths of millions. <BR>While Noor does not overemote throughout the book about her husband, clearly she loved and still loves him deeply and passionately. Beyond being a biography, this book is a romance, though a very understated one and palatable to both genders. Her chapters on Hussein's final months, which she embroiders with such details as her bathing him daily at the Mayo Clinic, are deeply moving.<BR>If I had one criticism of this book, I would note that Noor offers little self-analysis on some very important issues in her life. In addition to her mother's nordic looks, she also seems to exude a Swedish reserve. While she provides the details of her leap, she offers little insight into the impact on herself, her family and her friends. Certain things can be inferred: her father was a high powered, controlling, Arab American perfectionist as was her husband. You don't need Freud. Other issues might have benefited from analysis. At one point, she was against the war in Vietnam, a pioneering woman in Princeton's first female class, and independent soul. A few years later, she was a Muslim woman, enmeshed in some of the most controversial issues of the 20th century, and bound to the traditions of her new land. She was part of the first generation of women that didn't take their husband's last name. Yet in Halaby's case, she changed her last and first name upon her marriage, as well as her religion, citizenship, political views, and profession. In addition, I would have been interested if she or her parents had had Jewish friends who had difficulty (ordidn't) with her choices. To be fair, Halaby simply may not have in it her for such analysis-she mentions at one point that she considered going to a therapist but realized that she couldn't for fear of her confidences getting out.<BR>I would recommend highly this book to individuals who like serious biographies and/or current political issues. You will learn a lot. Your understanding of the Arab-Israeli world will be enriched.I would caution individuals with very strong pro-Israeli views that she is very (though not militantly) pro-Arab. I also would warn individuals who love biographies on celebrity princesses-Diana, Grace Kelly, Jackie Kenndy-that this book focuses on politics and philosophy and not clothes and hair. You'll learn about what people said at a State Dinner at the White House not what they wore that night.	2003-05-24

Virginia Woolf is the first woman from the 1920's; the second is a post World War II housewife in LA; the third is a woman nicknamed &quot;Clarissa,&quot; (Mrs. Dalloway's first name), a modern day New Yorker who lives with her female lover. <BR>I respected this book and the author's efforts to pull these three disparate stories together. The author manages to portray accurately so many of the darker shades of the emotional palette: grief, despair, anguish, suicidal longings, and so on. A plot twist near the end knitted together two of the stories.<BR>I would recommend reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; first to increase your understanding of this book. Small yet telling nuances leave you thinking throughout the night. For example, in Mrs. Dalloway, the heroine is a prosperous London housewife preparing for a party who looks back on a brief kiss with a woman in her youth; in &quot;The Hours,&quot; the modern day Clarissa is a lesbian hostess preparing for a party who looks back longingly on a heterosexual relationship from her youth. However, you can appreciate this book without reading Woolf first.<BR>I would recommend this book to those individuals who gravitate towards serious, thoughtful contemporary literature. English Lit junkies-particularly Woolf fans-should also try it. (Even if Woolf followers don't like the book, they still can discuss it.) <BR>I would not recommend this book to individuals who needs some levity in their reading. This book does not leave you &quot;feeling good&quot; but it does make you think a lot.	2003-05-23

Camelot fans will get great glimpses into those years from her vantage point. But there is a lot more to this book...<br />I would highly recommend this book to women who love biographies on the Jackie Kennedy, Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn set. I also would recommend this book to women who enjoy the story of a self-made woman and a survivor and anyone interested in the social history of this era. I would not recommend this book to most men and I would caution all readers to note that this is a book filled with details of food, flowers, gowns, and jewels and not policy making or congressional bills. You learn about the parties that Jackie Kennedy went to in the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis not about the policy nuances behind the crisis.<br />I gave this book as a present to several female friends and they loved it.	2003-05-23

The premise-a 13-year old girl tells a lie that ruins lives-snares the reader early on. Can someone make such a profound mistake at such a young age and never be able to seek atonement for the rest of one's life? McEwen explores this thought throughout the book. <BR>The writing is beautiful, at times lyrical. The settings-an odd English country home, London during WW II, Dunkirk, the home again-have been visited before and we will be visited again in numerous tomes. However, McEwen casts a fresh eye on these locales and these times. The War almost comes as a relief to these individuals, a new focus for their energies previously consumed or destroyed by the lie. <BR>The ending provokes thought. The author leaves the reader with a challenge: what is reality in fiction and what is not? <BR>I would recommend this book for those individuals who like to have new thoughts thrown at them. At times, the story gets a bit slow (hence the 4.6 on a scale of a 1 to 5), and if you are seeking fast paced action, then you might have trouble with this book. But it is well worth the time and the energy. Once you finish it, you will want to discuss with someone else.	2003-05-22

I would give him 5 stars, even if the book wasn't war and peace (and I don't think that's likely at this point in his career), if I felt he deserved it based on his other work. And I would have given the first few chapters of this book 5 stars-you're hooked quickly. <BR>However, while the book starts fast-a glittery party in the Hamptons, a murder, a good brother law school student and a bad brother-it slows down quickly. I thought -perhaps Patterson wrote this book as fast as we read his work? <BR>Whatever. This is a beach book. It is still fun. You still get some sharp dialogue, some scenes of the rich at play, some gore, and an ok mystery. I found the ending a cop out and I was disappointed in Patterson. <BR>I would recommend this book to individuals who like Patterson and similar authors, though I would caution them that it is not as good as some of his other work. I also would recommend this book to those individuals looking for a quick and easy read on a plane or at the beach.	2003-05-22

He felt that the structure of the book represented the best of current American writing.<BR>True, true. But there is so much more to this book! <BR>Hillebrand captures the era, the social demographics of the 1930's, and the mystique of this horse. She researched this book extensively and her work comes through in all corners of her masterpiece: she builds tiny descriptions in her depictions of characters (he had a dime in his pocket) that tell everything. Her chapters on the lives of the jockeys at that time-living in poverty, no health insurance, many of them only 15 or 16-made me cry.<BR>Hillebrand also writes beautifully. At times, yes, she can go too far. But for the most part, the passion she feels for her topic and for her characters, channels itself realistically into her descriptions and depictions.<BR>I read this book for two very different book clubs: a group of well educated suburban women and a very intense Ivy League city club of older intellectuals. I would say that 90-95% of the members of both clubs loved it. Five to ten percent found it boring. However, I can't give an exact demographic on those who disliked it-it was  a personal thing. I can say that all types of people loved it: people who hate sports and horses, people who love sports, young mothers, seventy-something retired professors, grandmothers. <BR>I would recommend this book for most people. You should be able to find something in it that you will like if not love: beautiful writing, exciting horse racing, carefully researched descriptions of historic settings and times in the 1930's, a strong plot with two climaxes, memorable characters. If you are one of the random people that I have encountered who for whatever reason finds the book boring, I apologize!	2003-05-22

I loved the title and for that alone I ran out and got this book. <BR>And yes, I certainly had a chuckle or two throughout the book. This story has been told many, many times-and by fiction writers in all genres (from Danielle Steele and Nora Roberts to more serious feminist authors who write on ageism and sexism)-a forty something woman is dumped by her employer and her husband at the same time. The book chronicles the  rebuilding of her life. <BR>This book is written, to a degree, in the style of \\"Bridget Jones' Diary,\\" and \\"I Don't Know How She Does It.\\" The heroine is an upscale London urbanite with keen powers of observation and a sharp take on her set. This book has a more thoughtful and more realistic journey through our heroine's travails than your typical supermarket fiction. I particularly liked the fact that she ultimately placed some of the blame for the end of her marriage on herself.<BR>I would recommend this book for the \\"Bridget Jones\\" crowd, though \\"Revenge\\" is not nearly as funny or as easy a read. I also would recommend this book for those women out there-and there are many and I am one of them-who like reading about the rebuilding of lives in middle age.

Thus, I could relate to Dubner's moving tribute to his hero, Franco Harris. I know what it is like to be a teenager and to think that this person really would be your good friend if only they knew you.<BR>Dubner takes one small aspect of American society shared by many people-the worship of a sports hero at a young age-and explores it. He meets Harris as an adult and decides to write a book on him. Only the experience doesn't turn out to be the dream of a lifetime. In many ways, it is more of a nightmare.<BR>The reader feels for both the author and Harris. Franco Harris clearly is an athlete who has moved on with his life, much to his credit. At times, the author seemed to almost stalk him. Yet you feel for the author also. No one should lose the image of a hero at any stage in his or her life.<BR>I would recommend this book for sports lovers of all ages and both genders. If you're not into sports, then this would be a more challenging read. Yet most people have heroes in their youth in many arenas (sports, history, politics), so in that sense, the book's theme is universal.	2003-05-22

Ideas and Recipes for Easy Parties That Are Really Fun	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Very Good, Very Useful Book	I enjoy cooking and eating and reading about cooking and eating.I received this book as a gift and I have had a lot of fun with it.<BR>Garten's recipes are relatively easy and presented with beautiful pictures. She offers suggestions and menus for a number of different occasions: lunch in the garden, a birthday party, a fireside dinner for two. I am always most interested in the author's approach to cooking and event planning. Garten shares such information as &quot;organize like a caterer&quot; and offers such tips as have your guests share in the cooking. <BR>My only criticism-I wish she had put more of herself in the book. I am a Nigella Lawson devotee. With her books, I feel like she is in the kitchen next to me. With Garten, I feel as if she jotted down her tips and handed them to me. <BR>I would recommend this book to cookbook lovers and to beginner and more advanced cooks with entertaining ambitions. I would not recommend this book to individuals who want just one or two cookbooks-this book focuses more on party and event planning. <BR>I also believe that it makes an outstanding gift.	2003-05-22

It is a fast, fun and furious look at the world of rich parents in New York City and the people in their employ.It is satire-but all great satire is based on truth, and given my knowledge of this world, there is a lot of truth in this book. <BR>In many ways, this book is an extended New Yorker cartoon. A young, smart woman tries to make her way in the city. She becomes a Nanny to fund her education and her lifestyle (not very extravagant). Her job ends up draining her time, her idealism (or whatever was left of it) and ultimately her emotions. She basically becomes a full time slave to her witchlike employer. While parts of this book are laugh out loud funny, other parts are poignant and sad. She takes care of a small child who is neglected by his parents. She sees a marriage filled with material possessions and devoid of love. She realizes that her employers are not unique in their set. <BR>I would have given this book five stars but I felt that there should have been more of a plot. Still it is great satire.<BR>I would recommend this book for those who enjoy such contemporary takes on society as &quot;Bridget Jones Diary&quot; and &quot;I Don't Know How She Does It.&quot; I wouldn't recommend this book to those individuals who need more from a book than clever caricatures of rich people in the early years of the 21st century.	2003-05-22

Most members enjoyed it. More important, the book provided plenty of fodder for a robust discussion. <BR>The book begins in India. Two cousins, the beautiful Sudha and the intelligent Anju, are being raised in the same fatherless household. The book narrates the youth and early adulthood of these two women, both of whom eventually enter arranged marriages. Now Sister of My Heart takes place in the late 20th century--many women in my book club were educated about the mixture of tradition with more modern customs in India throughout this book. <BR>Eventually Anju moves to the US with her husband and gradually becomes more \\"americanized.\\" Yet the bond of the two cousins remains strong and they are there for each other during tough times and tragedy. The book has an interesting twist near the end, which provoked discussion in my group. <BR>I would recommend this book for individuals interested in \\"women themed\\" books with some literary aspirations. All those good female issues-bonding, body image, beauty, relationships with mothers and husbands-are here, albeit from the vantage point of a different culture. I also would recommend this book for individuals who like to read about different cultures and traditions. You will learn a lot from this book. I wouldn't recommend this book for most men or for individuals who require Western setting in their books.	2003-05-22

Many of us were disappointed in it.<br />Why? The book starts strong and informs the readers of many interesting facts about the early years of the muslim religion and the culture of Islam. I particularly appreciated the insights into the superiority of those in the muslim world-they felt that civilization and Islam were one and the same.<br />Lewis explores a number of themes with mixed results. I enjoyed and appreciated his insights into women's issues and cultural and social barriers. I was interested in his thoughts on the Muslim's religions interactions with technology. I had a more difficult time with his attempts at explaining his thesis \\"what went wrong?\\" This book started as a series of lectures and that might be the problem. Perhaps his words made sense when they were heard. My views were shared by many of my book club colleagues.<br />I would recommend this book to those most interested in political and religious history. Lewis certainly deserves credit for tackling a tough subject. However, if you have just a casual interest in Islam, I would suggest you look elsewhere for a more accessible tome.	2003-05-22

However, I like them when there is a reason for length-War and Peace for example. This book just needed a strong editor to cut out the fat.<BR>However, the bones of this book are excellent. Carter depicts the upper crust of African American society in unsparing, and at times unflattering, detail. He has an intelligent, low key sense of humor that keeps you chuckling throughout the book. I particularly appreciated and relished the descriptions of the hero's wife \\"Kimmer,\\" a woman who belongs in books on other segments of contemporary upper middle class society such as \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" and \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" <BR>I also found the legal mystery aspect of this book entertaining. Grisham structures better and faster paced plots. However, Carter has a more intelligent and thoughtful take on the genre.<BR>I would recommend this book for several different types of readers. If you are interested in immersing yourself in one demographic of today's society-the well educated, affluent African American population with their winter homes in connecticut and summer homes in Martha's Vineyard-you will enjoy this book. If you like legal thrillers, you should like \\"Emperor,\\" though that depends on your patience level. Once again, be prepared for a lengthy and meandering read-if you want fast paced, Thurow and Grisham are your men. Finally, if you enjoy an intelligent, thoughtful, self-deprecating hero, and you want to see the world from his vantage point, \\"Emperor\\" will satisfy you.	2003-05-22

The reader will travel through the book, and the next few years, viewing Susie's family, town, friends and murderer through her dead eyes. <BR>I liked this book and I read it in one sitting. Sebold creates a memorable character in American fiction (though she doesn't rank as its greatest writer) with Susie. Susie is fun, somewhat popular, and intelligent. She shouldn't have had her life cut short and she really doesn't want to be in heaven. <BR>The best parts of the book for me detailed the impact of her death on her family. Susie aches to be with them. Each family member, in his or her way, aches to be with her. Each goes off in different directions with at times dire implications. I found these parts poignant and (given my knowledge of families who have lost a child) brutally realistic.<BR>My main problem with this book lies in the fact that several different writing styles seem to have been employed throughout it. I wondered if the author started and stopped at various times.<BR>I read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" for a book club of well educated suburban women. About 65%-myself included-liked the book. Another 35% didn't-either they couldn't handle the child's murder (they were mothers) or they felt the story meandered.<BR>I would recommend this book for most people (men and women) who enjoy contemporary fiction. However, if a child's rape and murder will bother you, I would not recommend it. For such readers, the writing isn't that great to justify the pain.	2003-05-22

I love her show, her books, her writing, and her overall take on life. She is an inspiration for forty-something women everywhere.<BR>Nigella Bites is an excellent book both for those individuals who already have her previous tomes and for those new to the Nigella world. She includes new recipes and she updates previous ones (her famous ham with coca cola, for instance). I particularly appreciated the revising of her recipes-you felt as if you were evolving with her. It forced me to rethink my own dishes and it made me realize that recipes are not set in stone. <BR>I have made a number of the recipes in this book including a lemon risotto for a casual cuisine club. All received good reviews. I would recommend that the cook watch the proportions of fat and calories in these recipes-Nigella lite can still be very good. <BR>Nigella is not for everyone. She is not a cooking purist-doesn't claim to be-and she is not into spa cuisine (to say the least). Her overall British goddess act could get on some people's nerves. But if you do like her, she is a wonderful, witty companion in your kitchen. Each new book launches another great series of conversations with her.	2003-05-22

When I saw that Fran Leibowitz wrote the introduction, I thought \\"it's time.\\"<BR>O'Hara sets the book in the early 1930's in New York City. He focuses his sharp powers of observation on the \\"speakeasy\\" class of New York: those individuals with still enough wealth to spend time in illegal bars drinking their worries away. At first, you think \\"ah, these are the beautiful people.\\" Of course, soon you realize that these individuals are  anything but beautiful.<BR>The heroine, or anti-heroine, Gloria, is a beautiful, young woman of loose morals and some inherited wealth. She is smart-we're told she could have gone to Smith-and underneath everything, kind. But sexual abuse  early on triggered a rampant promiscuity. <BR>O'Hara specializes in delineating the subtle class differences-the Catholics who went to Yale as opposed to the Wasps-that existed at this  time. He structures class systems in his novels as rigidly as any Brahmin. <BR>I would recommend this book for individuals who enjoy contemporary fiction, particularly books set in New York that depict wealthy, beautiful people. (If you like Fitzgerald, you'll like this book.) Both men and women can enjoy this book-as Fran Leibowitz says in her introduction, \\"it's a young man's book\\" in many ways. <BR>I would not recommend this book for individuals who dislike \\"dated\\" fiction (though this book is surprising fresh in many ways) or books that verge on melodrama. <BR>One note about the Leibowitz's introduction: I found it excellent. She has some acute observations-sex is an animal desire, the perception of it human and changing according to mores in vogue-that have stayed with me.	2003-05-22

While I have a few criticisms of this book, I had to give it 5 stars simply for Lamb's tour de force writing from the point of view as a woman. Wow. And not just any woman...but a sexually abused, obese yet very funny one. <BR>Dolores Price is not your average dime store heroine. We first meet her as a child as she observes the fruits of her father's infidelity: his mistress has given the family a tv set. We then travel through the years with her-through her mother's mental illness, her father's departure, a rape, her obesity, a bad marriage. <BR>So you're thinking why should I read this? The book engages you quickly. You want to find out what happens next-always a good sign. The book also offers up hope and humor. No matter how bad it gets, Dolores has a wisecrack. The book also sets its story in parts of the country-blue collar Rhode Island, a not-so-good college in the middle of Pennsylvania, a not-so-pretty (at least emotionally) part of Vermont-that you normally don't read about in fiction (no New York, no California, no Boston). <BR>I would recommend this book to individuals who enjoy contemporary fiction. I would not recommend this book to people who want a \\"pretty\\" or a romantic story. This book gnaws at you at times with its rawness. But memorable if you get through it...	2003-05-22

Yet, Nigella Lawson injects so much insight and thinking into her writing about the art of baking. This book is as much a treat to read as her delicacies are to eat. <BR>Lawson's recipes are straightforward and relatively simple (she warns you when there is work). I would heed other reviewers' cautions about keeping an eye on the fats-clearly, she does not worry about cholestrol. However, all of the recipes that I have tried (about 10-15) worked beautifully both when I modified the fats and when I didn't. <BR>I would recommend this book for the beginner who wants to try baking and the more experienced cook who wants to think about it. I would not recommend this book for anyone looking for ways to cut calories out of his or her diet!	2003-05-21

I appreciate Dan Brown's take on the international thriller genre: a combination of religious history, contemporary issues and fast paced action. <br />I purchased this book after I read the DaVinci Code, which I loved. This book is not as good as that one: clearly Brown matured as a writer in both plot development and his style of prose. However, I still found this book a fun and fast read.<br />Brown again educates the reader on an historical religious sect: this time it is the Illuminati. Brown also uses exciting international settings-Switzerland and Rome-as backdrops. He has the same hero (a swashbuckling Harvard professor) and a beautiful, intelligent female sidekick.<br />I would recommend this book for those who enjoyed the DaVinci Code, though I would caution the reader not to expect the same level of entertainment. I also would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys the thriller genre. I would not recommend this book for individuals with strong religious beliefs who would prefer not to be challenged in this arena.	2003-05-21

She can tell a good story and develop a few interesting characters. She is a high end version of Barbara Delinsky and other such female writers. <br />My problem with her-or her marketing team-is that she appears to strive for higher literary goals. And I don't feel she achieves them.<br />However, this book recounts an interesting story. In the early years of the depression, a young bride learns about life and love in a big old home in New Hampshire. A secondary character, a young Boston socialite, matures through her interactions with this New Hampshire community. In the background, fierce and bloody union wars rage: an intriguing glimpse into the social fabric of the region at that time. <br />I would recommend this book to individuals who enjoy melodrama, women's stories, and historical fiction (early 1930's). I would not recommend this book to individuals who expect or demand the highest literary standards from their authors.	2003-05-21

You want to make her dishes-a superb roast chicken, a delicious lemon fettucine alfredo, a flourless clemintine cake-not just for company but for yourself and your family. I also enjoy reading and rereading her passages on how to think about food and eating.

I realize that it is not supposed to be and I respect the author for her choices. But even some of her humorous passages could have been sharper.<br />I would recommend this book for women who enjoy the Bridget Jones, Nanny Diaries genre. Pearson captures one demographic of the contemporary woman well. I would not recommend this book for women who want either too much humor or poignancy-Pearson balances both in this book as her heroine juggles mother and career.	2003-05-21

I felt exhausted keeping pace with our hero and his companion as they navigated themselves through a night and a day in Paris, the French countryside and England.<br />In addition, this book also educates or re-educates the reader on the traditional view of Mary Magdalene in the bible. I actually surfed the web after I read the book to learn more about Jesus' supposed marriage-which many scholars support-and the possibility of a line of children.<br />I would recommend this book strongly for those individuals who enjoy the thriller genre. If you are dogmatic in your Christian beliefs or an Art History purist, then this book may not be for you.

The author shares hard-won lessons from her own life as a mother, wife, and an editor in a series of thoughtful essays. Certain insights-if you have peace in your home then you carry it into the world-will stay with me. <BR>However, I also had trouble with this book. There seems to be little consideration for other ways, other paths to balancing or living a life. Some women have to work for economic reasons. Some women don't have the luxury of being able to maintain a relatively prestigious career from home. Some women want to work. <BR>In addition, while certain solutions to a more peaceful, more balanced life may work for the author-no television, unstructured time for children during the summer, fewer lessons-they may not work for everyone. Without being too politically incorrect, television offers a lot of interesting and educational fare if you know where to look. Some children cherish their memories of summer camp. Some kids want all those lessons. <BR>Finally, the author clearly has certain economic priviliges not shared by all. In addition, what about the mother of children with disabilities? I would hesitate giving this book to my friends with autistic or physically challenged children. They could never live this life due to the demands on their time.<BR>While I admire the author for having the guts to formulate and propound a philosophy for family life, I also must say that I found her and her book a bit smug and self-satisfied with little thought for alternative ways to live.	2003-04-27

If you enjoy lengthy descriptions of furniture, scenery, clothes, fireplaces and interior and exterior monologues, then you will like this book. If you need a lot of action, several plots and subplots and/or multiple character development, then you should look elsewhere.<br />Embers develops two characters very well, describes their friendship in detail, and infers several powerful themes (jealousy, greed, revenge, importance of class structure) from their mutual story. After I read it, I wanted to discuss it and debate it immediately with another person. The themes resonated that strongly with me. My mother had also read it so we could and did debate the ending at length. We both loved the book; however, we both could see how others might find it less riveting.	2003-04-20

When I first approached this book, I hesitated. My boook club was reading it and I had considered skipping that night. However, the blurbs on the inside convinced me to give it a try.<BR>I am so glad that I did. I read it in one sitting. Fuller's book haunted me. Her description of the imperialistic and racist attitudes of her parents was deeply frightening to me as the book took place in the 1970's and the 1980's. Yes we all know of British colonial attitudes in India and the Raj and the like-but that seemed so far away, so pre-World War II. In this book, you realize that such attitudes are barely a decade away.<BR>In addition, Fuller made you feel the landscape of Africa. I couldn't live there-I doubt that I would have survived a year of her childhood.

Great literature can trigger uncomfortable thoughts and actions. Without ruining too much, there was a book burning scene, which I found deeply unsettling as a lover of literature. <BR>However, I believe that the author could have developed his characters better. In addition, I wished he had delved deeper into the literary exchanges between the two main characters and the seamstress.<BR>If you are considering reading this book, I would say go ahead.

I loved many of the other characters that Tartt developed-the maid, the mother, the grandmother, the best friend-and I enjoyed the emphasis on a family of strong women (with the exception of Harriet's mother). <BR>As another reviewer said, Tartt is aiming for Faulkner territory not Grisham.

After I finished it, I re-read the first section and realized how beautifully the pieces of the book fit together. Glass is too sophisticated, too knowing of the realities of life, to come up with pat endings or make everything fit together too neatly. However, even small characters that are introduced in the first section, Fern's friend Anna for instance, are re-introduced in the later sections with appropriate follow-ups. She shows how different the world can be viewed from various perspectives. For example, in the first section, she details a character, Marjorie, a schoolteacher from Devon, who gets on the nerves of Paul, the main character. Later, Marjorie shows up at Paul's funeral and they seem to have remained in touch through the years. The reader assumes: she kept pushing herself into his life. Paul's son Fenno has a different take on Marjorie-and he wonders-were they good friends. NO , no you want to cry-she got on his nerves-but Fenno never gets to realize his father's take on herth-nor would most people in real life, after someone has died. <BR>Bravo!	2002-06-29

The irony: he resides in SoHo (I know they have a Gap there but please), his child is a baby and he lives in a loft. He transports himself and his family to Paris to escape all--he really should have traveled to a suburb of Atlanta or a small town in Iowa if he wanted a viable alternative to SoHo.<br />Sarcasm aside, some of his essays are quite enjoyable. His observations on nuances of culture--the fact that who you choose to have cut your hair on a regular basis can impact your view of a city greatly--are accurate. To his tremendous credit, he neither recreates nor revisits the tradition of Hemingway or Gertrude Stein in Paris. His expatriate experience in Paris exists very much in the late 1990's. He deserves tremendous credit for escaping the cliches.<br />When he does not include himself too much in an essay, his writing leaps from the page. When he does, well you want to scream &quot;since when has SoHo been a stand in for the archetypical American town.&quot;	2002-02-28
