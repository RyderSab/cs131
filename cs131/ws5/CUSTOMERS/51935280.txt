As yet another 40 yo who re-read this book, and found it was just not right, I went to visit Snopes and they have a whole page on it.  Go read it for yourself and see.  Sorry I'm not including the link- that's against the review guidelines.  Anyway- Snopes is a great site for getting to the root of urban legends like this one.  They have researched this book, and found that just as we all suspect (25-30 years later) that it is a bogus diary written by someone who wants to keep kids off drugs and is willing to lie to do so.    As said earlier- their heart is probably in the right place, but this is not an accurate portrayal of drug use- either at the time it was written or now.	2005-07-27

This is a wonderful series- Cynthia has a definite love of Christianity and is able to pass that love on through her words and ideas.  These cds are a pleasure to listen to, and Cynthia lets her love and knowledge shine through.  She does incorporate the Gnostic gospels, but do not be afraid that is all- she does not exclude the canonical Gospels, but weaves them all together in a seamless fashion. <br /> <br />The discussion on Lectio Divina is short (about an hour), but the most complete explanation I have yet found. Very inspiring- I hope to incorporate Lectio Divina in my own life and form a regular practice.  She explains it so very well, and makes it all so poetic and lovely.	2005-07-23

She doesn't outline a whole plan like Bill Phillips does. Pamela gives plenty of information, and many recommendations, but does not write up a complete easy to follow plan like Bill.  To be honest, that is what I expect from a book named Body for Life for Women, so I had to take a star away from what is otherwise an outstanding book.    Overall, I find Bill's original plan too limited for a lifetime, so in this way, Pamela's book is better. But, his is so detailed that all you have to do is decide to commit and follow through. BFL for Women requires more input than that. You will need to research, figure out what exercise you prefer and plan accordingly.  Determine what cardio you like and the level, etc.  Weight work is also not all spelled out like his plan.   She discusses yoga and Pilates, but again, doesn't make it easy to fit all this in.    It's a great book, but not what I had want in a BFL for Women.  I want a plan of the same quality as the original BFL plan, that is guaranteed to work if followed. Not just a book full of great advice.  Something I know will be worth the time because it has been proven by 100's of people who have followed the same plan and have great results to show for it.  This is closer to all the common sense advice we've all ignored time and time again. Wonderful book, but not at all like the BFL concept.    I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to learn more about fitness for women.  But, not for anyone who loved the original BFL plan and wants one for women.  Nor for anyone who wants a quick, easy to follow plan to blast their body into shape.  This is a great book for the long haul.	2005-04-12

In my mind, this is neither positive nor negative- I love them both.  Jim is wonderful, and the material is perfect for him.  Barbara did a spectacular job on the first two cd sets and we love her too. <br /> <br />I can't review the books, as I chose to buy the cds instead.  So any review of the material would best be found in the book reviews.  Anyone worried about appropriatness, or looking to find what subjects are covered would be advised to check the various book reviews. <br /> <br />My kids love all three of these cd sets. We listen to them in the car, and we are all learning more history than I was ever taught in school.  And, it's more fun.  These may just be a taste of everything, but it's well planned and well put together.  This will form a wonderful framework for filling in as the childrem get older.  And, sad to say, but it's the truth- if this is all the history and child gets, they will still be far ahead of the majority of children taught in the US. Which, is a very serious statement- this is history at a level a 6 year older can relate to.  And, we as adults have, for the most part, not even been taught most of this.  The material is not dumbed down, but it is age appropriate (I'd say 6 on up, because as an adult, I still find it fascinating).  The gore is minimized (but not completely glossed over) and there is nothing sexual.  Let's just say that sex as a motivation will be one of the blanks they can fill in later. <br /> <br />I love the cd format because it is fun for the whole family, and makes driving more pleasant.  The kids beg to hear this (all 3 of the sets) and we are all amused and learning at the same time.	2005-03-27

This isn't a book of blank mandalas to color.  Instead, this is 52 different mandalas already printed in color for meditation.  A short discussion of each mandala and some ideas of what to notice and think about are included for each picture.  Some of the madalas are traditional ones we are already acquainted with, and some are modern interpretations of ideas in mandala form.   <br /> <br />They are all beautiful, and one could use this book in many ways.  With 52 mandalas, one could cycle through them, giving each a week, either in order or randomly.  Or find a favorite that matches your mood of the day.  Stick with one till you are tired of it and move on at your own speed.  Who knows?   <br /> <br />I love looking through each of them.  To be honest, I also use their colors as inspiration for coloring my own mandalas I have bought from other books.	2005-01-28

Maybe it was her comparisons between London and NYC, or maybe the introduction of more characters helped, but it was less outlandish than the first.  It helps that she is already dating Luke- the tension between them in the first really wasn't there.  You could tell from the start they were ending up together.  But, now that they are, that leaves plenty of room for embarrassingly sticky situations.  <br />And, Bex is the queen of situtations.  Lucky for her, she's the queen of getting out of them too.  <br />Needless to say, she is again having trouble with her spending.  But, this time we get to shop with her in the Big Apple.

The patterns are not only great to look at, but well written and easy to follow too.  I made a couple pairs of the baby booties, and they were quite quick to make.  And, felted up beautifully.<br />Same with the pocketbook.  Not that the instructions are as critical there, but still- well written and easy to follow, again.  And the results were gorgeous. People compliment me on it all the time. I've been inspired to begin a hat- but it's too early to discuss the finished results.  Still- I have faith it will be perfect.<br />She tells you all about how to choose your yarn, what yarns felt well, gives suggestions for figuring out gauge and discusses washing machine vs. sink techniques.  Lots of nice pics in the beginning to get a feel how much felting changes your fabric.  I found that helpful, as I had no idea what novelty yarns worked in might look like. Given how gorgeous they are, and that I would have been afraid to even try, I feel as if it's almost a public service to include those.	2004-06-03

Quite enjoyable- Cokie makes the history interesting and it's a great book to listen to while driving.<br />No- this is by no means a complete history of our country.  And no- it does not even qualify as a complete biography of any one of these women.  But, it is a much needed glimpse into the past.  In general, women are ignored by history books, and she fills in some gaps.  Of course, there are still huge gaps, but those say more about how women have been ignored throughout history than the thoroughness of Cokie's research.<br />I would recommend this to anyone interested, and quite frankly, were I a history teacher, I would make it required reading for any American History class. Altogether too often history gets bogged down in dates and wars, and every single class can benefit from remembering that these people were human too.	2004-05-30

For some odd reason the authors of this book seem to think that Dan Brown is expected to stick to the facts, but they can make whatever silly statements they wish, and call them facts.  <br />Very early in the book they begin by slamming feminism- a feminist mother will not let her daughter wear a dress.  Yeah- score one for accurately portraying reality (sarcasm for those who don't get it).  As I said- they slame DB for making stuff up, but in reality that isn't actually something they have a problem with themselves.  Two men who obviously know nothing of feminists and here they are teaching others.  Sorry guys- it's silly pontificating like this that proves you have no respect for facts yourselves.<br />As one can guess, this book isn't going to convince anyone who actually enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, and thought that the concepts DB discussed were interesting and worth researching, that DB was wrong.  But, it will convince those who hated the book and were troubled by it all along that he was wrong.  So- expect lots of believers to cite this book as proof that TDC is not true.  Unfortunately, the writers of this book were not held to the high standards they seem to expect fiction writers to adhere to.  And, funny thing- they aren't calling their book fiction, but proclaim it to be the truth.  <br />Well guys, &quot;truth&quot; is more like it.	2004-04-25

This is a review of the Jim Broadbent recording of the first Winnie the Pooh book.  Although it does seem to include the other recordings I have heard, and I expect his version of The House at Pooh Corner would be quite similar.<br />Jim Broadbendt does a great job reading us WtP.  Anyone who has heard the Charles Kuralt version- this version is 300% better.  Jim not only has a sense of of humor, but does a different voice for each character.  Two things sorely lacking on the CK versions.  Now, for those who have heard the Peter Dennis recordings, well, those are better, there's no getting around that.  Peter's piglet cannot be topped and he also does the most wonderful versions of the songs I have ever heard. But alas, those tapes are no longer available and Dennis never recorded the entire book(s).  So, I figure Jim is still deserving of the 5 stars.<br />Broadbent does a wonderful job of bringing out the humor in the stories, something which the Kuralt recordings do not.  His Eeyore does sound a bit like Ringo Starr- but, that works rather well now, doesn't it?  Pooh, well, he's a bit on the not-so-bright side, but he's cheerful and trustworthy.  Piglet does sound timid and sweet.  Rabbit, well, he could be a bit more edgey in these. Jim has made Rabbit a bit more sympthetic a character than I envision him.  Still, the subtle nuances are not lost, even on children. And, it is nice to have an unabridged version of the story available.  <br />My children just love these cds.  Which is nice.  It's always good to have something that the entire family enjoys and is still a worthwhile use of time.  Especialy something that one can listen to in the car that doesn't bore the pants off the driver and yet amuses the children enough to keep them quiet.  I highly recommend this version for anyone who would like to expose their child to the original Pooh stories.	2004-03-19

It follows all 3 generations of a family- grandma and grandpa are involved throughout, a situation that not all children are lucky enough to experience.  It is a wonderful idealized Shabbat experience- perfect for a book, but leaving many of us wondering why we cannot manage this ourselves. The illustrations are beautiful, and set a peaceful mood.  I love the colors, and find this a lovely soothing book.	2002-12-04

The way things are shaping up is very interesting, and Anita is gaining more and more power.  This both pulls her closer and pushes her away from Richard and Jean-Claude.    The first half or so of the book dragged.  There was way too much sex.  Now, I enjoy reading about sex, but to be honest, this is not where Laurel Hamilton's talent lies.  She is a great writer of action and has an incredible imagination.  But, the sex scenes just drag.  Anita is an amazing prude for someone who has slept with just about everyone!  She spends endless amounts of time trying not to have sex, convincing everyone she is some born-again virgin, then she goes at it with the next guy(s) she meets.  Can't speak for everyone, but for me, that whole good girl plot line has worn thin.  Time for her to grow up and join the 21st century.  The '50's are so over.     On the other hand, the book really improved near the end, as the groups pulled together.  It was much more like her writing in the earlier books, and the action moved right along.	2002-11-17

I have not made one recipe from this book that is good enough to make a second time. And, given how simple they are, that says a lot!

The writing is so heartbreakingly beautiful, and the subject so distressing.  At times I had to stop and take a rest, the emotions were so strong.  <br />Sebold is an incredible writer, and has written us a world we can all feel at home in, and yet wish we had the power to change the past.  Her heroine grows and matures (quite a feat for a dead girl) and we love her.  Her family also grows and matures, as seen through her eyes.  The unique perspective is what holds this together for me- she observes everyone, and has the background to make us understand their motives, and how it affects her. And, unlike many concept books, the narrator from Heaven concept does not wear thin, and she has written a great ending that fits the story perfectly.  Rather nice in this day of [poor] endings. <br />This could easily be a chick book (and will probably be a chick flick soon enough), but it isn't.  My father and husband both were enthralled by this book.	2002-08-28

Even when Eliza is helped by Saul, they don't truly interact, but she is first led, then leaps beyond him.  Aaron's seach is funny, sad and touching all at the same time.  As for Miriam, that is truly only sad, and pitiful.<br />Eliza's story is the frame for the entire book, but this isn't her story.  This is the story of her family- including her.  The spelling bee scenes are the last scenes that take place in the real world, after that, all of the second half of the book involves mystical searches, through three different paths.  Very interesting, especially the references to the Kabbalah and ISKON.  The parallels exhibited in their journeys provide and interesting contrast between religions.  It is fascinating to view the attempts by the characters to either keep their tenuous hold on reality, or to sever that hold entirely.<br />The writing quality in this book is exceptional.  With two sentences she can evoke an entire year of life.  Or describe a person well enough that I would recognize them were I to meet them.	2002-07-29

The inside information does add a nice new facet to what we know of RR.  But the unabashed love fest of the life and \\"character\\" of RR gets sickening. It is amazing to me that any reviwer could read more than one account of RR's life and still think he was an exemplar of character. OTOH, it makes sense if you work for him, and are secretly (or not so secretly as the case may be) in love with him. You might think seeing his crook friends would clue one in, figuring that one who has friends who are crooks would most likely be a crook himself. But, that doesn't seem to be the accepted viewpoint. His character must be due to spin, since it cannot be shown by actual evidence. Goodness, if muddy thinking and lying are what we are all supposed to aspire to, I am afraid for the future of the country.	2002-05-13

This may be useful if you want to tie your reading in with the Bible. This could be useful if you don't know the Bible well, but still want to include it.  Since I didn't wish to do so, and it was the only information that was new to me, I mention it.  Certainly there will be someone for whom it is helpful. My inclination though is to think that those who wish to include a Bible reading that relates to a story know the Bible well enough choose a scripture by themselves.<br />This book was very expensive for the information it contains.

Although it is designed for babies, I listen to it with my kids who are older (6 and 2). The songs are actual spanish songs, not songs that have been translated into spanish. They are short (great for the little ones) and the words can be clearly heard (not true for many language tapes). There are songs and rhymes on this, and the whole CD is pleasant to listen to, and will give your child a great introduction to Spanish. There is no english on the CD, so it will not teach your child spanish, but the words are all translated in the liner notes, so with an effort you can teach your children the translations if you wish. <br /> There is a short book with the CD, and it is very helpful. It discusses how children learn languages, and the benfits of becoming multilingual. They also explain the different stages your baby goes through when learning languages, and how the various songs and rhymes on the CD fit into this learning.	2001-09-09

There is a poem on one page, and a full color picture to go with it on the opposite page. The book begins whith the \\"30 Days Hath September\\" poem, and a couple of shorter poems, and finally gets to what I consider the meat of the book- her poems for each month of the year. She has written one poem for each month. They are rather long for young children, but most will sit through a line or two and they will love looking at the pictures, and that will gradually increase their interest in listening to the poem. What a beautiful way to introduce the months of the year to a small child. And for those parents looking for seasonal/monthly poems to read with their children, these are wonderful. The book was originally published in 1927, and the drawings/paintings are of an older style than many of the newer books available. This particular reprinting is well done, with a cloth reinforced binding and a good quality medium weighted paper for the pages. The colors are lovely and the pictures are appealing to children (well, to mine at least).	2001-08-26

Different animals are used to illustrate different facets of our personality- quick as a cricket, loud as a lion, shy as a shrimp, etc. The illustrations are just gorgeous, and can help children learn about a variety of animals in the natural world, as the animals are not shown in a zoo setting.  I appreciate that the child can be seen as either a little girl or a little boy, since there are so many books need to enforce gender roles right from the beginning.  This book is truly a gem for the 2-6 range.  At least, my 2 yo son loves it, and will imitate the animals!	2001-08-18

She writes fairy tales, not PC versions of those we grew up with, nor gory, horrible ones, but tales from her own imagination. Each of these tales involes a Fairy Prince, but all are different. She doesn't tend to have them rescuing princesses like in traditional fairy tales- oh no, the gender roles are better than that. When a princess is involved, she is strong and capable, and has an talent the prince needs. Bad things do happen, but not gory pointless, bad things. These are the fairy tales of dreams, not nightmares.<br /> I found this a great book for boys- usually the fairy type books are pretty specific in their intent to captivate girls. Princes are only included in a romantic way. Well, these are not romantic tales, nor are they the typical male books that leave out girls entirely, or put them in a subservient role. These have very few girls in them (it is about Fairy Princes after all), but the girls in there can hold their own!<br />This book is for older children and is far less repetitive than the Seven Year Old Wonder Book. Still, I read it to my 6 yo (along with the 7 YOWB and King Beetle Tamer) and he loves them all.	2001-07-19

Obviously this book isn't meant to be the &quot;last word&quot; on any of these festivals, but to give a bit more background to festivals you might celebrate, and increase knowledge of those you don't.  There are full color pictures and edgings done in the style of the country involved for each story.

Each week I let him choose one recipe from this (or Pretend Soup) and we cook together.  He is eating much better, has learned a few kitchen skills, and tried new dishes.  Her pictures are easy for even the younger kids to understand, but adults will still have to help with these recipes for the little ones.  We now make pizza from scratch, and have more fun in the kitchen than we ever did before.	2000-12-25

It is organized by Seasons and Holidays, with songs, stories, crafts and recipes that relate to the season/holiday.  It is very easy to come up with nice additions to your family celebrations with this book.  The holidays tend to be European Christian holidays, which is different than the typical American holidays, but not so much that you can't work in many of the activities in the book.  Plus, you may discover new holidays.  We have added Michealmas to our celebrations- it is a great way to distract my kids so that we don't have to start Halloween in September!	2000-12-25

And probably the only one I still use, nearly 30 years later.  If you enjoy Alice, you will love to know more of the background, and inside jokes that you will no doubt miss without this book.	2000-11-02

I have read many of the reviews here, specifically looking for the negative comments, and find that I agree with those I would characterize as well thought out.  I find her to be a bit too shallow, concerned with appearances, and she spend lots of time urging you to buy things.  On the other hand, she can't make me more shallow, or buy anything I don't want.  I read her thoughts and suggestions, and used what I needed.  And she had far more days of writing that included what I needed, than useless stuff.  I found quite a few favorite authors from her suggestions.  many of her end of the month suggestions were silly, but many were very nice celebrations.  Mostly though, they inspired me to write my own calender of what I enjoyed.	2000-09-25

It is a great concept, and who doesn't want to know where to get the best Chinese food?  Unfortunately, his writing , although full of style, is lacking in substance.  Much like a  poorly prepared meal, the reader is left with a bad taste in her/his mouth.   His writing tries too hard to be hip to the GenXers, and cool to the  Boomers.  In this case it really isn't enough.  Personally, I regret buying  this book, as I have only managed to read 2/3 of it. And there are very few  books I ever regret buying. I just can't force myself to finish it.	1999-10-09
US	51935280	R11VPY053XA97Y	0345242610	930097565	Fever	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Exciting and informative reading.	This is a great book. It chronicles the discovery of Lassa Fever from Africa to the US. I cannot believe that this book is unheard of, whereas  The Hot Zone is a best seller.  If this book had been released today (OK, 2  years ago) it would have beaten out THZ on the charts.  Instead, it is  unavailable, and a much better written, more exciting story goes unread.  I  have lent this book to scientists and laypeople, and everyone who has read  this book has raved about it.  Do yourself a favor, and check your local  library.	1999-07-17

The author takes a non-event,and makes it into a best seller.  Pretty impressive, huh?  This is probably a good book if you know little about viruses, and can be impressed with learning some medicine.  Unfortunately,  I am a molecular biologist, and was already aware of the things that make  this book interesting.  That only left me with his plodding plot, and  repetitive descriptions.  If you want an exciting virus story, search out  the book &quot;Fever! The Hunt for a New Killer Virus&quot; by John Fuller.   It is much better written, more coherent, and more interesting. This is  the story of the discovery of Lassa Fever in 1969, without the benefit of  all the technology used in the Hot Zone, and it will have you on the edge  of your seat if you are lucky enough to locate a copy. If you want to learn  about medicine, read the Coming Plague.  Although a little ponderous, it  discusses many interesting diseases.	1999-07-17

There is nothing special in here, but there are no false claims (except for the implication that you can look like a star) either.  I too found the style of the book to be corny.  There  is no diet information at all.  Personally, I would recommend Denise  Austins &quot;Jumpstart&quot;. That has an easy to follow diet plan, a  decent exercise plan (for beginners only), and her encouraging thoughts of  the day.	1999-06-30

It can only be said that they are one molecule different because they are both molecules, and are  different.  Using that type of argument, the same could be said of water  and oil, or O2 and CFCs.  The implication is that if you make one tiny  little change in sucrose, bang, you have cocaine, but you would need a  whole series of enzymes, changing ring structures, adding a N, and removing  oxygens, etc.  Sugar may be bad, but there is no need to lie about it.   Please be certain to check any scientific claims for validity.	1999-06-30

I found that often the information in this book contradicted common sense, and once in a while, even his own information.  The diet is very restrictive, especially for a lifelong diet program.  His whole  evolutionary explanation for the diet is bunk. Of course, it is healthier  than the typical American diet, which is why people feel better on it.	1999-06-30
