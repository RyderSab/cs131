Her characters are so developed that you hate to let go of them when the book is finished.  However...having said all this, ANY PLACE is not her best work.  I do love the Jewish flavor of her books and the light politics, but this book was heavy on the politics of the 2004 presidential election.  After listening to it non-stop on news programs for over a year, I was not willing to invest the time in this book to regurgitate the 2004 elections.  I want to be entertained, not bored with more of the same crappola as to why the democrats are so much more progressively attuned and brilliant than the conservative Republicans.  I really don't want that in my entertainment.  I've loved all her books, SHINING THROUGH and RED, WHITE AND BLUE are two of my favorites, but this one was just too heavy handed with politics and overshadowed the story of a strong and determined young woman.	2005-04-20

I have been told and so many of the reviews have stated that this is the most difficult book of the Tower series to get through.  That's an understatement.  I've plodded through it however, trying to absorb the content enough to have a basis for what I understand are much greater books to follow in this series.  I tried reading this when it first came out and put it down quite quickly as it was so dull.  I've now managed to get through it on tape and am relieved it's over.  I realize it's the foundation for the rest of the series, but I wish I could have skipped it.  If the next in the series is this droll, I'll have to eliminate these works from my King favorites.  Struggle through it and perhaps you'll enjoy it more than I did.	2005-04-13

For years I've known that fluoride was most dangerous to our health.  Knowing Hitler put it in the water to mollify the German public was enough to make me skeptical of ever using it.  Bryson has done an exemplary job of digging up the entire background and facts on this water additive.  I purchased several of these books and gave one to my veternarian as they used to give animals fluoride treatments after cleaning their teeth.  When I mentioned that fluoride was poison and not at all good for the animals, my vet said that he'd seen cattle with horrid fluorosis around Alcoa, TN where the aluminum is made.  It's in the water in horrendous amounts there.  We won't even buy toothpaste with fluoride in it (you can buy TOM'S) and we have a special filter on our drinking water that removes both fluoride and chlorine.  Of course showering in fluoride treated water is not good for you either as you breath in the steam.   <br /> <br />So many cities fought putting fluoride in the water, and rightfully so.  The belief that it was good for teeth and bones has not been proven out and was a false deduction from the get go.  But boy what a great way for the corporations and government to get rid of their fluoride poison.  Feed it to the masses.  <br /> <br />There's massive amounts of deception that are just like this.  Might want to order and read MARY, FERRIE, AND THE MONKEY VIRUS, another mass poisoning of the public in the 50's and 60's with the polio sugar cube vaccine contaminated with SV-40 monkey virus which causes soft cell tissue cancers. Also might want to order FAST FOOD NATION about the meat slaughtering business and fast food.  It will make you stay away from all of them. <br /> <br />Kudos to Bryson...I hope he does more.  Excellent expose!	2005-02-15

I've read all her books, every one of them being totally enjoyable.  This book however, broke my heart.  It's so close to reality for so many people.  As Stephen King once said, \\"You sell a lot more books when the endings are happy.\\"  This book is the story of heritage, ancestry and some wonderful and despicable people.  Tragedy strikes the most undeserving sometimes, and this is that story.  The heroine Jane is a personality Ms. Isaacs must know intimately to write with so much insight into her emotions.  I just wish she'd had a different ending to this wonderful book that traveled through so many lives.  I loved her character Jane Cobleigh.  It's worth the read...truly a good book.	2004-09-20

It was another excellent read by Susan Isaacs.  I actually loved the generational background of both characters.  What I find most pleasing about all her books is that her female characters are real women, with real emotions.  Most male authors, Jonathan Kellerman, Stephen White, Leonard Goldberg, etc., have female characters that actually make me angry. (I still love their books however, even though all of their females are on the border of being witches to live with.)  Why is it that so many male authors see women in this light?  It's truly refreshing to read Ms. Isaacs books and have likeable female characters.  She's a truly wonderful author to read and I'm always anxious to get her next book.  The Jewish flavor and history in her novels is so delightful...I simply love it.	2004-04-28

Robin is so self centered, so needy, even with her own business, that it's a major sidetrack from the real story.  I wish Kellerman would get over this &quot;woman&quot; thing and find Alex a gal that appreciates all he does.  Women are not all like the Robin character.  I've noticed that this seems to be the case with all mystery/psych writers.  The women are so self centered and egotistical, that they're fighting for the limelight.  It really gets disgusting.  Most women support their partners.  There's no support in a great number of these writers' novels by the &quot;modern day&quot; women.  Other than that, the stories are great and I enjoy every one of them.	2003-08-18

Auschwitz was pergatory and Bergen Belsen was hell.  She told it just as it was with very little digression into unrelated subject matter.  As Matt stated in his review...she writes as a surgeon, always cutting to the core of the story she had to relate.  I must agree that this is one of the very finest books I've read by a survivor, albeit there are a great many.  The many very talented and wonderful women that fought to live and failed in their quest will break your heart.  Dr. Perl tells of the spirits of these women and the great loss to the world of the multitudes of talented and wonderful people put to death by these butchers.  The book was reprinted in 1997 by Ayer Company Publishers, Inc. in North Stratford, NH, and I cannot understand why it is so difficult to find today.  My most generous thanks to those who supplied me a copy of this marvelous testimony for my library.  <br />Read dear Lucille Eichengreen's book, FROM ASHES TO LIFE.  It too is a valuable historical testimony.  Then get ECHOES FROM AUSCHWITZ by wonderful Eva Mozes Kor, which is the story of Eva and Miriam Mozes, two of Mengele's twins.  Excellent!	2003-08-02

I could not put it down until I'd reached the last page.  Unfortunately, it's a story of great sorrow.  Loretta Young was always one of my most favorite actresses.  Her life seemed shaped by her family history, by her devout Catholicism, the Hayes morality codes and her chosen career.  Fear of being found out seems to have permeated her life to the point where when she was confronted by her daughter Judy regarding Judy's parentage, she actually became physically ill.  Throughout the book Judy displays a deep devotion and love of her mother, but undoubtedly was terribly confused regarding Loretta's attitude towards her.  Although Loretta was a devoted Catholic, knew all the Catholic rules and abided by them, she failed to show genuine Christian love.  It broke my heart that Loretta failed to see how her husband Tom Lewis treated Judy, how Judy despised one of her caretakers and was terribly frightened of her, and how Mary Coney after 37 years of working for Loretta was turned out of the house when she was sick and dying.  For all Loretta's charity work, she really needed to start her charity at home.  I was glad to know that Judy and Loretta reconciled in 1997, three years prior to Loretta's death at 87.  I have since often wondered how Loretta's two boys by Tom Lewis have faired in life and if they were treated similarly by their mother.<br />Judy Lewis was a beautiful child, and is a beautiful woman.  She had a terribly difficult childhood despite being the offspring of two wealthy and powerful Hollywood figures.  She made her own way however, and succeeded in becoming a most lovely and talented woman without the help of her parents.  I'd say this is the result of a determination on her part and perhaps the genes she inherited.  I certainly wish she'd write more, her book was a wonderful read.	2002-08-20

It tells of the struggles of a pastor with the congregation, the elders, the board members.  It tells of the false prophets that draw people from the church for &quot;signs and wonders.&quot;  It tells how bad the church is today...how the pastors have failed to ground the congregations in the truth and they're swayed to and fro by any wind of doctrine.  It tells about the self-righteous, the cruel, the mean side of church goers who think they never do harm.  It's a great book, with a great message...a message that rings true for most of us that have attended church all our lives.  None of us are perfect, but there'd be a lot more hallelujahing if the self-righteous gang would shut up and sit down.  There's a lot of walking wounded out there that have left churches because of the hypocracy of the leaders, and the so-called &quot;brownie points&quot; one must earn from God to be good enough, when in reality it's brownie points from the leaders of the church that are supposed to be earned.  Lots of love and understanding and ministering is missing today, not to mention discernment by the pastor and the leaders.  Peretti points it out so succinctly...excellent book, excellent job...beware of wolves in sheep's clothing!	2002-08-08

As a producer for two national talk show hosts, I can honestly say this is one of the finest and most thought provoking books I've read.  Ed Haslam's book is a major dot connector.  Think about it.  We already know thanks to  A &amp; E's Investigative Reports that Oswald did NOT kill Kennedy, but  that's not the big jist of this book. What needs to be understood is that  the polio virus vaccine all the baby boomers received via shots and sugar  cubes in the 50s and 60s was contaminated with SV-40 Simian Monkey  Virus...the results...an epidemic of soft tissue cancer.  And SV-40 shows  up in autopsies of cancer victims.  However, even more horrific is that the  SV-40 contamination does not end with those of us that received the polio  vaccine.  It is passed to our children and grandchilren even though they  have not received the vaccine.  Who is responsible?  Ed Haslam's fabulous  research was given to us in this book in 1995, and five years later, in the  February, 2000 issue of Atlantic Monthly, it is finally discussed by the  &quot;regular&quot; media.  Stop and think about this...Plutonium  experiments from 1936 through the cold war on unsuspecting  Americans,radiation experiments on military men, the Tuskegee, Alabama  syphillis experiments, the depleted uranium issues from Desert Storm, and  countless others...this book exposes another form of deception and coverup.  If this book doesn't make you think and do even more research, then you're  in denial and have your head in the sand.  There are countless other books  that should be on the suggested reading list after reading Ed's fabulous  work, but Amazon hasn't listed them.  Please read Pulitzer Prize winner,  Eileen Welsome's book, THE PLUTONIUM FILES, then read Martin A. Lee's THE  BEAST REAWAKENS, and if you can find a used copy, get Borkin's THE CRIME  AND PUNISHMENT OF I.G. FARBEN.<br />Ed's book is superb and written in a  style that is easily assimilated.

It takes courage  to tell the full ramifications of the truth and Martin has done it. <br />I am  personally a conservative bible believer, but I know the right wing  &quot;Christian&quot; politicos are tied to the giant octopus of fascism,  even if it is by the tiniest suction cup on the end of the smallest  tentacle. After 30 years of studying the rightwing folks, a book like  Martin Lee's is a welcome breath of fresh air.  Albeit, this is not to say  that the leftwing is any better, for they are not.<br />I suggest everyone  follow the money trails and check the &quot;beliefs&quot; of the  rightwingers one may subscribe to...underneath it all lies a monster that  needs exposure to the light.  Martin Lee has done this in great and  wonderful style...the book is a definite keeper for reference...and a good  one to buy for friends as holiday gifts.  <br />Kudos Martin!  Superb!	1999-09-10
