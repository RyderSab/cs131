While there are many books out there with futuristic time travelers, Jane's Warlord is probably one of the most erotic and entertaining.  The story keeps you tantilized and wanting more.  A warning for those used to milk and water misses and polite gentlemen:  THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU.  It is extremely graphic.  The sex is hot and may be disturbing to some.  However, if you like serious alpha males and the women who challenge them, you may enjoy Jane's Warlord.  I did!	2005-07-28

It was erotic and action packed.  I will definitely keep reading Angela Knight's books.  You may be wondering why only 4 stars:  Having just finished Jane's Warlord, I was a bit perturbed to notice that the sex scenes were disturbingly familiar.  You will know what I mean if you read this book immediately after Jane's story.  This was only a minor flaw.  Overall, Master of the Night was interesting, sexy and a great read!	2005-07-28

I have waited (very impatiently) for this new edition of the Lady Whistledown series.  I enjoyed the first and was not disappointed by the second.  Julia Quinn, Suzanne Enoch and Karen Hawkins deliver in a big way.  Their stories were fun, romantic and wonderfully woven together.  And please, if you don't get the tingles over this exchange...<br />&quot;I admit I have felt the effect of your mouth, my lord,&quot; she said in a low voice.<br />This looking and not touching was going to kill him.  &quot;You haven't begun to feel the effect of my mouth, Charlotte, &quot; he murmured.<br />(page 228)<br />WOW!  Be still my beating heart!<br />The only low point in this fabulous collection was the story by Mia Ryan.  I was very disappointed by the silly, downright obnoxious character of Miss Martin.  What happened to Mia Ryan?  I really enjoyed the story she wrote in the original Lady Whistledown compilation, but since, her work has seemed forced and painful.  Very sad.<br />In all, you must read this book for the wonderful stories from Quinn, Enoch and Hawkins.  This book is going on my keeper shelf!	2004-06-16

When I saw that Mia Ryan's book had been released, I was very excited.  I loved her story in Lady Whistledown and could not wait to read more of her work. I almost did not buy Ms. Ryan's book when I read the reviews below, but I am glad I gave the book a chance.  The story is not the same &quot;everything is happiness as long as you have on a gorgeous dress and a handsome man on your arm&quot; kind of book most of us are used to.  In fact, it is quite the opposite.<br />Lady Lara does not fit into the lady-like mold that Society demands.  In fact, the harder she tries, the worse it is.  The people she meets are horrible and the only people she enjoys spendng time with are misfits like herself.<br />While the story is not the fairy tale readers may expect, the story is fun and I defy anyone not to laugh at the Unfortunate Incident with Lord Cartwright.  Give Mya Ryan's book a chance.  There are some lovely parts and quite a few chuckles. I expect we shall be seeing books telling Lady Lara's sisters' stories in the coming years.  Frankly, I can't wait to see what is in store for them, especially Rachel!	2004-01-20

Did I read the same book that everyone else reviewed?  This book was horrible.  Dorris DeMaio was right on.  This book deserves less than zero stars!<br />From the very beginning I was scratching my head over historical inaccuracies and, excuse me, a duke decides after less than a day to marry a street urchin who picks his pocket and then shoots him?  There was no chemistry between the characters and none of it makes sense.  I may not be an expert in Regency England, but come on!  I've read enough books to know that men can't bring women to live in their bachelor home without causing some talk. They certainly don't allow their fianc&eacute;s to steal jewelry from guests at a ball without making an effort to return it!  Geez, where are the morals in these people?!  Also, peers definitely don't marry compulsive thieves!  Five-year-old children do not eat in the main dining room with the adults and servants do not call a duchess \\"ma'am\\" the first time they meet them.  It's \\"your grace,\\" or \\"duchess,\\" but never \\"ma'am.\\"  This book bothered me from the first page and about page 150 I just about lost it!  Since when is the phrase \\"pre-wedding jitters\\" appropriate in a Regency novel?  And a 5-year old who talks like he's thirty?  How does a kid who's grown up on the streets learn to speak like he's been raised with the best tutors?  The dialogue was ridiculous, inane, boring, and completely improbable.<br />Arg.  I could go on and on.  This book was just atrocious.  Don't waste your money!	2003-12-06

Have you ever read a book and cringed when something happens to embarass one of the characters?  That is the way I felt throughout this book.  There wasn't any real chemistry between Anne and Connor and Anne was at times incredibly weak and pathetic in her attempts to get Connor to reestablish a relationship.  Connor clearly did not deserve her and Anne was not as strong as the author tried to make us believe.  Anne and Connor hardly spent enough time together to learn about how each other had changed and even then, they clearly weren't ready for any kind of committment.  There were also several characters the book could have done without and at least 3 subplots that just sort of died without being resolved.<br />I was not impressed by If the Slipper Fits.  I sincerely don't think the slipper fit at all.	2003-08-20

Maybe I am just a sucker for the strong, alpha male types, but I had a hard time liking Nick Pryce, Viscount Somerton.  He begins the book as a serious wastrel and ends the book still not up to my standards of hero.  I just never bought that Willie would be drawn to a man who kidnapped her, humiliated her in front of a bunch of strangers, and then allows her to become a servant in his home.  I'm sorry, but I just did not get the attraction.  Sure, he was cute, but there have to be better men out there.<br />Despite my problems with the \\"hero\\" of \\"The Viscount's Bawdy Bargain,\\" it did have some nice moments and some fun characters, especially the Cyprians turned chambermaids, the alleged poisoner turned chef, and the pugilist turned valet.  These saved the book from the donation bin before I had finished it.<br />Overall, not my favorite hero or book. I'm willing to give Connie Lane another shot, but this book is definitely not a keeper.	2003-07-18

Miss Fenella Trentham fell in love with the Marquess of Perryn five years ago on a moonlit night in his rose garden.  Never mind that he was horribly drunk at the time or that he seemed to be wasting all of the gifts he had been given by birth.  There was something about his kisses and, well, something about him that Fenella fall hopelessly in love with Perryn.  For his part, Perryn remembered only that an angel had visited him and her words and kisses had led him to change his life for the better.<br />Five years later, Fenella and Perryn have encountered one another at many balls and neither has been able to shake the inexplicable attraction they have for one another.  This time, they encounter one another at a house party given by their mutal friend, Mrs. Almington.  They encounter one another by chance in her rose garden and their attraction is fueled by the most amazing kisses.  Mrs. Almington, for her part, has always believed that Fenella and the Marquess belong together and so she has set upon a matchmaking scheme.<br />Following Mrs. Almington's grand plan, Fenella and Perryn find themselves matched together on a scavenger hunt to create a collection to be auctioned for the poor.  Along the way, they must spend every travelling moment together.  While they bicker and tease one another, their attraction continues to grow.  Fenella, however, cannot find it in her to trust Perryn given his roguish tendancy to flirt with anything in skirts.  But as their trip continues, she finds herself falling deeper in love with him and feeling more as if she could not live without him.<br />A Rogue's Embrace is a charming book that will have you smiling from the first page.  The attraction between Fenella and Perryn is evident from the beginning and their lighthearted teasing makes an enjoyable book.  The only draw back was a slightly sinister appearance by a family member.  However, this does not detract from the overall experience of the book.  Quite entertaining, you will find this easy and fun read.  Valerie King's talent at writing regencies and at creating a reading experience reminiscent of the language of Jane Austen will keep you coming back for more.will find this easy and fun read.

I almost passed out until she came to retrieve the book and told me how incredibily funny the diary of Georgia Nicolson was.  She encouraged me to read Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging.  Never one to turn down a laugh, I went to the store purchased Angus and the Sex God book and was hooked by the first page.  I laughed so hard at the trials and tribulations of Georgia that I kept following my husband around the house reading bits and pieces of it to him.  \\"Why is this so funny to you?\\" he kept asking me.  \\"You don't understand, \\" I replied.  \\"You're not a girl.\\"<br />Georgia's diary is full of experiences many 12-14 year old girls have lived through.  From those traitorous girlfriends, \\"I told him that I was breaking up with him because you said I could do better,\\" to parents who are clearly losing their minds, and little sisters who charm the ferocious beasts who live in our houses, Georgia's diary will keep you entertained and laughing because you KNOW exactly what she is going through.<br />Whether you are a teenage girl looking for a truly fun book to read, a woman who would get a laugh out of remembering your 14 year old adventures, or are a parent who often wonders just what your teenage daughter is thinking, Louise Rennison's books are perfect for you.

Georgianna and Tristan's encounters were witty and fast-paced and exactly what you want to read during the summer or even a cold winter evening. I only wish I could find a man as enchanted with me as Tristan is with Georgianna.<br />Suzanne Enoch's books are the best and I will continue to read them over and over.	2002-06-29

I have only read a few of Lisa Kleypas' books, but this one is definitely going on my keeper shelf.  This book was well-written, fast-paced, and, while I could have done with out the whole brother/bad guy thing, a great plot.  I have been eagerly awaiting Ross Cannon's story and Kleypas certainly met my expectations.  I enjoyed Sophia as a strong, capable woman, thankfully free from the general concerns of society's daily influence and Sir Ross's inability to keep his hands off of Sophia was very entertaining.  While I guessed the reason for Nick Gentry's presence in the book from the first and was unsurprised as the story unfolded, he was not a distraction as the interaction of Sophia and Ross was intriguing.  I have several favorite scenes in the book, but one of the best was Sophia's former lover getting his from Sir Ross!  Oh, to have a man like that on my side!<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book (and finished it in only a few hours) and I encourage you to get a copy.	2002-06-17

Much like the quote from an author on the front of this book, I generally buy anything with her name on it.  However, I struggled through this book for various reasons.  First, after years of reading books where one's reputation is the end-all, be-all of one's existence, I was disconcerted by the haphazard care Amanda Cynster had for her reputation.  Neither she, nor anyone else in her family, seemed to care one whit about her visiting gambling hells, private parties known to be meeting houses for people looking to carry on sexual liaisons...It was a struggle to believe that no one in society was talking about her and that her reputation was unblemished by her stubborn carelessness.  Second, and this is a reflection of how bored and upset I was, I came to be increasingly distracted by Ms. Laurens overabundance of paragraphs with fragments.  In many of the scenes, particularly love/sex scenes, Ms. Laurens seems to lose all sense of English grammar and haphazardly (a recurring theme in this book) drop verbs and leave sentence fragments littering the text.  Why is this an issue for me?  Because I was in such a state of frustration with the book by page 100, that I was noticing every flaw.  I was so frustrated that my husband threatened to take the book away from me as I was muttering to myself every other minute (I promise this is not a regular occurrence).<br />Ms. Lauren's editor would have done everyone more justice had she encouraged her to cut at least 150 pages from the text.  Undoubtedly, this would have eliminated many of the sentence fragments and encouraged the story to seem less drawn out and endless.  Indeed, the only reason I can see for the excess pages is the incredible price...<br />Why am I giving this book 2 stars when I seem to have hated it?  For all of the frustration and irritability it caused, I was fascinated to see how Amanda would manage to convince Martin to fall in love with her.  For a young woman of 23, she had a much better grasp of the male psyche than the majority of women I know.  Also, despite the distraction of the sentence fragments, the love/sex scenes were pretty intense and they kept me distracted on a very long drive.<br />If you feel the need to own this book, whether to judge for yourself or to be able to at least say you read it, I highly recommend buying a used copy or purchasing one at a discount store.<br />Sorry, Stephanie, I really wanted to like this one.  I have enjoyed so many of your books until this.For a young woman of 23, she had a much better grasp of the male psyche than the majority of women I know.

Based on the cover description and the whimsical design, I had serious hopes for A Prince of a Guy. It sounded like a cute story idea and at times, the book does meet expectations. Jeff Hardin is just like my husband, he lives and breathes sports. His interactions with Kate Stonewall and her children are fun and heartwarming. However, right when I started to think that their story was getting interesting, Ms. Rabe introduced another character who Kate starts to fall in love with. Um, excuse me, I was confused. I thought this was Kate and Jeff's story!<br />While the newly introduced second love interest is eventually done away with, his introduction ruined the book for me and I was never able to recapture the excitement and interest I had for Kate and Jeff's relationship. It was hard to go from Kate and Jeff to Kate and Grayson back to Kate and Jeff again. In short, it was hard to be happy that they ended up together when I wasn't even sure they belonged together after Kate had feelings for someone else.<br />While I understand Ms. Rabe's motives, I like my romances with a little less romantic confusion. Give me one clear hero and one clear heroine and I am happy.<br />Overall, worth a few giggles: I'd buy it used.	2001-08-10

With all of the excited, exclamation point reviews of this book, I was expecting a lot more from it.  A Pirate of Her Own was cute, I giggled a bit, and there were some steamy scenes, but problems with the story started to irritate me.  First, for a ship that is supposed to be full of men Captain Morgan Drake wants Serenity to be careful around, they are amazingly (and conveniently) absent for most of the book.  Secondly, it was incredibly frustrating that Morgan or Serenity would make a decision (key was Morgan's decision to &quot;one way or another claim her body&quot;) and then it was like the decision was never made.  The characters went back to &quot;Do I/No, I can't&quot; in the very next chapter.  I kept feeling for every step forward, the characters took two steps back.  Third, the book was incredibly choppy.  It did not flow in a manner that made me feel like I knew what was going on.  The shock of the last two chapters was almost too much for me.  I sat there reading and remember saying, &quot;What?!&quot; out loud.  Finally, the author had an opportunity to really develop her secondary characters, but a few of them who really had promise got lost in the the story.<br />I really wanted to enjoy this book.  Everyone else was so excited about it, I wanted to be too.  It began with lots of promise to be something unique and exciting, but got lost toward the last 40% of the book.  Unfortunately, it had flaws that I just could not get past.  I have already purchased Master of Desire and Master of Seduction and truly hope they are better.	2001-06-02

I rarely write reviews because others seem to be able to express my opinions better than I can.  But this book inspired me...:)  The Indiscretion, while not the best title for the book, had me hooked from the beginning.  Lydia Bedford-Browne is a wonderful character.  She is fun, unpredictable, and when she stands up for herself, you feel like cheering.  Sam, the American cowboy, is just yummy and only a bit complex.  Sam and Lydia's relationship, especially on the moor, had me sighing and laughing and smiling, and well, not wanting the book to end!<br />This book is full of unpredictable and very humerous moments, but it is the time while Sam and Lydia are lost on the moor that I truly appreciated.  So often, authors forget that their characters need to spend time together (outside of ballrooms and other crowded events), before the know they are truly in love.  The quiet moments on the moor, reading to one another, discovering one another, made this book for me.  Their relationship is steamy, fun and a welcome respite from the tortured relationships in so many other books.<br />If you are a Julia Quinn fan, you will adore Judith Ivory.  You will fall in love with Sam and Lydia. You will love this book!	2001-04-07

A London Flirtation is about a young lady, Marianne Pemberley, who travels to London intent on marrying well.  But Sir Jasper Vernham has been in love with her for quite some time and wants nothing more than to marry her.  Marianne, determined to marry better than her sister and to take London by  storm, denys Jasper's love and takes off for the glittering balls and  sparkling society.<br />  Marianne is instantly a success and thinks she  is in love with Lord Crowthorne.  However, Jasper has followed Marianne to  London and does everything he can, including kissing Marianne silly, to  convince her to marry him.  Marianne cannot make up her mind and along the  way hurts many people with her indecision.<br />  Unfortunately, Valerie  King's book was hard to read.  In order to cheer for the heroine and the  hero, you have to like both of them.  Sir Jasper was delectable.  There  were times I really hoped someone would throw Marianne into the Thames.  Her spoiled selfishness bothered me so many times, that I almost took the  book back to the store about page 49.  Ms. King tried to color Marianne in  a positive light, making her feel contrition for her abominable behavior  toward her cousin, Miss Theale, and being generous and kind to a group of  children.  Quite frankly, it was too late.  By that point, Marianne simply  appeared as a petulant, selfish child.  I started to cheer for Miss Theale,  hoping that Sir Jasper would fall in love with her.<br />  It appears that  Ms. King wanted to write a romance that was different from the many others  on the market and perhaps she was telling a story of a young lady different  from the many romance novels out there.  I am all for being unique.  It  just did not work here.  I did not like the heroine and that ruined the  book for me.	2000-06-07

The hero sounded wonderful.  The adventure had promise.  The initial chemistry between Duncan and Cairo was great.  And then... Well,the book started to  lose me.  Maybe I've just read too many books were the single mom is afraid  to tell the father of her child that he's a dad.  Maybe I'm tired of this  weakness in women that keeps them from telling the  whole truth.  Frankly,  I felt Cairo wasn't as strong as Duncan seemed to think she was.  I just  didn't like her. So, it really didn't matter if they got together. Or maybe  the problem was with the thing between Cairo's aunt and Duncan's dad.  It  was just - well, their reactions to one another didn't sit right. They  seemed to fall into passion easily and fall right out of it just as easily.  Their relationship was awkward because it happened so fast and they seemed  to have so many issues that just got swept under the rug. I was very  disappointed that this book wasn't better than the reviews said it would  be.  I was really looking forward to something different.  Sorry, this is  one for the garage sale.	2000-05-22

If you're not ready to take a major leap into erotica, Bedtime Stories for Lovers is a great start point.  Lloyd's stories are fun for erotica newbies and are pretty hot.  I've reread them over and over and they never fail to turn me on.  Like I said, &quot;Yum!&quot;	2000-02-29

I purchased this book based on the reviews I had read and on a coworker's comment: \\"It was so hot I had to put it down.\\" Please! Are you kidding? I like Erotica, but not when the author has no imagination. This book is full of nothing but one spanking after another. While spanking may be fun every once in a while, page after page of spanking got old really quickly. I understand the whole idea of control, etc., but please! Half way through this book, I put it down and swore I would not continue. Unfortunately, I convinced myself that at some point the book had to be about something else. Trust me it isn't.<br />Just leave Anne Rice on the shelf.	2000-02-23

The beginning scene was very exciting and then......Well, somethings are just too good to be true.  I have always been a great Coulter fan (I think I own  every book), but I will think twice before I purchase her next book.	2000-02-01

From the moment I discovered Julia Quinn, I have been hooked.  I've read everything of hers I can get my hands on and have waited and waited for this book.  It was wonderful and all I could have hoped for.  I love  Quinn's romances for the witty humor and how she can take us into each  character's life with such ease.  The Duke and I delivers and then some.  Simon and Daphne are wonderful.  Julia Quinn has created characters who are  down-to-earth and so likeable, they feel like well-known friends.  From the  moment Simon enters the picture, you will fall in love with him.  He is not  brooding or completely unapproachable  (as so many authors seem to be  fixated upon).  He is intelligent and makes Daphne's ( and my ) knees weak.  I especially enjoyed Daphne.  She is a strong woman who knows what she  wants and loves her family and her duke in ways that feel real, not overly  romanticized.  All I can say is:  You have got to get this book.  You  will laugh, fall in love, and maybe even cry a little.  It is one of  Julia's best!  I can't wait for the next one!	2000-01-07
