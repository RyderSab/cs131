She has attempted to settle down and retire, but while living in Mexico, her boyfriend and unborn child are killed by a gunman. As she recovers from her own wounds, she starts planning her revenge on those who are responsible: organized crime bosses in St. Louis; former clients.  Two FBI agents return from Certain Prey also: Mallard and Malone.  They call in Lucas Davenport, the deputy Commisioner of Police of Minneapolis, as a consultant to help them attempt to net Clara Rinker. Thus begins a very solid Prey novel, as one would expect from John Sanford.  He breaks no new ground with this novel, but does a great job keeping the reader entertained. The novel does not bog down into a lot of unnecessary detail and filler; it keeps moving at a good pace.  As stated above, a number of the main characters are recycled from Certain Prey. However, if the reader has forgotten the details of that book, it won't affect the enjoyment of this one. A thoroughly enjoyable read for seasoned Sanford fans as well as those who have never read a Prey book.	2002-06-02

This novel does nothing to put a spark back into a series that is one of the best of all times.<br />The story focuses on the Ghost, a man who leads a human-smuggling operation out of China. He is accompanying a group of his 'cargo' on this trip to the U.S.  He doesn't realize that the FBI and the INS are using Lincoln Rhyme, the foremost criminologist, to help track the ship and capture him.  As the Coast Guard closes on the vessel, something goes wrong, and the Ghost escapes. He pursues the Chinese 'undocumented',while evading the law and the team of Rhyme and Amelia Sachs. <br />The book reveals interesting tidbits about Chinese culture that I was unfamiliar with.  Mr. Deaver also leaves the reader guessing and curious about the identity of the Ghost's bangshou, or spy.  But the majority of the book, is a general rehash of most of the other Rhyme books: Lincoln 'walking the grid' through his partner and lover Amelia. Someone on the case will be resentful and doesn't want Rhyme heading the case, the dialogue between Rhyme and his caretaker Thom, some plot manipulation, and other things that I don't want to write, because of their spoiling effects all are typical of these books.  <br />Overall, not a bad book.  And, if you haven't read a Lincoln Rhyme novel before, then this is a fine one to read: it is a good gauge of what you will get in the others. It's quick and easy.  But, as a long-time Rhyme reader, I felt this installation did not advance the characters any and was only mediocre for the series.	2002-04-03

I have read Carl Hiaasen, and John Sanford and was told that if I liked Hiaasen then I HAD to read Leonard. So I picked up his latest in paperback, Pagan Babies, for a long flight to Europe and back.  Please tell me that this isn't the quintessential Elmore Leonard book!  If so, then I am highly dissappointed.  The book wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. There was no zing, no suspense, no real humor. The characters of Terry Dunn and Debbie were not ones that I felt connections with, or even really cared to read more about. Some of the smaller characters were more enjoyable: Randy, The Mutt, and Johnny Pajonny, but it ends there.  The book coasted along at a relaxed, but easy pace.  I will try another Leonard book (someday) before giving up on him. Hopefully, I will have better luck.	2002-03-17

The author does not try to make the characters very deep, which helps the pace. But at the same time, will not make the book particularly memorable. I found the plot to be too predictable. An example: when secondary characters are introduced, it was obvious their 'skills' would be used later. That was a vague statement, but I do not wish to spoil it for the potential reader. The book takes off immediately, and maintains the high pitch throughout, hoping to distract the reader from questioning the plausability of the story and the actions and reactions of the characters. I have a hard time suggesting this book to anyone wanting some depth to their stories and characters. But, if you want a book that is for helping you to while away the hours, or a no-questions-asked reading experience then this is for you.	2002-03-16

Despite this, the book has helped me to start writing our applications using .NET instead of VB6.  It does some good explanations of fundamentals, and does not bog down too deep in the framework and Microsoft's reasons for .NET . On the down side, it does not give a lot of detail on many other things that may need deeper understanding. There definitely needs to be a second edition or a part 2 to this book to give us those deeper samples. But since it is Wrox, I imagine we will see those in separate titles (such as Professional Web Services, etc.)  Considering that at this time, the final product has not shipped, I think it is a good start.  All-in-all, a good book to use; one of the best on the topic as of this review.	2001-12-31

I went into this book with a very rudimentary understanding of what XML is, and found it to be a good start-off point.  The writing style is simple and straightforward. All the samples are included on the CD, but I found that by typing them in by hand instead, I understood the sections better. Plus, I could change some things and gain even more understanding.<BR>The book explains what XML is, some examples of applications that use XML, and how to display XML data via Cascading Stylesheets, databinding, the Document Object Model, and XSL stylesheets. <BR>As a programmer, I would like to have seen the book tell more about the creation of XML documents from sources other than notepad (i.e. : programmatically) for use in places other than IE ,or at the minimum, have it point at some other resources for this information. <BR>Finally, the book doesn't really wind down - it just stops cold.<BR>Overall, a good primer.	2001-10-24

As a person who likes to savor books, I read this one in two evenings. After Speaking in Tongues, I was a little wary of getting excited about another Jeffery Deaver's book. But as a programmer, I decide to pick it up because it is about something I have an interest in. Wyatt Gillette, a convicted felon, and the California Computer Crimes Unit attempt to stop a man, and an unknown accomplice, who uses his computer for the ultimate evil: murder. Jeffery Deaver throws out a few curve balls to keep the reader guessing, but avoids the unbelievable twists that seem to be rampant in thrillers. Generally I find that hi-tech fictional works are usual laughable in their portrayal and explanations of the technologies involved. Along this line,I have long felt that Michael Crichton is one of the best authors in researching his topics. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Mr. Deaver did a great job in his own; all-in-all, his events and explanations were realistic and they reflect his opinion that the reader is not stupid, without going so far as to be a textbook on the subject.   It is a very fast moving book, and there are complaints that the characters are not deeply developed.  I attribute this to two things. It would take away from the quick pace of the story, and furthermore it is unnecessary.  You learn enough about Wyatt and Phate without needless filler.   Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of spots where I crinkled my nose in disbelief, but it is a work of fiction and it is a very good one at that.	2001-05-19

A number of times, books of this girth have too much filler and not enough substance.  Although it does, at times, ramble a little, this book uses its size to fully explore the world of Erna, a world similar but also very different from our own, with magical powers flowing all around.  Many fantasy books are based upon a standard template for its setting, however C.S. Friedman creates a whole new world with some creative twists.  Because we are unfamiliar with this world and its inhabitants, who are descendants of our own world, she must develop the world and explain so that we may understand it. It evens goes so far as to explain why guns are not used on this world (which was a question of mine).  <br />It takes some time, but in the meantime we are entertained with a pretty good storyline.  I did find myself skimming some of the descriptions of the characters thoughts, but because of the depth of the characterizations throughout the book, I don't feel that I lost anything.  The main storyline is par for the genre (the &quot;good guys&quot; take a long journey to a faraway land to do battle with evil for the motives of revenge, honor, and duty), and the characters are a mixed bag. Gerald Tarrant and Damien are solid but Ciani and Senzei are not, and seem to be secondary.  <br />When put all together, the book is a nice long journey into a refreshing and deep world with hybrid fantasy/sci-fi tones.	2001-04-10

If you really enjoyed the first book, Left Behind, then you will most likely enjoy this one.  However, I read the first one and I liked it okay ( 4 out of 5 stars).  I felt it was simplistic writing with a prepackaged theme, but pretty good nonetheless with potential and it was thought-provoking.<br />This book gives me a totally different view of the authors.  In this installment, the characters are bland and trite, and the authors prejudice, against those who do not subscribe to their doctrine, shines through. The reader is not challenged to think about the implications in this book. I rarely start a book and not finish it, but this time I did. I may pick it up again when I am bored, but I will not continue the series. Bad writing style, mixed with poor, unrealistic characters and a predictable storyline make for wasted time and lost potential.	2001-03-29

The styles are almost like two different writers. This particular book adds nothing to Carl Hiaasen's works that he has not done before.  The plot really had some potential, but was never realized. The idea of ruthless lottery winners not being satisfied with winning only half the lottery is not that farfetched. But the characters, in typical Hiaasen style are out there, slightly resembling some people you could find in the real world.  The hero and heroin share a strange attraction and team up to recover her stolen ticket from some not-ready-for-primetime militia leaders.  In between these characters lie a group of people taking advantage of religious beliefs and so-called miracles. The typical Hiaasen trademarks are in here; something always seems to happen to someone's appendages and there are the cracks on the evil tourist industry in Florida.  Unfortunately, the author almost seemed to be writing this half-heartedly. This book is light reading and moves pretty quick but for real humor, you should check out his other books.	2001-03-15

A trust-funded young man with anger-management problems by the name of Twilly makes it his mission to keep South Florida clean.  His main target is a lobbyist with some fetishes that might be considered strange, until you read about the other characters.  Twilly attempts to teach the man a lesson...several times, but he just doesn't get through to him until he gets the man's dog, renames him and then starts to sabotage one of the lobbyist's biggest projects, the ripples of which reach far into the politics of Florida, which is already funny itself.  An enjoyable addition to this book is that the dog is used as a great character too.  The description of what Boodles/McGuinn is thinking and doing is excellent and doglovers out there will be nodding along with this.  Twilly is an okay character that is actually the most normal of them all along with Desi, the wife of the lobbyist.  The rest of the characters are where the real fun can be found.  The plot is fantastic in both senses of the word, but the characters have basis in real world politicians and slick businessmen, or rather how we might perceive them to be.  Overall, a great book that is refreshing and humorous.	2001-03-15

One for the Money mixes light, realistic characters and a fun, yet exciting, storyline.  Stephanie Plum goes from unemployed to a bounty hunter and doesn't do it without hitches.  Realistically, she runs into some problems that would happen to most people trying this line of work.  There is the suspense and twists that a good mystery novel exhibits tempered with the romance and fun characters( Stephanie and Grandma Mazur) that I am sure you will enjoy, no matter if you are a man or a woman.	2001-02-11

But when I started to read it, I realized my misconception, and grew fearful that I would be preached at for a couple hundred pages.  Again, I was wrong.  IT is definitely a Christian-oriented book, but it wraps it up in a compelling story. The characters are not deeply developed, but that's what the other books in the series are there for. It sets the stage for what is to come in those installments. <br /> Another plus is an associated web-site with message boards to discuss the topics and the series, a nice touch.  Believe me, you do not have to buy into everything the authors convey to enjoy the story. It is pretty light reading, and might get you to think about things.	2001-01-27

He is a top-tier suspense writer, however this book falls well short of his writing abilites, as have been evidenced by his other books.  If you are thinking of starting your first Deaver novel, please check another one.  The book's action is well described, when it occurs.  The actions of the antagonist are beyond belief; they make all the ancillary characters look stupid, and All the characters can't be that stupid.  Even the protagonists in this book are problematic; it is hard to make a connection with them, and I almost found myself rooting against them.  If Dr. Matthews were a little more plausible, then I might have been pulling for him. As it turns out, Megan is the most sensible character in the book.  I do not regret reading this book, however it is not a great one.	2001-01-22

I will attribute this to 2 things. First, I was hungry for some kind of resolution which the Demon Spirit did not give, and secondly the fight scenes were better.  Again, however, I found that the lead characters in this installment are flat, but this flatness does not stop at just the leads; the King of the Land and his court suffer from the same character malaise as do the elves (for which I had high hopes). The worst of it, Pony gets more annoying as the series moves on.  She picks up skills ridiculously quick, when it takes the other characters half of their lives to master. This book and its predecessors seem to serve only as a prelude to the next series, which I cannot imagine will offer up anything new.  Too many flaws in this series that have not been apparent in Mr. Salvatores other writings.	2000-12-14

One of which is the mixed-group of adventurers out to destroy the center of evil and attempt to stop a massive war. This book and its accompanying series do not vary from this tried-but-true theme.  But what can seperate a book apart from others, is the storytelling and characters.  The Demon Spirit has some good storytelling and characters.  Unfortunately these characters are made secondary, while the primary characters are pretty static.  The fighting scenes are &quot;stock&quot; and even skippable at times.  The story develops well for the first 80% of the book, then the main characters do something totally out of character and frankly, stupid: They decide that a tavern-hopping nobleman and a battle-naive young man would be fine guards for a dangerous assassin that was captured .  After this the storyline plummets, the characters lose their respect in the eyes of the reader, and the book ends with no real resolution.  The redeeming quality is the writing and depth of the lands, and hope of improvements in the third installation.	2000-11-30

Salvatore's Cleric Quintet series of books, and the Dark Elf Trilogy and found them to be fun and exciting series.  I picked up this book in anticipation of some more great reading. However, it did nothing to amaze me, nor did it offer anything new.  Generally, books of this genre offer a set of characters that would be considered an odd-assortment &quot;adventure party mix&quot;, and this book stuck to that recipe: a Ranger named Elbryan, a Fighter and his love (Pony), a Centaur (Bradwarden), a magic-wielding Monk (Avelyn) and of course Elves.  I enjoyed the story pretty well, and the characters were developed well enough, but not earth-shattering. There were things and characters I felt were underdeveloped, but overall found it to be a solid and enjoyable story and I will continue on to the next in the series.	2000-11-19

Overkill? Maybe. IF I had bought this book first, I would not have needed the others. The other 2 were Microsoft Press books (see my other reviews) that when combined, did not even come close to covering the material in this tome in appropriate detail. <br /> Although its 1300 pages may be daunting at first, it is packed with useful information for certification and beyond, without a lot of silly fluff. It covers in detail: ActiveX controls, COM components, callbacks, error-handling and debugging, data access, creating user-help, all the way through packaging and deploying your applications via disk, network or web.<br />Beginners beware- this is not the book to start learning VB.

This book does not break any new ground in thrillers.  It mixed a lot of good writing with some unneeded and tangent storylines.  A few good characters developed, but I had a hard time connecting with the protagonist, Kate.  Guessing the killer was somewhat easy and then also somewhat difficult, because of the usual last minute plot twist that is found in books of this type.<br />I felt it was reminiscent of the Kay Scarpetta series of books by Patricia Cornwell, but not on the same level as John Sanford or Jeffery Deaver. Despite the tone of this review, I am looking forward to the next book Dust to Dust, featuring two of the best characters of this book: Kovac and Liska.	2000-09-25

It, like the others, is written in the first person.  IF you start  with the others, like I did, you may find trouble associating with or  understanding Dr. Delaware, the protagonist, and his background.  This book  sets up the characters, lays the foundation for the following books, and at  the same time delivers a great story.  Mr. Kellerman does a good job of  mixing in numerous characters and plot twists to the extent that the first  victim in this book gets &quot;lost&quot; in the middle of the story, but  gets tied back in at the end.	2000-09-06

Will this book give you everything you need to know for the exam?   No.<br />Does it point you in the right direction? Yes, it does that.But you  will need supplemental material AND Practice. <br />Is this book error-filled?  Yes. And the corrections are hard to find.<br />Is it easy to read? Yes. The  language is light enough for someone relatively new to VB 6.<br />It was hard  to tell who the intended audience was.  I have enjoyed much success with  MSPress's Training Kits in the past. As an MCSD Training Kit, it would seem  to be for someone proficient in the language, wanting to know what points  to emphasize in study.  However it is not detailed enough, and is written  in a language style more suited for a newcomer. Overall, this is a pretty  good book to sit down and learn some of the language along with the  Intentions of the VB Exam.  It gives the reader a high-level view of the  language and topics covered.  However, the detail is left to the reader to  find, in either experience or other materials. The exercises are valuable  and the demo exam is not.  <br />The largest problem of this book, besides the  errors, is the price tag:  The cost of this book outweighs the benefits.	2000-08-24

But, my roommate bought Black Notice, and I decided to go ahead and  read it.  On the whole, it is a fairly good book.  The strange victim with  a strange tattoo found with strange hairs starts the book off. The primary  plot revolves around this death, and becomes a little too fantastic (Who's  Afraid of Virginia's Wolf?) .  However, the book is saved by having a  subplot involving what appears to be a new nemesis for Dr. Scarpetta: a  strong woman Deputy Police Chief, attempting to shake up the department and  Marino, Kay's close police friend, and Scarpetta herself. Ultimately, these  two seemingly divergent plots must come together. <br />I have read all the  books in this series, yet I will not profess to understanding all the  complex personalaties and  relationships in the primary characters.   Therefore, if you are thinking of delving into this series, try the earlier  books first.<br />The secondary plot, which almost becomes primary, and solid  writing help make up for an odd story and a weak ending. Furthermore,  Patricia Cornwell attempts to throw some things in the mix to keep  interest, such as the question of &quot;Is Benton really dead?&quot;. <br />My  suggestion: Read the book and enjoy, but don't analyze it.	2000-08-16

Let me  start by saying that I did learn a lot, but the book needs some help, as  has been witnessed by other reviewers.  The examples jumped a lot, which  makes the book seem less cohesive:<br />In the second chapter the author  discusses one application using Northwind, the next chapter we jump to  another application using a Biblio database, in chapter 4 we make yet  another application based on neither of the previous two. Finally in  chapter 5, we go back and build on Chapter 3's project, and then there is  an arcane reference back to the Northwind application, that has gotten lost  in the shuffle, then off to a couple more different samples.A book is  better served with one, maybe two projects that you implement and  improve.<br />The explanations of the sample code are lackluster. Chapters 3  and 4 are the meat of the book; they introduce you to the Object-oriented  side of VB and Object hierarchies, and could have used more in-depth  explanation. The best way to use the book and samples is to build upon them  yourself. However I will say this: there is no doubt that Peter Wright  knows the topic very well, I just wish he could have relayed it better.	2000-08-11

If not, then take it slow, but it can still work.  I took an OOP course featuring C++ and got  lost quickly, but in just a few chapters of Bruce Eckels' book, he helped  me to understand what I had missed. The book starts out with a great  foundation of explaining what objects are, then tells us that Everything is  and object, and explains why. It explained these concepts in simple terms.  The book then pays a little respect to program flow. For those who already  have had programming experience, this is a quick read.  Then it is back to  the OOP ideas and then on into some more advanced Java topics. Excellent  grouping and interesting section titles keep it a relatively light read. It  covers the Java language, not just applets. That was refreshing.	2000-07-06

I say that because during the first 80 pages, I had the feeling that it was going to be the typical Lincoln Rhyme book with Rhyme talking to his assistant Amelia while she  walked the grid. (which would still get the book a good rating). Then bang!  The book takes off, like a roller coaster that eases you up the hill, then  sets you down your way. You find that you can't let go, as it twists and  turns you with the plot and storyline. Just when you think you know what's  going to happen next, it twists. It doesn't let you go until you have  turned the last page, and then some humor in the Author's Note.	2000-07-02

It mainly focuses on the implementation when dealing with databases (using DAO), but covers a little of everything else in the language: ASP, Objects &amp; Classes, and some  things that other books mention in passing.  This is the 3rd VB 6 Book that  I have owned and reviewed, and it outdoes them all in ease of readability  and content.  John Connell does a great job; I cannot think of a major flaw  in this book - errata is covered on the Wrox web site, along with forums to  discuss the book. A great touch for a Publisher.	2000-07-01

This one is easily the most memorable.  It seems Mr. Sanford took a little different approach with this episode. Character interaction was a  lot more appealing than some of the other books. The antagonists characters  were very well defined, and I could almost like them. The plot is one that  is not likely to happen. But, overall it makes for a very quick, and  pleasureable yarn, different than the others. A great book in this genre,  you'll enjoy it.	2000-06-28

After rolling my eyes, I reluctantly agreed.  I thought, how bad can it be,  they're small books. She was nice and gave me one she thought I would  enjoy, Eclipse Bay (? Great, what a title).  (sigh) The truth is.. I  actually did enjoy it. It was an light but exciting read.  I was afraid the  book would be nothing but one stereotypical romance scene after another,  dead wrong again.  It had a solid bit of whodunit quality, some sound  character exchanges and wit (Winston), overall quite engaging. The  characters were as well developed as most other books that I've read,  especially considering the relatively small number of pages. If this is  what her books are like, then I highly recommend Ms. Krentz and this book  to all.	2000-06-17

I found this book to be the average Sanford / Lucas Davenport book.  Nothing out of the ordinary is introduced in this installment of the Prey's and the plot twists were a  bit of a stretch, in hindsight. Despite this, I couldn't help but devour  the book. <br />And , if you have never read John Sanford, then you are in for  a treat with this series and this book is fairly typical.  You will find a  good, but imperfect character in Lucas Davenport whose great skill as a  detective is a contrast to his personal life, and at times you may find  yourself saying &quot;Oh Man Lucas, why are you doing that?&quot;	2000-05-31

Ms. Podlin presents basic Visual Basic in a way that is light and fun .  The flow of the projects are very good, with a real-life small project feel.  The book gives the fundamentals of the language and Environment in a clear  and hands-on manner, and then gives the reader a taste for a number of  different ways in which VB 6 can be used: automation with Office apps,  objects, and database access. From these projects, you can decide which was  the most fun or intriguing for you and pursue that usage of the language.    The downside of the book, as mentioned by another reviewer, is the need for  more explanation on the integration with Excel and Word.  I guess, though,  that this gives more insight into the intricacies of the language.	2000-05-11

For the common layperson, this book is too technical. It tells about the history of lithium, it's full of charts, diagrams of the brain, and statistics.  There is a whole section on having someone committed and  costs.  I'm sure this information may be valuable to some people, but the  book should be titled something else. I don't see how it benefits someone  &quot;Overcoming Depression&quot;.  Most of the pertinent information about  this illness can be found in other resources.  Save your money.	2000-05-03

This kit does a better job of going in depth on a lot of the items that will be tested than the Online Kit(which I have also reviewed).   The practice exercises are good, and the included evaluation copy of SQL  Server allows you to experiment and become more familiar with the product,  along with giving you the books online for additional reference. The  organization of topics is well done, something that I have had issues with  with MSPress books in the past.	2000-04-11

I enjoyed the lecture-style format as opposed to the book-training kits. I agree that it needs to be complemented with Books On-line and Inside SQl Server.  But, I definitely came away with some practical  experience which I am now using on the job.   Knocks on the course, for  improvement:<br />The unit on web publishing, with the wrong quiz questions.  They should gear the exercises to a higher level. If someone is using this  material, MS should make the assumption that we don't need to be told  &quot;to close Microsoft Outlook (or any other application) , click the  close button&quot;. All of these types of statements could have been left  out, and more content added to the course.<br />Despite this, it is still a  good way to learn the material and I look forward to continuing to the next  one.	2000-03-14

I have sworn by MS Press books for all my certification exams and have to say that this one is by far the most disappointing. I found it to be too superficial to be of much benefit.  It works as a decent complement to  other resources, but can't really be a primary resource itself.	1999-12-06

I agree that it could be updated with better end of chapter questions. It is an essentials book, so I didn't expect it to be The Authority on networking; just the basics to  help me pass an exam. It delivered what it said it would.    Of all the  resources that I've used for various certification exams, there is not one  that I have found that has the ability to be the only one to use. And no  book is a substitute for practice/experience.	1999-11-24
