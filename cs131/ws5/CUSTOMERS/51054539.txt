What is wonderful about this story is how Miss Zukas is the a-typical librarian that everyone has always heard of.  Prime, proper and very set in her ways.  Once a murder is committed in her library Miss Zukas becomes involved without really knowing it.  She and her best friend from childhood work together to solve the crime and in the middle get mixed up in more action then they bargained for.  A quick and nice read.	2005-09-12

It follows Walter, a cryptographer and archeologist through his life of obsession.  Starting as a child he has been driven by ruins and finds himself middle aged, with nothing but his work and a translation that he isn't getting very far on.  During his trials, he meets a girls that changes his life.  He chases his career and life to rescue an ancient text.<br /><br />This book was sold as a new Da Vinci Code, which it is not.  It was a fun story but was missing the pull and detail that The Da Vinci Code had.  It is worth reading if you are not set looking for the same type of action/adventure that you got out of Dan Brown's books.	2005-09-12

This story is riddled with interesting facts about Egypt and ancient history.  The main character is an archeologist who believes that archeological finds are just for research, and once you are done with them there is no reason for preservation.  His father is a cruel general for the U.S. military and in the mix is an ex-nun named Mother Earth.  What they all believe is Atlantis is found and they must work together to unlock its secrets.  If you like science fiction, action, adventure, all mixed with a bit of cleverness ... then you will love this story.  This is one of the best books I've read this year.	2005-09-12

We follow a young woman who works as an analyst for the White House.  Her father is currently running for president and is someone whom she does not respect or like.  Meanwhile during his campaign he is bashing NASA who seems to be the fat cow of the current administration.  All of this culminates in an action adventure thriller about which you are constantly trying to figure out who is lying to whom.  A wonderful read and fully worth the slow beginning.	2005-06-28

With a story so short and so full of adventure I would have though that I would grow to care about these people.  But, that wasn't the case.  The story is about a young wizard and his life to maturity, through all the trials of being a child and through manhood.  I would say interesting.

Now, if you know much about computers and you let that get in the way of the story, you will not enjoy this book.  But, if you put all of that behind you and let the story be just a story, then you will enjoy this book a lot.  I do not think this book is Dan Brown's best work, but it is good for laying on the beach type reading.	2005-03-16

So, much so that the characters are over shadowed by it to the point that if you aren't actually experiencing this in your own life, you will probably not like the book.

The chapters are written as if a diary history of 10 years of dating.  The chapters are not immediately connected and the main character is so slimly designed that you could care less if a bus hits her.  I would put this on one of the all time worst chick-lit books ever written.  And to top that off probably one of the worst books ever.

The story is basically about 3 friends and the troubles that relationships bring.  Especially when they are with one another.  The three friends are well developed and their interactions are a wonderful read.

As a matter of fact half way through the book I was wondering why I was reading it.  The characters seemed to be transparent and left little to the imagination.  The mom, crazy girl and slut all seemed to fill their niches rather well.  But, towards the end of the book you start to see all of the driving factors.

Thrown into the mix is a gossip hound named Belinda Black that writes trash about celebrities for a paper.  I found the story hard to get into.  Wendy kept loosing me in which character she was talking about.  They didn't seem to be very well defined.  About ¾ of the way through the story she pulls it together though.  By the end of the story I was enjoying the book and found myself hoping Grace could get it together and not loose herself too much.  The problem is keeping the book open until you hit this point.<br />Grace is a wonderful character that reminds me of a lot of other Wendy female characters in her man troubles and outlook on life.  Belinda is exactly like most of Wendy's money-crazed freaks.  Although by the end of the story both of these characters have evolved and are more true to real-life than some of her others.<br />A worthwhile read - just a slow starter.	2003-08-25

This turns out to be a moot point since they need a nanny more than she wants help writing.  Anna then re-meets a Scottish man and the story takes you to a castle in Scotland.  Needless to say the only interesting character is Cassandra the evil boss who Anna is a nanny for (which I do not think was the intention of the novel).

Maggie is the great looking younger sister that gets whatever she wants because she looks good.  Rose is her smart lawyer that isn't as pretty as her sister.  Seems like a pretty simple plot, but the story and characters have depths that are reviled as you read.  Both sisters are slightly damaged from the loss of their mother at a young age.  The death of their mother is the center of the story and the push for each characters development.  A MUST read!	2003-06-04

The store is about your average family with average kids who all seem to know that they are average. Eliza is a 9-year-old girl that happens to win the class spelling bee and move onto the bigger bee.  Her father, Saul, who is a Jewish religious man, sees something in her that no one else does.  Eliza's older brother, Aaron questions his Jewish faith and begins exploring other religious worlds.  Eliza's mother, Miriam, sees herself as a little girl in Eliza.  Miriam is obsessed with something perfect and this brings the story into a chaotic and twisted fate.  Once you figure out exactly who the characters are, the story takes off and keeps you hoping for a good ending.	2003-04-17

I found the characters to be captivating and real.  Rosie is the typical fairytale girl who falls into a deep dark well and comes out with a dozen roses, and the guy.  Never have I read a story that depicts the country and it's people better.  I laughed throughout the book and cried at the end.  A wonderful book for any time anywhere.  You would most likely have to enjoy British authors to get some of the humor.	2003-03-27

It took me till the last 4 pages, where she tells you who did it, to figure it out.  Once I knew who did it, the whole story feel into place.  But, the story kept me on my toes the whole time.<br />Sam has yet again stumbled into a murder.  This time her best friend Tom has been accused.  She spends her time in a small town outside of London debating her relationship with Hugo and trying to figure out who done it.  This story is a fast mind-tickling read.  I would recommend it to any mystery reader.	2003-02-20

If you like Christopher Moore, you will love this book.  Lamb is the story of Jesus' life between 9-33 (the unwritten years).  The book was both witty and unstoppable.  I couldn't stop reading or telling people about it.  Biff, Jesus' childhood friend, tells the story.  The tale revolves around Jesus trying to figure out how to be the messiah by finding the three wise men and learning from them.  It is fun to draw the lines between what Jesus learns and what is actually written in the New Testament.  This story paints Jesus as a human who is lost like us all, and trying to find the way.  Incredibly funny and one of the best books I have ever read!	2003-01-23

Each story goes into some sort of detail about their crazed lives.  Since four short stories were put together, none of them are really complete.

She meets men she loves and rich men.  She tries to figure out what is more important to her.  This book had me laughing out loud and crying.  One of the best books I have read this year.

The book starts off slow - and I was tempted to put it down.  But, something kept me reading.  In the end I was very happy I stuck with it.  The story revolves around a famous one hit wonder named Bee and her younger sister Ana.  Ana and Bee haven't spoken in years - but when Bee dies, Ana is forced to travel to London and clean up Bee's possessions.  While in London Ana figures more out about Bee than she ever really wanted to know - and she learns who she really is.  This book has more twists in it than a Red Vine.  It will keep you intrigued, guessing, crying and loving the characters.	2002-06-04
US	51054539	R2DYRNSVFQA9FV	0609808656	269597282	Chained: A Sam Jones Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Decent	Chained is not my favorite of the Sam Jones novels.  This book was again centered on a mystery of sorts and drama (in all forms), but the \\"kick [backside]\\" detective girl was just slightly off (and no mantra to the mini skirt - which is a key Jones symbol).  It could be that she has a steady man, or that she was written to be less aggressive, but whatever the reason it makes her less of a hero and more of a normal character.  I liked Sam as the [bootie] kick action hero type.  I also found the \\"chained\\" part of the story a bit too dark.  Over all a good read - but not the best one.	2002-05-24

The premise of this story is that Earth is fighting an alien race throughout the galaxy.  Humans move through collapsers to locations for fighting the aliens.  When moving through collapsers, time gets dilated (for the traveler).  The main character ages hundreds (and then thousands) of Earth years per one of his years.  This is why it is the Forever War.  Interesting fun read.	2002-03-12

The main character is supposed to be a sweet, innocent, small town girl who you just never fall in love with.  Her character isn't developed in a realistic way.  As a matter of fact most of the town folks aren't real.  This wouldn't be such a problem had the novel not been rounded enough to even keep you interested.  The only reason I finished the book was to find out if there were really aliens or not.  The alien story line was the only part of the novel that kept me interested.  A disappointing read.	2002-02-26

I would actually venture to say on par with her first Bridget Jones novel.  Bridget goes though similar problems from the first book - as well as some VERY different problems.  She as always over analyzes everything.  Messes a lot of stuff up.  And yet keeps moving forward.  If you liked the first book you will love the second.  A must read for any Bridget fan.	2002-01-02

I was let down with the lack of real direction or character development.  The story revolves around a young man who is helping an older gentlemen drive across the country to return Einstein's brain to a living relative.  Their journey explores all kinds of ideas about Einstein.  But, leaves you wondering how would Einstein feel about his brain being driven across America in a Tupperware container.  I felt that the author could have done more to move the book down a path that could have kept my interest.  Instead I was happy to be done with the book.	2001-08-23

The main character is a pilot named Tuck Case who is your run of the mill looser.  He gets put into one crazy situation (which I am not going to tell you about) and he rises to the occasion in more than one manner.  Not only is Tuck a great character, but there are TONS of wonderful people to read about.  Kimi (a transvestite hooker) and his/her bat, the Shark people, the Sky Priestess a Sorcerer and Ninjas.  These characters are well rounded and more three dimensional then most people I know.  Moore's best novel to date!	2001-03-01

It just didn't keep me wanting more or wishing the story had continued.  Instead I was kind of happy when it was over so that I could move on.  Please don't get me wrong. It is good.

As Willie Morris says in the dedication, &quot;And to every person who ever loved a cat&quot;  I couldn't agree with him more.  This book is a true story of how a &quot;dog man&quot; becomes a &quot;cat man&quot;.  Starting from the get go Willie tells you all about why he has hated cats and what dogs have meant to him.  Then he tells about the first time he and his bride to be (The Cat Woman) get a cat as a gift.  The kitten and cat tales just continue from here.  Reading this book will make you laugh, love your kitty more and find Spit McGee to be an ordinary cat that a not cat person realizes is extraordinary just because of his catness.
