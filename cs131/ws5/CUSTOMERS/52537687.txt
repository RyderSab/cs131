This book is about as realistic as it gets, the analysis of the internal and political problems start-up companies face is dead on. Steve Winn is a classic example of the salesman CEO, one who will say anything to close a sale. This book is a fantastic case study for anyone interested in understand the excesses of the .com era. The excessive spending, the focus of revenue, and the approval of garbage business plans. This book is also a testament to how far one can get with A+ salesmanship.<br />After reading this book, I decided to look up Steve Winn and see what he is up to these days. The book mentions the fact that Winn seemed to find religion shortly before he was ousted, now he is pushing books on terrorism denouncing Islam trying to cash in on 9-11. If you read this book, do an Amazon and Google search on Steve Winn, hilarity will ensue. Even his bio on the 700 club page has the typical Winn exaggerations. For more laughs, be sure to check out Winn's book about how his company was ruined by everyone else but him.	2003-03-25

Thinking about starting a company? Read this book to find out what it really takes to create a successful high-tech company. This book covers just about every detail and sacrifice you will need to make. A lot of techies aspiring to be the next Bill Gates thought they could start a company based upon the merits of their idea alone, but the facts are it takes a lot more than a good idea to create a successful high tech company.<br />The book outlines the whole process from initial idea to IPO. The book tends to focus on the IPO-Venture model for startups, giving little ink to other methods. The only downside of this book is it was written during the height of the .CON boom, so don't expect to find the magic formula for developing a startup in today's business climate. The information dealing for personnel, legal, IP, and getting VC funding is worth the cover price alone. Overall, this is an extremely informative book and a must read for anyone thinking about starting a company or joining a startup.	2003-03-15

From his beginnings as an awkward boy in NYC, all the way to rise of the free software movement. I figured this book would be written from extremely pro-gnu standpoint, but I was pleasantly surprised to find an objective account of Richard's issues with the open source movement.	2003-03-15

Even if you only write the occasional e-mail, &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; is a worthwhile companion for the most casual of writers. The book is clear and concise, weighing in at less than a hundred pages. The 4th edition does not stray from the formula of previous editions, but it does add a handy glossary and modernized examples. If you own the third edition, there is no practical reason to go out and purchase the new edition.	2002-12-09

The Illustrated History of Electronic Games	Books	5	4	6	N	N	A Trip Back To Memory Lane	Remember when games were made by handful of coders and they're names were featured prominently on the box? High Score is great book that provides a history of electronic gaming from it's beginnings with spacewar all the way up to recent titles such as Unreal. The book is divided by decades and is further subdivided by game companies. I wouldn't really call it a &quot;coffee table book&quot; because it's definitely a book you can sit down and read just for the history.<br />The pictures are amazing, each company has pictures of developers, screenshots, and boxshots. The book tends to focus on computer games more than console, and doesn't talk much about more modern arcade games. IMHO, I think the book focused on the right points, there is no way you could have unabridged illustrated history without ending up with a 1000 page monstrosity. If you've played games for a long time like me, this book will bring back tons of memories. Younger gamers would probably like it for the history, but older gamers and even people who just work in the industry will appreciate this book.	2002-11-27

This book is not language specific; almost all of the concepts can be applied to virtually any language. Besides dealing with how to write better code, &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; discusses project management, team dynamics, user expectations, and a host of other topics. At only 250 pages, this book does not go in to great detail in any one topic, yet there is enough information for anyone to implement the practices suggested in the book. I recommend this book to anyone who is in the field of software development: developers, project managers, systems analysis, and even managers who want a better understanding of how the software development process should be.	2002-11-14

In this book, Clayon Christensen explains why seemingly good companies fail to embrace disruptive technologies.

It is a good book for people who are new to programming, but packs enough meat at 1100+ pages for people like me who have programmed in other languages and are looking to pick up Java. Horton does a wonderful job explaining basic principles of object oriented design and the right way to document code.

Easy to Follow	TCP/IP Sockets in Java is a great way for any Java programmer to get started. The code examples are numerous yet thorough and clear. This book should be enough information to get any Java programmer started with the sockets API. There are a few things that this book is not. Its not a complete reference of the sockets API. Its not a thorough reference of TCP/IP. Finally, this book is not for people who are new to Java. Overall a great book if you want to get started with TCP/IP in Java.	2002-10-31

In \\"Next,\\" Michael Lewis looks at the social implications of the Internet by interviewing a few ordinary individuals who have managed to do extraordinary things on the Internet. The first section deals with Jonathan Lebed, the 15 year old stock trader from a blue collar family, who managed to turn $8,000 in to $800,000 by pushing stocks in owned via [false]press releases of financial boards.<br />The second section of the book deals with another fifteen year old who managed to become the top rated legal advisor on the askme.com website, even though he came from a poor family, never touched a law book, and learned about the law exclusively from the internet and television. In both these cases, ordinary boys who otherwise would be categorized as [normal], managed to do extraordinary things by using the Internet.<br />The other sections of the book deal with gnutella, tivo, polling, the sense of time, and the idea that accessibility of information due to technology may lead to the downfall of mankind. I really enjoyed this book, but I though that overall it was rather incomplete, this book could have been easily doubled in size by examining more social phenomenon. I was really surprised that there was very little ink spent on the open source movement and how strangers are now collaborating on major projects. This was partially covered in the gnutella chapter, but you could write a whole book on the social implications of open source development.	2002-10-23

I did not have high expectations for this book, but to my surprise I could not put it down after opening it. As a prospective entrepreneur, I wanted to get a sense of what it is like to start your own company from the founder's point of view, but I wanted to hear about real companies, with real products, not glorified IPO get rich schemes. This book supports my belief that when looking at case studies, one can learn much more from failures, than successes. As a techie, Mousedriver seemed doomed to fail from the start because they were trying to push a novelty item as a high end product in a croweded market. One question that the book does not seem to cover is, &quot;Was this business a failure?&quot; Platinum concepts did not come close to reaching their sales estimates, but they did break even. Can a failing business be considered a success because of the lessons learned? In the case, it seems to that the answer is a definite yes, because these two entrepreneurs are teaching and inspiring potential company founders, at a time when most people in the business world are just trying to survive. After reading this book, my desire to learn my own lessons has increased considerably.	2002-10-21

The book started out great with an accurate assessment of Columbus and colonial atrocities only to go off on a tangent come 1776. Here is a list of some of Zinn's opinions that he puts forth as fact:<br />-The Constitution was written in such a way to give the lower classes the illusion of equal rights.<br />-The Founding Fathers wanted to maintain the status quo<br />-The Labor movement is always right.<br />-The Depression was caused by class division<br />-Abraham Lincoln was a racist, who freed the slaves in desperation.<br />-Big Industry has done nothing but exploit the worker<br />The best way to show the bias of Zinn's prose is to look at any passage where he mentions statistics, especially in the chapters dealing with the labor and socialism movements. He always will highlight x amount of strikers dead, but he rarely talks about casualties when it does not help his argument. The portion of the book dealing with the 20th century is so incomplete, its not worth even noting in this review.  This book would be more accurately titled as &quot;Howard Zinn's opinions on United States History.&quot;	2002-10-18

Overall, I think this book does a good job of going through most of CVS's features, however I think there could of been a little more detail in the administration section and dealing with permissions. I was pleasantly surprised that besides covering CVS, this book gives some great background in to the OSS movement and the advantages of OSS in general.

This book appeals to a wide variety of readers, it is written in way that doesn't scare off newbies, but manages to have enough meat for experienced Linux users. The great thing about this book is it spends a fair amount of time explaining how to do things on a variety of distros.<br />Parts of the book that stand out in my mind are the chapters dealing with kernel recompilation, scripting and security. The kernel recompilation chapter is by far the best material I've seen on the subject to date, it almost makes kernel recompilation sound too easy. The security chapter is good starting point for sysadmins that are new to Linux. The book also provides a nice little introduction to scripting, although if your going to be a Linux sysadmin, the Orielly books on bash and perl are a must.<br />There were very few things that I didn't like about this book. One thing that stands out in my mind is the author's insistence on using paper journal books for logging system changes. With the proper backup procedures in place, a web based system log is a much more efficient way of keeping tracking of changes. Overall, the book is must read for anyone new to Linux and is also a good pickup for seasoned Linux users. I've been recommending this book over Running Linux as of late, since the Oreilly offering is showing its age.	2002-06-20

This book takes a deep look into the third great merger movement which led to the birth of the conglomerate merger. Williamson gives a detailed summary of the events leading to the third merger movement, and also includes a brief explanation of the policy changes that occurred during the Nixon administration. This book highlights many of the legal precedents set by the Supreme Court which today seem to be ignored by the antitrust wing of justice department in recent administrations.<BR><br /><BR>The most interesting chapter of the book deals with the Supreme Court's interpretation of section 7 under the leadership of Earl Warren. In every case out of the sixteen antitrust cases which reached the Supreme Court, the court ruled in favor of the justice department, concluding that ANY merger which substantially reduces competition violates section 7. Unfortunately, the court can only rule the cases brought before it, and the languid approach to antitrust in recent years has lead to a legal environment where the actions of multination conglomerates go unchecked.	2002-06-03

As 3-series owner, this was a great to book to get a sense of the history of the car and a partial history of the company itself.

I knew the book was going to give some shocking statistics and stories, but the aspects I found most interesting were the stories from individuals who owe their great success and failure to fast food. Schlosser take a look at the usual cast of characters, Kroc, Thomas, and the Coronal, but he also profiles the entrepreneurs of the supporting industries. One myth that I'm glad he cleared up was the idea that purchasing a franchise is an easy way to &quot;get rich quick.&quot; People seem to think the franchise route is the easiest way to start a business. Schlosser profiles franchisees that signed up looking for the American Dream and got more than they bargained for, very interesting read.	2002-02-14

The 7 habits is a timeless collection of values which can be traced back to early religious teachings and the protestant work ethic. I'm not a big personal development reader, I was assigned this book in a management course, but I think reading the 7 habits can benefit everyone. The fundamentals behind the 7 habits have been in place for a very long time. Covey recognized these fundamentals and puts them to use in to an consolidated reference. <br />I don't agree with all that Covey says, I really think he tries to bring in too much spirituality in to this book. Also, some of his examples are all too rosy. How come there are no examples of failures? Surely he hasn't had a 100% success rate as a consultant. We can learn much if not more from failures than successes.<br />I still think this is a great book but the reader needs to look at this book objectively. Too many people read this book and follow Covey blindly without taking the time to analyze his examples and concepts.	2002-02-09

I find most of this information to be commonly known or discussed amongst the geek community, but it's great to have such keen insight packed in to this small book.

It is non-technical book that would be a great intro to P2P, especially for &quot;suits&quot; who only think of Napster when you mention the word P2P. There are loads of gems in this text; I recommend this book to any computer enthusiast.<br />The chapters start out strong, but I lost interest in a few of latter chapters, which tend to be a little redundant. There seemed to be a little too much emphasis on decentralized systems and anonymous file sharing. A few chapters appear to focus on broad topics but actually focus on the particular author's project. For Example, the security chapter was more or less an overview of grove networks.

Levy seems to focus a little too much on MIT and homebrew (especially MIT), but it should be considered that this book was written in the early 80's. I find it odd that he seems to highlight and glorify various hackers' objections to cigarette smoke, which leads me to believe that he himself is an ardent non-smoker.<br />One section of the book that I thought was one-dimensional is the section dealing with Ken Williams. Levy would have you believe that Sierra was the force in electronic gaming at the time but there were a lot of companies doing much more interesting and creative projects than Sierra at the time. Another gripe is that Levy does not make any mention of European or Japanese hackers. Hacking, even in the 70's was a global phenomenon. <br />Overall, &quot;Hackers&quot; is a must read for anyone interested in the history of personal computing.	2001-10-18

If you want to read up on Bill Gates, this is definitely the book to start with. The author does a great job balancing Microsoft's successes and failures. Each chapter gives insight in to why Microsoft is the monstrosity it has become. This book covers the history of Bill G. up to windows 3.0.	2001-08-31

Every topic has real world examples and the author never gets too technical with the descriptions. This book would be perfect for a survey course in infosec. The only complaint I have about this book is that the author tends to focus too much on cryptography, his specialty. PKI and other forms of encryption are an important part of infosec, but the majority of attacks bypass any form of cryptography altogether.	2001-08-27

Not only is the book enjoyable, it also has some good one liners like, &quot;Now, the only reason you might ever open the GIF89a dialog box again would strictly be for nostalgia... kind of like playing an old Donny and Marie album, just to torture yourself with bad memories of the past.&quot; If you are a graphic designer moving from the print to the web world this book is a great start. This book does not make a good reference or guide for advance photoshop techniques. If you are just starting out in photoshop, this is the book for you if you just plan on editing web graphics.	2001-08-01

This book is great if your have some knowledge of Linux and the open source community. The best part is towards the end when you get Linus's moderate opinions of a variety of topics. I just started using Linux in the past few years and I always thought that Linus shared the same views as Richard Stallman. This is not the case at all, it turns out Linus has really practical views when it comes to open source software and IP in general. The first 1/2 of the book is a brief history of Linux. This book is a really quick read. It turned out to be much more entertaining than I originally thought it would be.	2001-07-29

There is no reason to pay for classes when any reasonable intelligent person with a decent background in computers can pass the tests using just these books.	2001-07-03

I've read a couple of books on HTML but this is by far the best and most complete reference. I would recommend this book to beginners and seasoned HTML gurus. Even if you are extremely proficient in HTML there are probably a lot of tags you don't know about that can be very helpful in certain situations and there are probably a lot of tags you use that are depreciated under the HTML 4.0 standard.<br />The book is an easy read for anyone and explains every tag imaginable in detail. I really have no complaints except for maybe a few minor issues. A lot of depreciated tags are mentioned very early on in the book let the author does not list any viable alternatives except CSS. The CSS chapter is halfway through the book and only talks about very basic CSS commands. Ifyou are really serious about HTML I would recommend purchasing Orielly's CSS book unless you want to continue using depreciated tags.<br />Overall, I think this is the best HTML book available. I haven't read a bad Orielly book yet.	2000-11-28
