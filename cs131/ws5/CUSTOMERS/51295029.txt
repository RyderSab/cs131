It focuses much of its attention on the private lives of Chopin and his partner George Sand.<br /><br />Any biography of Chopin has to include the period of his involvement with Sand, for it was the most important relationship of his adult life.  The book tells of how the two lover's relationship finally turned into a parent/offspring situation, with Sand regarding Chopin as just another of her children.<br /><br />It seems that Chopin was, because of his illness or personality or probably both, needed someone to take care of him.  Even negotiations with music publishers werer entrusted to friends.  Before the break-up came to Chopin and Sand, Chopin's health was already getting worse, and when he was out on his own again it wasn't long before tuberculosis took its toll.<br /><br />Chopin was a man that constantly lived beyond his means, was forever in debt, had no qualms about borrowing money from family and friends knowing full well he would never be able to repay them.  He was a man of rather common background, but moved into the world of aristocracy and artists.  Along the way he picked up aspects of noble snobbery and prejudice, and it is revealing to know that of all his piano students (of which there were many), most were persons of the nobility and aristocracy. It was a subject of braggadocio to have studied piano with Chopin, and he was one of the most expensive piano teachers in Paris.  There was no piano progeny of Chopin, no great student that ever became a leading pianist or musician.<br /><br />But these are but human facts.  All humans by nature are full of good and bad traits.  It is Chopin's music that is the important thing, and the author touches on some of it in this book.<br /><br />A good introduction to the life of Chopin, his music, and the times it was written.

This book is a combination of history, biography, music commentary, geneology of the two men, all woven together in a fine tapestry.  The author manages to pack a lot of information in a relatively short book, and does it in a way that is far from fragmentary.  It is a most engaging narrative written with great style.<br /><br />And in the end, a meeting that can be viewed as a way for the Great Frederick to stump the Great Bach, ends up with \\"Old Bach\\" besting the plan.  Bach had to sit and play even before he could refresh himself from his long trip, and improvised on a very complicated theme given by Frederick.  And as if that wasn't enough, after Bach returned home he wrote 'A Musical Offering', a set of dazzling pieces based on that complicated theme.<br /><br />This book combines two of my main interests, history and music.  I started reading it on a very hot summer Saturday, and was so captivated by it, read straight through the rest of the day.  A most enjoyable way to beat the summer heat!<br /><br />Most highly recommended!	2005-07-14

Books such as these are a wealth of historical tid-bits that are presented in an easily read style.  The author continues to shed new light on old tales by including reecent findings on the subjects covered.

Biblical scholarship, with the help of the discovery of ancient texts such as the Dead Sea Scrolls has revealed the great diversity of thought that made up Christianity in the first three centuries after the death of Jesus.   <br /> <br />It wasn't until the fourth century and the adoption of Christianity as the state religion of Rome that Christianity went through a period of codification and setting of official dogma.  Fundamentalist Christianity today continues the traditions and dogma put in place by politicians and church elders of the fourth and fifth centuries.  Beliefs of a different age, and a society much different than our own.  <br /> <br />It was then that beliefs became law, for there was no division between church and state...indeed, a heretic in those times was guilty of not only treason against God, but against the state.  In this book by John Shelby Spong, he exposes how the Bible has been used to suppress the opposers of the state and its religion.   <br /> <br />He tells how the Bible has been used to keep women as second-class citizens, how scripture has been used to justify cruelty and tyranny.  His words are the words of a man that has studies the Bible all of his life, given his life to working for God and the followers of Jesus. While many will not agree with him, there is no doubting his scholarship and dedication to Christianity. <br />  <br />It has been said that the days of the prophets are gone. I disagree.  John Shelby Spong, Marcus Borg and others are speaking out against the iniquities of ancient biblical thought that continue to be practiced. We need people like them to speak out.  There are many that wish to maintain the old thoughts about God and keep people in fear.  For those, this book will be a revulsion.  For others that look for a different way, this book could be a revelation. <br /> <br />Highly recommended	2005-05-05

It is written as a chronological narrative, and is a good general history of Britain.<br /><br />It explores not only the personalities that lived the history, but tells about how English culture was brought about.  Through the ancient Celts, the invasions of the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Danes and the Normans, Britain was influenced by different cultures and traditions.  These influences, along with the influence of Christianity, was molded into a country as diverse as those influences.<br /><br />Most important events and personages are mentioned, some in passing and some at more length.  In any case, a book like this won't be filled with minute details, but instead gives a broad view of the history of this great country.  So if there's a specific time or event that you want to know more about, you'll find but small reference to it here.<br /><br />At 700+ pages, this is not a short narrative.  But the fact that it took so many pages to paint but a broad picture of the history of Britain says volumes about how rich the history of this nation is.<br /><br />Written in a very readable style, and considering the type of history it is, I can't think of a better book for an overview of the history of Britain.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-05-02

There are countless books published every year that add to an already huge amount of material and opinion about those times.  This book's value lies in that we have an opportunity to read interviews held with numerous members of Hitler's government from all levels.<br /><br />That is not to say that there are any real revelations revealed by these interviews.  For the most part, the defendants and witnesses pass the buck, claim ignorance, or admit to only doing their job.  So it is primarily a discourse on how some peole can participate in a government, particularly a war-time government, and justify, ignore, or gloss over their acts as 'merely following orders'.<br /><br />History is mostly written by the victors.  And while I absolutely do not defend any of these people's actions, it has made me ask myself these questions: What if the tables were turned? What if the allies lost the war and were subjected to the same type of criminal trials?  What if a world court would hold similar proceedings for the leaders in this country during the Vietnam war, and more recently the Iraq war?<br /><br />I am not comparing any of our leaders with the Nazi leadership, or what the Nazis did. But accusations of atrocity and pursuing an aggresive war can really only be made against a country that has been defeated.<br /><br />This underlines the gruesome fact that, no matter how 'civilized' we try to make war, it is ultimately an uncivil act.  War itself is the atrocity, and during the heat of battle and under the influences of any idealogy, war crimes are committed.  Whether for the fatherland, protection of national security, or war on terrorists, the opportunity for 'crimes against humanity' are apparant, and most generally committed to ensure 'victory'.<br /><br />So it boils down to a simple premise:  War should only be a last resort.  When diplomacy fails, then war perhaps is necessary if there is an attack on a country or 'just cause' is proven without a doubt. To enter a war for any other reason is wrong, for history has shown that war is inhuman.  It is the 'legal' form of murder, for victory in war means that you kill more of them than they kill of you.  Plain and simple.<br /><br />There is much to be learned from these interviews, and much to be learned from history in general.  As the saying goes, those that do not remember history are doomed to repeat it.  Have we forgotten already?there is an attack on a country or 'just cause' is proven without a doubt.

It is all well and good to espouse beliefs, but the narrowness comes in the fact that this is a book essentially about Christianity.  The author does take the Christian right and left to task.  But the author also seems to think that his viewpoint is the more 'Christian', hence I detect a note of 'This is the way it really is' mindset. The author has no more of a monopoly on truth than anyone else.<br /><br />And what about other religions outside of Christianity?  The author does make some token remarks about inclusion of these religions, but his primary focus remains Christianity. As this is presumably what the author intended, he makes a good case for his beliefs.<br /><br />But these criticisms are mere personal opinion.  The book is a pretty good read.  Worth reading if you're concerned about how religion, specifically Christianity, can fit into the modern world.	2005-03-17

There are plenty of other book about him that deal much more in depth, but this book makes for a good beginning.<br /><br />He was a man of tremendous ambition that was concerned with climbing the social ladder.  Indeed, he was one of the richest men in Virginia at the time.  But the fact remains that after the end of the Revolutionary War he resigned his commison and went back to his Mount Vernon farm.  Instead of taking advantage of his tremendous popularity at a time when he could have easily grabbed a lot of power from the young nation, he wished nothing more than to become a country farmer.  That fact tells volumes about his character.  How many men would have not taken advantage of the situation?<br /><br />Not to put him on a pedestal, or portray him as a saint, this book tells of his ambition, his concern with climbing further into the social strata, and also tells of his love for the new-founded country.  He was a great man, and totally human.<br /><br />A good short introduction to George Washgington, and another great volume in the series!	2005-02-18

There was always something about him, a certain style that he had on screen, that was unique.<br /><br />This book does tell the truth behind the real W.C., and dispells many of the myths that still are current about him.  He was a man that was in turn cantankerous, gentle, funny and poignant.<br /><br />I for one never realized that he was such an avid reader.  Books seemed to be his passion, and all during his world travels as a vaudeville juggler he carried trunks of books along the way.  Anyone that reads so voraciously is bound to be an interesting personality.  His vast reading no doubt contributed to his comedy that involved the word play for which he is famous.  It is astounding to know that for many years in the early part of his career when he was a juggler, that he did his act in almost total silence!<br /><br />A great biography that reveals the unique character that was W.C.

There is a difference, just as there is a difference between liberals and progressives.  These are examples of Lakoff's idea of how words and terms are used to frame an issue or position.<br /><br />The true meaning behind the words used to frame an issue or position is what kind of an 'image' the words conjure in the mind.  If the proper words are chosen, then it is Lakoff's assumption that no matter if a person is for or against the issue in question, if they use the words within a given 'frame', the image will be constant.  Such is the power of words!<br /><br />This book should help all of us recognize the words that are used by people and politicians in power and what those words truly mean.  It is nothing less than a mind-shift and a growing awareness that sometimes it really doesn't matter what is being said, but how it is being said.<br /><br />Recommended	2004-12-22

A popular president wasn't necessarily a good president.  As far as what each president accomplished during his tenure, sometimes it takes a long time for the policies of a president to catch up with events.  Perhaps a president that gets credit (or blame) for an outcome of a situation deserves neither.  The outcome may have come about because of the policies of his predecessors.<br /><br />While I found this book interesting, ranking of the presidents for me remains a matter of opinion.  The men and women that did the ranking are scholars, journalists, historians and political leaders. Perhaps these people had ther historical facts to make their decisions, perhaps they did not.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of this book ws the choice of authors for the very short articles about each president.  Whether historically accurate or not, it was rather interesting to read the thoughts of Robert Bork about Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  This is the most glaring example in the book of authors chosen that were opposite in their political thinking to their presidential subjects.<br /><br />I will admit that this makes for an interesting read, but not solid history.  It merely leads to short vignettes that are also short on scholarship.<br /><br />The good read was worth four stars.  The mere opinions about the great and not so great was only worth two.	2004-12-06

But pick it up I did, and the more I read, the more I was surprised.  Me, agreeing with Pat Buchanan?<br /><br />Not on everything, but more than I would have thought.  He exposes the foreign policy of the Bush administration for what it is...American Imperialism.  Is it in this country's best interest to interfere in the affairs of other countries because we simply don't agree with them?  Is it necessary for Iraq and other middle east countries to adopt our form of government, or be labeled as enemies? Is the only way for our country to feel safe is for us to have all the bombs?<br /><br />Nothing less than a complete change of foreign policy is needed, according to the author, or we will continue to fight wars as in Iraq. We will continue to lose jobs overseas in the name of so-called free trade.<br /><br />This is a book for everyone that is concerned with the direction our country has taken.

It sheds a lot of light on a man that was as complex as he was talented.  Wolf learned his craft from blues legends, like Charley Patton, and took the blues he heard when he was a child and molded it into his own sound.  With a voice that was truly unique and actually quite flexible, he put everything he had into a song.<br />It tells the heroic story of a man born in the south in the first decade of the 20th century amid grinding poverty, extreme racial prejudice, and an unhappy childhood, that found his freedom and his place in the world of the traveling blues man. His early life scarred him both physically and emotionally, and it can be heard in his music.<br />The musical structure of his music could be very simple sometimes, but he put so much heart, so much emotion into it that the music is never boring, never trite.  His childhood and life were hard, but his music is not merely a reflection of hard times.  It also can reflect the joy he took in his talent and sharing it with people. A totally unique performer and voice in all of music, not just the blues. And a truly unique man.<br />The book is well written and is easy to read, with many bluesmen telling about their encounters with 'The Wolf'.<br />Highly recommended!	2004-06-05

Gives the reader much room for thought on these subjects, and also makes you realize that all of the brainpower and genius that has gone into this scientific thought has not prevented the ones with the brains from being human.<br />The history of science is full of intrigue, back-stabbing, petty quarreling, arguing, refuting and 'cooking the books' to promote your pet theory.

It tells a fascinating story about a man and his talents and his demons.  A man that made some very bad career choices because of his cavalier attitude about money.  It tells the whole tale, warts and all, and gives a very lucid picture of an intelligent, talented actor that was ever the dedicated craftsman, no matter how bad the picture was that he was in.<br />The book especially casts some light on Bela Lugosi Jr. and his lawsuits dealing with his father's image.  The light it casts does not portray Junior in a pretty picture.<br />The only negative criticism I have is the author's penchant for going into multi-page synopses of Lugosi's pictures interwoven with the text.  I found this to interrupt the flow of the book, but that is my personal opinion.  Perhaps for others, the synopses would be more than welcome.<br />But that minor personal criticism does not deter me from giving the book 5 stars.  Well-researched, well written, a must for any Lugosiphile!	2004-01-25

It remains an excellent analysis of Beethoven's 9 symphonies.  Along with copious music quotations of the symphonies, the author has integrated some history of Beethoven's historical times and quotes letters and anecdotes that reveal not only the music but the personality of this composer.<br />The author's knowledge of the scores of the symphonies is extraordinary.  For anyone with more than a passing interest in the symphonies of Beethoven, I can't think of a better book for the money.  While it is impossible to name any composer as the greatest, Beethoven must be acknowledged as one of the great architects of musical form and expression.  George Grove's book underlines the genius of this composer, and is highly recommended	2004-01-05

The calmness in which Hoess relates his story is disturbing.  Regardless of whatever was in this man's background that led to his beliefs and actions does not lessen the lack of morals and ethics exhibited by him, unless a person's actions can be merely attributed to his upbringing.<br />Unfortunately, the real value of this book is not recognized by recent events in Bosnia, Palestine, Israel, and other parts of the world.  'Ethnic cleansing' is a term I detest.  Why not call it what it is, mass murder with a capital 'M'.  There is no room for euphemisms when it comes to millions of people being slaughtered.<br />A disturbing book indeed, but one that should be more widely read and understood.

It is an interesting story of how, 1,700 years ago, Christianity was a religion that had many different beliefs.  The formation of Christian dogma was a very political move to try and bring all of these beliefs under one catholic (meaning universal) church.  The Gnostics were accused of heresy because they could not be controlled by the hierarchy of the early church, and thus were labeled heretics.<br />Despite the passing centuries, that has seen much of alternative christian thought being banned and destroyed, the thoughts and beliefs of these early 'heretic' christians are still being hotly debated in the religious community today.<br />A very good book!

He takes his thoughts and summarizes them, then puts them into an overall context that unites all of his beliefs into his own personal way of spirituality.<br />He offers a different way to look at spirituality, a different way to try and reach what all Christians are trying to reach...a life firmly rooted in the teachings of Jesus.  This way is not for everyone, admits Borg.  He even says that if the way towards Jesus that you are following works for you, then more power to you.  But he demonstrates a way for others whom the more 'traditional' ways of spirituality do not work.<br />Some have called Borg a radical, accused him of heresy.  But if you compare his writings to someone like John shelby Spong, Borg could even be called moderate in his thought.  In any case, the ideas of Borg, Spong, and other contemporary writers on religion are really not new.  Some of these ideas have been floating around since the Enlightenment of the 18th century.  But in these modern times, these ideas get to see the light of day.<br />A great book.  Food for thought, and at the least a book for those who disagree to argue with!  Recommended.	2003-12-14

Not expecting any kind of virtuosity, I thought I could learn enough to perhaps play in an amateur string quartet or something like that.  I knew it would take time and be a lot of work, but I've been playing the piano for a long time and figured a different instrument would be a good change of pace.<br />After a few months of cramped fingers, a stiff neck, and a bow arm that was more suited to sawing lumber, I gave up.  Not that I'm a quitter by any means, but I am a realist.  Besides, the sounds that I produced would cause every feline in the neighborhood to congregate outside my window.  Don't know what my 'music' sounded like to them, but do you realize how much noise a herd of howling cats can make?  But all was not lost.  The violin hangs above the piano, next to a copy of a Renoir painting.  It looks very nice there, and there it shall stay.<br />But I'll always have a fascination for violin playing.  Hence, I bought this book, primarily for the Chaconne for solo violin.  I was familiar with the Busoni transcription, and even flirted with the idea of learning the Brahms transcription for left hand only (by the way, I'm a lefty, but that didn't make the Brahms any easier!).  But I wanted to see for myself the demands Bach made on the poor fiddle player.<br />Bach can be a very demanding composer, but the demands are always in service to the music he wrote. The Chaconne deserves every accolade and legendary status that it has.  It is a truly phenomenal piece of absolute music that taxes the interpreter absolutely in every way.  It is one of those pieces that exists in the stratosphere, positively unique in its makeup and emotion.<br />Dover does it again!  There is much music in this volume besides the Chaconne, which would be worth the price itself.  If it's true you get what you pay for, then you get a lot of music for not much money with this edition.<br />Recommended for music students, performers, and even for people that have a violin hanging on the wall!d for music students, performers, and even for people that have a violin hanging on the wall!	2003-08-20

Beethoven wrote string quartets throughout his composing life, and they reflect his evolving art.  Never resting on his laurels, Beethoven continually grew artistically until the end.<br />It is difficult to label Beethoven as primarily a symphonist, chamber music composer, or piano composer.  Practically every ensemble and form he used he produced masterpieces that reflect not only the music he wrote, but the music he wrote within the ensemble he chose.  His music does not transcribe well at all.<br />A music lover needs to be acquainted with pieces from each of the ensembles to have any kind of grasp on the monumental influence that Beethoven has had on western music. Perhaps a good beginning would be the piano sonatas, but the string quartets have to have a place also.<br />From the early quartets to the last quartets, the amount and variety of music in the quartet opus alone is astounding.  Like the other genres he composed in, some of his best music is in the string quartets.<br />One of the best ways to get the most out of this music is to follow along in the score.  It is a good way to learn to follow more than one staff of music at a time, and is a good primer that can lead to full orchestral score reading.  And the music...incredible!<br />A ton of music, a pittance of a price.  Serious music lovers, take the hint!  Highly recommended!	2003-08-20

His masterly writing for the piano is astounding, and while it's been written and said that he wasn't much of an orchestrator, after reading the score I found this not to be the case.

The escapades of Til Eulenspiegel, the familiar opening of Also Sprach Zarathustra (and the less familiar final bars that can't make up their mind what key to close in), and the 'heroic' Ein Heldenleben reveal Strauss at his most complex, lyrical, bombastic and egotistical.

The composer puts his directions on paper, and the musician tries his best to do what the composer has directed to do.  Play this note high, this note low, this note long, this note short, etc.  Music is an art that really doesn't exist until it comes to life through the time it takes to perform it.  Like a seed, the score of an orchestral work lies dormant until the musician(s) plant it, nurture it through performance.<br />For the few that can read a score like the rest of us read a newspaper, the music can come alive in the imagination of their inner ear.  For the rest of us mortals, following the score while the music plays can help us 'see' the tree come to life with our ears and revel in all of the life and vitality it contains.<br />The tone poems of Richard Strauss are like vast, sprawling trees.  There is no need to follow a score to admire the beauty of the trees.  If that were so, symphony orchestras would pass out copies of the score to the audience and keep the lights on.  But following the score is like climbing right up into the tree.  You can see the diversity, the details, and even look down at the ground and realize where you are.<br />So to be able to appreciate these masterpieces on a different level, following the score can be a revelation.  Dover's edition of these tone poems is inexpensive, of good quality, and I especially like the large format.  If you try to follow a miniature score of these works, you best have really great eyes or a magnifying glass.  These are vast, romantic works, and Strauss uses a very large orchestra. So the large format is much easier to read and follow.<br />So if you ever have the urge to get closer to these masterpieces, then by all means let the Dover edition of the scores be your guide.  Your efforts to climb the tree will be well rewarded!	2003-08-12

All of us read Christian scripture that has been handed down from transcription to translation to interpretation for many centuries. It was interesting to read the possible meanings of some of this scripture.<br />Books like this are valuable because they help us to see the context in which they were written.  If an accounting for context and the historical era aren't taken into consideration, can the truth of scripture ever be revealed?  Even if scripture was inspired by God?<br />Recommended!	2003-08-08

And I was correct.  It is a book that contains the thoughts and beliefs of a mainline, 'traditional' Christian.  But as I disagree with most of the contents, I refuse to chastise the authors because of what appears to be a well-thought out apologetic defense of traditional Christianity.  I tend to be on the more 'liberal' side of religion, but the danger in any difference of opinion is reducing that difference to name calling and condemnation of beliefs.<br />We are living in a most chaotic time, with many traditional thoughts and beliefs about Christianity in particular and religion in general, being in question.  The last thing we need in these times is the broadening of the gulf that seperates us all.  This is a time for understanding and open dialogue without condemnation.<br />If the authors, through their beliefs and theology have condemned those of us that do not fall within the parameters of that theology, then that is unfortunate, but after seventeen hundred years of Christian tradition and teaching, it is understandable.  But for a liberal to do likewise is but adding fuel to a fire that is already threatening to consume us.  We can all talk all we want, but the true measure of your belief is if you can live it.  Perhaps if the folks that have a more liberal view of theology would make those views part and parcel of who they are in their daily lives, some of the barriers between us all would slowly crumble.<br />It wasn't the 'answers' that the authors gave that were so disagreeable to me, but the thought that so much of what they addressed HAS a definite answer.  But I'll say this, as much as I disagreed, the book forced me to think of why I disagreed. And that is the reason I gave it 4 stars.	2003-08-04

That's what this book is about.  Of course, there are very little facts about Jesus that we know.  Much is conjecture, historical reasoning and such.  But this book sheds light on the era in which Jesus lived, and some insight on perhaps what happened in his life.  A thoroughly enjoyable book, but if your theology prevents you from thinking about Jesus in any other terms but the literal embodiment of God, then there is probably much in this book that will disturb you. That being said, I still have to recommend this book highly!	2003-08-04

The two opposing views of Christ held by the followers of Arius and the followers of Athanasius led to bickering and bloodshed, all in the name of Christ, the prince of peace.<br />Perhaps this book can shed some light on why after seventeen centuries, bloodshed and violence continue to be a part of Christianity.  It is a story of power, control and politics from the 4th century that appears to be ongoing today.<br />Recommended!	2003-08-04

The only complaint is that the print is rather small, so there's not much room to write in fingering,of which there are none. So this book, by the nature of the music and the lack of fingering, is not for the beginner.<br />That's the only complaint that prevented a five-star rating.

This book is about the crusades carried out against the pagans that dwelled near the Baltic, east of the Oder river.  Professor Urban has written other books about the northern crusades, such as the Baltic Crusade and The Teutonic Knights that participated in these crusades.<br />With full blessing from the Pope and a promise of remission of sins for the knights that fought in these crusades, there proceeded a forced conversion of the pagans to Christianity.  Some truly converted, some faked a conversion until the time was right for rebellion, and some flat out refused conversion and fought.  Professor Urban, in this book and others, surveys the many aspects of these crusades.  For the medieval and middle ages history buff, highly recommended!	2003-08-03

It must be said up front that this is not a book for the casual classical music lover.  If you are not familiar with the classical piano literature or Mr. Brendel's recordings, this is not the book for you.<br />But for the advanced classical piano student or knowledgeable listener, this book sheds much light on Mr. Brendel's opinions and thoughts about the great composers and how he feels they should be played.  He is not just a virtuoso pianist, but a world-class musician. His comments on interpretation of the classics and about other famous pianists, past and present, are quite interesting.	2003-07-17

Of the three, perhaps Napoleon comes across as the better man, but considering the other two that he is compared against, that is not much of a compliment.<br />What struck me about all three men was their utter ruthlessness and greed for power.  Napoleon sacrificed his army in hopeless wars without any remorse, along with Hitler and Stalin.  But Hitler and Stalin also participated directly in the murder of innocent civilians for reasons that only could make sense to someone hungry for power and paranoid to the extreme.<br />Dr. Neumayr reviews their lives, their physical ailments, and to a certain extent their mental health.  But by no means is this a book that rambles on with page after page of suppositions and hastily drawn conclusions.  To be sure, the mental health of all three is questioned, but were they insane? After reading about the millions of lives that these men took, and the misery caused for their countries, it is even more chilling to know that they knew exactly what they were doing.<br />All three paid the price for their murder, deceit and immorality.  Dr Neumayr examines their physical health, and toward the end of their lives they all suffered from many physical ailments, some directly caused by the stress that their ambitions placed on them. But the suffering they had was as nothing compared to the suffering they caused.<br />I have also read Dr. Neumayer's three-volume biography/medical history of the great classical music composers.  If your interest in famous people goes beyond learning a few facts about their lives, then these books will certainly be of interest to you.  Highly recommended!	2003-05-31

I have heard Bishop Sprague on two occasions, and have followed the contoversy that surrounds him and his beliefs.<br />Whether you agree or disagree with him, this is a book for all to read.  For I get the feeling that Bishop Sprague's real objective is to open a dialogue, not just between Christians, but people of all faiths. Perhaps there is a common ground we can all reach that will end much of the trouble in the world. He does assert in the book that this is his own personal way of looking at things.  By stating that, I believe he has opened the door for dissent from his beliefs, not only in the United Methodist denomination, but all peoples of faith.<br />Whether you agree or disagree with him, this is a man that has devoted  his life to not only preaching the Gospel, but living it as best he can. For his service to people and to God, he deserves the opportunity to be heard without the charges of heresy and the threats on his life that he has endured. And I would say that any person, no matter what their belief, should have the same right.<br />Whether a person follows Christ, Buddha, Mohammad, Moses, or Joe Blow from Kokomo makes no difference to me.  If your belief causes you to do good towards others, to throw off the rampant self-centeredness that the world is full of, and causes you to be a good person, then your faith is real.<br />Finding this faith does not consist of blindly following ancient interpretations of even more ancient texts.  Look at all the injustice done within the last nearly 2,000 years, and it's obvious it hasn't worked. This is a time for new thoughts about ancient truths.<br />I am proud of our Bishop in the Northern Illinois Conference.  I do not agree with him 100%, nor should I.  We were all created with a brain to feel, think, and reason with.  I refuse to be a part of any religion or denomination that insists that I accept 2,000 year-old teachings without debate.  I refuse to be a part of any religion that requires me to 'check my brain at the door'.<br />I encourage all to read this book.  Agree or disagree with his views, the dialogue will begin.  And every Christian, from 'liberal' to 'fundamentalist' will benefit from that.hat I accept 2,000 year-old teachings without debate.

Lionel Atwill,a highly respected stage actor that made a specialty out of playing off-beat mad doctor roles and whom his friends called 'Pinky'.  Colin Clive, another star of the stage  who detested his horror movie roles and drank himself to death. George  Zucco, an actor that worked on stage with Colin Clive, made a living acting  in everything from Grade 'A' feature films to poverty row Grade 'Z'  pictures. I knew something of the lives of Atwill and Clive, but the bio of  Zucco was especially interesting.  While Atwill was the host of 'adult'  parties in his home, and Clive spiralled into an early alcohol-induced  death, Zucco comes across as a gentleman.  This book was most interesting,  and not only taught me the differences in the three men, but also the one  thing they had in common. All three were fine actors with backgrounds on  the stage who(especially for Atwill and Zucco) always strived to give a  good performance, no matter what the picture they were involved with.	1999-07-08

That is what I got from this book of his  movies and his life. Despite having to stand in the shadow of his father,  despite many personal demons that haunted him,  he made a name for himself  as a character actor and played many roles alongside some major stars (for  example, Gary Cooper in HIGH NOON)  Since I have read the book, I have a  new admiration for his talent. I enjoyed this book very much, and after  reading it will watch Lon Chaney's performances in a much different light.	1999-07-05
