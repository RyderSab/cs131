The book was created by the team that makes the PBS production by the same name \\"Rare Visions and Roadside Revelations\\"  And the book  is really hard to find at normal book stores.  I know people that use this book on a daily basis - tracking down the artists.  I like the way the book is written because it does not make fun of its subjects like some other books.  It is part travel guide / part art book / part just fun to flip through the pages.  ALSO - this is important - this book had places and artists that none of the other books mention.  I guess that this is because the authors are on the road traveling the back streets and hunting down their subjects.  The photos in the book are also good - not as nice as some big photo book coffed table book - but definetly informative and easy to see.	2005-10-01

I wrote this about the 1st edition : This is really a top notch book for the guys that like to get in a car and drive down the state highways - avoiding the interstates. \\"Eccentric\\" = don't be scared off buy that - this is not a book of weird stuff - just FUN stuff. This is one of those landmark travel books that comes out every now and then. The author really did the homework to get it all down in print.  ==== Now all that has changed is that it is BETTER.  We sell this book in our gift shop - it is the best seller.  What I like about it is that the author does not make fun of her subjects like other wacky travel guides.  Also the amount of details is really handy to the traveler who likes details.	2005-04-09

But hey this is the real book about this southwest Louisiana music.  The photos are second to none.  The photos really could be framed and hung on the wall of any art gallery in the country.  Sure I know the photographer but anyone who knows me knows I tell it like it is.  And this is a wonderful book.  The writer, Ben Sandmel, writes like he is talking to a good friend.  It is a fun read.  Both the writer and the photographer must have had really good access to the musicians to come up with such original stuff.	2004-12-20

I can't believe what some of the other reviewers claim.  I am a professional artist.  This book is not the bible on all of art history, it is simply a group of theories by the author, who is a world class artist himself.  The superb illustrations and easy reading text works for me.  I now view the work by the old masters in a different light - not negative - not positive - different.  This book is expensive but if you have the bucks or if your business or life causes you to deal in traditional art  - get the book.	2004-11-03

This is not your daddy's clip art book considering the prefect photos and layout. This book should be on every library of anyone involved in the graphic arts.  The price is really incredible too.  As a graphic artist I sometimes need to get inspired - this is one of those books that helps me get out of a creative slump. Even my non-art friends find it enjoyable to look at.	2004-10-23

I will probably be on my shelf in my studio till I die because of the wonderful selection of fabrics.  I do like the way the book is laid out too.

The photos and illustrations are not reproduced very well so don't buy it for the pictures.  There are some good essays and it reads fast.  I have studied this topic for many years so I was prepared for the worst - meaning i wouldn't find much new stuff here - but hey I DID.  New info about some old things I have been studying always impresses me and tells me that the writer(s) did their homework.	2004-10-05

It is not a book to take to the beach.  But I could see taking this book on vacation - that is if you were driving the old state highways that may still have some of the kewl vintage motels and stuff.  This book covers a lot of ground and it would be of interest to those who enjoy funky motels and stuff.  The writing style is not a fun as I would like - perhaps this book started out as a college thesis.  But the info and pictures make it a good buy for the money.	2004-10-03

Sure, it's light reading. But there were lots of info that I found very entertaining (I am in the travel/tourist business).  What I liked most was the way the author pointed out the different eras of the motels in the USA.  He discussed the big chain motels as well as the small mom and pop operations.  This book will bring back memories to anyone who stayed in a motel that boasted of having \\"air conditioned\\" rooms.	2004-10-01

There is a good historic overview of the early days, and lots of facts that make for fun reading. This book is not just for collectors of gas station stuff.  This is a good read for anyone who use to pay 35 cents a gallon for gas.	2004-10-01

This book is for the rest of us wantabees.  Of course you need to be able to read music - maybe not.  I really can't read music - but I can play piano - so hears what I did - I found someone who 'can' read music - they showed me the notes - now I am playing.  If it worked for me like this - hey five stars.  The songs in the book are a good mix and you can find recordings of the tunes all over the net - if you are not keen on the songs.	2004-09-30

I like Louisiana music and I think it some of the best in the world so I read the book the first time with a very critical eye.  If you are planning a trip to Louisiana with the thought of catching musicians doing their thing - this book is a good 101 course to begin with - even before you arrive in the only third world in the USA - Louisiana -- get the book.	2004-09-30

Creating mosaic work is much more then simply bashing plates and tiles and gluing them on flat surfaces. I believe the even the beginner \\"I don't know nothin about art\\" will learn from this book.  But this book is not just for the beginner.

So I have some one who can read - show me the notes - and I can figure the beat and I can do it.  The CD included is really well done.  I think this book should be required by all piano teachers everywhere.  This is like if Scott Joplin were alive and giving tips on playing.  So if you can't read a note - get someone to help you out.  Playing piano is fun and this book is real fun.	2004-09-30

Not a heavy piece of reading - but very informative - from several angles - historical, business, and travel.  I have read other books by the author and am impressed with all of them. The layout and art direction of the book serves the subject well.  I can see this book going into more editions.
