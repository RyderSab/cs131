I am certainly glad to have read this book, and will add that I found it intriguing enough to order the two subsequent books in Hawkins' trilogy. At the same time, I have rather mixed feelings about what I read-- which is reflected in this review.<br /><br />Whereas I tend to keep an open mind, I have considerable skepticism of any teacher, mystic or expert who claims to have \\"THE answer.\\" Although he'd like us to think he has the \\"definitive answer,\\" what Dr. Hawkins has-- and offers readers-- is a PERSPECTIVE, much the same as most other Teachers. And whereas it may be an intriguing and possibly life-altering perspective for some, it is none-the-less still just that: a perspective. Since the majority of the reviews written so far seem to be offering largely *opinions* I'll start by trying to explain what this book is actually ABOUT.<br /><br />This is mostly a spiritual book, masquerading under a facade of questionable science. Loosely speaking, Hawkins pokes at the fringes of Nonduality, vaguely drawing on traditions of Teachers ranging from Sri Ramana Maharshi to Eckhart Tolle. Yet, at the heart of Hawkins' theories about life, and \\"How Things Work\\" is the \\"science\\" of Applied Kinesiology (AK). AK is not exactly new, having first gained some attention in the 1960s. It is basically a kind of \\"muscle testing\\" which posits that we simply \\"know\\" whether something is truth or not-truth, regardless of intellect, training, experience or anything else. Thus if something is \\"bad,\\" \\"untrue\\" or \\"evil,\\" our muscles will be \\"weak\\" in its presence. Conversely, if something is \\"good,\\" \\"truthful\\" or \\"benevolent,\\" we will be \\"strong\\" in its presence.<br /><br />The basic process of this muscle testing *appears* straightforward enough. The test involves two people-- one who holds out his/her arm to the side, parallel to the ground, and one who asks a simple yes/no question about an object, person or idea. Depending on how the object \\"calibrates\\" the person holding their arm out will either test \\"strong\\" or \\"weak.\\" What is NOT straightforward are the particular conditions and limitations Hawkins claims must be met to make muscle testing viable and accurate. And herein lies one of my (and many other reviewers') hesitation with the concept: There's a distinct tone of \\"We have this fabulous and 100% accurate method, but almost nobody is qualified to execute it, and it's almost impossible to create the environment in which it is completely accurate.\\"<br /><br />It's tempting to dismiss AK as \\"complete quackery\\" since there is very little scientific evidence to support it. At the same time, there may be more to it than meets the eye-- a \\"version\\" of it has been used by several large \\"canned music\\" providers to select music that makes people \\"test weak\\" to be played as background music in retail environments; the implication being that you'll be \\"weak\\" with your wallet. For my money, it amounts to \\"Strange Theory\\" which Hawkins presents in a highly \\"scientific-sounding\\" style, perhaps in the hope that readers will be convinced that \\"if it SOUNDS like science, it must BE science.\\"<br /><br />According to Hawkins we, as humans, live at vastly different \\"levels\\" of consciousness. All these levels, along with the \\"truth level\\" of ANY true/false style inquiry, can be tested for truth and numerically \\"calibrated\\" through muscle testing, on a logarithmic scale of 1-1000. According to Hawkins, any person, concept, thought or object that calibrates at 200 (The level of Integrity) or above is positive (\\"power\\"); anything below 200 is negative (\\"force\\"). So far, so good. Hawkins' \\"map of the levels of human consciousness\\" is highly consistent with most spiritual teachings, running the range from Shame (lowest) to Enlightenment (highest). Hawkins' descriptions of the levels are accurate; his coverage personal growth, positive energy and similar concepts are spiritually sound.<br /><br />The book is a \\"mixed bag\\" that is both fascinating and may certainly be eye-opening, if not enlightening, to many people-- while some individuals (especially those of a scientific bent) will probably find it distressing that the work presented appears to be based on some \\"dicey math\\" and some philosophical \\"leaps of faith\\" that don't necessarily hold water in double-blind tests in a controlled environment. To which I feel compelled to reiterate that-- HOWever it may be presented, and WHATever he may want us to believe-- Hawkins' work is really more \\"spiritual\\" than \\"scientific.\\" My point? The spirituality is predominantly sound; the science is.... dubious.<br /><br />On the first read, this book annoyed me-- possibly because I had expected to be \\"wow'ed\\" to a greater degree than I was. However, once I got comfortable with the idea that I was being offered another \\"puzzle piece\\" on my spiritual journey (as opposed to \\"the Truth\\"), I found it a reasonably enjoyable and interesting read. I was disturbed by a number of (mostly trivial) contradictions that brought into question how the material in the book could ostensibly calibrate at 800+ (level of enlightenment). For example, Hawkins states that it is unlikely that a person's level of consciousness will rise enough to calibrate more than a few points higher in their lifetime-- yet the mere process of \\"being exposed\\" to the material in the book can raise consciousness by 30 calibration points. Huh? Likewise, I take issue with Hawkins' persistent undertone that unless you're highly intelligent, well educated (and basically from the \\"priviliged classes\\") you have very little hope of reaching enlightenment. Whereas I can recognize this thinking as a reflection of Hawkins' own neo-conservative life philosophy (which is entirely HIS business, I don't care), its INCLUSION here detracts from the integrity of the work. However, if you can overlook such nitpicks, there are some very sound spiritual and self-development principles presented throughout the book-- largely following path of Non-duality.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Recommended (7 out of 10 possible bookmarks), with some reservations. Some interesting premises, but probably not for the \\"lightweight\\" spiritual seeker-- better suited to the intermediate to advanced student. Gets a bit repetitive and subtly self-congratulatory at times; Hawkins could probably have said everything needed in 100 fewer pages. DON'T buy it for the \\"science,\\" buy it for the spiritual angle.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!<br /><br />--Peterls are accurate; his coverage personal growth, positive energy and similar concepts are spiritually sound.  <br /> <br />The book is a \\"mixed bag\\" that is both fascinating and may certainly be eye-opening, if not enlightening, to many people-- while some individuals (especially those of a scientific bent) will probably find it distressing that the work presented appears to be based on some \\"dicey math\\" and some philosophical \\"leaps of faith\\" that don't necessarily hold water in double-blind tests in a controlled environment.

Unlike most books on the subject, it offers exploration of both the psychological AND spiritual sides of the enneagram and, with the inclusion of Riso & Hudson's useful system of \\"Levels of Development,\\" it is a fairly complete learning tool for newcomers and advanced students, alike. As a student of the enneagram for a dozen-odd years, if I were to recommend a *single* book of lasting value for someone wanting to gain an understanding of the enneagram, this one would be near the top of the list.<br /><br />Part I-- \\"The Inward Journey\\"-- approaches the enneagram from a historical and general informational perspective. This section includes a brief-- but quite accurate-- self test, as well as thumbnail descriptions of each of the nine enneagram types. The rest of the section covers topics to help the reader understand the basics of personality, essence, ego and awareness. The authors also explain the interactions and parallels between the enneagram and other personality theories. The section concludes with a primer on the \\"mechanics\\" of the enneagram, including the concepts of \\"Wings,\\" \\"Instinctual Variants,\\" \\"Levels of Development\\" and \\"Integration and Disintegration.\\"<br /><br />Part II consists of nine chapters, each one covering a corresponding enneagram type, in depth. For those who don't already know their type, each chapter begins with a fairly detailed set of questions to help the reader determine if he/she resonates with that type. The authors then describe the type and its associated issues in considerable detail, with separate sections to show the differences caused by a predominant \\"wing,\\" and by a person's \\"instinctual variant.\\" Although self-tests (and even online \\"quizzes\\") can be helpful in determining type, by far the most accurate and reliable way to be certain is to read detailed type descriptions to see which has the strongest feeling of \\"rightness.\\" The descriptions offered here are quite comprehensive, and are expanded through adding Riso & Hudson's system of \\"Levels of Development\\" for greater \\"granularity.\\" Each type-chapter then progresses to describing the underlying \\"issues\\" facing that type, along with guidelines to the \\"paths to growth.\\" Whereas these sometimes feel a bit \\"mechanical\\" to me, and perhaps are not the most thorough I have seen, they are certainly quite adequate to start readers on a path of personal development.<br /><br />Part III-- \\"Tools for Transformation\\"-- is somewhat brief, but does a respectable job of introducing the spiritual aspects of the enneagram. The section includes \\"type-appropriate\\" considerations in choosing and following a spiritual practice, and talks about ways in which each type can get trapped by their fixation. There is also a brief discussion of transcending ego and personality, and how to find our essence, which will lead to a state of inner peace.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Highly Recommended (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks) as an excellent introduction to the enneagram, with enough in-depth material to help students quite a long way along their journey to self-actualization. Whereas the authors' backgrounds in the more psychological traditions of the enneagram (as a \\"personality typing tool\\") are often evident, the inclusion of spiritual material makes this a highly worthwhile read.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!be certain is to read detailed type descriptions to see which has the strongest feeling of \\"rightness.\\" The descriptions offered here are quite comprehensive, and are expanded through adding Riso & Hudson's system of \\"Levels of Development\\" for greater \\"granularity.\\" Each type-chapter then progresses to describing the underlying \\"issues\\" facing that type, along with guidelines to the \\"paths to growth.\\" Whereas these sometimes feel a bit \\"mechanical\\" to me, and perhaps are not the most thorough I have seen, they are certainly quite adequate to start readers on a path of personal development.

However, if you are someone who is constantly feeling overwhelmed and irritated by environmental stimuli, to the point where others sometimes think you're slightly crazy, I have little doubt that you will find this book to be filled with \\"aha moments;\\" leading to a great sense of relief that there is actually a \\"name\\" for the confusing and painful feelings you may have experienced all your life.<br /><br />After a thorough descriptive introduction, the author covers the ins and outs of Sensory Defensiveness in four sections. Part One talks about the basics of Sensory Defensiveness, giving many examples of the different ways people experience the condition. Heller also talks about the brain, and the neuroscience involved, and explains how Sensory Defensiveness falls along a continuum from fairly mild to debilitating.<br /><br />In Part Two, entitled \\"Secondary Effects,\\" the author describes the many ways in which Sensory Defensiveness contributes to other issues and illnesses in life. This includes issues from difficulty with maintaining a healthy social life, to actual mental disorders ranging from Anxiety to Social Phobias to OCD and much more.<br /><br />Part Three introduces readers to the ways we may be engaged in activities that are overstimulating, and offers a range of suggestions for how to \\"turn down the volume\\" on stimulation. Heller's notion of a \\"Sensory Diet\\" is about creating an environment that reduces the number of \\"triggers\\" that contribute to making the world feel overwhelming and out of control. Part Four is pretty much an extension of Part Three, except it applies to actions we can take for OURSELVES, rather than for our surrounding environment. This includes such things as diet, body awareness, posture, exercise, forms of physical therapies and more. These two sections include many pointers for better living that would be suitable even for those who are *not* Sensory Defensive.<br /><br />A cautionary note, especially if you are an HSP reading this. Whereas Sensory Defensiveness shares many traits with being an HSP, the two are far from identical. Having studied *both* fairly thoroughly over the past 8 years, my observation is that a number of HSPs are likely Sensory Defensive, but so are many people who are NOT HSPs. Most noteworthy, Sensory Defensiveness is a \\"condition,\\" while being Highly Sensitive is a \\"neutral trait;\\" thus it is fairly important to remain objective in diagnosis.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Highly Recommended (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks)-- this is one of the first comprehensive works on Sensory Defensiveness, and it is very well done. Do keep in mind that this book does NOT suggest a pharmaceutical treatment; there is no \\"magic pill\\" to make Sensory Defensiveness disappear.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!for OURSELVES, rather than for our surrounding environment.

I have had my copy since 1993, and have lent it out numerous times to a variety of people who-- after studying it-- have all commented that they had a much clearer understanding of their career-related ups and downs.<br /><br />The Tiegers cover three different areas in the book. Part One offers a basic introduction to the theories behind personality typing and the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator. Whereas there is not actually a Myers-Briggs style \\"sorter quiz\\" in the book (these are best administered by a professional), there are fairly good descriptions of the four dimensions of personality type-- thorough enough for most readers to be able to determine their four-letter \\"code.\\"<br /><br />Part Two addresses the interaction between the dimensions of personality and work style, and how they affect behavior and priorities in the workplace. This includes such things as how different personalities might approach the same problem differently, as well as a discussion of personal development at different stages of life.<br /><br />Part Three-- which is the bulk of the book-- provides detailed descriptions of the 16 personality types, with a full chapter for each type. Each chapter includes three \\"real people\\" examples of working people, showing what works (as well as challenges) for them in their chosen careers. Each chapter continues by finding the \\"common threads\\" of the type covered, and then goes on to list a large number of careers that might be a \\"good fit.\\" The chapters then conclude with tips for the job search, pathways to success and possible pitfalls to stay alert to-- as they apply to YOUR particular type.<br /><br />Overall, the book offers many interesting insights. However, readers should keep in mind that books like \\"Do What You Are\\" serve as GUIDES, and NOT as a set of \\"hard and fast\\" rules. Some people may have had life experiences that open different doors than those outlined here, and some may find the lists of careers for thir type a bit limiting. Also, the book mostly deals with \\"mainstream\\" professions with a heavy focus on the corporate track-- if you're of an entrepreneurial nature, you may not find it quite as useful. Finally, I would suggest that you don't rely on this book alone, when trying to find a career that's a good fit-- personality typing is merely ONE of many possible approaches to career development.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Highly recommended (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks), especially for those who are considering a new direction because their career seems stagnant or \\"not quite right.\\" It would be helpful-- but by no means essential-- to know your Myers-Briggs type prior to reading the book.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!e book offers many interesting insights.

Indeed, \\"Sixteen Men\\" offers an interesting \\"gender specialized\\" view of personality typing, using the basic Jungian model and the widely used Myers-Briggs Type Inventory. Although the focus of the book is type as it relates to men, it would certainly be an equally useful and interesting read for women.<br /><br />The opening chapter of the book presents readers with a basic overview of typology, from its origins, to how it works-- including sections on the influence of gender on type. Chapter two is a particularly interesting discussion of the psychology of type and male communication. Noteworthy is the author's suggestion that miscommunications between men and women-- often thought of as \\"gender related\\"-- really could be caused as much by type differences as gender, especially in view of the fact that certain types are predominantly male, while others are predominantly female.<br /><br />For most of the remainder of the book, readers are introduced to the \\"Sixteen Men,\\" presented in four groups of four as \\"The Thinkers,\\" \\"The Idea Men,\\" \\"The Doers\\" and \\"The Dreamers.\\" Within each group of four, there's a short overview of the category, followed by a detailed description of each man's traits, strengths and weaknesses, corresponding to each of the 16 Myers-Briggs types. Pedersen's use of \\"real people\\" with real lives (rather than just anonymous letters) gives the book a nicely human touch. I found the type descriptions (both my own, and those of people I know well) to be quite accurate.<br /><br />The book concludes with a chapter on how to use typology as a psychological and personal growth tool. There was some useful information in this chapter, especially in the realm of relationships, and developing the \\"inferior\\" function. I also found the appendix quite interesting, with the inclusion of a number of statistical tables, showing a breakdown of types by gender, as well as a selection of professions by type.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Recommended (8 out of a possible 10 bookmarks). Although the book stands alone pretty well, it's probably more useful to those already familiar with typology and the Myers-Briggs system. The book does NOT contain any kind of quiz or \\"self-test\\" to help determine type.of statistical tables, showing a breakdown of types by gender, as well as a selection of professions by type.  <br /> <br />Final thoughts: Recommended (8 out of a possible 10 bookmarks).

I picked up a copy of \\"The Introvert Advantage\\" because the title intrigued me. I am an introvert, and I have found the trait to offer relatively few advantages in a practical day-to-day living sense. Marti Olsen Laney's book was certainly an interesting and worthwhile read-- and is \\"recommended reading\\" for introverts as a nice general reference on the trait-- but it offers only the flimsiest of explanations as to how Introversion is an \\"advantage.\\"<br /><br />Unlike most writers exploring the subject of introversion-- and who generally go to some lengths to share woeful tales of how \\"difficult\\" introversion is, and how it is practically an \\"illness\\" or \\"syndrome\\" one should be pitied for-- Olsen Laney refreshingly goes into explanations of the neuroscience aspects of Introversion. By showing that \\"innies\\" ARE wired a little differently, she effectively removes the \\"it's all in your imagination\\" angle many introverts are presented with, on a daily basis. The author also shows how differing biochemistry is behind many of the differences between introverts and extraverts. This, alone, makes the book stand out from previous works on introversion. To her credit, Laney also mostly avoids the common tendency to present a work on introversion in an \\"us vs them\\" (extraverts) tone.<br /><br />The book is divided into three main sections. Part one explores the basics of introversion, with descriptions and examples, as well as self-assessment quizzes. This is also the section that talks about the neuroscience of introversion. Part two covers the challenges facing introverts in a predominantly extraverted world, addressing the areas of relationships, parenting, socializing and work. Part three-- entitled \\"Creating the 'Just Right' Life\\"-- is basically about \\"coping skills\\" for introverts.<br /><br />There is little doubt that \\"The Introvert Advantage\\" will provide some nice validation, as well as some helpful information, for many Introverts. I have lent my copy to several fellow introverts, and the feedback has mostly come back in the form of \\"Oh, that is SO me!\\" or \\"Yay, I'm normal!!!\\"<br /><br />In the end, Laney does her readers a bit of a disservice-- AND somewhat invalidates her own claims that Introversion is an \\"advantage\\"-- by including a chapter on \\"Extraverting.\\" The presence of a chapter which implies that introverts need to be more extraverted to cope in life flies in the face of describing Introversion as something that is an \\"advantage.\\" But maybe I'm being overly picky. I also felt some parts of the book focused too much on the guilt, shortcomings, phobias, shame, social anxieties and other ostensibly negative issues associated with Introversion.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Recommended (7 out of a possible 10 bookmarks), but not a 5-star book. Quick and easy to read, but very much a book with definite strengths and weaknesses. The coverage of the neuroscience of Introversion approaches \\"must read\\" status, while the notion of \\"Extraverting\\" comes across as a non-creative sellout to the idea that \\"you can either be like the majority, or fail.\\" The rest of the book falls somewhere between the two.eral fellow introverts, and the feedback has mostly come back in the form of \\"Oh, that is SO me!\\" or \\"Yay, I'm normal!!!\\" <br /> <br />In the end, Laney does her readers a bit of a disservice-- AND somewhat invalidates her own claims that Introversion is an \\"advantage\\"-- by including a chapter on \\"Extraverting.\\" The presence of a chapter which implies that introverts need to be more extraverted to cope in life flies in the face of describing Introversion as something that is an \\"advantage.\\" But maybe I'm being overly picky.

For instance, we may habitually make choices that set us up to fail, or we may abandon projects right before they succeed. Maybe we choose abusive partners and friends; maybe we're chronically underemployed. Perhaps we avoid happiness because of a persistant fear that we will *lose* that happiness. Each issue-- in one way or another-- adds up to living a life in which we never really feel content or fulfilled, and like the \\"good things\\" of life somehow keep passing us by.<br /><br />Whatever the issue might be, conventional psychology either does not recognize Misery Addiction at ALL, or it chalks such problems up to more \\"popularly acceptable\\" causes, such as poor self-esteem, lack of assertiveness, ADHD or some other more widely recognized \\"syndrome.\\" In this groundbreaking new book, author and psychotherapist Anne Katherine explains that there's really much more at work here.<br /><br />The book is divided into two main sections. Part One (\\"Understanding the Problem\\") is dedicated to explaining and identifying the various aspects of Misery Addiction. In short, easy-to-read chapters, the author takes us through descriptions of what exactly Misery Addiction IS, then on to explaining the strange paradoxes that lie at the heart of Misery Addiction; where we may have learned during our upbringings, and how we now engage in certain behaviors that keep up from reaching happiness in life. Throughout, Katherine illustrates her descriptions with examples from her own psychotherapy practice and Misery Addiction retreats, and also includes a number of small self-tests and quizzes to help readers understand precisely where their \\"traps\\" lie.<br /><br />Part Two (\\"Finding and Living the Solution\\") deals with recovery from Misery Addiction. Katherine is a strong proponent of following the basic \\"12-step program\\" format, as the optimal road to recovery. Even if you do not have a local MAA (Misery Addicts Anonymous) meeting, she recommends recommends getting involved with a 12-step group. This section also includes several chapters with \\"tools\\" to help the recovering Misery Addict deal with life.

Not only does Jaxon-Bear offer insights for the individual, he also offers all of humanity the glimpse of a possible future that is free from suffering. And he does so, without sending his readers on a confusing journey through 800 pages of convoluted prose.<br /><br />I had the good fortune to read this book shortly before attending a weekend retreat and Satsang with Jaxon-Bear, and I found him to be a profoundly insightful and compassionate Teacher, both in person and in writing. \\"Sudden Awakening\\" offers readers an invitation to self-examine, ask difficult (and not always pleasant) questions, and find the silence and love that is already within us, underneath this trance called \\"the ego.\\" Unlike some spiritual teachers, Jaxon-Bear does not talk about \\"killing\\" the ego. Instead, he points out that it has been a very real and possibly essential survival strategy for us-- up to *this* point-- but that now it is no longer serving us. And it is our \\"ego fixation\\" that has lead to a sense of \\"duality,\\" that is, the idea that we are somehow \\"separate\\"-- from God, from others, even from life itself.<br /><br />In this book, Jaxon-Bear uses simple (and at times funny) teaching stories to lead the reader on a journey from the invitation to embrace freedom; to understanding the nature of \\"reality;\\" to understanding the nature of mind, ego and ego-development; to finally understanding Who We Really Are, so we can awaken and be the silence and love that has always been right here.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Highly recommended (9.5 out of a possible 10 bookmarks). This is one of the best teachings on Non-Duality I have read, and is an easy-- and potentially life-changing-- read for the spiritual seeker who is ready to \\"find\\" and wake up from the trance.	2005-03-17

Building on Dr. Elaine Aron's research on Highly Sensitive People, Ted Zeff's book takes a practical \\"next step\\" for the HSP: Now that you *know* about the trait, how do you *manage* it, in an overstimulating world? I started reading this book on a flight from Texas to a convention in California, and discovered tips I could immediately apply to my situation at that moment.<br /><br />The author starts with a general overview of the HSP trait-- including the sensitivity \\"self test\\" developed by Elaine Aron-- and then offers readers some guidance on how to make the best use of the book. Subsequent chapters deal with such topics as preparing for your daily life, dealing with time pressures, physical health, improving sleep patterns, coping with relationships, the work environment, and spirituality. The book concludes by answering some common concerns and questions asked by HSPs, as well as a section on choosing an appropriate healer from the helping professions.<br /><br />Throughout, Zeff draws on a variety of relaxation and meditation techniques, as well as aspects of Eastern philosophy and spirituality helpful in minimizing and ending general pain and suffering. His overall tone is gentle, helpful and validating, and completely appropriate for a Highly Sensitive Person.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Highly Recommended (10 out of 10 possible bookmarks) for all HSPs. The book is easy to read, and takes on the much needed topic of how to PRACTICALLY deal with being an HSP.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!<br /><br />--Peter	2004-10-20

The book is divided into two main sections.<br /><br />The first part teaches the reader about the basic Jungian preferences-- extraversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling and judging/perceiving. Each is explained in terms of general characteristics as well as specifics on how they influence communication, work, relationships, careers and more. The explanations are straightforward, but more than adequate to help readers determine their preferences, and thus their four-letter personality type.<br /><br />Part two offers detailed descriptions of the 16 different personality types.

I thought I was ready to review Eli Jaxon-Bear's \\"The Enneagram of Liberation\\" shortly after I first read it, about a year ago. However, in spite of having been a student of the enneagram for many years, I realized that I really didn't have a clear sense of how to describe the book. After a recent second reading, followed by a five-day workshop based on the principles outlined in the book, the penny finally dropped-- this is definitely a fresh new approach to an old system. Indeed, the reviewer with the negative opinion (elsewhere in these pages) is EXACTLY right in saying that this is NOT like other enneagram books.<br /><br />Eli Jaxon-Bear really did not write a book \\"about\\" the Enneagram-- as most people are familiar with it-- as a work to determine psychological personality types; rather, he wrote a book about self-actualization, \\"using\\" the Enneagram as a \\"framework\\" to guide the reader. If you are looking for a \\"descriptive text\\" about the history, use and mechanics of the Enneagram strictly from a personality type perspective, this is probably NOT the best book for you-- I'd recommend something by Riso & Hudson, or by Helen Palmer. However, if you are looking for an insightful spiritually-based guide to self-understanding, this is a very insightful book. Having a working knowledge of the Enneagram might be helpful before starting this book, but is by no means essential.<br /><br />The author uses the Enneagram to examine the nine different psychological fixations and \\"ego-structures\\" that correspond to the nine enneagram points, and explains how each Enneagram type's \\"fixation\\" is also what prevents them from living and experiencing an \\"authentic\\" life. The text is clear and easy to understand, with the first part of the book covering some basic explanations and background of the system; the largest (middle) section describing the different ego-structures and fixations of each of the nine Enneagram types; the final section offering insights towards attaining an \\"enlightened\\" or \\"liberated\\" state of being through the realization and acceptance that the limiting \\"identities\\" we assume through the ego are no more than illusions. Throughout, Bear offers examples from his workshops, as well as from his own journey of self-discovery, which draws predominantly from Eastern thought and philosophy (Buddhism & Sufism). Overall, I have found \\"The Enneagram of Liberation\\" to be a very valuable addition to my library of enneagram books.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Highly recommended (10 out of a possible 10 bookmarks). However, it is important to remember that this is NOT a book about \\"personality typing,\\" but a book about self-growth. In general, I'd suggest a working knowledge of the Enneagram prior to reading this, or at least a working knowledge of the self-examination process.ining an \\"enlightened\\" or \\"liberated\\" state of being through the realization and acceptance that the limiting \\"identities\\" we assume through the ego are no more than illusions.

In \\"Sensual Dreaming\\" she takes on areas of dream analysis that are seldom talked about: Sexuality, eroticism and sensuality.<br /><br />This book is NOT a \\"dream dictionary\\" with lists of symbols and their ostensible meanings. Instead, Delaney explores the ways in which our sexual dreams must be interpreted in the context of each person's unique life experience. The book is divided into three sections, covering \\"Sexual Passions,\\" \\"Intimate Passions\\" and \\"Creative Passions,\\" and is \\"illustrated\\" throughout of examples of dreams along with interpretations. In addition, Delaney guides readers through the processes of remembering and recording dreams, dream incubation, the dream interview and various other techniques to help us enrich and understand the sexual content of our dreams.<br /><br />In addition to offering *interpretations* of our sensual dreams, Delaney also covers the therapeutic aspects of dreams, drawing on her experience as a psychotherapist and offering insights into how the images and symbols we see may offer keys to challenges we face during our waking life. An appendix also offers tips on how to choose a sex therapist, general therapist, or dream specialist.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Highly Recommended (9.5 out of a possible 10 bookmarks).

And, in a sense, the book's subtitle (&quot;The mixed blessings of extraordinary potential&quot;) serves to underscore the somewhat mixed blessings of the book, itself.<br />Did I find this to be an interesting book? Certainly. Did I seriously &quot;get something out of it?&quot; I'm shrugging a bit, at this second question. The author has certainly succeeded in writing a book many gifted people will relate to, simply because they will recognize themselvbes in the pages. But does the mere ability to make people relate to the text make this a *useful* book? Again, I am shrugging a bit, and I find myself saying &quot;Yes, this was interesting, but I am not really that much wiser, so what exactly *was* the point....?&quot; Ultimately, the &quot;usefulness&quot; of the book will depend on what the reader is looking for-- MY perception is that this book is more &quot;descriptive&quot; than &quot;educational.&quot;<br />But back to the book's contents. It is divided into three sections:<br />Part One establishes what exactly the author *means* by the term &quot;gifted grownup.&quot; On the initial plus side, Streznewski avoids the trap of correlating &quot;giftedness&quot; with numerical IQ scores. Instead she attributes giftedness to (a somewhat arbitrary?) 3-5% of the population who have exceptionally perceptive minds, quick thoughts and extraordinary talents. These people are then subcategorized into Strivers, Superstars and Independents. The rest of the section offers a bit of historical background on &quot;defining giftedness,&quot; theories on the brains of gifted individuals, as well as an interesting (and fairly accurate) commentary on the way many gifted adults tend to &quot;hide&quot; their giftedness, due to social/environmental pressures.<br />Part Two traces the impact of giftedness of the life of a person, from birth to adulthood, covering childhood and parenting (along with other family dynamics), schooling and work. I found myself able to relate especially well to the section describing the difficulties many gifted children have while in school.<br />Part Three focuses on &quot;Gifted Lives,&quot; covering such topics as gifted adults and relationships, special issues facing gifted women, and gifted senior citizens. At the end, Streznewski has added a section of resources and recommended reading.<br />&quot;Gifted Grownups&quot; did an excellent job of providing a large number of &quot;Oh wow! Me too!&quot; moments-- and thus offers nice validation, especially for those Gifted Adults who may feel like &quot;misfits&quot; in the world. Streznewski uses quotes from the many (over 100) gifted adults she interviewed in her research for the book, and many will be able to recognize themselves in these excerpts. Yes, there are indeed others &quot;like you,&quot; out there!<br />But as I finished reading, it all struck me as being somewhat long on opinion and too focused on the fact &quot;that&quot; gifted adults face certain challenges, while too short on scientific research, explanations and &quot;why&quot; those difficulties occur. And it is also long on somewhat self-congratulatory &quot;feel good&quot; vignettes, but short on real-life solutions, help and applications for those Gifted Adults who find life to be a struggle. Finally, I found Streznewski to step somewhat lightly over the psychological issues facing the gifted.<br />In short: &quot;Mixed blessings.&quot; But given how few books are available on Adult Giftedness, it was definitely worth a read. However, not enough &quot;meat&quot; here to warrant a 5-star rating.<br />Final thoughts: Recommended (7.5 out of 10 possible bookmarks). If you're a Gifted Adult, it'll offer you moments of recognition. More highly recommended for teachers of the gifted, in that it provides insights they might not otherwise have, and certainly recommended for any member ofa family that feels &quot;mystified&quot; by a gifted family member.<br />Thanks for reading!<br />--Peterof a family that feels &quot;mystified&quot; by a gifted family member.<br />Thanks for reading!<BR>--Peter	2004-06-30

I have been a student of handwriting analyis for about a dozen-odd years. Handwriting analysis-- formally known as Graphology-- is known to many people, and is used worldwide as a psychoanalytical tool to give us insights into someone's personality. There is considerable scientific evidence to suggest that since our hand (and thus writing) moves as a result of electrical impulses from our brains, our handwriting is a very accurate representation of our state of mind, and the way we think and behave. Although still regarded as a &quot;soft science,&quot; Graphology is now used extensively in courts, in the crimal justice system, by therapists and by employers.<br />Graphotherapy takes a &quot;reverse&quot; approach, suggesting that if a certain style of writing is representative of a certain personality trait or characteristic, then by changing our writing style, we must also be able to &quot;reverse engineer&quot; and change certain behavioral traits.<br />This book is NOT about handwriting analysis-- it is about about how modifying your handwriting can change the way we think, act and react.<br />The first half of the book provides readers with a general overview of various aspects of handwriting, and their meaning. In this section we are also introduced to the &quot;Vimala Alphabet,&quot; which is the author's interpretation of &quot;ideal&quot; handwriting-- digitized into a computer font, but not difficult to reproduce with pen and ink.<br />The second half of the book walks us through the letters of the alphabet, one by one, explaining the corresponding personality traits, thoughts or habits associated with both the uppercase and lowercase version of each letter. Along with the recommendations on how to shape each letter, Rodgers also shows us a number of ways NOT to write certain letters, since they have negative connotations. At the end of the book, there is a brief chapter suggesting how to undertake daily exersises to help permanently change your handwriting over time.<br />The one (fairly minor) reservation I have with this otherwise noteworthy and useful book concerns the author's &quot;Vimala Alphabet.&quot; I feel that it is based rather heavily on the assumption that everyone wants the SAME traits, and interpret the SAME traits as &quot;what they should strive for&quot; in life. Other works on graphotherapy put more effort into explaining the psychological implications of DIFFERENT ways of writing each letter, while Ms. Rodgers' book simply suggests that the Vimala Alphabet is &quot;the answer&quot;-- and the justifications for adopting it are a bit vague and not well explained. Whereas most recomendations are sound-- from a graphological standpoint-- there is a definite emphasis towards &quot;extreme positive,&quot; rather than a more &quot;balanced person&quot; approach. This is the only reason the book doesn't quite merit a 5-star rating.<br />Final thoughts: Recommended (8.5 out of 10 possible bookmarks). As a therapeutic tool for self-improvement, graphotherapy provides an easy and inexpensive way to get a lot of value for your money, and Rodgers does a thorough and understandable job.ng over time.<br />The one (fairly minor) reservation I have with this otherwise noteworthy and useful book concerns the author's &quot;Vimala Alphabet.&quot; I feel that it is based rather heavily on the assumption that everyone wants the SAME traits, and interpret the SAME traits as &quot;what they should strive for&quot; in life.

Sandra Maitri's &quot;The Spiritual Dimension of the Enneagram&quot; is, without doubt, the most insightful and meaningful book on the enneagram I have read. However, I must also agree with Ms. Maitri's own comments elsewhere on this page and caution potential readers that this is not a &quot;beach read&quot; and is best suited as reading for those who are seriously ready-- and honestly ABLE-- to take a deeper look at their own psycho-spiritual essence and soul. This is not a pop-psychology &quot;personality typing&quot; book, but rather a valuable guide for people-- &quot;seekers&quot;-- on their journey of self-discovery, transformation and self-realization.<br />Yes, the book DOES touch on the &quot;Nine Points&quot; of the enneagram in the &quot;personality type&quot; context most people know it, and it covers the psychological aspects of the different &quot;types.&quot; The majority of &quot;The Spiritual Dimension of the Enneagram&quot; is dedicated to a thorough discussion of each of the nine enneagram points, examining the way each has &quot;lost touch&quot; with its essence or &quot;Holy Idea;&quot; describing the psychological and environmental circumstances for these losses, and then offering guidance on how to recover the part of the self that has been lost. That is an oversimplification, of course, as there is SO much more here. Maitri takes us on a spiritual journey that comes as close as ANY contemporary writer to reaching the origins of the enneagram as a system for integrating the nine ASPECTS (as opposed to personality &quot;TYPES&quot;) of human consciousness into a whole and self-actualized person. And, in taking that journey, readers must be prepared to look &quot;beneath the surface&quot; and examine some of the &quot;not so nice&quot; (or &quot;shadow&quot; aspects) of their beings. Whereas the insights offered are often profound, they may also be a bit disturbing to some readers-- in the sense one would feel &quot;disturbed&quot; by a writer's ability to describe parts of one's psyche that has never been shared with anyone else.<br />The term &quot;sprituality&quot; by no means makes this a &quot;religious&quot; book-- an angle I generally avoid in a psychology and self-help context. Instead, it is a book about understanding and healing our souls, regardless of religious orientation.<br />Final thoughts: HIGHLY recommended (10 out of 10 possible bookmarks), possibly the best enneagram related book I have read in 10+ years! Definitely a book for the &quot;serious student;&quot; familiarity with the enneagram and the process of objective self-scrutiny is STRONGLY suggested (if not *essential*)-- as is a strong vocabulary and knowledge of the finer nuances of the English language.

BUT....	Helen Palmer is widely viewed as one of the foremost experts on the &quot;modern&quot; enneagram, and her books are regarded by many as &quot;standard&quot; references on this system of personality typing, psychology, spirituality and self-growth. As a long-time student of the enneagram, I find that I often reach for one of her books when I have a question.<br />In this book, Palmer offers only the briefest of introductions to the historical background of the enneagram, and then goes on to in-depth descriptions of each of the nine enneatypes. For each type, she covers the basic personality traits, biases and preoccupations, as well briefly addressing the three &quot;instinctual variants&quot; found within each. She then proceeds to describe each type &quot;in love&quot; and &quot;at work.&quot; In terms of love, these descriptions attempt to explain what it is like to &quot;live with&quot; each type, as well as that type's orientation towards intimacy and the &quot;signals&quot; (positive AND negative) they send to their intimate surroundings. In the &quot;work&quot; contexts, Palmer covers work styles, leadership styles, teamwork and areas of conflict. Overall, I found the descriptions to be quite accurate, and I gained some new insights into why people in my life behave the way they do.<br />The most useful part of the book is the third section, the &quot;Directory of Relationships.&quot; This is basically a &quot;matrix&quot; of descriptions outlining how any given type is likely to interact with any other type. For each combination (for example, &quot;four with nine&quot;) there is a brief description of the dynamic that might exist in a love relationship, as well as the dynamic of a boss/employee work relationship. The book is worth buying for this section, alone.<br />There is no &quot;quiz&quot; or &quot;self test&quot; in this book to help readers determine their enneagram type, so it is definitely beneficial to know your enneatype before starting-- otherwise be prepared to spend some time reading the different type descriptions before you can really gain much benefit from the relationship/work focus of the book's content.<br />I do have a few &quot;niggles&quot; with &quot;The Enneagram in Love &amp; Work;&quot; some of which have already been touched on by prior reviewers. Palmer seems to have a somewhat uneven knowledge of each of the nine enneagram types. In spite of her &quot;expert status,&quot; I give her the benefit of the doubtm as this is possibly a reflection that she's a follower of the &quot;oral tradition&quot; of the enneagram-- which revolves around learning from each type as they talk about their lives. The shortcoming of this system is that certain personality types are DRAWN to psychology workshops (thus offering a greater wealth of knowledge) while other types would have little interest in such things, thus resulting in underrepresentation and limited information. In general, though, Palmer offers many more accurate insights than questionable ones.<br />Another (very minor) problem I have is that Palmer starts the book by outlining the enneagram from a spiritual path perspective, setting the scene from the Bible's &quot;Seven deadly sins&quot; (Plus two others, which I am never quite sure where come from!), yet the entire book is basically focused on &quot;personality type psychology.&quot; Given the body of work presented here, I think she would have done well to have provided more psychological perspectives in the introduction-- surprising, in a way, given that Helen Palmer is a practicing psychotherapist.<br />Final Thoughts: Recommended (8 out of possible 10 bookmarks); Palmer does a fair job of taking on the topic relationships between enneagram types, but at the end I still find myself thinking that &quot;there's really more to it than this.&quot; This is perhaps not the most useful book for someone who's just starting out, but definitely a useful (and fun) reference for a person with some basic knowledge of the enneagram, or psychological type, in general.<br />Thanks for reading!<br />--Petersic knowledge of the enneagram, or psychological type, in general.<br />Thanks for reading!<br />--Peter	2003-11-12

Unlike most books on personality types, this book is NOT about the theory and application of a particular system, nor is it about helping people determine their personality type. Instead, Jeffries' slim volume sets out to answer the most commonly asked questions about the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the world's most widely used personality typing system.<br />The author is an Organizational Development Consultant (and Duke University PhD) who specializes in creative applications of the MBTI in practical situations. This book answers the 50 most frequently asked questions about Myers-Briggs, as he has been asked them during many years of giving workshops and consulting with 100s of organizations. Here are just a few examples:<br />-- How reliable are my results?<br />-- Can I change my type?<br />-- Can the MBTI be used for psychologically disturbed people?<br />-- How does my age affect my type?<br />-- What is meant by &quot;falsification of type?&quot;<br />-- Do men and women differ in how they report type?<br />-- If I am under pressure when I fill out the indicator, will my results still be valid?<br />-- Can't I come out ANY type I want on the MBTI?<br />-- How can I best describe the MBTI and the associated preferences to an audience?<br />-- Why do many Jungians reject the J-P preference on the MBTI?<br />The answers to these (and 40 other questions) are generally short and clear, with a few going into some depth. At the end of the questions, Jeffries spends some time offering a brief summary of what the MBTI is, and isn't, and what it can, and can't measure.<br />Overall rating: Highly Recommended (9 bookmarks out of a possible 10) BUT keep in mind that this is a book for those who are already know their type and are somewhat familiar with the MBTI.

As I sat down to write a review of this book, my initial thought was to call it &quot;Helen Palmer Light.&quot; But there's a lot more than that to this slim volume.<br />The enneagram is an old and very complex system of personality typing and self-growth. In just 175 pages, Webb gives the reader a brief overview of how the system works, and then provides concise thumbnail sketches of each of the nine enneagram psychological types. The type descriptions are followed by two especially useful sections: One on ways to distinguish between &quot;lookalikes&quot; across the nine types; and another on communication, both from the perspective of being a listener and a speaker, belonging to each type. The book concludes with a short opinion on &quot;what to do next,&quot; along with a (somewhat UK-centric) resource directory.<br />Whereas Karen Webb leaves us with little doubt that she's a big fan of Helen Palmer-- Palmer even wrote the foreword-- &quot;Thorsons Principles of The Enneagram&quot; is really an excellent introduction to a very complex subject, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's curious enough to want to learn the &quot;basics.&quot; Webb's style follows the &quot;oral tradition&quot; of the enneagram-- which also means that there is no &quot;quiz&quot; to determine your type; instead, you would need to read about each type and make your determination based on the descriptions.<br />Final thoughts: Highly recommended (9.5 out of a possible 10 bookmarks). I own more than 50 books on this subject, and this is possibly the best &quot;concise introduction&quot; available.	2003-09-18

I am always a bit suspicious of books that makes claims such as the subtitle of this one: &quot;The only introdution you'll ever need.&quot; However, Leo Rutherford does an excellent job of covering the major aspects of Shamanism in enough detail to give the novice (or curious) a basic sense of what is entailed in this ancient spiritual path-- all in a scant 160 pages.<br />The book-- in a concise fashion-- covers a definition of Shamanism and mythology, then introduces the reader briefly to the concepts of the Medicine Wheel; the &quot;tools&quot; of Shamanic living-- including ceremony and ritual; journeying and soul retrievals-- including &quot;non-ordinary&quot; realities; Trance Dancing as a path to healing; and &quot;Teacher&quot; plants from nature. Rutherford concludes with a section on &quot;Shamanism Today,&quot; and includes an appendix with assorted resources-- however, please note that the resources are somewhat &quot;skewed&quot; towards the UK, where this book was published.<br />Final thoughts: Highly recommended! (10 out of a possible 10 bookmarks) Very readable, and highly worthwhile, introductory text on Shamanism.	2003-07-14

I have been a student of the enneagram for a long time, and I frequently reach for this book as a reference.<br />The book is divided into two main parts. The first 70 or so pages are dedicated to an overview of the enneagram system, both from historical perspectives, as well as in terms of pratical application. The remainder (and majority) of the book's 400-odd pages provides a well organized wealth of information on each of the nine enneagram personality types. Because each of these nine chapters are laid out in a standard &quot;template&quot; format, expect some minor duplication from chapter to chapter.<br />UNlike most personality typing books, Helen Palmer's book does NOT include any kind of &quot;quiz&quot; to help readers determine their enneagram type. However, the descriptions of each type are so thorough that it isn't difficult to determine which one is the best fit.<br />The book is quite comprehensive, and goes well beyond merely examining the enneagram as a &quot;personality type inventory,&quot; instead also covering the self-growth and life philosophy aspects of the system. Palmer goes into great depth in her decriptions of each of the Nine enneagram personality types-- starting with the childhood &quot;programming&quot; that influences current behavior patterns, then going on to outline the adult &quot;preoccupations,&quot; including how they affect that type's behavior in both intimate and &quot;authority&quot; relationships. She relies extensively on the &quot;oral tradition&quot; of the enneagram; that is-- the practice of listening to, and learning from, groups of people of the same &quot;type,&quot; talking about their lives and motivations. Many quotes and examples from Palmer's enneagram study groups are included in the book, and they add a nice &quot;live&quot; counterpoint to what is otherwise somewhat &quot;academic&quot; material. Each chapter also includes a brief description of &quot;instinctual subtypes,&quot; and concludes with a list of actions/environments that might help each type grow and thrive.<br />If there is one (minor) complaint I have about this book, it is perhaps that Palmer has a tendency to dwell at length on the negative or &quot;defective&quot; traits of human nature while not really giving equal time to the positive-- or even how to work our way through the negative. In addition, she does not acknowledge the possibility that an &quot;emotionally healthy&quot; version of any type might exist-- which is one of the reasons I prefer the work of Riso and Hudson. In personal growth terms, it is certainly of great importance to identify the pitfalls of life (Our &quot;preoccupations,&quot; as Palmer calls them), but it is almost of equal importance to be offered some guidance for self-devlopment-- and this book falls a bit short in that area. Which, in a way, is surprising, since Helen Palmer is a practicing psychotherapist. However, this is trivial issue that really doesn't detract a great deal from the book's overall usefulness.<br />Final thoughts: An excellent and worthwhile reference (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks), especially for the more serious student of the enneagram. Provides a nice counterpoint to Riso &amp; Hudson's writings. Perhaps not the best &quot;first read&quot; for someone just beginning to explore the enneagram-- if that's you, I'd recommend Baron &amp; Wagele's &quot;The Enneagram Made Easy&quot; as an excellent introduction.<br />Thanks for reading!<br />--Peterram study groups are included in the book, and they add a nice &quot;live&quot; counterpoint to what is otherwise somewhat &quot;academic&quot; material.

For many years I have enjoyed (and studied, to some degree) personality and psychological tests of various kinds. If you like the idea of getting a whole batch of different psychology tests in ONE book-- rather than having to buy a separate book for EACH test-- then this may be the book for you.<br />Louis Janda's book is divided into five sections, each containing five tests, under the general headings of \\"Getting Ahead\\" (intelligence, work and life experience); \\"Getting it Together\\" (Self-esteem and self-image); \\"Getting Along\\" (Your intereaction and social style); \\"Getting Together\\" (Your relationship styles) and \\"Getting it on\\" (Your sexuality and intimacy preferences). There is only the briefest of introductions on how to use the book and the metrics of psychological tests, and at the end of each test Janda includes only a few VERY brief statements about the development of each particular test, and the meaning of your results.<br />These 25 tests were, indeed, developed by psychologists and researchers, and they certainly have the potential to teach you a thing or two about yourself. However, the nature of this \\"book of tests\\" also means that there simply isn't any significant room left over for interpretation of test scores, nor for helping the reader *apply* the information to their own self-growth. As such, I would be happy to recommend the book for someone who's already familiar with psychological testing-- however, if you're just getting *started* on the concept of psychology, I expect this text would leave you with the thoughts \\"OK, so these are my results. Now what???\\"<br />Final thoughts: Recommended (7.5 out of a possible 10 bookmarks), but mainly for those who already have some familiarity with psychology and testing.	2003-03-22

This is one of the &quot;odd&quot; little books residing in my self-awareness library. Yes, I do own this book. Don Riso is well known as one of the world's foremost experts on the Enneagram and he has written some of my most used books on the topic, but this slim volume (130 pages in mass-market paperback size)is quite a departure from his normal style. Gone are the deep psychological analyses of personality types and their behavioral patterns-- replaced by a set of 25 single-sentence statements (16 &quot;Releases&quot; and 9 &quot;Affirmations&quot;) for each of the nine Enneagram types. There's also a final section with &quot;general&quot; affirmations relevant to all types.<br />And that's about it, folks.<br />So who would really benefit from this book? Well, if you're looking to learn about the Enneagram, this is NOT a good book. Get yourself Riso &amp; Hudson's &quot;Personality Types,&quot; instead. However, if you're already a student or fan of the Enneagram-- and are interested in some self-exploration/self-improvement in addition to learning-- this would probably be of interest, as it is a nice companion to more &quot;scholarly&quot; texts. If you're someone who enjoys daily affirmations as motivation-- and you do KNOW your Enneagram type, but *don't* care about the system, otherwise-- this might also be a good book for you, since the affirmations are accurately matched to your particular personality type and will seem remarkable &quot;relevant.&quot;<br />Essentially, this is not much of an &quot;Enneagram book,&quot; rather, it is a somewhat lightweight &quot;self-help book.&quot; The real question you have to ask yourself is whether or not you're willing to pay &quot;the price of admission&quot; to get 25 &quot;motivational insights,&quot; well matched to your particular personality.<br />Final thoughts: Recommended (8 out of 10 possible bookmarks), but only for the SPECIFIC audience outlined above. Otherwise-- to paraphrase Obi-Wan-- &quot;This is NOT the book you're looking for.&quot;the book you're looking for.&quot;	2003-01-28

Baron &amp; Wagele's &quot;The Enneagram Made Easy&quot; is-- for my money-- one of the best introductory level books available for someone who's just beginning to study the Enneagram, or who just wants some &quot;bare bones&quot; coverage to satisfy their curiosity about this ancient personality typing system. Although I have studied the Enneagram for many years, I often refer to this book when trying to illustrate basic concepts to someone who has expressed an interest.<br />The authors have put together a light hearted and highly readable book about the basics of the Enneagram. Each of the nine &quot;types&quot; has its own standardized chapter, which includes a &quot;personality inventory&quot; checklist to help readers determine their type; then coverage of the ups and downs of that type; relationships, relating, typical thoughts, childhood, parenting, careers and free time. The chapters also include brief coverage of &quot;wings,&quot; as well as a section of &quot;practical suggestions and exercises&quot; (for making life easier) for each type.<br />The final 20 or so pages of the book covers the interaction and overlaps between the Enneagram types and Jungian psychological types, specifically making comparisons with the popular Myers-Briggs typology system.<br />The book is illustrated throughout with Elizabeth Wagele's generally funny-- often poignant, sometimes silly cartoon drawings.<br />Do keep in mind, however, that this book presents a VERY superficial and simplistic outline of a profoundly complex and thorough psychological &quot;personality mapping&quot; and philosophical system. If you are seriously interested in studying and understanding the complexities of the Enneagram, I highly recommend that you also invest in one of Riso/Hudson's or Helen Palmer's more thorough books.<br />Final thoughts: Excellent (9.5 bookmarks out of a possible 10); keeping in mind that this is an introductory text and by no means a &quot;thorough&quot; work on the Enneagram. A quick and easy read, and well worth it!agram. A quick and easy read, and well worth it!	2003-01-08

Sometimes I like to supplement my studies of psychology and &quot;personality typing&quot; by picking up a book that falls outside the mainstream framework. Mac Fulfer's &quot;Amazing Face Reading&quot; caught my eye while I was looking for something completely different, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />Face reading-- also known as physiognomy-- is the 2,000+ year old &quot;soft science&quot; of learning about people and their personality from looking at, and understanding, their facial features. The author is an attorney and jury consultant who studied 1,000s of people through his work and established correlations between certain physical characteristics, behavior and personality. After 20 years of study, he summarized his findings in this informative, interesting and easy-to-read book.<br />The book is richly illustrated with 200+ high quality pencil drawings, accompanied by concise paragraphs about each facial characteristic. After covering the basics of face reading, Fulfer includes a section on different applications for what you have learned-- as applied to the fields of Sales and Jury Selection-- and also includes brief coverage of reading facial expressions and body language.<br />Is &quot;Face reading&quot; a science? Well, I'll leave that for someone else to decide. Does it have merit? From what I have learned, Fulfer's principles seem almost uncannily accurate-- although I expect they are best used in conjunction with other psychological tools. To those who dismiss face reading out of hand, I do have to point out that many of the principles draw on pretty well researched fields such as NLP and reading body language. There's also a large component of intuition and common sense involved. For example, it doesn't take a degree in rocket science to conclude that someone with laugh lines at the coroner of their eyes are more likely to have a sense of humor than someone with frown lines. We ARE the sum total of our experiences in life, and we &quot;wear&quot; the effects of many of those experiences-- trauma, stress, joy, anger, etc.-- on our faces.<br />Final thoughts: Recommended (8.5 out of a possible 10 bookmarks) but keep in mind that this is not an &quot;exact science.&quot; However, the book *will* teach you to pay more attention to people, and it has the potential to help you understand others' motivitions during your daily life.&quot; the effects of many of those experiences-- trauma, stress, joy, anger, etc.-- on our faces. <br />Final thoughts: Recommended (8.5 out of a possible 10 bookmarks) but keep in mind that this is not an &quot;exact science.&quot; However, the book *will* teach you to pay more attention to people, and it has the potential to help you understand others' motivitions during your daily life.	2002-12-27

This book provides readers with a 70-item \\"self test,\\" and then goes on to outline some of the principles and history behind determining type. Keirsey explains the four \\"basic\\" temperaments: Dionysian, Epimethean, Promethean and Apollonian, from which all other subgroups are derived-- 16, in all.<br /><br />Once explained, he moves on to cover the impact of type on \\"mate selection,\\" children and parenting, as well as leadership and work. Finally, there is a very LONG appendix which contains detailed \\"Portraits\\" of each of the 16 personality types, using the same 4-letter designations as the Myers-Briggs system. Although many people are introduced to personality inventories in a work setting, they really provide a useful \\"roadmap\\" to self-understanding in many *other* aspects of life.<br /><br />A large part of my liking of this book is not merely due to the concise and easy-to-understand coverage of typology, but also due to Keirsey's call for a change in the way we view people and personality. Instead of the conventional (at the time the book was published, 1978) attitude that you could \\"change\\" yourself into any type of personality you wanted to be (the so-called \\"Pygmalion Project\\"), we should instead just accept, and work with, the basic traits and differences we were born with.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Highly Recommended (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks) for anyone seeking a basic understanding of Personality Theory. Provides some interesting insights for both the casual and serious student of personality type. Fairly easy to read, although a bit \\"stiff\\" at times.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!<br />--Peter (an INFJ)e basic traits and differences we were born with.

I say &quot;accidental&quot; because I saw &quot;9 types of lovers&quot; and jumped to the incorrect conclusion that this was an enneagram book. Whereas this certainly IS a personality type book, it has nothing to do with the enneagram.<br />Daphne Rose Kingma is a practicing psychoanalyst and also a prolific writer who specializes in love and relationships. This book draws on her 25+ years of experience in counseling couples and individuals, during which time she has concluded that people tend to fit into nine basic &quot;love types,&quot; each with their own characteristics and idiosyncracies.<br />The majority of the book is dedicated to Kingma's detailed descriptions of each of the nine types of lovers. Each chapter starts with a section on how to identify a type; then covers the various &quot;attraction&quot; and &quot;detraction&quot; characteristics of that type. Next, we're offered a fairly thorough psychological explanation for how a person's history makes them fit into their type, identifying the specific &quot;emotional wound&quot; that affects their behavior pattern. I found these to be the most insightful and poignant parts of the book, with some very &quot;on the money&quot; ideas. Finally, each chapter has a section directed to the person actually of that type, with suggestions on how to better understand and manage their relationships.<br />The book is fun and easy to read, and mostly works as a tool to identify and understand each of the nine types. It does outline some very basic truths about How We Are, and I agree with the previous reviewer that it would be a good resource for someone stuck in a pattern of choosing the same kind of (unsuccessful) relationship, over and over. On the downside, I feel that very little time is given to the more practical aspects of how each type interacts with other types, &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot; combinations, the realities of finding the right type for you, and so on. And although Kingma uses a fairly upbeat tone, I did come away with the feeling that the popular psycho-buzz phrase &quot;everyone is damaged&quot; must *really* be true-- at least based on this book.<br />Final thoughts: Recommended, although not brilliant (7.5 bookmarks out of a possible 10). Does a nice job of teaching us about the different types, but is a little thin on how to APPLY that knowledge.

Billed as \\"A Novel,\\" futurist Daniel Quinn's tale of humanity's condition and fate on the planet is really only a \\"novel\\" in the same sense that James Redfield's \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" was labeled a \\"novel:\\" Ishmael is basically about the author's philosophy and a set of teachings, wrapped in a thin veneer of very minimal storyline. The core lesson? Sustainability is essential to our survival. That's the \\"short version.\\" Now....<br />I expect some of you will have come here because the book is \\"required reading\\" in a philosophy course; or perhaps because you heard about it and have an interest in philosphy. And you will no doubt find it \\"annoying\\" that the author has tried to write a \\"story.\\" Others may be considering this as a \\"novel,\\" and you will probably be disappointed that there really isn't much \\"story.\\" Because there isn't, and you'll most likely find Quinn's slightly \\"preachy\\" style offputting. If you've read some of the other 500+ reviews, you probably noticed that most of the negative comments had to do with confusion over what the author \\"is trying to do.\\"<br />Thus, in order to get something out of this book, I suggest that you abandon any need to make it fit a \\"genre,\\" and instead just consider the underlying philosophical message. If you enjoy discussions about \\"The Meaning Of Things,\\" you could well enjoy this book. If you consider yourself a \\"Serious Philosopher\\" be aware that \\"Ishmael\\" is quite introductory-level in its presentation.<br /><br />That said, Ishmael is the \\"story\\" of a teacher and a student. The teacher (and also Quinn's \\"mouthpiece\\" for conveying his philosophy) is a telepathic gorilla; the student is the man who answers an unusual ad in the paper: \\"TEACHER seeks pupil. Must have an earnest desire to save the world. Apply in person.\\"<br />The book presents Quinn's interpretation of the tale of humanity. As we progress through the book, we learn about the \\"hows\\" and \\"whys\\" of \\"The Way Things Are\\" in our modern world, and \\"how they got to be this way.\\" Ishmael (the gorilla) uses a variation on \\"Socratic teaching\\" to guide his student to drawing his own conclusions. Finally, Ishmael (Quinn) presents us with some possible solutions to change the inevitably apocalyptic scenario that represents humankind's final destiny, should we continue along our current path. Whereas a solid 80-90% of the book is dedicated to conveying the author's philosophy, we're occasionally sidetracked by the thin thread of \\"plot,\\" there to remind us that we're ostensibly reading a novel, rather than a philosophy text.<br />Quinn's ideas center around the premise that at some point, humanity decided that it was no longer subject to the basic \\"laws\\" of nature and the universe. He argues that our ensuing problems with pollution, overpopulation, hunger, disease, crime and a host of other issues can be traced back to the point when we decided to no longer follow the \\"Gods,\\" but instead to BECOME those \\"Gods,\\" bending the world to our perceived needs and whims; and creating our own definitions as to what is absolute \\"good\\" and \\"evil.\\" Along with this, we developed our \\"civilized\\" habits of taking more from the Earth and the Universe than we actually need. End result? 1000s of species dying, and eventually we will succumb, as the natural end game of a process we started, ourselves. Please note that I use the term \\"Gods\\" very loosely in this paragraph, as this is not a religious book.<br />From a philosophy standpoint, the book succeeds, in as much as it makes us think about life, and our future on this planet. From a \\"story\\" standpoint, there's not much there. Overall, I found \\"Ishmael\\" to be an enjoyable and fairly easy read, and I think the somewhat \\"general\\" nature of the book is attributable to the fact that Quinn is essentially using it to \\"set the stage\\" for a subsequent series of books that go on to explore his philosophy in greater detail.<br />Final thoughts: Well worth reading (9 outof a possible 10 bookmarks). If you have an open mind, and an interest in \\"big pattern thinking,\\" it's not a stretch to understand why \\"Ishmael\\" is as awarded and talked about as it is.

As testament to its continuing usefulness, my aging copy of &quot;Getting Unstuck&quot; is full of highlighted passages, pencilled margin notes and post-its. I RARELY write in books. Although many (some more &quot;popular&quot;) books have been written on the topic of &quot;getting your life out of a rut,&quot; I have found Dr. Simon's book to be one of the best in the &quot;Motivational&quot; genre. I highly recommend it!<br />I found this book at a time when I was stuck in a dead-end relationship and a counselor had told me to &quot;Get on with YOUR life.&quot; That was almost 10 years ago. What I continue to find particularly appealing about this book is its straightforwardness. Instead of a lot of &quot;buzzwords,&quot; &quot;song and dance routines&quot; and &quot;feel-good exercises,&quot; the author follows a simple approach of &quot;Here's where you are, here's where you COULD be; here's what to think about to get from &quot;here&quot; to &quot;there.&quot;<br />The early parts of the book provide an overview of the different ways in which people do get &quot;stuck&quot; in their lives; then-- with some simple exercises-- the author helps you identify some of the &quot;whys&quot; and &quot;hows&quot; associated with changing the direction of your life.<br />The bulk of the book identifies and addresses the different &quot;obstacles&quot; we deliberately put in our way, and the implications of changing your life in the face of them. Topics covered include Self-esteem, options in life, our values, &quot;Letting Go&quot; (of old ways), fear, and dealing with our needs for &quot;Cooperation&quot; and &quot;Perfection.&quot; Each chapter includes simple exercises and tools for identifying your own personal &quot;pitfalls,&quot; as well as real-life examples of how to apply the principles learned.<br />The final two chapters deal with the all-important concept that it's not enough to &quot;know HOW&quot; to get unstuck-- you also have to more forward and actually &quot;do&quot; it. If this book has a &quot;flaw,&quot; it is perhaps that this section doesn't *quite* have as much &quot;meat&quot; on its bones as one could hope for.<br />The book is not specific, in terms of having to do with work, or relationships, or family or any other *particular* area. Rather, it helps people identify, deal with, and move on from, the FEELING of being &quot;stuck&quot; in some aspect of their lives.<br />Final thoughts: Excellent book!

If you have read Elaine Aron's original book &quot;The Highly Sensitive Person&quot; and have determined that you are *definitely* an HSP, then the next logical step in personal development might be to buy this workbook-- especially if you find yourself struggling somewhat in your dealings with the world.<br />&quot;The Highly Sensitive Person's Workbook&quot; *can* stand alone, but I would HIGHLY recommend reading Dr. Aron's original book on High Sensitivity before attacking the Workbook.<br />This is definitely an excellent tool to teach the HSP how to become more of an &quot;expert&quot; on themselves, and their sensitivity. HOWEVER, I must also caution that the book might be a bit daunting, or overwhelming, for the individual to work their way through on their own. As such, I would characterize the book as &quot;superb&quot; in an HSP support group setting, but perhaps only &quot;good&quot; to &quot;very good&quot; for an individual. That was certainly my personal experience after I bought the Workbook. I made a number of &quot;false start&quot; attempts at working through the exercises in the book by myself, but it wasn't until I got involved in an online &quot;HSP study group&quot; (not so diffuclt to find, by the way) that I managed to get all the way through. Having completed the workbook, I will say that it was a thoroughly worthwhile effort!<br />Here's what you get:<br />This Workbook is essentially a journey of Self-Exploration for HSPs. The early chapters address how to identify and become familiar with your sensitivity; subsequently Dr. Aron takes you through sensitivity in childhood, in social intereactions, and eventually in the context of the workplace and adult (intimate) relationships. Finally, there are sections &quot;deeper wounds&quot; and psychotherapy; medical and health issues, and finally Spirituality. There is also a discussion on setting up, and working within, an HSP group setting.<br />The focus of the chapters is generally on self-examination, &quot;re-framing&quot; past negatives related to your sensitivity, and practical suggestions for ways to go forward. Each chapter has many exercises which are mostly designed to be done in writing, as they require considerable reflection before formulating an answer. This is definitely where a &quot;group discussion&quot; setting becomes most helpful.<br />To get the maximum benefit from the workbook, you DO have to be &quot;emotionally honest.&quot; As such, some of the exercises may be quite difficult to some readers-- since they ask you to look at parts of your life history that may be very painful, as well as areas in which you may feel that your sensitivity is (or has been) a &quot;character flaw.&quot;<br />Final thoughts: Highly Recommended (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks), especially if you have a support group-- or maybe just a couple of HSP friends-- with whom to share feedback on the exercises.mination, &quot;re-framing&quot; past negatives related to your sensitivity, and practical suggestions for ways to go forward.

This book was recommended to me in 1995, by a friend who knew that I was struggling with a difficult marriage and a business that was going nowhere. &quot;Read this!&quot; he said, &quot;it will change your life.&quot; So, having little to lose, I bought the book and read it.<br />&quot;Wake-up Calls&quot; perhaps didn't change my LIFE, but it certainly gave me some things to think about.<br />The fundamental idea in this book is that many of us fall into a pattern of &quot;sleepwalking&quot; through our lives, but life also presents us with a large number of so-called &quot;wake-up calls.&quot; These can range from major-- divorce, bankruptcy, getting fired-- to relatively minor-- a promotion, an invitation to an important social event. Each wake-up call generally results in us facing a &quot;choice point,&quot; and from each choice point, we have the chance to learn and grow.<br />The book is fairly simple and very easy to read, and guides the reader through a step-by-step process of first teaching us to recognize where we may have choice points; then goes on to teach us how to overcome old habits, change direction-- and go on to &quot;stay awake&quot; instead of sleepwalking through life.<br />Almost every chapter is laid out with bullet-point lists, simple exercises to use with your OWN situation; as well as a closing list of &quot;Awareness Checks&quot;-- a list of questions to make readers think about how to apply the current chapter to their own life. The writing is &quot;light&quot; and Allenbaugh uses personal anecdotes to help readers relate &quot;ideas&quot; to &quot;reality.&quot;<br />Overall Rating: Highly Recommended (9 bookmarks out of a possible 10) BUT this book is probably best suited to those who are just BEGINNING a journey of self-discovery. It provides some straightforward principles for &quot;getting on with life.&quot; Although I have certainly referred back to &quot;Wake-up Calls&quot; from time to time, it is a somewhat basic motivational book, and probably too simplistic for someone who has already spent some time with other self-exploration.nal book, and probably too simplistic for someone who has already spent some time with other self-exploration.	2002-11-22

As a long-time student of the Enneagram, I am frequently reminded that this book is my best-- and most frequently used-- reference on the subject. Almost every time I pick it up, I gain new insights-- even after six years of diligent use! Apart from its thorough usefulness, I think that what makes &quot;Personality Types&quot; my personal favorite, is the fact that it views humanity, the psyche and personality types from a &quot;neutral&quot; position-- unlike other writers in this field, who seem predisposed to focus more on the negative aspects. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone seriously interested in the Enneagram!<br />At 500+ pages; this book offers comprehensive coverage of many different aspects of the Enneagram, drawing on Riso's 25+ years of research and experience in the field. The book starts with some background information and a short history of the Enneagram; then offers a set og thorough guidelines for understanding and using the Enneagram.<br />The bulk of the book is, of course, dedicated to nine chapters that thoroughly describe each of the nine Enneagram types. These descriptions go well beyond your basic &quot;thumbnail sketch,&quot; to include characteristics of each type along a scale of &quot;mental health&quot; from healthy, to average, to unhealthy. The authors also cover the major &quot;subtypes&quot; of each type, as well as the dynamics of &quot;integration&quot; and &quot;disintegration.&quot;<br />The final part of the book goes into more advanced concepts; combining and comparing the principles of the Enneagram to Freudian and Jungian Psychology; examining mental health and the Enneagram in the context of psychological pathologies; and generally offering more advanced theories and techniques for exploring the psyche with the Enneagram.<br />If the book has ANY flaws, it would be that it does not include a version of the RHETI (Riso-Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator) questionnaire, which has become the de-facto &quot;quick and easy&quot; standard used to &quot;test&quot; for personality type. This, however, is a very minor &quot;niggle&quot; since the descriptions of each of the nine Enneagram types are so comprehensive that readers will have little trouble identifying their, and someone else's, personality type.<br />Final thoughts: 9.5 bookmarks out of a possible 10-- and the half-point is only for the ommission of the questionnaire. Perhaps not the easiest choice for those *just* starting to explore the Enneagram on a casual level, but highly recommended for everyone else!tandard used to &quot;test&quot; for personality type.

As a long-term student of personality typing, I would describe this book as a &quot;serviceable introduction&quot; to the basic ideas behind the Enneagram. Although perhaps not as publicly well known as the Myers-Briggs personality typing system, the Enneagram is a remarkably accurate system for determining your basic personality type.<br />This slim volume (120 pages) centers around the 144-item &quot;Riso-Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator&quot; (RHETI) which is one of the &quot;standards&quot; for determining your Enneagram type. This particular book uses Version 2.0 of the RHETI-- which makes it a couple of &quot;generations&quot; old as of this writing-- but I don't believe the age of the test will have a negative effect on its usefulness in accurately determining your type. The RHETI is a &quot;forced answer&quot; format quiz that forces readers to choose between two statements (not necessarily related)-- statements that sometimes can be very difficult to find a clear choice between.<br />In addition to the RHETI itself, instructions and score sheets, the book includes a VERY brief introduction and history of the Enneagram, as well as fairly minimal &quot;thumbnail&quot; descriptions of each of the nine Enneagram personality types. There's also a VERY basic introduction to the interpretive tools for understanding your type, including Wings, integration and disintegration, and levels of health. However, if you're interested in learning about the Enneagram in ANY kind of depth (and perhaps already know your type), I'd recommend Riso and Hudson's &quot;Personality Types&quot; instead, which is one of my most frequently used and valuable reference books on the subject. On the other hand, if you just want a &quot;quick and basic&quot; evaluation, then THIS book is for you!<br />I am generally a big fan of Riso and Hudson's books-- they seem to provide a more &quot;balanced&quot; view of the human psyche than other experts in this field. Helen Palmer's works are also noteworthy.<br />Overall: I'll give it 7 out of 10 bookmarks, based mostly on the fact that it's really not TRYING to be anything but a very basic introductory book.

Although I am a long-time student of the Enneagram, I skipped past this book a number of times, mistakenly thinking that it would be yet another formulaic &quot;How To Find Your Perfect Mate&quot; book. Of course, I was quite wrong about that-- once again showing that there is SOMETHING to that old &quot;Don't judge a book by it's cover&quot; saying. Some day I'll learn.....<br />Baron &amp; Wagele have put together a light-hearted and eminently readable book, introducing readers to the personality types with the Enneagram-- in the context of relationships and relating between the nine different types. The authors have also included a section on Myers-Briggs personality typing, comparing MB types with Enneagram types. Whereas this is intended to be a fun and informal look at type and relationships, the book offers lots of solid information for those interested in personality typing and understanding the people in their relationships. I suppose you COULD use this book is a helpful tool if you're on a quest to find your perfect partner, but I get the sense that's not really its purpose.<br />Each of the nine Enneagram types has its own chapter, which includes a brief description of that type; a section on each &quot;subtype&quot; (Self-preservation, relational, social); a brief coverage of Enneagram Wings; as well as examples of famous people and couples who fit that type. The bulk of each chapter is dedicated to paragraphs about what each of the OTHER types might think of the type described in the current chapter-- and I found these descrptions to be especially &quot;on the money.&quot; Finally, the authors include their thoughts on &quot;Things this type would NEVER do,&quot; and &quot;How to get along with&quot; each type. The book is illustrated throughout with Elizabeth Wagele's sometimes poignant, sometimes silly cartoon drawings.<br />Overall rating: Highly Recommended (9 bookmarks out of a possible 10); although this is by NO figment of anyone's imagination a &quot;thorough&quot; work on the Enneagram, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of useful information and insight I found.

Whereas researchers, psychologists and society in general go to great lengths to study, understand and help those who dwell a long way below the mean intellect, those living their lives an equal distance the opposite side of the mean often find themselves living in a void of confusion, misunderstanding-- and misinformation. Their lives are perhaps complicated by a &quot;split personality&quot; support system that provides tools and special programs to gifted children, but then vanishes into thin air once the gifted individual is deemed &quot;Adult&quot;-- in some cases providing an abrupt perception change from giftedness as having positive &quot;value&quot; to suddenly being a reason for discrimination and sneers.<br />Gifted Adults are &quot;statistical outliers.&quot; As such, they often have special issues, living in a world whose actions are centered around accommodating the &quot;norm.&quot; At best, a Gifted Adult seeking to have his/her needs understood, may hear the words &quot;Well, we're ALL gifted, in our own special way.&quot; At worst (and more frequently) they will hear &quot;How can you have problems, if you're so smart?&quot;-- words that reflect a popular view that giftedness is a &quot;privilege&quot; that exempts a person from having any difficulties in life. Yet, Gifted Adults discover that working harder, seeking answers, seeing therapists and trying to contribute often leaves them with a sense of &quot;emptiness&quot; and lack of fulfillment.<br />Mary-Elaine Jacobsen's book is a much-needed tool to help gifted adults understand themselves, and accept the fact that their brains work a little bit differently. Real differences, I might add, that change the way a gifted person views their interactions with the world, their road to self-actualization, or considerations for seeking therapy.<br />In Part I of the book, Jacobsen starts to define her own view of giftedness, and addresses some of the Societal Myths (Giftedness = High IQ), and influences (Gifted adults' tendency to deny their giftedness) established by conventional thinking.<br />In Part II, she presents her alternative theory for measuring giftedness-- a broad system she has named &quot;Evolutionary Intelligence&quot; (or EvIQ). Although Jacobsen &quot;borrows&quot; heavily from the &quot;Multiple Intelligences&quot; theory originally set forth by Howard Gardner at Harvard, she adds a number of new facets, presented in a 240-item &quot;self quiz&quot; in Chapter 7 of the book. Unlike &quot;standard&quot; IQ tests, this is NOT a timed exercise with &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; answers, but rather a self-evaluation. Of course, honest self-scrutiny is central to obtaining a &quot;valid&quot; result-- which may present difficulty for some.<br />Part III explores most of the common &quot;misunderstandings&quot; gifted adults encounter in their interactions with daily life. Topics include &quot;self mis-diagnoses;&quot; the issues associated with &quot;Failing to Fit In;&quot; rewriting personal history and past events through understanding &quot;common criticisms&quot; often heard by gifted adults (&quot;Can't you just stick with ONE thing?&quot; &quot;Where do you get those wild ideas?&quot; &quot;Can't you just slow down?&quot;); the &quot;False Self&quot; and dumbing yourself down; as well as the &quot;Impostor Syndrome&quot; gifted adults often experience.<br />Parts IV and V offer a series of tools and possible solutions to help gifted adults reorient their energies in an effort to create lives that let them be &quot;true to themselves&quot;-- while still fitting into the &quot;normalcy&quot; of their surroundings. In part IV, Jacobsen explores both career issues and personal relationships, however, I found this section to be a bit general and &quot;pep-talkish.&quot; The final section deals with summarizing and then applying the lessons learned in the book.<br />Observations: My general inclination is to say &quot; Buy this book! Buy it NOW! Read it! Learn!&quot;<br />However, the potential reader should understand just what the book will do for them. &quot;The Gifted Adult&quot; (Formerly published under the name &quot;Liberating Everyday Genius&quot;-- the name change is a GOOD idea!) is long on presenting Jacobsen's theory of Evolutionary Intelligence, and long on providing self-understanding for the gifted adult-- but somewhat short as a &quot;How-To&quot; guidebook on how to live life. If you're looking for &quot;connect A to B&quot; solutions, you'll find only a limited number here.<br />The author is also quite &quot;liberal&quot; with her use of the designation &quot;gifted.&quot; Normally, the term is used to describe approximately 2% of the population. Jacobsen's definition may include as many as 10%-- and whether this is merely a technique to sell more books, or a figure backed by scientific research, I do not know. It doesn't detract materially from the value of the information presented-- but at times the writing does become a little bit &quot;fluffy&quot; and lacking in focus.<br />Some personal thoughts (Caveats): Society is engaged in a long-term love affair with the idea of &quot;pathologizing&quot; any behavior not tightly clustered around a narrow definition of &quot;Normal.&quot; Incorrectly diagnosing and medicating giftedness as ADHD or Bipolar Disorder responds to a popular need for &quot;A Quick And Easy Fix.&quot; If AT ALL possible, we want a &quot;magic pill&quot; rather than &quot;hard work.&quot; And whereas disorders certainly DO occur, Adult Giftedness-- and the psychological makeup specific to it-- is NOT a pathology.<br />Overall rating: Outstanding (9.5 bookmarks out of a possible 10), not only for the gifted adult and anyone living with a gifted adult, but the book also should be required reading for any psychologist/therapist who's been asked if they are &quot;familiar with the psychology of Adult Giftedness.&quot;er issues and personal relationships, however, I found this section to be a bit general and &quot;pep-talkish.&quot; The final section deals with summarizing and then applying the lessons learned in the book.<br />Observations: My general inclination is to say &quot; Buy this book!

I found Elaine Morgan's &quot;The Descent of Woman&quot; to provide some highly interesting concepts to think about, and I have no doubt that her outsider &quot;alternative&quot; view of evolution caused a considerable uproar in the scientific community when the book was first published in 1972.<br />At the core of Morgan's theory is the idea that women played an equal (or possibly superior) role in human evolution, and were NOT just submissive second-class childbearers while the &quot;strong and brave hunter men&quot; (&quot;Tarzanists&quot;) were shaping the evolution of the species. In presenting her case, Morgan draws heavily on the Aquatic Ape Theory (first presented by Sir Alister Hardy in the 1920's) for explanations of how humans moved from the trees to walking upright, how they became hairless, the development of speech, and the physiological factors that make us radically different from other primates.<br />The book doesn't portray the male half of humanity in a very favorable light-- which, in itself, I don't really have a problem with. However, the tone of the writing sometimes crosses the line from scientific to slightly condescending and &quot;preachy,&quot; and in doing so, the work perhaps loses a bit of credibility from a scientific standpoint-- almost as if the author couldn't quite decide between &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Feminism.&quot; Nonetheless, Morgan should be commended for questioning male-centric evolutionary theories put forth by a historically male-dominated scientific community, and readers should not lose sight of the fact that she is more of an &quot;outsider&quot; than a member of the &quot;establishment.&quot;<br />I am not sure if the designation &quot;Classic Study of Evolution&quot; is deserved-- the core CONCEPTS were somewhat revolutionary at the original time of publishing, but the actual presentation tastes more of &quot;pseudoscience&quot; than hard science. At the end of the book, I felt that I had been presented with a very interesting (and plausible) POSSIBILITY, but without being CONVINCED that This Is How It Is. That, of course, is just my OPINION-- I am not a scientist.<br />Overall rating: Recommended (7 bookmarks out of a possible 10). Women readers will feel good/vindicated; open-minded men will hopefully feel somewhat enlightened. The writing style is eloquent, at times humorous, at times somewhat dry and scholarly.

Aron's \\"sequel\\" to her best-selling book \\"The Highly Sensitive Person.\\"<br />This second book builds on her previous research, this time taking on the topic of Relationships and along with it, possibly one of the most difficult issues facing Highly Sensitive People (HSPs): How to balance a strong need for \\"alone and quiet time\\" with the genuine desire to have an active and fulfilling intimate relationship. In addition to her research, Aron (an HSP) also draws on experiences from her own marriage to a non-HSP.<br />As a starting point, the book includes a \\"Sensitivity Self Test\\" for both the reader and their mate or potential partner. Aron then goes on to explain how HSPs differ from the rest of the world in the way they fall in love, think about love, and their needs within a relationship. There are separate chapters covering the pluses and minuses of different types of relationships: Two HSPs together, and an HSP paired with a non-HSP, as well as the differing needs of highly sensitive men and women. Finally, there are sections on \\"Building Sensitive Partnerships\\" and HSP Sexuality. Except for a few vague and indirect references, \\"The Highly Sensitive Person in Love\\" deals strictly with heterosexual relationships.<br />Whereas I enjoyed this book, and found much useful information within its pages, it didn't seem to offer quite the number of insights provided by \\"The Highly Sensitive Person.\\" This perhaps goes to illustrate that whereas HSPs may have special needs, their relationship dynamics aren't AS different from anyone else's as one might think. Still, the book is well worth a read-- the sections on dating that \\"works\\" for an HSP, handling conflicts in a relationship, communication, and dividing \\"like\\" and \\"dislike\\" tasks in low-stress ways are highly recommended.<br />Aron's writing style gets a little dry and \\"clinical\\" from time to time, but the book is still quite readable. I think it stands alone quite well, but I would still highly recommend also reading Dr. Aron's original book.<br /><br />Overall rating: Recommended (7.2 bookmarks out of a possible 10), not only for the Highly Sensitive Person, but also for a less sensitive person with a Highly Sensitive partner who thoroughly mystifies them!well, but I would still highly recommend also reading Dr. Aron's original book.<BR> <BR>Overall rating: Recommended (7.2 bookmarks out of a possible 10), not only for the Highly Sensitive Person, but also for a less sensitive person with a Highly Sensitive partner who thoroughly mystifies them!	2002-10-04

Have you ever felt overwhelmed and \\"jangled\\" by situations most other people seem to take in their stride? Have you often heard the words \\"Crybaby\\" or \\"You're just too sensitive about stuff?\\" Do strong smells, bright lights are loud noise seem to affect you more than they affect other people? Do you enjoy people and their company, but feel exhausted after you've been around them for a while? Do you intuitively see solutions to problems other people spend weeks solving? Do prescription drugs affect you more strongly than indicated? If you answered \\"yes\\" to any of these questions, then you owe it to yourself to read this book. When I first read it, I had a long string of \\"AHA moments\\" with each chapter, and I have since spoken to many others who have had similar experiences.<br />Dr. Elaine N. Aron's research on High Sensitivity in people is a welcome effort to show the world that \\"not being the same as the societal ideal\\" does NOT necessarily have to be labeled as a pathology. This is an important book that will resonate with the millions of people who have spent their lives feeling just a little out of step with the frenetic, aggresive, extraverted, hectic \\"do, do, do!\\" aspects of modern society.<br />The book starts with a Sensitivity self-test, to allow readers to evaluate their degree of sensitivity. The good news is that if the test shows that you ARE a \\"Highly Sensitive Person\\" there is nothing \\"wrong\\" with you, and Dr. Aron has done a laudable job of helping us understand WHY. High Sensitivity is a genetic biological state you have about as much control over as the size of your feet-- and it certainly isn't a personality \\"disorder\\" in need of \\"repair.\\" Throughout the book, Aron provides background to help readers understand more about their sensitivity, as well as tips and tools for how to improve the quality of their interaction with a world that isn't always tolerant of those who are a little \\"different.\\"<br />For some people, this book is a serious eyeopener-- especially those who might have been diagnosed with, and treated for, Social Phobia or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-- while feeling that the diagnosis really didn't seem \\"right.\\" Just the mere understanding of the characteristics of High Sensitivity could have a \\"healing effect\\" for them.<br />Anything I didn't like about this book? Well, stylistically, the writing is a bit dry and academic-- but then again, the book was not written for entertainment purposes.<br />A cautionary note: As with most self-help and self-analysis books, I would caution readers not to become TOO absorbed in pursuing the ideas presented in this book. As a long-time member of the \\"HSP Community\\" I have observed a number of people adopting their sensitivity as a \\"lifestyle\\" with a near-religious fervor, and a somewhat negative \\"Us vs. them\\" philosophy.
