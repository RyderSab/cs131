Soehnlein begins this his second novel with the narrator Jamie Garner returning from San Francisco to his boyhood home of Greenlawn, New Jersey for the funeral of his father with whom he has not spoken nor visited for the past few years. It all had to do with his father's never having accepted his being gay. While on that visit Jamie, as he is going through the attic, discovers some old letters and photos that belonged to his father before he married Jamie's mother years ago. The rest of this hefty novel of over 400 pages is mostly about the narrator's quest to find out what happened in his father's life so long ago in California and to make some sort of sense of it all--as well as his sorting out his relationship with his lover Woody.<br /><br />There are many things to admire about YOU CAN SAY YOU KNEW ME WHEN. Mr. Soehnlein has written a most ambitious and dense novel with serious themes: the search for one's father, the importance of friendships, the difficulty of getting a relationship right. He writes with tremendous perception and at times turns phrases beautifully, getting the period and locales just right. In the 50's and 60's women had their hair done in \\"beauty parlors.\\" Now people broadcast their \\"personal life for all to hear\\" on cell phones in public places. The death of one family member-- or the death of anyone we care about for that matter-- brings back the remembrance of the death of someone else all over again. When Teddy meets for the first time Ray Gladwell, an artist with whom his father had had a brief affair with in 1960, she looks to see if he resembles his late father, a beautiful human touch by Soehnlein. When Jamie is attracted to a FedEx employee, he describes what could quickly take place between the two of them as happening in a \\"flirt-friendly environment.\\" Additionally the minor characters are fleshed out and for the most part endearing: Jamie's cousin Tommy and Anton, his marijuana supplier, just to name two. Mr. Soehnlein obviously loves San Francisco and it shows. He could convince anyone who hasn't been there to visit. The first section of the book entitled \\"The Son\\" is so well-written that it could stand alone as a short story. The family dynamics are just perfect.<br /><br />The novel, however, is about 50 pages too long. After my delight in reading the first 45 or so pages, I got bogged down and found the last half of the book heavy sledding-- to mix my metaphors. The problem: Jamie is totally believable but not very likeable. He is self-centered with a large streak of self-pity and not big of self-awareness. One friend after another points out to him that he is essentially like his father.<br /><br />Mr. Soehnlein is still a very fine writer and a cut above most of the current authors of gay novels. I would probably like this novel much better if I had not read and liked tremendously his first one, THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS.bviously loves San Francisco and it shows.

A few days later at the evening meal, Dunne suffered a massive and fatal heart attack. In this exquisitely written and searingly honest book, Ms. Didion recounts her days in the next year or so and attempts to make some sense of it all. Her grief is intensely personal and solitary, yet universal. She remembers what started out as an ordinary day and asks the age-old question: \\"what if?\\" She returns again and again to the following:<br /><br />  Life changes fast,<br />  Life changes in the instant.<br />  You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.<br />  The question of self-pity.<br /><br />Ms. Didion may not provide a map for getting through the pathless wood of grief; she rather defines it: \\"Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. We anticipate (we know) that someone close to us could die. . . We might expect if the death is sudden to feel shock. We do not expect this shock to be obliterative, dislocating to both body and mind.\\" And even though I think she would agree with Auden that suffering ultimately is solitary, what she has written can offer consolation to all of us as we can see ourselves and our own struggle with loss in her experience as she defines and differentiates between grief and sorrow: grief is passive but mourning, \\"the act of dealing with grief,\\" requires attention. There are her coping mechanisms-- she avoids as best she can revisiting any place or event (\\"the vortex effect\\") that will trigger a connection between either her husband or daughter-- and finally her attempt of letting go: \\"I know why we try to keep the dead alive: we try to keep them alive in order to keep them with us. I also know that if we are to live ourselves there comes a point at which we must relinquish the dead, let them go, keep them dead.\\" Emily Dickinson, who said as much about death as any other American poet, would have called it, \\"sweeping up the heart.\\"<br /><br />THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING is also a beautiful love story of two people who were married forty years and worked together most of those years. On the dust cover of this book notice that all the letters of the words \\"Joan Didion The Year of Magical Thinking\\" are written in black except the letters that spell out J-O-H-N; those are in gray. A beautiful tribute to Mr. Dunne.<br /><br />A lot of people will return to this book again and again and see images of themselves.

Almost all the poems are highly personal and often told through the voice of a first person narrator who is obviously Bukowski himself. He is nothing if not opinionated. He listens to Sibelius, Wagner and Brahms, reads Auden, Dostoevsky and Hamsun, does not care for visitors, (\\"sometimes I simply ask them to leave/and they do\\") abhors poetry readings and signings (\\"this is the ultimate sellout, Jack.\\") as well as most academic poets or academics of any kind. He doesn't care for Hemingway, (\\"he knew that what he was/killing was already/dead.\\") likes his cats, (\\"I think cats are better than we are\\") alcohol and women-- although he admits that he is not always successful in his affairs-- and detests reviewers, describing them as \\"a dink moralist, a failed young writer or most likely just nothing at all.\\" (I suppose I know what he would have to say about nothing Amazon reviewers.) He thinks about death but isn't obsesssed by it. (\\"death doesn't always come running.\\") After all, he is now past 70 and has beat the odds of not living a long life (\\"because Death after all these years/walks around in the room with me now and speaks softly\\"). He doesn't want a eulogy when he departs this world. \\"it would be nice/if one of my x-ladies was there/wearing too much makeup. . . and a tight green dress. . .\\" He is crazy about horse races, spends a lot of time and money attending them, and hates most movies, particularly those that win awards. (\\"Academy Award?\\", page 86.)<br /><br />Two or three character sketches of Richard Corey types are included here-- a Harry Keel person, \\"admired and feared\\" in school who years later turns up as a down-and-out salesman and Dale Thorpe (\\"golden boy\\"), envied from afar in high school but who has since disappeared-- and a moving poem about a kid who, after the bullies beat him up daily at school, must endure the wrath of his mother because his clothes are ruined (\\"clothes cost money\\").<br /><br />As do all good poets, Mr. Bukowski achieves much with little-- often with biting humor: \\"is what's good for the goose sometimes only good for the/goose?\\" he asks. And he beautifully contrasts youth and old age in \\"beach boys.\\"<br /><br />  I watch the young boys on their surfboards<br />  slim strong bodies gliding<br /><br />  some of them will end up in the madhouse<br />  some of them will gain 80 pounds<br />  some of them will commit suicide<br />  most of them will eventually stop coming to the<br />  beach.<br /><br />The poet, who says we are all \\"museums of fear,\\" eloquently describes his feelings in \\"with his awful teeth,\\" describing \\"this dog Sadness,\\" who is a \\"persistent mongrel.\\"<br /><br />There are literally dozens of similar passages in this collection that you will return to again and again.ruined (\\"clothes cost money\\").

C. Boyle obviously takes a page from Lord Tennyson in his latest collection of short stories where nature at best is indifferent, at its worst, malevolent. Wind storms are so bad that the weather service's wind gauge was once torn from \\"its moorings and launched into eternity\\" (\\"Swept Away\\") and a \\"bird lady\\" probably was washed out to sea. Two individuals get lost in a blinding snowstorm in the Southern Sierras in \\"The Swift Passage of the Animals.\\" The characters-- at least some of them-- in \\"Blinded by the Light\\" are obsessed with a hole in the ozone layer: \\"So the sky is falling. Or, to be more precise, the sky is emitting poisonous rays.\\" In \\"Chicxulub\\" an asteroid collided with the earth \\"sixty-five million years ago: \\"The thing that disturbs me about Chicxulub, [the name of the asteroid or comet] aside from the fact that it erased the dinosaurs and wrought catastrophic and irreversible change, is the deeper impication that we, and all our works and worries and attachments, are so utterly inconsequential.\\" Additionally, in several of these stories the characters must also deal with nature's animals: wind-driven falling cats in \\"Swept Away,\\" man-eating alligators in \\"Jubilation,\\" an African wild cat that the narrator wins in a bar bet-- coincidentally in a driving rain-- in the title story. Or what is even worse, at least one character (\\"Dogology\\") wants to become a dog.<br /><br />Thirteen of these fourteen stories will open up your sinuses. The characters, many of whom would be described as losers-- but never dull losers-- step in front of the proverbial train and suffer the consequences-- a sleep-deprived man, a homeless man for the first time, a high school teacher who uses and deals drugs at night. Mr. Boyle is quite amazing at setting the tone for a twenty-page story in one sentence. Check out \\"Here Comes,\\" for example: \\"He didn't know how it happened, exactly--lack of foresight on his part, lack of caring, planning, holding something back for a rainy day--but in rapid succession he lost his job, his girlfriend and the roof over his head, waking up on morning to find himself sprawled out on the sidewalk in front of the post office.\\"<br /><br />My favorite story is \\"Chicxulub\\" where parents, whose daughter is not home yet, get a late night telephone call-- every parent's worse nightmare-- that \\"there has been an accident.\\" In a little over ten pages, Mr. Boyle tells a story so universal, so painful and so well-written that you almost forget you are reading fiction and hope with all your being  that that child is safe. But isn't this what fine fiction should do?<br /><br />\\"The Doubtfulness of Water: Madam Knight's Journey to New York, 1702\\"-- a story with a title that long had better have something going for it-- for me it didn't, went right over my head, or around it. I don't have the slightest idea what the writer wanted to say- which alone doesn't make a story bad-- I just found it dull; and there are too many other wonderful, satiric, funny and profound stories by this fine writer that I haven't read yet.<br /><br />Mr. Boyle has to be one of our best short story writers.how it happened, exactly--lack of foresight on his part, lack of caring, planning, holding something back for a rainy day--but in rapid succession he lost his job, his girlfriend and the roof over his head, waking up on morning to find himself sprawled out on the sidewalk in front of the post office.\\" <br /> <br />My favorite story is \\"Chicxulub\\" where parents, whose daughter is not home yet, get a late night telephone call-- every parent's worse nightmare-- that \\"there has been an accident.\\" In a little over ten pages, Mr. Boyle tells a story so universal, so painful and so well-written that you almost forget you are reading fiction and hope with all your being  that that child is safe.

He could just as easily have called it MORE GOOD POEMS or FURTHER GOOD POEMS since he has produced another anthology every bit as good or better than his previous GOOD POEMS. These 185 poems from 61 named poets-- there are a couple of anonymous poems and a psalm or two-- were selected from Keillor's \\"Writer's Almanac\\" radio show so they are the kind you listen to and grasp the meaning of while waiting for the light to change. These poems are meant to speak to ordinary people through what Mr. Keillor calls \\"the last presence of honest speech and the outspoken heart.\\"<br /><br />It is worth the price of this book for Mr. Keillor's introduction alone. He opines that America is in \\"hard times\\" now with \\"the levels of power firmly in the hands of a cadre of Christian pirates and bullies whose cynicism is stunning,\\" with the perversion of religion, a tax system that favors the rich, when newspapers decline and the censor abounds. He fears for a future when America has \\"no binding traditions,\\" when the public cannot name senators and gets their political knowledge through television and their \\"only public life at Wal-Mart.\\" He says further about what is already taking place: \\"You lie in a hotel bed at night, remote in hand and surf a hundred channels of television. . . and you can drift for hours among the flotsam and you will never see anything that shows that you're in Knoxville or Seattle or Santa Fe or Chicago and nobody will ever speak to you as straightforwardly and clearly as poetry does.\\" That's pretty scary stuff.<br /><br />Mr. Keillor is totally democratic in his choice of writers. The qualifications for inclusion appear to be that the poet be fairly accessible on a first hearing and not long-winded so you need not look for a Pound or Eliot here. These verses are about the rubber meeting the road. There are some heavy-hitters among the poets included, i.e., the ones we read in the Norton American and English Literature anthologies: Auden, Robert Burns, E. E. Cummings, the beloved Miss Emily, Donne, Frost, Hardy, Keats, Shakespeare, Whitman et al. Also included are important modern names-- Wendell Berry, Charles Bukowski, Raymond Carver, Billy Collins, Rita Dove, Donald Hall, Mary Oliver-- and a host of good poets I had never heard of before. (I found myself often looking up the bio of a previously unknown writer whose poem I had just been taken with.) Although I understand completely that every editor must discriminate and cannot include everybody, I would have liked included maybe a poem by Cavafy or Mark Doty or Paul McCartney.<br /><br />The subject matter of these poems is diverse, from 1977 Toyotas and spiral notebooks to baseball, which is not to say that many of the selections are not profound nor beautiful. One of my favorites is Charles Bukowski's \\"the con job,\\" obviously about the First Gulf War where \\"the U. S. ground troops were largely/made up of Blacks, Mexicans and poor/whites/most of whom had joined/the military/because it was the only job/they could find.\\" Another is the beautiful and sad \\"Affirmation\\" by Donald Hall where the young \\"row for years on the midsummer/pond, ignorant and content.\\" And Lisel Mueller's exquisite poem about snow, \\"Not Only the Eskimos.\\"<br /><br />Finally the biographical sketches of the poets included at the end of this collection usually have a quotation in bold black letters by the writers themselves, often as good as their poems. My favorite is by Lawrence Ferlinghetti: \\"Like a bowl of roses, a poem should not have to be explained.\\"<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Keillor, for more good poems.lish Literature anthologies: Auden, Robert Burns, E.

Gone is much of the nihilism as well as the endless gratuitious sex scenes among people of all persuasions from his former writing. Of course the snow in this novel is still in the bathroom and not on the front walk, and designer labels and name-brand products abound. The protagonist, however, is a writer approaching middle-age named Bret Ellis who desperately seeks to establish a relationship with both his wife and his young son as well as to put to rest the ghost of his recently deceased father.<br /><br />While I'm usually put off by writers who name characters in novels after themselves, Mr. Ellis had to do that here in order for the reader to make any sense out of a character who keeps turning up named Patrick Bateman, whom we recognize from AMERICAN PSYCHO. For the most part the technique works.<br /><br />In a recent interview Mr. Ellis said that LUNAR PARK is in part homage to Stephen King, the acknowledged master of horror stories, as this one is. It is much more than that with an intricate plot with clever plays on words-- \\"terby\\" and \\"307 Elsinore Lane\\" for example-- a most moving ending that is beautifully written and the universal theme of a man who seeks to be a decent father and to make peace with the memory of his own father. The most interesting thing about Mr. Ellis' interview was that he announced that he was reading Marilynn Robinson's GILEAD, a novel about as far away from Mr. Ellis' stories as one can get and still remain on the same planet.<br /><br />I almost didn't read this book. I'm glad I did.	2005-09-18

With beautiful prose that often rises to the level of poetry (\\"When the snow came it lay over everything in impersonal dislike.\\") Sebastian Barry weaves Willie's tale. As in every story of war, whether it is the ILIAD or THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE-- the soldiers opine, however, that Dante and Dostoevsky would have written about their plight-- the events are similar: the comraderie of fellow soldiers, the homesickness (much of the fighting takes place in Belgium), the filth, the omnipresent specter of death, the confusion of battle, the desire to live. Even though much of the plot then is predictable, it does not make for a lesser novel. Willie would like to marry and grow old with Gretta. The fighting Irish must believe that God in on their side. They must believe that they will prevail in the end.<br /><br />In addition to the usual concerns of every soldier, Willie also must confront and resolve his differences with his own father over political tensions in his own country as well as his love and betrayal (his soul is \\"filleted\\") of the beautiful Gretta. There are many memorable characters (Willie's sister Dolly, Father Buckley, Sergeant-Major Christy Moran) and scenes here: when Willie sees his first death in battle (of Captain Pasley), when he kills his first German, when he returns to Dublin on leave and his father bathes him, when he visits the empty grave back in Ireland of Captain Pasley.<br /><br />The horrors of war of course forever change Willie. He figures out that not King George but Death was the \\"King of England. . . Emperor of all the empires.\\" His comrades try to define victory. \\"'You put out a crowd of lads on the field, and the other side put out a crowd of lads, and you had musket shot and calvary. . . And when everyone was dead on the other side, you had a victory. A victory, you know? Well, and that's not the same with us, then is it?' said Willie. . . 'And if more of us is left standing, then they might be calling that a sort of victory. . . Some f-----g victory. . . Some f-----g war.'\\"<br /><br />Sadly some stories do not change.hat's not the same with us, then is it?' said Willie. . .

Well, Nelson has gone from dying his hair lemon-lime to \\"flame-blue,\\" an appropriate color since he is certainly the flamer of these three. He is the outrageous one who never had a chance of being in anybody's closet, even if he had wanted to. Kyle is still the shy one on the swim team who can \\"pass\\" if left alone. Jason, of course, is the high school jock equally attractive to both young men and women.<br /><br />There are no surprises here. We pretty much know where Mr. Sanchez is going with his plot. Will Nelson break up with his new boyfriend Jason because he is HIV positive? Will Kyle go to Princeton rather than to a lesser university even though it means he will be separated from Jason? Will Jason come out to the other members of the basketball team? If he does, will he lose his college scholarship? Will they all attend the senior prom?<br /><br />What this novel does extremely well is provide a story that gay teenagers can read and know that they are not alone, particularly those who live in out-of-the-way towns and attend small high schools. It is comforting to learn that RAINBOW BOYS was an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults.<br /><br />As in the previous novel, there is information about all kinds of organizations and help for gay teenagers at the end of this novel.	2005-09-11

Both men are under twenty, both high school dropouts, both \\"rough-mannered, rough-spoken, inured to the stoic life.\\" These men fall hopelessly in love that summer and their lives are forever changed. Pulitzer prize winning author Annie Proulx in language as understated as Dante's (\\"that day they read no further\\") describes their first coupling: \\"in a little while they deepened their intimacy considerably.\\"<br /><br />Their dilemma, which provides the central conflict of this perfect story, is whether to leave wives and children and live together in fictional Wyoming-- forty years before the true life tragedy of Matthew Shepherd-- or to seek each other out in secret when they have the time over the passing years. They are well aware of the inherent danger of expressing their love before the world. Ennis: \\"We do that in the wrong place we'll be dead. There's no reins on this one. It scares the p--- out of me.\\" Jack: \\"It don't happen in Wyomin [sic] and if it does I don't know what they do, maybe go to Denver. . . come on, Ennis, you just shot my airplane out a the sky -- give me somethin a go on.\\"<br /><br />I have read this story three times now and with each new reading pick up nuances I missed previously. Ms. Proulx has created here two characters who will tear your heart out; you remember them long after you finish reading. Ms. Proulx is quite a marvelous story-teller, writing about the redeeming power of love and the comfort of memory. Her language is as tough and beautiful as the Wyoming country. Near the end of her story, there is a poignant scene where Ennis finds his old shirt that Jack had stolen hanging inside one of Jack's own: \\"He pressed his face into the fabric and breathed in slowly through his mouth and nose, hoping for the faintest smoke and mountain sage and salty sweet stink of Jack but there was no real scent, only the memory of it, the imagined power of Brokeback Mountain of which nothing was left but what he held in his hands.\\"<br /><br />This story deserves more than five stars.e faintest smoke and mountain sage and salty sweet stink of Jack but there was no real scent, only the memory of it, the imagined power of Brokeback Mountain of which nothing was left but what he held in his hands.\\"    This story deserves more than five stars.	2005-09-08

He exercises daily, rides a motorcycle for pleasure, and is much attracted to a lot of women who also find him desirable, although he has recently met and fallen for an unusual woman named Julia who works at a cytopathology lab and wants to \\"save the world from sinister diseases like Ebola and anthrax.\\" Reed is a second generation employee of a nuclear plant where his father died in a chemical accident when his son was only six.

The plot is all about his obsession with these young men and their devotion to their religion-- as well as the sexual attractiveness at least of some of them. He goes so far as to study their religion and dress like them. These boys are fascinated with him as well, his sexuality, his avowed atheism, his promiscuity.<br /><br />While this novel is certainly a easy read, it is ultimately sad and is a perfect argument for just how futile are discussions about religion with someone who already knows all the answers, i.e., most religious fundamentalists of all kinds, whether they be Christian, Jew or Moslem. These young men are convinced that they are God's chosen people and that homosexuality is a sickness, a disease, a criminal act. There's not much room for air in that boarded-up building.<br /><br />In the blurb on the dust jacket of this novel, someone calls this book a \\"semiautobiographical novel,\\" whatever that means. The protatonist has the same name as the author, and like him has been a porn star, has never driven a car and has a passion for reading. At least Mr. Sandford calls this work a novel, thereby avoiding the quicksand an increasing number of writers, many of them gay, find themselves in, intent on writing what I would call fictional memoirs where the names and events have been changed to protect the people involved and to suit the \\"memoirist.\\"<br /><br />It is also sad that THE BOYS ACROSS THE STREET has to be Mr. Sandford's only novel as he died of AIDS in 1995.	2005-09-02

The same could be said of the characters in Cormac McCarthy's latest novel. For me such a statement is not a criticism of either writer. McCarthy's people lead hard, blue-collar lives. They eat open-faced roast beef sandwiches with gravy and mashed potatoes, along with \\"soupbeans\\" and \\"good cornbread.\\" As boys they played \\"mumbledypeg.\\" They lie on \\"pallets.\\" They don't have a dog \\"in this hunt\\"<br /><br />McCarthy creates the character of Llewelyn Moss, a thirty-six-year-old welder married to Carla Jean, who at nineteen is wise beyond her years. He happens quite by accident upon two million dollars in drug money and makes a very bad decision, i.e., he decides to keep the cash, thereby setting the stage for a catastrophe, not only for him but a lot of other people as well.<br /><br />Each chapter in this tightly written narrative as sparse as the Texas landscape McCarthy writes about opens with the thoughts of Sheriff Bell, a friend of Moss, and who has the impossible task of trying to stop the hemorrhaging of illegal drugs across the border from Mexico into Texas. He ultimately accepts defeat and resigns as sheriff, believing indeed, to quote Yeats, that this is no country for old men.<br /><br />Sheriff Bell is reminiscent of Reverend Ames in the novel GILEAD and in his own way is just as decent. He too contemplates his own mortality and the world as he sees it and is sustained by the love of a good woman. \\"I believe that whatever you do in your life it will get back to you. If you live long enough it will. Perhaps God only speaks only to those who need him the most. And \\"you fix what you can fix and you let the rest go.\\" Bell on money: \\"I think I know where we're headed. We're bein bought with our own money. . . But it [money] will put you in bed with people you ought not to be there with.\\" Finally, he praises his wife Loretta: \\"I reckon I thought that because I was older and the man that she would learn from me and in many respects she has. But I know where the debt lies.\\" Bell's is not a life badly lived.<br /><br />If would be a shame if Clint Eastwood did not direct a movie made from this novel and play the part of Sheriff Bell.as older and the man that she would learn from me and in many respects she has.

Having lost a wife many years ago in childbirth-- and the child soon afterwards-- he never dreamed that he would find love and marry in his late sixties to a woman thirty years his junior and have a child with her. He has led a decent though certainly not perfect life so there are no major regrets of past horrible deeds. He worries about his young son and regrets that he will not live to watch him grow up. \\"Why do I love the thought of you old? That first twinge of arthritis in your knee is a thing I imagine with all the tenderness I felt when you showed me your loose tooth. . .

On his seventy-seventh birthday, his wife prepares pancakes, (with candles) one of his favorite dishes, and places marigolds on the table. His young son recites the Beatitudes \\"with hardly a hitch, two times over,\\" as a gift to his father. \\"I hate to think what I would give for a thousand mornings like this.

In old age Reverend Ames' thoughts, longings, wishes and regrets for the most part are those of all of us, regardless of our religion.

These characters are dislocated by space, time, religion, education, unforeseen events, even death. And though they may travel to the four corners of the earth, whether it is India, Canada, the United States or Australia, they never really ever leave their homeland. When left unattended, their thoughts return there.<br /><br />Most of these stories have hard sayings. A burn victim, formerly a pretty young girl (\\"Golden Girl\\") must face a reconstructed future with a reconstructed face. A dying woman (\\"The Dark Wood\\") who two days ago learned of her death sentence longs to putter in her tomatoes. A friend whom the narrator has just left is killed by an automobile in \\"Some Have Called Thee Mighty and Dreadful\\" leaving the narrator overcome with guilt: \\"If I had invited them back to our house. If I had only tilted time a few minutes to one side or the other. This is shock. Of course I am not responsible. Life is random, brutally indifferent.\\" In \\"After Long Absence\\" a woman returns to Brisbane and her family whose fundamentalist religion she has long since left behind. Her teetotaler father, so as not to embarrass her in front of her friends in a university lounge, \\"takes polite sips\\" of white wine. She, on the other hand, is unwilling to select a passage and read from the Bible as is the custom for visitors to do in her parents' home at the evening meal. \\"It cannot be a concession anywhere near as great as my father's two sips of wine. . . Yet I canot do it. 'I am sorry,' I say quietly, hating myself. . . Outside I hug the mango tree and weep for the kind of holy innocence that can inflict appalling damage; and because it is clear that they, the theologically rigid, are more forgiving than I am.\\"<br /><br />As always, Ms. Hospital gets right to the heart of the matter as well as the hearts of her readers.	2005-08-17

The statement is certainly true as it relates to Ms. Hospital. It isn't fair that one person should have so much talent. On the other hand, we can all be glad that she keeps writing extraordinary short stories and novels. ISOBARS contains fifteen short stories, all of which are as good as we have come to expect from this writer. They are about loss, sorrow, violence, missed opportunities. While many of the men in these stories behave very badly-- law enforcement officers rape a trusting school teacher, and boys steal the clothes of a teacher and her two female students while they are skinnydipping-- many of the characters, both men and women, have a strong resilience and courage, even in defeat.<br /><br />Ms. Hospital takes the reader through a landmine of terrific words and phrases. The past is a \\"Dead Letter Office.\\" The children of a man's second marriage \\"had not yet reached the age of disappointment.\\" An old man in a rooming house has been \\"left stranded by old age and widowerhood.\\" His housemates \\"came and went, anything could claim them: death, a son or daughter whose conscience got the upper hand for a while, loss of memory.\\" Another character has \\"learned to let happiness come and go, without anxiety. It always did keep coming again, in new and surprising shapes.\\" One could do worse than have that philosophy.<br /><br />I am always so amazed and undone by what this writer does with so few words. In the last selection in this book, \\"Here and Now,\\" in six and a half pages she tells a story of death and loss that will convince you she's as good a living writer as there is. In Toronto, Allison, a college professor who at fifty has just learned that her mother has died in Sydney, consoles Walter, a ninety-year-old retired professor, who remembers the loss of his son who has died in an accident in Australia. They both are awash with memory and sorrow-- as is the reader.<br /><br />Ms. Turner is an amazing writer.	2005-08-13

This Mr. McDermott's first novel is certainly well worth reading. We can only hope that this is not a one time effort on his part and that he will publish another novel soon.<br /><br />This novel begins with the opening sentence: \\"Gerald was as well preparead for death as anyone could be.\\" While one cannot always judge a book by the first line, in this case, this sentence, along with the first paragraph, sets the tone for a fine tale indeed. The protagonist, a New Yorker, who is now in better health but who has been very ill with AIDS, has made a will, a living will, arranged for his cremation, weeded out his photo collection, thrown away his porno stash and all his journals, shut out most of his friends, stocked up on suicide drugs and is \\"as ready to go as the dinner guest in coat and gloves standing at the open door.\\" Then he gets invited to be in a play being produced in Italy by an old director friend of his and gets another go at living. In Italy Gerald meets a variegated cast of characters-- he actually meets one actor on the flight over-- one of whom he falls for, an Italian named Enzo. The novel has interesing twists and turns. One of Gerald's dilemmas, for instance, is when and how to tell Enzo that he has AIDS. The author quite deftly solves the problem for both Gerald and the engaged reader.<br /><br />Since he is an actor-- having appearead in the stage production of EQUUS with Richard Burton, for example-- Mr. McDermott would be expected to write about the theatre with an insider's knowledge; and he does. You feel as if you are actually rehearsing with these characters, on stage with them and sharing in their bickering and gossiping. The author is also adroit with words and at turning phrases. Gerald visits a government office where \\"poor people with jobs decide if poor people without jobs are eligible for assistance--food stamps, disability.\\" Disney and Hard Rock Cafe are \\"gelding\\" Forty-second Street.\\" Enzo's skin looks like \\"Sicilian olives caught in sunlight.\\" Finally, Mr. McDermott captures in beautiful, succinct language the loss of so many lives snuffed out by AIDS: \\"Poor Damon [Gerald's deceased friend]. Poor everyone he knew who died so young: tricks, roommates, friends. Sometimes he's recall one after another, guys who'd been so much a part of those early, sexy years in New York, until he'd cocooned himself in the past and peopled his present with the dead.\\"<br /><br />A very impressive first novel.stance--food stamps, disability.\\" Disney and Hard Rock Cafe are \\"gelding\\" Forty-second Street.\\" Enzo's skin looks like \\"Sicilian olives caught in sunlight.\\" Finally, Mr. McDermott captures in beautiful, succinct language the loss of so many lives snuffed out by AIDS: \\"Poor Damon [Gerald's deceased friend].

The Great Depression had settled over the United States, and poor out-of-work people were everywhere. The election of President Franklin Roosevelt boosted the nation's collective morale, along with Seabiscuit, the champion racehorse, with his owner, trainer and jockey Red Pollard of course. Then came the now all-but-forgotten Ruth Hardness, who is 1936, accomplished the impossible by bringing back to the United States the first ever live panda from the dangerous territry where China borders Tibet.<br /><br />Vickie Constantine Croke in THE LADY AND THE PANDA recounts this wonderful saga of a determined New York socialite, who after the death of her young husband on a similar mission in China, takes up where he left off, invests her entire inheritance on her quest and surprises practically everyone when she brings back Su-Lin for all the world to see and adore. The panda takes up residence in Chicago's Brookfield Zoo where, the author says in her \\"Preface\\" that he drew \\"more than 53,000 visitors when first displayed at the Brookfield--a single-day tally the zoo has never again matched.\\" Such famous people as Helen Keller, Shirley Temple, Sophie Tucker and the Dionne quintuplets fell under Su-Lin's spell. He was insured by Lloyd's of London.<br /><br />Ms. Harkness is a bigger than life character. The author tells us that though short in height, Harkness always appeared to be much taller than she was. She is quoted as saying that the two things she hated most were going to bed at night and getting up in the morning. In addition to her passion for pandas, she was besotted with beautiful clothes--she was a dressmaker by profession-- cigarettes, alcohol, fine food and late-night parties. More importantly, she showed no racial prejudice and treated the Chinese as equals-- a rare quality for Americans during this period-- fell in love with both China and its people and even had a brief affair with a young Quentin Young, her Chinese expedition partner. In this extremely well-written book that reads like a novel-- although the author assures the reader that every word is true-- Ms. Harkness meets other fascinating people in addition to Quentin Young: E. A. Cavalier, her good friend and helper Dan Reib of Standard Oil, Her nemesis and rival Floyd Tangier Smith and her cook and friend Wang.<br /><br />Many of the passages here read like a travelogue, particularly the descriptions of Shanghai. Both Ms. Croke and Ms. Harkness are fine writers. Ms. Croke had access to hundreds of Harkness' letters as well as the 1938 book she wrote with the same title as this one. This book has extensive notes, along with many good photographs of Ms. Harkness and her beloved pandas.

John Irvin's new novel UNTIL I FIND YOU covers the life of the protagonist Jack Burns from the age of four until his early 30's. The illegitimate son of William, a church organist and lover of tattoos (an ink addict), and \\"Daughter Alice,\\" a fulltime tattoo artist-- her specialty is a tattoo called \\"Rose of Jericho\\"-- and sometime prostitute, Jack spends over 800 pages searching for his absent father. As you would expect from an Irving novel, it is replete with literally dozens of extraordinary (a nice word for weird) characters: tattoo artists-- one with only one leg-- from several countries, a bevy of older girls and women, many of whom Jack sleeps with (sometimes in a wheelchair), as well as his good friend Emma who, as Jack's third grade teacher Ms. Wurtz would say, only holds his \\"thingamajig\\" while they are in bed together. There is also Emma's Lesbian mother who has a long affair with Jack's mother, as well as Hollywood types when Jack becomes a famous actor. There is also Wheelchair Jane, various prostitutes from Amsterdam, a fascinating chauffeur named Peewee et al. Since I detest reviews that are plot summaries, I won't give away much more of the wondrously convoluted plot here.<br /><br />Mr. Irvin has said that parts of the novel are autobiographical. For instance, he never met his own father; and he said in a recent newspaper interview that he first had sex with an older woman when he was only eleven. Jack also wins an Oscar-- as did Mr. Irving-- and like the author, he is a great wrestler.<br /><br />There are many funny lines and events here, not the least of which is a hilarious scene where Jack, playing a young woman in a school production, starts to bleed in a scene earlier than the plot calls for. The driver Peewee, who is in the audience, thinks Jack is in physical danger and storms the stage to help him; of course pandemonium breaks out in the theatre.<br /><br />While the book may appear univiting by its sheer size, the 800 plus pages actually fly by rapidly for the most part. If you are wondering if Mr. Irving can tie up all the loose ends with so many characters and story lines, indeed he does and very well. He pulls out all the stops about 500 or so pages into the novel and holds the reader hostage for the remainder of the book.<br /><br />The novel abounds in great themes-- not unlike some of the great organ music that William plays. It is about loss, the unreliability of memory, particularly that of childhood-- there is a beautiful quotation at the beginning of the novel from the great writer William Maxwell on the subject: \\"memory. . . is really a form of storytelling that goes on continually in the mind and often changes with the telling. . . In any case, in talking about the past we lie with every breath we draw.\\" There is also the never-ending search for one's parents that is as old as the ODYSSEY, the cruel things that parents too often do their their children when they use them as pawns against each other, that things all too often are not as they appear, that we can never really know our parents, the consequences of child molestation, the necessity of forgiveness.<br /><br />Mr. Irvin is famous for his repetition of words and phrases throughout his novels. There are many here: \\"Not around Jack,\\" \\"Sleeping in the Needles,\\" \\"It's a good job to lose,\\" etc. Having finished Tom Wolfe's latest tome recently, as I read the last two hundred or more fantastic pages of this novel, I keep thinking: \\"Mr. Wolfe, you're no John Irving.\\"ually fly by rapidly for the most part.

The plots are as different as the kidnapping by teenage hoodlums of a busboy wearing a kangaroo suit to lure customers to the restaurant where he is employed to a man, no longer in love with his very successful wife, who hires a prostitute to have sex with him while driving his Mercedes through an automatic carwash. Mr. McIntyre is very wonderful with words and can do a lot with a little: \\"She looked at his tired gray eyes and lipless mouth. He had a habit of chewing on the inside of his cheeks.\\" Another example: \\"The cousins slept scattered around the downstairs like shoes on the floor of a messy closet\\". And drinking brandy is like \\"swallowing candlelight.\\"<br /><br />While all eight stories are excellent, the last two are quite brilliant. In \\"Foray\\" the narrator Ray reads MOBY DICK to a young relative, Vance, who has Down syndrome. The story overwhelms the reader with its compassion as the young Vance is  touched by hearing this great epic read aloud. When the narrator finishes MOBY DICK as the Pequod and its crew were \\"swallowed by the sea,\\" \\"Tears streamed down Vance's face and fell into the sand. His hands moved from the armrest to cling to my [Ray's] arm as if there were something I could do for all those men. For him it had been not tragedy, but disaster.\\" In the final story, \\"Nightwalking,\\" three adult children  for the first time after the death of their mother all get together with their father and each other. This little gathering sounds too much like family get-togethers too many of us have experienced. One sister is much more welcome if she shows up with her husband and child, rather than alone. A brother brings a new woman friend to meet his family for the first time and gets turned on by the idea of sleeping with her in his old bedroom from childhood.

Hayes published THIS THING CALLED COURAGE: SOUTH BOSTON STORIES, one of the very best collections of short stories in a long time. Now he follows that debut with NOW BATTING FOR BOSTON: MORE STORIES BY J. G. HAYES. There are eight stories here-- although one of them barely qualifies (\\"Once on Christmas Eve\\") as it is only three pages long. The other seven stories allow the reader to fully engage himself with a group of memorable characters. Michael Nava may know his California, the late John Preston had his finger on the pulse of working-class Maine, but Mr. Hayes clearly understands South Boston. His characters usually have many things in common. Being Southies, they are of course white, Irish Catholic, blue-eyed, rabid Red Sox fans, either high school dropouts or only high school graduates, blue-collar workers-- pipefitters, drywallers, painters' helpers, housecleaners. They detest the gentrifiers moving into their neighborhoods who would make a verb out of \\"winter.\\" Some of them have criminal records, drinking problems and parents who are deceased. While they may have girl friends, they also have strong, forbidden feelings toward other men although the word \\"gay\\" never enters their vocabulary. That is not to say they are of one cloth. To paraphrase Tolstoy, each one of them is unique in his sorrow.<br /><br />In his \\"Preface\\" Mr. Hayes mentions one reviewer of his first book who found the collection \\"often bleak.\\" He points out that in a five-year period, \\"over 350 young men had died in South Boston due to a variety of causes--alcohol and drug overdose, violence and suicide\\" and that he was attempting to \\"highlight the ill effects of the violence caused by homophobia, whether it comes from family, peers, church, school, media, advertising, or consumerist/corporate culture.\\" Mr. Hayes goes on to say that some of these new stories are \\"less bleak.\\" Indeed some of them are. These men sometimes improve their lives, find love and a modicum of happiness. Just as in the first collection, however, these characters, to a person, tug at the reader's heart-strings and are more sinned against than sinning.<br /><br />The title story \\"Now Batting for Boston\\" is about a young man's love affair with both his father and with baseball and of course his quest for a lover. His father returned from the military to civilian life a broken man physically. He vowed, however, to marry a woman he would treat as his queen. Since the narrator's name is Joe Hayes, we have to assume that much of this poignant story is autobiographical. One could to a lot worse than have such parents as these. In \\"There is a Balm in Gilead\\" taken from the hymn title, two lovers meet after an eight-year separation and in a surpise ending worthy of O'Henry find out that relationships may be possible, at least the hope of one, even in South Boston. Although Danny in \\"You're Always Happy When You're Rich\\" will probably never be the architect he dreams of becoming since he cannot get into college, he is loved by his friend Billy, in his own way of course. There is a touching scene where Billy and Danny go on a picnic after Billy has made sandwiches for the two of them, marking Danny's with a red \\"D.\\" Then they split a \\"Mountian Dew.\\" They promise to share secrets with each other and maybe even volunteer to work on a Habitat for Humanity house. Not all the characters fare so well. At least two of them in as many stories attempt suicide by slashing their wrists. Another is in detention for a DUI; another steals a car in order to leave South Boston and drive his friend to Florida.<br /><br />These stories are every bit as good as the first collection and are not to be missed.in the first collection, however, these characters, to a person, tug at the reader's heart-strings and are more sinned against than sinning.

Secondly, the writers are all for the most part unknown. Edmund White, who selected them says that not one writer has had a book published yet. Third, they come from all areas of the United States as well as the British Isles. And they are not all Caucasian. The stories are set in a variety of locales and are not all about gay men picking up other gay men in bars. We can finally read about gay men who interact with other people besides other gay men and live outside a gay ghetto in a large city, usually New York.  As you would expect from most any collection of stories, some are better than others. Some of the stories are excellent. I would put \\"ONJ.com,\\" \\"Acqua Calda,\\" \\"TV Dinner\\" and \\"Teamwork\\" in that category. \\"ONJ.com\\" by Vestal McIntyre, the first story in the book, is about a young woman in the world of advertising who wishes to \\"make a gay friend,\\" a silly wish on its face, and gets more than she bargains for. In Keith McDermott's \\"Acqua Calda\\" a young American wrestles with how and when or if he should tell an Italian whom he is attracted to that he is HIV positive. \\"TV Dinner\\"  by Reed Hearne is a funny account of a minor TV personality's filming of a day in the life of a waiter in the California Bay Area. Kevin Reardon's \\"Teamwork,\\" which according to the biographical data about the authors won the 2003 Richard Hall Memorial Short Story Contest, is a great little story about proofreaders at Healthco, \\"a pharmaceutical advertising agency. The narrator has a crush on Todd, a perfectly drawn character, who when he gets fired over an ampersand by Gregory, a gay art director who \\"played for the team,\\" responds: \\"'You're a bastard, man. . . I am so out of here.'\\" He is just so \\"kwel.\\"<br /><br />This is a very good collection and introduces the reader to writers he wants to read more of. Several of the selections are from novels in progress and should be available soon if not already.f not already.	2005-07-20

But you'll have to read further to find out anything else.<br /><br />As Mr. Craft is prone to do, he introduces us to a subject that many of us have no knowledge or-- and in some instances not much interest either. In previous novels we have learned much about both cats and dollhouses, but not in the same novel. Here we get quite a taste for mushrooms.<br /><br />Five novels down and two more to go. Mr. Craft has staying power.	2005-07-14

As she did in her previous book, she pulls out quotations she finds most pertinent and enlarges them, as well as printing some words in red. There are of course illustrations on every page (done by Alejandra Vernon) that I would call realistic with a twist. Each page is designed as if it were a computer screen. Since I am basically computer illiterate, it is difficult for me to describe just what Ms. Kirschenbaum does with THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW so I'll let her speak: \\"People sometimes ask me why I use a web browser as the central motif for my Bible or why I portrayed Jesus holding a cell phone. Three words: relevant, relevant, relevant.\\"<br /><br />Some of my favorite images and/or sections: Christ in the magnificent coat of many colors on page 21, along with the Sermon on the Mount:(...) Then there is \\"Feeding the Hungry 2\\" on pages 94 and 95, otherwise known as the feeding of the \\"four thousand men, beside women and children,\\" particularly the gorgeous artwork at the bottom of the page. Some readers may find the \\"Many Are Called Few Are Chosen\\" section over the top as the pages are covered with cell phones, with a cross for an antenna; but it works for me. The Last Supper is reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci's painting, that is, Jesus and the disciples are seated at a long table, facing forward-- but with their cell phones of course.<br /><br />The one section that I thought was a little too much is the section on marriage (pages 112 and 113) with too many hearts and flowers. Also, if I remember from a Bible class years ago, somewhere I heard that \\"the eye of a needle\\" that is so difficult for a camel to get through referred to a small door in the city wall. If that indeed is the case, then the illustration of a camel with a needle around its neck (pages 116 and 117) would be inaccurate.<br /><br />Ms. Kirschenbaum discusses her dilemma of which translation of the gospels to use. She of course settled on the King James Version. I would have used a modern text since it would have gone so nicely with the spare font that she created, herself, as well as being more relevant to the 21st Century.<br /><br />If I had to choose one phrase to describe this book, it would have to be \\"otherworldly beautiful.\\" It should have wide appeal to Christians, Jews and those of other religions as well as anyone who appreciates art. I cannot imagine what this designer will do with the poetry of the Old Testament.which translation of the gospels to use. She of course settled on the King James Version.

It has so much going for it: a very complicated plot but one that is very timely, characters you care about deeply, good writing, thoughtful commentary on relationships, mortality, religious cults, and finally-- without giving away the story-- a tribute to the U. S. and the tragedy of September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Unlike many detective mysteries, this one is solved by police officers instead of, say, hairdressers or journalists or college English professors, making the story much more realistic. How many hairdressers in real life, for example, take time out from dyeing roots to avenge the dead?<br /><br />There are beautiful passages here on a variety of subjects including death: \\"You only have so many races in your life. You just have to try to win a many of them as you can.\\" And \\"Births and death are going on all around us all the time. But the dying seems more pronounced when you reach the front of the line. Now that my father [Kurt Wallander's] is dead there's no one ahead of me anymore.\\"<br /><br />This fine novel certainly rises about the genre of detective fiction. It is reminiscent of such first-class novels as Janette Turner Hospital's OYSTER and Margaret Atwood's THE HANDMAID'S TALE, just to name two.	2005-07-12

The narrator is a young 30-something who is on a constant quest for Mr. Right in all the wrong places-- well, actually in every place: England, France, Australia, the U. S, and in selected cities and bars of these countries as well as well as the internet and biker organizations. Almost to a person, these love objects are humpy beyond words at first blush; but things are never as they seem.  Mr. Alexander writes with a great deal of flair and humor, is brilliant with dialogue and certainly can coin a phrase. He makes a verb out of \\"double take.\\" One Roberto de Milano \\"seems larger than life, brick-chicken-shed of a man.\\" He is also very good at summing up in a few sentences what many of us have felt about a PNB (Potential New Boyfriend) the moment we sense that we have taken a wrong turn and are heading in the wrong direction a la Robert Frost. About Luc, whom the narrator has met in the internet.<br /><br />\\"'I feel happier here than I have for ages.'<br /><br />A Cold front moves over my heart; I shiver. . . 'I love this,' he says. 'I love being here, your house, the garden, the cat,' he laughs. 'I think I love you too,' he says.<br /><br />It's too soon and it's all too much. And it's all the wrong way round. I can feel my heart closing down. . . I don't want to be the all-in-one solution to anyone's problems.\\"<br /><br />Witty, sophisticated, addictive-- these loosely connected chapters add up to a fine novel. One other thing: you'll never feel the same way about a hard-boiled egg after reading about the narrator's encounter with the Egg Man.	2005-07-11

We have one terrific roller coaster ride. Faulkner said he wrote this novel to make money after the disappointing sales of THE SOUND AND THE FURY and AS I LAY DYING. About SANCTUARY, published in 1931, he wrote: \\"I began to think of books in terms of possible money. . . . I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could imagine. . .\\" This novel was the biggest seller of all Faulkner's works during his lifetime.<br /><br />We are introduced to a whole slew of unforgettable characters: Temple Drake, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a local judge; the monster Popeye; Gowan, the frat-boy drunk who \\"learned\\" to handle his alcohol while a student in Virginia; the tragic Ruby; Miss Reba, the Memphis madam; the obnoxious Senator Snopes; Horace Benbow, et al. In the hands of a lesser writer, some of these people would have become stereotypes. Instead we have a  remarkable and tragic story of small town justice where a man is convicted for who is is, rather than what he is accused of doing. Horace Benbow, an attorney who reads books, is the moral center of the novel who believes that sometimes a man \\"might do something just because he knew it was right, necessary to the harmony of things that it be done.\\"<br /><br />Unlike many of Faulkner's more difficult works, SANCTUARY is a very straight-forward novel-- an easy but fascinating read. As always, Faulkner's language can be beautifully descriptive: \\"When he waked a narrow rosy pencil of sunlight fell level through the window.\\" And \\"Within the black-and-silver tunnel of cedars fireflies drifted in fatuous pinpricks.\\" He is also razor-sharp with his use of colloquial language. At one point Virgil Snopes says, \\"Look and see if they taken anything of yourn.\\" Virgil and his brother Fonzo provide some much-needed humor in this rather horrific tale. They, young hick barber students, check into a house of ill repute in Memphis, thinking it is an ordinary hotel and then go to another \\"whorehouse\\" for their own earthly delights.<br /><br />While SANCTUARY is certainly not THE SOUND AND THE FURY, it is a necessary read for Faulkner lovers.ther Fonzo provide some much-needed humor in this rather horrific tale.

It's certainly well worth reading, has some interesting moments, is a quite ambitious novel, but very uneven and isn't THE HOURS. Like the previous novel, SPECIMEN DAYS, the name of a work by Walt Whitman, is set in three different periods. \\"In The Machine\\" takes place in the 19th Century; the middle section;\\"The Children's Crusade,\\" is set in the present; the final \\"Like Beauty\\" is at sometime in the distant future. All three sections take place in New York and there are characters in all three who have the same or similar names. Simon in \\"In The Machine\\" is the dead brother of Lucas; in the second segment Simon \\" buys and sells futures.\\" In \\"Like Beauty\\" Simon is a mechanical man or \\"simulo.\\" Then there is Catherine, Cat and Catareen and Lucas and Luke.<br /><br />There are nice touches and good language through this book. For example, in the futuristic section, Luke and Simon visit a deserted and destroyed Denver and see a store that had \\"once, according to its faded gilt sign, been called Banana Republic and was now a saloon, a barbershop, and a haberdasher's.\\" Horses had made a comeback as the best means of transportation. A child is named Tomcruise. And Mr. Cunningham writes about an experience that all of us have had dozens of times, sitting in a chair that is still warm from someone else's having just sat there and being mildly embarrassed.<br /><br />\\"The Children's Crusade\\" is a brilliant detective story that you cannot put down and is by far the best part of this novel.The other two parts pale beside it. In all three sections, each of which I'm convinced probably would be just effective if read alone, much is made of the poetry of Walt Whitman. Lucas in the first part quotes the poet constantly; in the second segment, a child terrorist also recites Whitman; and Simon, the mechanical man, has been programmed with Whitman. His creator Emory Lowell gave him poetry \\"to regulate you. To eliminate the extremes. I could put a cap on your aggressive capabilities, I could program you to be helpful and kind but I wanted to give you some moral sense as well.\\"<br /><br />The world of SPECIMEN DAYS is a dark one: from the dehumanization that the industrial revolution brought to workers, to suicide bombers, to the futuristic world where aliens have landed on earth and there has been a meltdown. But through it all the poetry of Walt Whitman shines through. If nothing else, Mr. Cunningham has convinced me to reread Whitman. That alone would be justification for reading this strange novel.<br /><br />SPECIMEN DAYS isn't THE HOURS, but it doesn't have to be.u. To eliminate the extremes.

The character here is Mabry Kincaid, who at 53 is staring down the barrel of a gun-- he is awaiting further tests to determine if he is in the early stages of multiple sclerosis. A restorer of old paintings, he is on a flight back to the United States from Paris when the twin towers of the World Trade Center are hit by the terrorists on September 11, 2001, and his plane is diverted to Nova Scotia. He then returns to his old home in North Carolina to visit his ailing father, a retired Episcopal priest whose live-in housekeeper is Audrey Thornton, an African American doctoral student in divinity at Duke University. She is also the mother of Marcus, a 19-year-old who has fathered at child at 17 with his cousin and has hopes of becoming a successful artist one day.<br /><br />The earmarks of Price's recent fiction are all here. A middle-aged Caucasian male apparently has just discovered that African Americans might be his equal. I suppose Mr. Price is to be commended for finally writing about sympathetic black characters. Both white Southern writers and readers certainly had to get to this place although other Southern artists were way ahead of Mr. Price. Carson Mccullers who over 60 years ago created memorable, decent black people in THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER as well as William Styron in THE CONFESSIONS OF NAT TURNER come to mind, just to name two. Mabry does much soul-searching and opines frequently about the cosmos. Some of his findings: men are base; men love nobody; men are sexually promiscuous; women are better; men have no friends; black people are better than white people, all other things being equal. Perhaps America on 9/11 was being paid back in part because of slavery. The contrast between whatever Mr. Price would call the North Carolina he writes about, whether rural or small town, and the rest of America. Then there is the religious overlay. The characters are usually pretty much main-line Protestant with a quirk here or there. Mabry, who has some residual religious feelings but not too many, is mildly repentant of his past life. He had many affairs while married but did see his wife through her final illness.<br /><br />Whether you care for Mr. Price's story or not, he certainly can spin one and obviously knows his territory. Remember when folks put peanuts in their Cokes and ceiling lights were often turned on with a string suspended from the bare bulb? What man hasn't checked, for instance, to make sure his pants are zipped up before he enters a room? And most of us have acquaintances we only regard as \\"Christmas card\\" friends.<br /><br />Price's characters sometimes stretch credibility. Some for instances: Mabry, who describes himself as not having one \\"gay gene\\" when the Australian Man Friday for a gay attorney who most assuredly was killed in he World Trade Center, thinks Mabry is making a pass at him, apparently has been totally comfortable from day one that his daughter is lesbian and is living with another woman. He is 53 and totally okay with that? Maybe. And, of course, the author's insistence on making saints out of his black characters although he does not go quite as overboard here as in his last novel, if I remember correctly. Marcus does have a child he's not supporting but then he's only 19. (There is a strange exchange between Marcus and Mabry when each person is to tell the other one \\"sixty seconds' worth of some private business that eats him up\\" They both relate stories of sexual excess. I suppose that shows that both black men and white men are roosters and equally red-blooded, equally decadent.) Finally, without giving away the ending, I'll point out that the priest's housekeeper has only worked for him for a month.<br /><br />As always Mr. Price's language is beautiful. I just wish I liked these characters more, particularly Mabry.him for a month. <br /> <br />As always Mr. Price's language is beautiful.

Nothing else comes anywhere close. I assume that Mr. Klein's motive is to sell books. And he obviously is succeeding. The awful news is that I purchased and read this piece of trash. The good news is that it was deeply discounted.<br /><br />Like the flea in the proverbial nudist camp, I hardly know where to start. First of all, the photograph of Ms. Clinton on the jacket cover is most unflattering, particularly if the book were standing on a bookshelf where all you see is her one eye glaring at you. Klein starts off with Monica Lewinsky's account of groping President Clinton in public and ends with a quotation by Richard Nixon. (I'm serious.) Throughout the book Klein repeatedly makes hateful comments about Ms. Clinton that he gleaned from former \\"White House officials\\" requesting anonymity, an anonymous source, a \\"prominent foundation head,\\" etc., etc. He also quotes heavily from the books by both Dick Morris and Gail Sheehy, not exactly Pulitzer Prize authors, themselves.<br /><br />Klein has the right to write anything he wants to, but shouldn't he be required to back up his statements with some sort of evidence. On practically every page he makes petty, hateful comments. he compares the Clinton's fights in the White House as \\"Jerry Springer-style free-for-alls.\\" He makes ugly comments about Ms. Clinton's looks. She is \\"homely,\\" does not have an attractive body, was not interested in her hair and makeup when in college and in her early days as the Governor's wife, but now has \\"cemented\\" hair and wears too much makeup. (She obviously couldn't please Mr. Klein if she wanted to.) Ms. Clinton is not interested in sex but had an affair with Vince Foster and might be a lesbian, either political or the other kind. She surrounds herself with lesbians or \\"gender feminists\\" or mannish women or all of the above. She is reported to have gotten into a fight in the fifth grade. She has too much \\"self-worth\\" along with \\"blonde ambition.\\" In the notorious photograph of her with President Clinton dancing on a beach in St. Thomas \\"shortly before he was forced to testify in the Paula Jones case,\\" Klein describes the couple as \\"half-naked.\\" Then they must be half-clothed as well. There are literally dozens of similar references, but I grow weary. The cruelest thing he says in the entire book is that he intimates that Ms. Clinton is not a good mother. His source-- I kid you not-- is none other than Richard Nixon. (p.255.) He also tells the reader on several occasions what Ms. Clinton is thinking, no small feat. According to Klein, \\"the day that the WASHINGTON POST broke the story of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky was the most painful day in Hillary's life.\\" (p. 103.) How does Klein know this? There is not a footnote to be seen.<br /><br />Klein claims Ms. Clinton is a liar. Most politicians do and are so only people who have never lied are fit for public I suppose. She is obviously wrong to have presidential ambitions. But could it have anything to do with her gender? There is a wonderful quotaton attributed to the first Queen Elizabeth where she tells a group of men that \\"you would not have treated me this way had I been crested instead of cloven.\\" I suspect the same applies in this case.<br /><br />About thirty years ago two young men from the Washington Post wrote ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN that inspired a whole generation of young people to go into journalism. It is sad indeed that we have come to this.h \\"blonde ambition.\\" In the notorious photograph of her with President Clinton dancing on a beach in St. Thomas \\"shortly before he was forced to testify in the Paula Jones case,\\" Klein describes the couple as \\"half-naked.\\" Then they must be half-clothed as well.

There is a wonderful quotaton attributed to the first Queen Elizabeth where she tells a group of men that \\"you would not have treated me this way had I been crested instead of cloven.\\" I suspect the same applies in this case.    About thirty years ago two young men from the Washington Post wrote ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN that inspired a whole generation of young people to go into journalism. It is sad indeed that we have come to this.	2005-06-26

According to the introduction, this book grew out of actual letters he began writing to friends after he and a girl friend identified only as \\"E\\" moved to New Orleans in early 2000. Four years later the couple left the city \\"for reasons that remain unclear.\\" Since they at first were not meant for publication, perhaps that is why these meandering letters are so wondrously conversational and totally unself-conscious. To a letter, they are a delight to read and made me want to revisit this most European of U. S. cities.<br /><br />Mr. Walker covers some of the subjects usuallly associated with New Orleans: Mardi Gras, jazz funerals, fine dining, the French Quarter and the relentless humidity. Although he obviously loves this city, he does not shy away from writing about the blight of public housing, urban decay and the fragile balance of race relations. The book is chock-full of both memorable characters and places. Whether they got that way on their own or were made that way by Mr. Walker's pen, it really doesn't matter. We meet Ernie K-Doe, the R & B singer who gave us the hit \\"Mother-in-Law,\\" whose funeral Walker writes about. And Galatorie's, the restaurant that fired a popular waiter-- who apparently couldn't keep his hands off women diners-- and so incensed its clientele that the article covering the firing in THE TIMES-PICAYUNE generated more reader comments than any subject since September 11. Don't forget the part-time embalmer at the funeral home Over by Rhodes and fulltime cashier at the grocery store Save-A Center. Or the notorious Gennifer Flowers. I feel better knowing she wound up in a club in the French Quarter where she now occasionally holds court, sings a little and will be photographed with you for $6.00. It seems appropriate that her now club once was a bar with what the writer describes as a \\"high-end whorehouse\\" upstairs.<br /><br />The author is nothing is not thorough. In one of the longest chapters in his book, he tells us everything we ever wanted to know-- and then some-- about the song \\"St. James Infirmary.\\" Although I had never heard of the song before, I'm going to find the Harry Connick version and see what the fuss is all about. Mr. Walker is that good at making his case for this music.<br /><br />One of the most intriguing things about the LETTERS is that Mr. Walker never tells the name of the woman who is living with him although he mentions her constantly. She is simply \\"E.\\" Elvira, Emily, Evangeline? We do not have a clue as to what the \\"E\\" stands for. Since he tells us that she left a good job in New York City to move to New Orleans with him, we are probably safe in assuming that he is not guilty of transporting a minor across state lines. On the other hand, perhaps, as Garrison Keillor would say, E thought she could do better and insisted on remaining anonymous.<br /><br />Finally, although there are many interesting photographs scattered throughout the book, we never see a picture of the author. Most readers want to see what a writer they like looks like-- and like Mr. Walker you will.

NEVER LET ME GO is such a book. Reading this extremely well-written but devastating novel is a deeply emotional and troubling experience that will break your heart if you let it. The plot is such that the less said about it,the better, as there are many surprises along the way for the uninformed reader. A friend of mine sent me an e-mail saying something to the effect that \\"I'm reading the new Ishiguro novel. It's about___________.\\" I'll never know then when I would have figured out what was happening nor will I ever know both the joy and shock of my own discovery. (I had the same experience with the movie THE CRYING GAME a few years ago when a gay reviewer gave the plot away so \\"other gay people\\" would not miss the movie.) So do not read reviews that are plot summaries and do not let your friends tell you about what happens either.<br /><br />The story is told by a first person thirty-one-year-old narrator whose name is Kathy H. We never know her last name or the last names of any of the other characters or even if they have last names. The narrator recounts her years as a child in Hailsham, a private school in England and her friendship with two other children, Ruth and Tommy, who also were at that school. You will remember these three tragic characters long after you've finished reading the novel.<br /><br />Mr. Ishiguro's transparent prose and pretty much without adjectives or other modifiers, but then he does tell a straight-forward tale most visceral. He raises questions about the ethics of scientific experiments and comments about the brevity of life, how utterly futile it is for friends to bicker and hold grudges. He also asks how much adults should warn children about what life has to offer them, how much should we shelter them from the real world, the loneliness of being different, the uncrossable gulf between the sick and the well, missed opportunities, how the smallest whiff of hope sustains us, the beauty of friendship and lasting love-- and finally, a sweet thought-- that the dead never leave us as long as we remember them. In a poignant passage the narrator remembers Tommy: \\"I half-closed my eyes and imagined this was the spot where everything I'd ever lost since my childhood had washed up, and I was now standing here in front of it, and if I waited long enough, a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field, and gradually get larger until I'd see it was Tommy, and he's wave, maybe even call. The fantasy never got beyond that-- I didn't let it--and though the tears rolled down my face, I wasn't sobbing or out of control. I just waited a bit, then turned back to the car, to drive off to wherever it was I was suuposed to be.\\"<br /><br />You will not read a novel like this one again. It certain will be nominated for a Booker Prize.llest whiff of hope sustains us, the beauty of friendship and lasting love-- and finally, a sweet thought-- that the dead never leave us as long as we remember them.

From \\"Last Night\\" with its beautifully ambiguous title, the first story I read, to \\"Platinum,\\" the last one I read, there is not one superfluous word in Mr. Salter's elegant prose. He can describe a person or place with a word or two; or when he's being long-winded, he may need a complete sentence. A retarded six-year old swimming in a pond has an anxious face \\"above the surface like a dog's.\\" A dog is simply \\"yellow-eyed.\\" A woman who is past 40 had \\"only her personality and good nature by that time, the rest, as she herself would say, had turned into a size fourteen.\\" Another woman's only fault is that she didn't like to cook. \\"She couldn't cook and talk at the same time.\\" Although many of Mr. Salter's characters are upper middleclass, they don't appear to be much better off than the rest of us. They just meet in nicer hotels to commit their adulteries. Some of them lead lives of quiet desperation. Mr. Salter is also the master of understated irony. For example, in \\"Last Night,\\" arguably the best story in this small collection, a terminally ill woman plans her suicide with assistance from her husband and invites a young woman, \\"a family friend,\\" to dine with her and her husband for her last supper. This quiet little story, as Garrison Keillor would say, will blow your head off.<br /><br />Short stories do not get better than these.	2005-06-02

The peace and tranquility will not last for long, however. Grace Lord, owner of The Nook, a shop specializing in furniture for dollhouses, has scheduled an annual regional exhibition of the Midwest Miniatures Society for the people who design and collect these dollhouses or \\"roomboxes.\\" Any writer who can write an interesting story about such an unusual subject-- and that's putting it nicely-- obviously can write about anything. Carroll Cantrell, the outrageously gay and national authority on these little houses, soon after he arrives to judge the competition, is found brutally murdered in Ms. Lord's carriage house. Pierce, the friendly local sheriff whom we know from the previous mystery is outed as a gay man when he turns up as a suspect since he has been sleeping with Cantrell since his arrival in Dumont.<br /><br />In addition to Neil, Thad and Pierce, Roxanne, Mark's attorney friend; Lucille and Glee, newspaper employees; the local DA Kaiser and Marian of Fem-Snach make return appearances as well.<br /><br />As usual, Mr. Craft takes on bigotry against gay people and voices his support for free speech. (Kaiser, who is up for reelection, forms an alliance with Marian in an effort to close down the adult bookstores.) Of course we have Mark's erotic dreams to add some spice to the narrative too.<br /><br />I do not usually figure out \\"who done it\\" but I did this time. I'm not sure if that says something good about me or something less than excellent about this novel. At any rate, it's always a pleasure to read Mr. Craft.

In early November of 1938, Herschel Grynszpan, a seventeen-year-old Polish Jew, walked into the German Embassy in Paris and shot the Third Secretary, Ernest vom Rath. Hitler's Minister of Propoganda, Josef Goebbels, used the German's death as a pretext to demand retribution and retaliated with Kristallnacht or \\"Night of the Broken Glass\\" as Jews were slaughtered. In THE GERMAN OFFICER'S BOY Harlan Greene (WHY WE NEVER DANCED THE CHARLESTON and WHAT THE DEAD REMEMBER) fleshes out the spare historical facts about this incident and writes a beautiful love story of two men doomed from the beginning of their affair.<br /><br />Here, as in his previous fiction, Mr. Greene is a master at creating atmosphere, through beautiful evocative prose: \\"It was not like India. And it was not day, nor night but a world incandescent with significance. And the room, the walls, the dirty windows, and their flesh too, all were washed in the pearl essence, like a shell, opalescent.\\" The fears of these two star-crossed lovers is palpable. While we'll probably never know the complete story behind this tragedy, the author writes a convincing, moving account of what could have happened complete with an actual photograph on the dust jacket of the young Herschel in a police car after the shooting. (Mr. Greene in an \\"Afterward\\" lists historical sources as well.)<br /><br />It is quite wonderful to read Mr. Greene's prose again after such a long hiatus. This slim volume is a great read.	2005-05-21

Mr. Mark Manning returns, as dapper as ever. He still drinks Japanese vodka with a twist of orange peel, writes only with a Montblanc pen and drives a Bavarian V-8. His lover Neil is still in the picture as is Roxanne, the woman attorney friend of both Mark and Neil. Frustrated because he did not win a coveted Partridge Prize, investigative journalism's highest award, and believing the reason he didn't get the reward he richly deserved is because of homophobia, Manning leaves his job he has held for many years at a newspaper in Chicago and moves to Dumont, Wisconsin and purchases a small but excellent newspaper there. And then all hell breaks loose. A woman relative is killed in Manning's home while the house is full of Christmas guests and he becomes the prim suspect as well as inheriting a fortune from the dead woman, along with custody of her unruly teenaged son.<br /><br />The plot gets quite byzantine and is a little over the top. Mr. Craft, however, certainly takes risks and as always engages the reader in what is going on. His usual sense of humor is here with hooty references to fruitcakes as well as a feminist who organization of women is called \\"Fem-Snach.\\" The Catholic Church takes as shellacking as well when santimonious priests give \\"fill-in-the-blanks\\" sermons, eulogizing people who haven't seen the inside of a church for many years. Finally, your eyes will cross-- in a good way-- because of all the references to khaki-clad butts.<br /><br />So we have a complex plot, characters we care about, and Mr. Craft's usual pitch for gay rights-- his best in this series yet.	2005-05-20

Surely it was light years ahead of its time as Ms. McCullers takes on homosexuality-- latent and the other kind, masochism, adultery, voyeurism, self-mutilation, a nervous breakdown and animal cruelty in fewer than a hundred pages. In the hands of a lesser writer, this tale would have degenerated into a trashy detective story. Ms. McCullers, however, manages to make the characters, with all their warts, believable, and for the most part, sympathetic. Captain Penderton, for example, is tormented by his hidden feelings for other men-- he is simultaneously attracted to both Private Williams as well as Major Langdon and hates Williams, even though he ought to despise the Major since he is cuckolding the Captain who, along with everyone else, knows about it. But Penderton is a real person, unhappy, lonely but capable of murder.<br /><br />Ms. McCullers keeps this story first class with her spare, though poetic language. \\"An army post [the story is set on a military post in the 1930's in the South] in peacetime is a dull place. Things happen, but then they happen over and over again. . . At the same time things do occasionally happen on an army post that are not likely to re-occur. There is a fort in the South where a few years ago a murder was committed. The participants of this tragedy were: two officers, a soldier, two women, a Filipino, and a horse.\\" With those opening lines, the story begins and never slows down.<br /><br />I never had an English professor who would give Carson McCullers the time of day. Her novels were too gothic, her plots unbelievable, there were too many kinks in her characters. Could it have been that her stories were too close to home or were they jealous of her popularity with the reading public from the publication of her first novel THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER?<br /><br />REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE holds up well on a second reading.

Since the very earliest days of the AIDS epidemic Larry Kramer has often been the loudest and sometimes it seems almost the only, lonely member of the U. S.'s gay community screaming out against what he perceives as the injustice of the government's handling of the AIDS problem. At 69, he shouts once again. I read his speech twice-- it's short and to the point; sadly he's right about most of what he says. On them: about the cabal or right wing conspiracy-- remember, people laughed at Hillary Clinton for using that term-- Mr. Kramer gives ample evidence that she was right, quoting Bill Moyers and others. The numbers are frightening beyong belief. The top 1 percent of wealth holders control 39 percent of total household wealth in the U. S. The inequality gap in this country is the highest in the industrialized world. Only two percent of the many billions of dollars Congress approved for Africa and around the world has actually left Washington some four years later. \\"Moral values,\\" if we don't know it, we should, is a code word that means us. That's why Bush was reelected. Conclusion: Those in power are happy to see us die.<br /><br />About us: Mr. Kramer's words to the gay community are just as harsh. We are still killing ourselves with drugs and having unprotected sex 25 years into the worst epidemic the world has ever known. (At the beginning of his speech he mentions two friends, one in his middle age who has just tested positive for the virus and the other, also in his middle age, who has become addicted to crystal meth. The younger gay people have no heroes to follow and no interest in learning about their history. They (we, or most of us) are unwilling to stand up and fight those in power. That is our tragedy.<br /><br />Mr. Kramer-- God bless him-- with the fervor of an Old Testament Prophet and taking no prisoners, in his rage is as outrageous as ever. Some of his observations: Ronald Reagan is responsible for more deaths than Hitler. Ed Koch, Mayor of New York City, when the first cases were reported there in 1981, did nothing, according to Kramer, and is one of three persons whose behavior is the reason the AIDS plague was \\"allowed to happen.\\" He also asks the pertinent question: what would happen if Mary Cheney wanted to teach?\\" Dr. Anthony Fauci is the only \\"true AIDS hero\\" in the entire government. Finally, George Washington was gay.<br /><br />No less than five times in his speech, Mr. Kramer opines that gay people are better and \\"smarter and more talented and more aware\\" than other people. He gives no evidence to support his conclusion. He's wrong on that one. But he is right on another point: \\"We are human beings as much as they are, and their God is the same as everyone's else's God and He simply cannot be allowed to be as punishing as they are requiring Him to be.\\"<br /><br />Read this very short but so relevant speech.York City, when the first cases were reported there in 1981, did nothing, according to Kramer, and is one of three persons whose behavior is the reason the AIDS plague was \\"allowed to happen.\\" He also asks the pertinent question: what would happen if Mary Cheney wanted to teach?\\" Dr. Anthony Fauci is the only \\"true AIDS hero\\" in the entire government.

They are set all over the world and no two of them have anything in common with each other except they are all inventive and brilliant. In the story \\"Ever Wrest: Log of the Journey,\\" we have a pilot into women's clothes who climbs Mount Everest and then disappears: \\"The Chineses say nothing about how Wilson's [the cross-dressing climber] body was clothed but it is still possible to view, in the Alpine Museum of the Communist Party, a voluptuous  high-heeled shoe that the legendary mountaineer Chu Ying-hua swears he found under the snow only a few paces from the British flag that Sir Edmund Hillary planted on the summit of Everest just a few days before Princess Elizabeth was crowned in Westminister Abbey.\\" Another favorite of mine is \\"Chronicle of the Second Plague\\" in which inhabitants of St. Martin believe that since they have survived the bubonic plague that they are immune from a second plague, a little like the belief many of us hold that lightning would never strike the same place twice. Then there is the narrator in \\"The Chinaman with the Heads\\" who meets a gentleman who is trying to get through customs with a box that contains \\"half a dozen human heads carefully wrapped in linen, with a penetrating odor that led me to believe they had been preserved in formaldehyde.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Padilla seems to be right smack in the Latin American writers' tradition of magic realism. I understand a new novel will be translated soon into English. I can't wait to read it.	2005-05-13

His beautiful work continues in this volume as well. He certainly changed the way a lot of fashion photography is done, having introduced us to the Jeff Aquilons of the world along with other boy-next-door types. (Your boy next door may not look like these young men, but they have to live somewhere.) According to the Plate List most of the photographs were shot in the late 1990's or 2000's although a few of them are done in the mid-eighties. (My only minor complaint about this beautiful magazine/book is that it's difficult so match up the photographs with the pages since the pages are not numbered.) There are a couple of pretty women here, some male portraits, a boxer, a Marine,  some opulent rooms, a few closeups of interiors-- \\"Call Your Mother, She Worries,\\" some landscapes; but for the most part, you'll see beautiful men, who, unlike a lot of the early shots, are often baring all here, both in color and black and white.<br /><br />Joshen Siemens writes an interesting introduction called \\"A Man and His Search; the artist includes commentary as well, proving that he is a decent writer as well as a world class photographer.

Having read in a gay anthology the last story here, \\"The Universe, Concealed,\\" is the reason I bought this slim volume of only 191 pages, proving once again that often less is more. While the stories can be read in any order as each of them stands alone, they are all related, a little like one of those David Hockney photographs where the frames are loosely connected to form one picture. There is the narrator, along with his brother Davis, who is 15 months older than he, and their parents. What makes these tender stories so heart-wrenching is that the family dynamics are completely accurate. I saw glimpses of both my parents and my brother in these characters, the competition between children for their parents' love and approval, the difficulties of growing up, the death of a parent or sibling-- and you don't have to be gay to experience that. The narrator is much taken with his mother, dresses in her clothes as a youngster, wants to spend time only with her, and she says things like he is her best friend, probably not the healthiest attitude for a mother to take. He also wants desperately to please his father but not if it means he has to go fishing with him or search for night crawlers. His father is mildly embarrassed with who his son is. \\"'He makes me nervous,' I heard my father tell my mother one night as I lay in bed. They were speaking about me.\\"<br /><br />Other passages-- or stories-- ring true as well. The narrator, like so many of us in the 1980's and 1990's, has attended far too many \\"gay\\" funerals. It's almost as each of them must be the most unusual but oh, so relevant: \\"I know what ritual we'll get when we die, I thought each time I looked around the room at the bunch of us, [the narrator is attending a Positive Immunity workshop] the worried unwell. . . It won't be Kaddish. It won't be a funeral pyre on the Ganges. It'll be a boombox playing 'Je Ne Regrette Rien' in the rear of some Unitarian church hung with rainbow flags, like a gay Knights of Columbus hall.\\" (Surely the funeral director who coined the word \\"cremains\\" for ashes will burn in hell for that little monstrosity.) There are literally dozens of paragraphs like these in these stories that go straight to the heart.<br /><br />The most moving story-- without revealing what happens-- is \\"My Brother In The Basement.\\" The narrator perceives that his brother Davis is on a collision course but cannot save him. This story, like many of the others, is to be read again and again. I'm reminded of what William Maxwell said about good literature, that we should enjoy it rather than analyze it.<br /><br />Mr. McCann is is a very fine writer.ien' in the rear of some Unitarian church hung with rainbow flags, like a gay Knights of Columbus hall.\\" (Surely the funeral director who coined the word \\"cremains\\" for ashes will burn in hell for that little monstrosity.)

The format here is similar to his initial offering. The models are all young, wholesome, more attractive than the boy next door and photographed in color, in nice, soft, flattering light. On the other hand, how could one photograph any of these men in a way that would be unflattering? Many of the models are wearing underwear-- Calvin Klein and Abercrombie & Fitch owe the photographer big time-- proving once again that often beautiful people are sexier partially clad rather than completely nude. A couple of the men have tattoos, I spotted an earring or two; but for the most part, these are all boys you could introduce to your prim Aunt Helen.<br /><br />Mr. Carson's biographical notes indicate that he has photographed 5,000 young men so there's obviously plenty more where these photos came from. He is one of a handful of photographers currently doing this kind of photography whose work stands out from the rest of repetitious, generic-like images. For me, the mark of a fine book of photography is one that I come back to again and again. This one definitely makes the cut.	2005-04-26

Mr. Boyle tells stories  that grab you from the first sentence-- \\"They wore each other like a pair of socks\\"-- and do not let you go until the roller coaster ride is finished, some 20 pages or so later.<br /><br /> The author has collected here 16 stories, most of which have been published previously in EQUIRE, GQ, GRANTA, THE NEW YORKER and PLAYBOY as well as collections of best short stories including The O. Henry Awards, an honor that is certainly apropos since this author is every bit as good at surprise endings as Mr. O. Henry, himself. (\\"She Wasn't Soft\\" and \\"After the Plague\\" are just two excellent examples.) Many of these stories are about men and women acting badly-- very badly. A young man throws his girl friend's unwanted newborn child into a dumpster, a young drug addict working at his physician brother's abortion clinic goes ballistic and starts shooting protestors, one of a handful of survivors of a global plague in a fit of jealously vandalizes another survivor's home. But Mr. Boyle also writes about the way some people react with gutsy courage to violence. An airline passsenger saves herself as well as everyone else on a plane by attacking an out-of-control fellow passenger who is trying to open the rear exit door of the plane by attacking him with the steel fork given with the awful flight food; and an elderly widow takes on a robber with a can of Mace, for example.<br /><br />Mr. Boyle has an endless reservoir of creativity. Who else writes stories about a tour of women from Los Angeles going to Alaska to meet eligible men? (\\"There were a hundred and seven of them, of all ages, shapes and sizes, from twenty-five- and thirty-year-olds in dresses that looked like they were made of Saran Wrap to a couple of big-beamed older types in pantsuits who could have been somebody's mother--and I mean somebody grown, with a goatee beard and a job at McDonald's. . .\\") Or two wealthy single sisters, one who wears only black, the other only white, who live in a black and white house and hire only black or white workers, wearing only black and white clothes-- no brown-skinned people, that is, Mexicans need apply? Or a house full of young pretty women in an upscale neighborhood where voyeurs can go online and watch their goings-on twenty-four hours a day? Or an elderly couple where the husband suffers a stroke and his wife falls and breaks her hip as she searches for him?<br /><br />Although not for the fainthearted, these Molotov cocktails are as good a collection of stories as you will find.n pantsuits who could have been somebody's mother--and I mean somebody grown, with a goatee beard and a job at McDonald's. . .\\") Or two wealthy single sisters, one who wears only black, the other only white, who live in a black and white house and hire only black or white workers, wearing only black and white clothes-- no brown-skinned people, that is, Mexicans need apply?

In the second novel in this series, Mark Manning, ace reporter, is back with a vengence. This time he's hot on the trail of one Dr. Pavo Zarnick, alleged to have discovered a tenth planet in the earth's solar system. Are there holes in his story, for instance, is he a fraud, and if so, why? As Manning becomes more involved, he gets all caught up in a plot by the religious right-- a group called Christian Family Network-- to do bad things, i.e., the murder of the President of the United States, along with a stadium-full of other people. Manning, himself, finds his own life in danger.<br /><br />There's never a dull paragraph in this thriller. The action moves quickly and the plot builds to a suspenseful climax. Mr. Manning is as handsome, muscular and as dapper as ever, drinking his Kirs, wearing his button-down shirts and driving his beloved fine automobile. His architect lover Neil is back, along with Roxanne, Manning's attorney friend.<br /><br />Mr. Craft does not write mysteries where the detective does dry, rather dull problem solving to catch the bad guys. He totally engages the reader, appealing to our sense of justice and fair play, in this instance, in his attack on religious homophobic bigots. Finally, he takes a great risk here in killing off a most sympathetic character. That's gutsy and the mark of a really skilled writer.	2005-04-22

As in his novel METES AND BOUNDS Jay Quinn has written another story where much of the action takes place at the North Carolina shores. At 48 the narrator Chris Thayer, when we meet him, is packing up his things and moving out of a fine home in Raleigh after living 22 years with the same man, one Zack Ronan, after having raised his three children. In fact, Chris is the only \\"mom\\"-- that's what two of the grown children call him from time to time and the other one Schooner calls him all the time-- these children have ever known. Zack's wife had committed suicide just after the baby Schooner was born.<br /><br />Mr. Quinn seems to say that gay children have no more hangups growing up in a household with two men than do those who are raised in straight homes. We know that psychological studies bear that out. What all children need is love and acceptance of which Chris has plenty of both to offer. The novel has a lot going for it. Mr. Quinn understands the way some of these people speak and gets the language right. Someone is as \\"sharp as a tack.\\" Another person would \\"talk to a stump.\\" Someone else is no \\"bigger than a minute.\\"  The book is quite a page turner and you'll genuinely like most of the characters. (All right. You proably won't care for Zack, who for the most part is a real cad, and his therapist daughter, seeped in psychobabble, can get a little tedious.)<br /><br />My problem with this book is that parts of the plot and some of the characters are somewhere way beyond the rainbow. With the exception of two stupid juveniles who are bad spellers, homophobia is practically nonexistent-- and this in the state that gave the world Jesse Helms. There is not an AIDS case within a thousand miles. Chris attends a nice Catholic church where the priest is totally accepting of his \\"lifestyle\\"-- for lack of a better word-- and has books by Bill Moyers and Bishop John Spong although Father Fintan confesses that he has not read everything in his library. The sex between Chris-- \\"Little Bit\\"-- and his macho \\"husband\\" Steve whom he calls \\"Big Man\\" is beyond description every time. Everyone at a family reunion Steve takes Chris to is completely okay with Steve and his \\"wife\\" and some of them, including an aging matriarch, say so. A more believable scenario would have been the \\"don't ask; don't tell\\" version where country folk love a male relative's \\"roommate\\" but never say aloud what everyone knows about the relationship. Finally, I do not believe that any woman whose husband drives a pickup truck-- I grew up in East Tennessee and think I understand such an animal-- is \\"praying\\" for her youngest son to be gay.<br /><br />Certainly we've come a long way since THE LORD WONT MIND and CITY OF NIGHT and it's refreshing to see Schooner and his lover Frank go off to Massachusetts to get married-- the time is post 9/11 and just before the last Presidential election. But surely this North Carolina unfortunately does not exist anywhere outside the pages of this novel.

US	51803143	RU9G8YVSVHRQJ	0312083025	782933835	Black Book	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Black Is Beautiful	Published in 1986, Robert Mapplethorpe's BLACK BOOK remains one of my favorite books of photography. Nothing had been published like it previously; nothing comparable has been published since. The book is devoted entirely to shots of black men, some of them naked, some of them not. There are portraits included here as well-- one of my favorites is the stunning portrait of Roedel Middleton on page 70. Some of the images are outrageously beautiful. Many of the models' bodies take on the quality of polished ebony. The four nude photographs of someone named Ajitto in a classical pose-- as are many of the images-- at the beginning of the book are as beautiful as any you will ever see.<br /><br />It is common knowledge of course now that some of these photographs have been declared obscene (by the likes of Jesse Helms et al.) and racist by some African Americans.(Some of the black men making these allegations, to paraphrase the black poet Don Lee, talk black but sleep white.) According to a less-than-scientific survey by this Caucasian male, there are about 94 photographs included here, only six of them are of body parts-- and I'm not talking here of feet and hands or even behinds here-- 27 are of male nudes with their genitalia exposed, and only in five of them is the model unnamed. Mapplethorpe may well have been a racist, but I fear his critics may have to look elsewhere for proof. An observation or two: his models appear to be willing subjects as no one is tied up or seems to be shot unawares. Secondly, the nature of the male animal of all colors being what it is, there's a good possibility that people having little to offer may have been unwilling to make the sacrifice of giving the viewer the full monty. The artist obviously loved black men and had many black friends as well as lovers. Finally the poet Ntozake Shange has written a beautiful poem as an introduction to this book. Apparently she had no problem with Mapplethorpe's creative vision.<br /><br />Many of these photographs will last.se photographs will last.	2005-04-14

A woman in her 40's, along with her niece and two other young women, a secretary and a boarder, cannot leave the young man alone. The older woman Medora Phillips would like to see him wed her niece, as would the niece. But the other two young women want him as well, along with an older man in his 50's. Of course the blond, Bertram Cope, already has a boy friend, who, when Cope writes him that he has somehow gotten himself engaged to Niece Amy, responds in what is my favorite line from the entire novel: \\"This thing can't go on, and you know it as well as I do. Nip it. Nip it now.\\" Does this scenario sound familiar?<br /><br />In Andrew Solomon's \\"Afterward\\" he opines that Bertram Cope is an \\"anti-hero\\" in that he is quite ordinary, not remarkably intelligent, and weak, both physically and emotionally. I disagree. Bertram is the Gay Everyman, at least until the most recent times when the love that dare not speak its name is on the ballot in many states in an attempt to get to the altar. Practically every gay man knows the frustration of finding out, sometimes too late, that by being friendly and polite to single women-- something our mothers taught us to do-- we have either sent mixed signals or they believe what they want to-- we have convinced them that we want to wed them.<br /><br />Henry Blake Fuller self-published this novel is 1919. It was decades ahead of its time and is certainly interesting from a historical point of view. On the other hand, it remains relevant and is well worth reading. Mr. Fuller writes well and with great subtlety.	2005-04-10

Now I know how to tell if baking powder is still good, why white chocolate should be cut into very small pieces before melting, how to substitute different kinds of chocolate in a recipe and why to avoid mixing water with chocolate at all costs.<br /><br />In her introduction, Ms. Medrich says she is attempting to write simple recipes for \\"busy home cooks.\\" For the most part, she accomplishes what she set out to do. The recipes in general appear to be straight forward and with plenty of instructions for the most wary of beginners-- where to place the rack in the oven, exactly how long to beat a mixture, whether a creation tastes better the first or second day, for instance.<br /><br />Although there are several other recipes I want to try, I bought this cookbook for one recipe alone, the Tiger Cake (page 269). It has everything going for it. It is absolutely stunning in appearance-- a five-year-old named it because of the stripes-- it is simple to make, and tastes divine. The twist here is that the cake substitutes extra virgin olive oil for the usual butter  and has a half teaspoon of white pepper in it. And as the author says, it really is better the second day-- should you have any left.<br /><br />In addition to the recipes, as the title indicates, Ms. Medrich has many stories about her experiences in chocolate. She could have called the book \\"My Journey from Milky Ways to Chocolate Truffles.\\" There is much to be gleaned from this book. You will come back to it again and again, both for her stories and for guidance on baking with chocolate.<br /><br />Finally, a word about the layout and design of this book: the desserts are beautifully photographed and the recipes for the most part are done with brown type on either a white or pale blue background so the volume is as pretty as it is helpful.	2005-04-10

Just when you thought that nothing else could be done with the overdone photographing of Calla Lilies, Mapplethorpe graces this book with eleven new shots of them, along with Orchids, Tulips, Poppies and a Rose or two. It should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with Mapplethorpe's work that some of these magnificent color shots are quite phallic in nature.<br /><br />It is appropriate that the artist selected flowers for some of his last work since he like flowers was here for such a short time. (It is futile to speculate as to how many beautiful books he would have published by now had he lived.)<br /><br />A short but moving introduction is included by his friend Patti Smith: She ends her comments with lines:<br /><br />\\"A flower that grew from years of flowers./By one who caused a modern shudder/and was favored by his mother./It is the wall that conceals all the tears of a relatively young man/with nothing but glory in his grasp and what he would be/grasping is the hand of God drawing him into another garden.\\"<br /><br />For those who will never afford a Mapplethorpe, this book is a beautiful substitute.	2005-04-10

A scientist, a pragmatist, he is at odds with his daughter Daisy, a soon-to-be-published poet and his father-in-law, a poet of some fame for he sees no value in reading \\"fairy tales.\\" It is far better to read Darwin than Tolstoy. He would agree with Auden that poetry-- and literature in general-- makes nothing happen. On the other hand, Perowne's life-- in addition to the lives of those he holds dear-- is probably saved because of one beautiful poem, Matthew Arnold's \\"Dover Beach.\\"<br /><br />SATURDAY covers one day in the life of Dr. Perowne, Saturday, February 15, 2003. (While the critics mention James Joyce and Virginia Woolf's novels that take place in one day, nobody seems to remember the short but brilliant novel, A SINGLE MAN, by another British writer, Christopher Isherwood.)There is a protest scheduled on this day in London against the coming war in Iraq. Perowne is undecided as to whether the U. S., along with Great Britain, should start the war in part because he has had a patient who has suffered under the old regime in Iraq.<br /><br />Is this novel as good as ATONEMENT or, say, ENDURING LOVE? Does it matter? McEwan is one of a handful of authors writing in English today whose work I will always read. He has something important to say about the way the world is put together-- or not put together-- and says it with incredible skill and grace. Like fine wine, he ages well. Although Arnold's \\"ignorant armies clash by night\\" here, Perowne takes pleasure in small, domestic things-- cooking a meal-- unlike a botched surgery, no one usually dies from a meal gone wrong-- making love to his wife of 25 years, watching his children grow up, beating a colleague at squash, listening to Bach-- and all this post September 11.<br /><br />The hallmarks we have come to expect from McEwan are here: the unprovoked, random act of violence to innocent people and the intelligent, affluent characters, so fleshed out that we know dozens of details about their lives, characters that we care about desperately. But Perowne exhibits here-- without giving the plot away although many of the critics seem intent on writing for Cliff Notes-- a magnanimity towards his assailant that approaches gentleness and forgiveness. Finally, as always, McEwan writes in spare though descriptive language and speaks universal truths. Perowne's visit to his demented mother in the nursing facility goes to the bone and made my eyes burn. Then there is the scene where he, along with his wife and two children, dismantle his mother's home. \\"She's not dead, Henry kept telling himself. But her life, all lives, seemed tenuous when he saw how quickly, with what ease, all the trappings, all the fine details of a lifetime could be packed and scattered, or junked. . . As the shelves and drawers emptied, and the boxes and bags filled, he saw that no one owned anything really. It's all rented, or borrowed. Our possessions will outlast us, we'll desert them in the end.\\" Even though Henry doesn't read Matthew Arnold, they are essentially on the same wavelength. This novel, like all good literature, reminds us that we're all in this together-- or to paraphrase Arnold-- we should be true to one another.<br /><br />A fine, fine novel.ovoked, random act of violence to innocent people and the intelligent, affluent characters, so fleshed out that we know dozens of details about their lives, characters that we care about desperately.

He is almost always one step ahead of the reader-- at least this one-- in this combination coming-of-age tale, tragic love story, dark murder mystery, historial novel, travelogue on Barcelona and commentary on antiquarian bookstores. While it is difficult to say much about the plot without giving it away, I promise you that you were never be bored and that you'll read the last 100 or so pages straight through. Mr. Zafon ties everything together nicely. Occasionally he-- and/or his translator-- turns a memorable phrase; parts of the narrative are reminiscent of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. A funeral wreath being sent to a wedding is something that the master, himself, could have written. There are jabs at the Americans and their obsession with television--one character labels TV the Antichrist-- and thoughful comments about life: we remain alive, for example, as long as someone remembers us.<br /><br />The young narrator Daniel, as if peeling off the layers of an onion, gets deeper and deeper into this tale of murder and deception as he sets out to find out all he can about the mysterious author of THE SHADOW OF THE WIND and other novels ( Julian Carax) that keep getting stolen from bookstores and burned.<br /><br />The critics are right in their high praise of this novel.	2005-03-26

One would gather from this great thriller that once a cop, always a cop or something like that. Mr. Janeway gets right onto solving the strange murder of his silent partner/erstwhile sleeping companion's ex-boy friend who has become a collector of signed first editions. Mr. Janeway hasn't lost any of his temper, detective skills or his nose for smelling out a liar or has he?<br /><br />The story progresses with much ease for the reader and goes down as nicely as a fine French pastry. Unlike some mysteries, you don't get a glimpse of the least bit of scaffolding here. There are of course tidbits about rare books and their prices that Mr. Dunning's fans anxiously await with each new volume. Janeway prices signed first editions of Capote's IN COLD BLOOD, Frost's IN THE CLEARING, Larry McMurtry's THE DESERT ROSE, just to name a few. These references blend right in with the story line, never becoming just literary trivia for trivia's sake.  There is also quite a poignant reference to A FAREWELL TO ARMS near the end of the book.<br /><br />Mr. Dunning also gives a very accurate description of the different kinds of judges-- the good, the bad, the ugly-- as well as good commentary about book fairs.<br /><br />Given the nature of what Mr. Dunning writes about here, it is appropriate that he signed the dust jacket of this book-- or is that his signature? I'm sure I speak for his other fans when I say that we are all ready for him to sign all our first editions of his Janeway stories-- to increase their resell value of course but only in the estate sales!	2005-03-16

The male good guys, Mark and Neil, are ruggedly handsome; Roxanne, the attorney who cannot leave gay men alone, finally redeems herself; as a friend of mine says, Mr. Craft writes well about sex; he takes punches at the Religious Right; and the plot has great twists and turns and builds to a believable climax.

Peter Finch (on the same movie) remarked that when he did the close-up \\"liplock\\" with Murray Head that he just closed his eyes and thought of England. When Princess Margaret and her then husband Lord Anthony Snowdon saw SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY, she said within earshot of both Schlesinger and his lover Michael Childers, that she thought the movie was \\"horrific. . . \\"Men in bed kissing!\\" (This from a woman who had an affair with a man 18 years her junior and was caught on film topless with him-- while married to Snowdon.)This film, the director said was his most personal and was about his own affair with a young man; but he labeled THE DAY OF THE LOCUST his \\"greatest achievement, something that few critics, however, would say. Bob Dylan wrote \\"Lay, Lady, Lady\\" for MIDNIGHT COWBOY but didn't get it finished in time to be used in the movie.  Schlesinger hated exercise and opined that when he thought about it, he just lay down until the moment passed. Although he lived for many years in the U. S. he felt that many Americans lacked manners, particularly when they went to movies. \\"'Audiences talk incessantly. . . They run up and down and eat all the time, because that is what they are used to doing at home.'\\" (We all can tip our hats to this gentleman for that attitude.) Mr. Mann's robust biography of John Schlesinger is chock-full of these and similar details. He had access to everything about this great director: tapes, diaries, family and friends and Mr. Schlesinger although only after he had had a stroke.<br /><br /> Although Mann's work is the \\"authorized\\" biography, he assured both Schlesinger and Childers that he would tell the whole story, the \\"low points and highs.\\" Be that as it may, about the worst thing we find out about Mr. Schlesinger is that he had a temper and often screamed at actors. Mr. Mann most obviously is besotted by Mr. Schlesinger and why shouldn't he be? A lot of us are. When no one else was doing so, he directed films that we had not seen before-- MIDNIGHT COWBOY and SUNDAY BLOOD SUNDAY. Never before had the subject of men loving men been shown so naturally and without shame.<br /><br />An astute critic, Mr. Mann gives his own reviews of practically everything Schlesinger ever directed: movies, opera, television. He attempts to be objective, noting in much detail the faults of THE NEXT BEST THING, the film starring Rupert Everett and Madonna. According to Mann, Schlesinger attempted to change the script so that the two principals decide to have a child, rather than having an \\"drunken, unplanned sexual encounter.\\" He was vetoed by Mr. Everett, who gets to live with his bad decision. For years Mr. Schlesinger attempted to direct another gay-themed movie to no avail. He turned down directing Armistead Maupin's TALES OF THE CITY but for a time considered Larry Kramer's THE NORMAL HEART. He also toyed with the idea of doing something with the novelist David Leavitt, but nothing ever came of that idea. Instead the world got THE NEXT BEST THING.<br /><br />This biography is a tad long-- over 500 pages and also suffers from too much praise from practically everyone Schlesinger ever directed-- Julie Christie, Sir Alan Bates, Dustin Hoffman et al. The list goes on and on. At times it's almost like the footage attached to DVD's where actors and directors \\"remember\\" making a film, etc. You have to ask yourself how accurate are memories about events that happened 30 to 40 years ago. EDGE OF MIDNIGHT, however, is still required reading for Schlesinger fans. And there are many of us. As Mann reminds us, this fine director gave us a handful of really great films that will not be repeated and several others that may not be his best but are much better than a lot of films by his contempories.be?

US	51803143	R3TBZU1FJCCRSI	0595282563	61940003	Monkey Suits: a novel	Books	4	7	7	N	Y	The Waiter World	The problem with this novel is that of many second novels; it is not as good as the amazing PINS, Mr. Provenzano's first novel. While the author wrote about the world of high school wrestling teams in PINS, here he writes about the waiter world (thus the name MONKEY SUITS since those who carry food to our tables usually are clad in those uncomfortable suits with cummerbunds). It's certainly not a bad novel  and is an easy read. It just doesn't have the passion, at least for me, that his first one did. Set in Manhattan in the late 1980's-- The elder Bush is elected president during the course of events-- the novel follows the lives of several gay \\"cater\\" waiters and one mostly straight one, Ritchie, who-- whether intentional or not on the part of the author-- comes across as one of his most endearing characters. There are other characters to care about as well: Kevin, for one, who is active in ACT-UP when he isn't waiting tables. But many of the other people aren't very sympathetic. They work for the people, high society types, who treat them badly even while raising money for AIDS. They do not lift a finger to help themselves-- unless you count the occasional passive agressive spitting in someone's food. And the use of feminine pronouns to refer to men is way past overdone. Additionally, the scene at the AIDS benefit at the Metropolitan Museum degenerates into slapstick. I thoroughly expected a food fight. Finally, at two different places in the novel the author inserts a page of quotations at the end of chapters (pages 108 and 165) that just seem to float. I have no idea what that's all about.<br /><br />MONKEY SUITS is far better than a lot of contemporary \\"gay\\" novels and certainly covers an area not usually written about. It's probably unfair to expect this novel to be as fantastic a story as PINS. Mr. Provenzano obviously is capable of writing very fine stories and most likely will do it again. I'll read them cheerfully.	2005-03-09

Tripp (The Homosexual Matrix) has written a controversial though scholarly treatise on the sexuality of our greatest president. The text is supported by voluminous footnotes and bibliography. There is a thoughtful introduction by the historian Jean Baker as well as three essays in the \\"Afterward\\" by Michael Burlingame, Michael Chesson and Alice Fennessey. Additionally the appendices contain relevant correspondence (the Speed letters as well as Lincoln's youthful attempt at doggerel.)<br /><br />A psychologist and associate of Alfred Kinsey, Tripp uses both the research gathered by Kinsey on human sexuality and factual information from Lincoln's life to arrive at his conclusions. He ascertained that Lincoln arrived at puberty very early, at age nine or ten, and from Kinsey's research, hypothesized that Lincoln would have been more likely to have been homosexual or bisexual because of that. On Kinsey's seven-point continuum, with zero being completely heterosexual and six exclusively homosexual, he opined that Lincoln would fall at five.<br /><br />Although there are other men mentioned-- Billy Greene, a lad who helped Lincoln with his grammar, often slept with him and said of the small cot they slept on that when one of them turned over the other had to do likewise-- Tripp discusses in detail three men that Lincoln may have had a romantic or sexual interest in. David Derickson was a captain in the Union Army, from a \\"socially prominent\\" family in Pennsylvania and nine years younger than Lincoln. For a time, when Mrs. Lincoln was away from the White House, this young man slept with Lincoln. Colonel Elmer Ellsworth was the \\"first casualty of the Civil War\\" and someone who had come to Lincoln's attention through a Col. John Cook. Lincoln invited him to study law at the Lincoln law office and later wrote letters to the Secretary of War recommending promotions for him. Ellsworth was killed in an effort to tear down a Confederate flag that waved across the Potomac in Alexandria that Lincoln could see from the White House. Upon learning of this young man's death, the President was distraught. The most compelling evidence, however-- though of course circumstantial-- comes from Lincoln's relationship with Joshua Speed. These two men shared the same bed for four years in Springfield, Illinois. When  Speed moved out and moved back to Kentucky, Lincoln had a nervous breakdown. Speed later married and had promised to write to Lincoln the following day to report on \\"how the wedding night had gone.\\" Lincoln responded as follows: \\"I opened the latter [letter] with intense anxiety and trepidation; so much, that although it turned out better than I expected, I have hardly yet, at the distance of ten hours, become calm.\\" It is Tripp's belief that these men had concerns over whether Speed would be able to perform on his wedding night and that this letter is the closest we have of a smoking gun. Speed and his wife never had children. There are other interesting facts: apparently Lincoln married Mary Todd because of societal pressures if he were to be a public figure. He only bought the marriage license on the day of the wedding. Mary later nixed the naming of their first child \\"Joshua\\" and never liked Speed. After Lincoln's death, when people were gathering all the information available about this martyred president, Speed gave some of Lincoln's letters to William Herndon  but only those of \\"any interest.\\" Finally, Speed is the only person that Lincoln ever signed his letters, \\"Yours forever.\\"<br /><br />There is more here-- about what a shrew Mary was as well as evidence that the story of Ann Rutledge as Lincoln's one tragic love is probably as mythical as George Washington's cutting down the cherry tree. For starters, she was engaged to someone else. Tripp discusses Lincoln's lack of conventional religious beliefs-- nowhere in his writings does he discuss a personal savior or mention Jesus. During the illness and death of his first born-- whatever Lincoln felt about marriage, he adored his children-- at no time did he appear to pray or seek divine intervention.<br /><br />Tripp winds up this certainly intriguing study in a final chapter labeled \\"On Lincoln's Sexuality with Extensions\\"  with comparisons of Lincoln to Churchill -- I didn't know heretofore that Churchill admitted to at least one homosexual involvement that he labeled \\"musical\\"-- and the World War II code-breaker Alan Turing-- a somewhat bizzare ending, but perhaps Tripp would have made revisions had he lived (he died before the publication of this book).<br /><br />If Tripp's conclusions are accurate-- we will never know, although other scholars believe that Lincoln was at least bisexual-- then ironies abound. Walt Whitman's tribute to Lincoln, the elegiac and beautiful \\"When Lilacs Last In The Dooryard Bloomed\\" takes on new meaning. (According to the footnotes from my college Norton anthology, lilacs in some cultures are symbolic of male love as I recall). And maybe we have the last laugh on that great heterosexual President Mr. Jefferson who, although he apparently had no qualms about impregnating his slave again and again, suggested that sodomites be castrated. Of course \\"jelly babies,\\" Lincoln's term for what happens when two men have sex, leave no DNA evidence, Mr. Jefferson.<br /><br />In the final analysis, it probably doesn't matter who slept with Lincoln.

US	51803143	RDXNTY2SJ5TIP	0679600175	161451712	The Sound and the Fury: The Corrected Text with Faulkner's Appendix (Modern Library 100 Best Novels)	Books	5	7	8	N	Y	Faulkner Endures	There had never been a novel like THE SOUND AND THE FURY (published in 1929) previously in American literature, and it's safe to say we probably will not see anything like it again. It has long been on every American Literature required reading list as well it should be. The professors got it right this time.<br /><br />The novel is about the unraveling of the Compson family in Mississippi in the early part of the 20th Century. Faulker abandoned the often-used linear plot for stream of consciousness narration--- as anyone who has ever heard of Mr. Faulkner of course knows. The novel is divided into four sections by dates: April Seventh, 1928, which belongs to Benjy, the youngest Compson child who is an idiot-- thus the allusion to Shakespeare in the title-- June Second, 1910, seen through the eyes of the suicidal brother Quentin; April Sixth, 1928, which is narrated by the obnoxious brother Jason; and the final section-- April Eighth, 1928, which is told by a third person narrator but belongs to the black servant Dilsey. Additionally in the Modern Library edition which I reread, there is the Appendix that Faulkner originally wrote for THE PORTABLE FAULKNER and published in 1946. It was the author's desire that this section become a part of the novel and that it be published as the first part of it. In this edition, however, it follows the novel. If people reading this masterpiece for the first time start with the Appendix, they will get an easier grasp of the convoluted plot.<br /><br />I read this novel for the first time in 1963 and several times more but not since about 1969 or 70 so I was interested in seeing if it is as good as I remember. It is. I can think of no family in literature, American or otherwise, where the characters are more real. By the time you are finished with them, when Luster drives Benjy around the town square, you know literally a myriad of details about even the most minor of characters. Is there anything more poignant in American literature than the grown Benjy's running around the fence at the golf course-- the Compsons sold that land in order that Quentin could go to Harvard and Candance could have a fancy wedding-- because he thinks the golfers are calling his beloved sister Caddy's name? Or Jason's refusing to let Caddy see her baby Quentin-- named after her dead brother-- after she had paid him a hundred dollars to let her see her child. Under cover of darkness Jason wraps the child in a raincoat, gets a driver to drive the hack with him and Quentin in it near where her mother is standing. In the words of Jason: \\"He was afraid to pass the stable, so we had to go the back way and I saw her standing on the corner under the light and I told Mink to drive close to the walk and when I said Go on, to give the team a bat. Then I took the raincoat off of her and held her to the window and Caddy saw her and sort of jumped forward. . . we went past her like a fire engine. . . I could see her running after us through the back window. . . When we turned the corner she was still running.\\" An argument could be made that with passages such as these, this novel should be called \\"An American Tragedy.\\"<br /><br />These characters act and talk the way most Southerners would in the early part of the last century, so anyone looking to be offended by the language, probably will be. The Compsons make derogatory comments about Blacks, Italians and Jews, in a word, any group of people not like them. On the other hand, Dilsey, the black servant of many years, holds this sad family together. In the words of Faulkner, she endured. As does this masterpiece.re than the grown Benjy's running around the fence at the golf course-- the Compsons sold that land in order that Quentin could go to Harvard and Candance could have a fancy wedding-- because he thinks the golfers are calling his beloved sister Caddy's name?

US	51803143	R2EWGJ0FL8BQ4M	096723820X	100520360	PINS	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Quite An Amazing Novel	In this quite amazing novel by Jim Provenzano, fifteen-year-old Joey Nicci and his family have just moved to Little Falls, New Jersey from Newark where he attended a private Catholic school. Now he is in public high school for the first time and a member of the wrestling team. It's the only sport he really cares about as he loves the body contact with other nearly naked boys. Joey also wrestles with his feelings for other boys and is in love with Dink Kohrs, another member of the team.<br /><br />The author deals with homophobia, both internalized and the other kind; gay bashing; the refusal of the church to acknowledge that some teenagers are different and to welcome them as they are-- in this instance the Catholic Church though unfortunately that organization doesn't have a monopoly on this attitude; the problems that parents and siblings have with gay family members-- Joey's younger brother Mike gets a shiner in school when another kid makes a derogatory comment about his brother and he defends Joey--  and finally the utter loneliness of being a teenager who is different. While awful, dark things happen in this novel that tear at your heart, its message is ultimately about hope and having the courage to do what is right. It could not have been written twenty-five years ago. Certainly no teenager could have told his wrestling coach then that he was gay.<br /><br />Mr. Provenzano writes evocative, sparse language: \\"In math, Joey spent way too much time looking ahead, waiting for him to turn around. When Dink didn't, he watched the back of his buzzcut turn a dozen colors, depending on the light; copper, straw, even gold. As his hair grew out, the hair on the nape of his neck began to curl like a question mark. In practice, Joey got to hug in close to it, to find answers.\\" These complex characters are alive-- all of them, even minor ones. The assistant coach Fiasole is completely fleshed out, and Joey's plumber dad is very believable and the most decent of fathers. There are wonderful human touches when Joey and his family visit their relatives in Newark, for instance, and a moving Christmas Day scene that pulses with life. You will care deeply about Joey, Dink, Anthony, Dino-- Joey's father-- et al.<br /><br />PINS (the title has a two-fold meaning) is as fine a coming-out novel as I can remember. But it is much more than that and certainly rises above any \\"gay\\" literature category it might get placed in. You will not be able to put this novel down for it's quite a page-turner and should be on every high school library shelf in this country.ful human touches when Joey and his family visit their relatives in Newark, for instance, and a moving Christmas Day scene that pulses with life.

This millenium edition is as good as any of the previous volumes. As always, there are terrific new writers-- some of them published for the first time here-- as well as the godfathers of gay lit. I suppose Edmund White and Jim Grimsley would fall into that category. The White and Grimsley selections I had read previously as they are chapters from novels. I remember thinking that White's novel THE MARRIED MAN was as good as anything he had ever written and that Grimsley's BOULEVARD wasn't up to his usual high standards. One exciting new writer here is J. G. Hayes, whose story \\"Regular Flattop\\" appeared in a collection of his short stories. His story is as up-to-date as 2005. The narrator, an eighteen-year-old South Boston lad, says about his father's coffin: \\"Dad's flowered, flagged (of course he's a veteran-- who do you think fights all these wars, we do) coffin does go down there. . .\\" This story resonates with life as the narrator kicks valiantly against the pricks to get away from his homophobic neighborhood. (You will care for him desperately.) \\"Quality Time\\" by Jim Provenzano is so good that I ordered his novel PINS from which this work is taken. He accomplishes in five pages what many writers cannot do in three or four hundred. He creates characters and situations that will break your heart. The narrator is a thirty-four-year old, divorced gay father spending some \\"quality time\\" with his son of fifteen, of whom of course he doesn't have custody: \\"And how is [his son's mother] a recovering alcoholic real estate divorcee. . . who still Suzanne Somers-tints her hair, any more normal than me, with my steady job, my dog, a home I rent, yes, but hey. At least I don't bleach my hair.\\" There are other stories here about gay parents and the usual selection of AIDS stories. \\"The Universe, Concealed\\" by Richard McCann and \\"The Third Person\\" by David Groff are particularly good.<br /><br />While there are no bad stories included here, some obviously are better than others.

S. Sadly only three of them are still alive, Edmund White, Andrew Holleran and Felice Picano. In this first rate anthology edited by David Bergman, Holleran and Picano are included. Holleran's \\"The Married Man\\" may be the best story here and is as good as anything he has written. His view of the world is not rose-colored as his characters rarely find much happiness in long term relationships. What is one to expect, however, from a writer who almost 25 years after the publication of his fine first novel DANCER FROM THE DANCE-- by anyone's standards a gay classic-- and almost as many years since the first reported AIDS cases in New York still refuses to use his real name in his writings.<br /><br />Mr. Bergman is to be commended for including new authors from many places outside New York who write about topics important to those of us in the red states. He has selected authors from Boston, Baltimore, San Francisco, Atlanta, Portland, Oregon, Florida and Maine. They truly are sons of the original Violet Quill writers. There aren't many Polo-clad Log Cabin Republicans here. Latinos, African Americans, blue collar workers, drag queens, teenagers and one white trash eighteen year who murders his mildly retarded sister are included.<br /><br />I particularly liked \\"Marriage\\" by Michael Bendzela who lives on a \\"farm in Maine.\\" Here an ordinary, not terribly attractive man leaves his wife and child for another guy. His wife teaches their child to hate her father who calls him \\"Barry, the Fairy.\\" The story is told from the viewpoints of Lydia, the mother of the wife, and Vic, the new male friend.

Unfortunately BLINK fits that category although Mr. Gladwell does make some interesting observations that fall into the sad, the fascinating and the obvious.<br /><br /> It is sad, for instance, that in the year 2005 we are still programmed by racial stereotypes when we blink. The shooting of Amadou Diallo is an unfortunate example. Police officers see a small black man on the street after midnight in a bad neighborhood in the Bronx. When they drive by him he does not run. Then he finally runs, attempting to get into his apartment and reaches for somethig that turns out to be a billfold. We know how this incident ended. Mr. Gladwell goes into great detail to explain all the mistakes that the polices officers made. For instance, if they had paid attention to his face they would have seen that he was frightened rather than dangerous. It is incredibly sad that in an experiment where black college students, when given twenty questions taken from the GRE, the standardized test for admission to graduate school, if asked to state their race on a pretest questionnaire, the number of questions they would get correct is cut in half, they are so programmed by negative racial stereotypes. (Congressman John Lewis has spoken out recently on racial profiling at airports.)<br /><br /> Some of Mr. Gladwell's facts are fascinating. Shoppers will pay more for the same amount of ice cream if it is packaged in a round rather than a rectangular container, for instance. Then there is the Pepsi v. Coke taste test. Fanatics swear they can tell the difference, and many drinkers can. However, if you do the triangle test, where you put the same cola in two glasses and the other in the third glass and ask a thousand samplers to tell you which two colas are the same, only about a third of the testers gets it right. That, according to the author, is not much better than chance, so we might as well guess.<br /><br /> Many of the author's observations and conclusions are obvious: what he calls the Warren Harding error-- that we often vote for attractive political candidates regardless of their qualifications; and that tall white men get promoted over black men, white women, black women and short white men; and that blinking or \\"thin slicing\\" is more accurate if it involves something we care about and are good at, i.e., we have experience in the area. He gives example after example of this: the psychologist who through years of study can predict from a short interview with a young couple- even if they are just discussing a pet-- if they will get a divorce down the road; the art critic who spotted an expensive fake immediately because she had studied ancient sculptures, the seasoned tennis pro who can predict when tennis players will miss their second serve.<br /><br /> The Seventeenth Century philosopher Pascal is way ahead of Mr. Gladwell since he said something similar a long time ago: chance favors the prepared mind., according to the author, is not much better than chance, so we might as well guess.

He gives here seven case studies of patients of his, all with serious illnesses, some whom he was able to help \\"heal,\\" one who lived for many years after seeing him, a young woman who died quickly of lung cancer and a final patient who did not follow Dr. Adams' advice and died much sooner than she should have.<br /><br />Each of these case studies is interesting. The format by its very nature invites the reader in. It doesn't hurt that Dr. Adams is a good writer and and even better doctor. His secret for success is so obvious that it shouldn't have to be stated; but unfortunately, it does: doctors should listen to their patients, communicate with them, and thus the physician and patient become partners in the healing process (healing by empathy).<br /><br />Almost everyone, if he or she lives long enough, will encounter the know-it-all physician who hears only his (or her) own voice. Mine was a cardiologist whom I saw for the first and last time five years ago. He waltzed into the examining room with an empty folder, not knowing that his nurse had just informed me that they had lost my records. I certainly could have forgiven him his misplacing a document. I could not accept however, his arrogance. He suggested that perhaps I should have an echocardiogram to which I responded: \\"I had one in your office about ten days ago and you read it and we discussed it.\\"<br /><br />Of the seven cases studies, the most interesting and poignant is that of Edith Tannenbaum (not her real name.) She suffered from severe asthma and for whatever reason -- Dr. Adams gives several possible answers, but we will never know the truth since the patient died all too soon-- would not do what the doctor prescribed. He suggests that it may have been because she was a holocaust survivor and thought she could  \\"survive anything.\\" Dr. Adams also mentions that this woman lived on a small income, was on Medicare and couldn't afford expensive medicine (although he offered her free samples). This caring physician-- and his warmth and kindness come through on every page-- has hit on something here, the utter disgrace of our lack of affordable health care for many Americans and underfunding for others. Because I had excellent insurance, I could fire the cardiologist I described above. Not everyone, however, has that luxury. The uninsured patient often does not have a choice of physicians.<br /><br />This book is so extremely relevant as it relates to the current national debate on caps for medical malpractice awards. While Dr. Adams didn't broach this touchy subject, I am totally convinced that there would be a drastic decline in lawsuits if more physicians followed his advice and \\"listened\\" to their patients.

Whether or not you like him-- and there isn't a lot to admire in this selfish young man-- he is as real as the people with whom you attended high school and as much a part of our culture as Willy Loman. Anyone discussing American literature in the last half of the 20th century has to deal with Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom, who obviously has a transparent name.<br /><br />When the novel opens in 1959, Rabbit is 26 and married to Janice Springer. They have a son Nelson who was born seven months after their marriage in 1956. Janice is now seven months pregnant and has a drinking problem. Rabbit demonstrates a kitchen gadget called the MagiPeel Peeler in five and dime stores. He got his nickname because of \\"the breadth of white face, the pallor of his blue irises, and a nervous flutter under his brief nose. . .\\" His big moment came in 1951 when he was the hottest thing basketball had ever seen in the town of Brewster, Pennsylvania. His life has beeen downhill since then. He tells Reverend Eccles, the Springer family's Episcopal minister, who befriends him after he leaves Janice: \\"I once did something right. I played first-rate basketball. I really did. And after you're first-rate at something, no matter what, it kind of takes the kick out of being second-rate.\\"<br /><br />There is a lot going on here that has to do with religion. Rabbitt spends a lot of time with the Springer family's minister Reverend Eccles of the Episcopal Church, getting advice and counsel, not always solicited. Rabbitt \\"believes\\" in a higher power although not much in his actions would support such a belief. Reverend Eccles does much good in his role as a minister although his heart isn't much in a lot of what he does. He is much better as a good shepherd on the golf course with Rabbit than from the Sunday morning pulpit. His wife is a nonbeliever. Rabbit's parents are severe Lutherans. There are references to religion on practically every page of this novel. Rabbit's mistress Ruth lives across the street from a church where Rabbit can watch the congregation coming to and from the church on Sunday mornings. So is this 1960 novel dated? Not when a large majority of Americans believe in literal angels and President George Bush is considered the leader of fundamentalist Christians in this country. Also, Rabbit and Janice in 1959, given their background, would have sought the advice of a minister, rather than a psychologist for help with their marital problems.<br /><br />No writer in America creates more complex, three dimensional characters than John Updike. We know hundreds of details about everyone in this novel. Ruth doesn't break the back of books when she reads them. Janice cannot cook weiners without their splitting open. Her mother-in-law has never cared for her. \\"I never liked that girl's eyes. They never met your face full-on.\\" Rabbit always folds his trousers carefully before having sex.  Minor characters are as richly developed as he is.<br /><br />We also never forget that Updike is a poet. (William Maxwell said he wouldn't read a novelist who didn't write poetic prose.) So we have \\"the wreckage of the Sunday paper\\". A waiter goes away \\"like a bridesmaid with his bouquet of unwanted silver.\\" There is the description of a \\"true\\" pink rhododendron in Mrs. Smith's garden where Rabbit works briefly. The Smiths had driven their Packard to New York City to get the plant off the boat and had put it in the back seat of their car \\"like a favorite aunt or some such thing.\\"<br /><br />Updike has written about a little piece of America. We know what products are in the grocery stores, what movies are playing, (Janice, for example, goes to see SOME LIKE IT HOT, what television programs people watch, and what cigarettes (Newports) they smoke.<br /><br />RABBIT RUN is as timely as it was in 1960. And, of course, it wasto be followed by three more novels, RABBIT REDUX, RABBIT IS RICH and RABBIT AT REST and a novella RABBIT REMEMBERED.UX, RABBIT IS RICH and RABBIT AT REST and a novella RABBIT REMEMBERED.	2005-01-23

He couldn't have been more wrong about someone like Helmut Newton. You recognize many of his photographs immediately. They are often of women (tall and svelte), they are erotic thought according to Newton not violent, they are often shot at night with available light, and the women are often nude or partially nude. As the photographer says, \\"I always want more skin.\\" And skin he got, even in portraits. What is fair for the goose works for the gander as well. This collection begins with self-portraits of Newton from 1934 to 1986, and he is nude is several of them in what certainly are not flattering photographs. Additionally, he photographs his wife June naked or near naked as well. (There is a marvelous portrait of her sitting at a table with food and wine in front of her. She is lighting a cigarette and exposing her breasts.) In \\"June Newton in the metro, Paris 1957\\" Newton's wife looks straight into the camera's lens. The woman wearing a fur seated next to her is even more interesting. Whether the photograph was posed or not, it has a wonderful candid feel to it. Newton obviously went to great lengths to stage some of these shots, however. The two portraits of Nastassia Kinski with the Marlene Deitrich doll are perfect examples. He apparently had favorite models as there are several photographs over a period of time of both Paloma Picasso and Charlotte Rampling. The environment is important in many of these portraits. These people, many of them celebrities, are often posed in elaborate, rich but relevant settings. For example, Mr. Newton would photograph American models only in front of American automobiles, never a French or German car. He would reserve those automobiles for French and German models.<br /><br />While most of these portraits are of celebrities and women, that is not always the case. There are fine portraits of unknown people and of men as well. For instance the portrait of \\"Female train engineers and a policewoman (left), Houston, Texas 1985\\" is as intriguing as anything in this book. Likewise, there are great photographs of Helmut Berger nude as well as Jack Nicholson, Prince Rainier and his friends et al.<br /><br />In addition to his own self-portraits, other photographs here certainly do not flatter their subject: an extreme closeup of Debra Winger, for instance. A few of them are in color: the sexy photograph of the singer Grace Jones and Dolph Lundgren and, of course, the color shot of the bejewelled Elizabeth Taylor up to her neck in a swimming pool with a parrot clutching her finger-- and we thought there was no new way to pose one of the most photographed women of all time. Some of these shots are beautifully lit. The portrait of Paloma Picasso and Rafael Sanchez Lopez is an equisite study of gradations of grays and has a beautiful formal feel to it.<br /><br />Mr. Newton, genius that he was, appears to be most down to earth. He shuns the idea of the photographer as artist as well as that the photographer can take a \\"psychological\\" portrait in the short time his subject is before him, a statement with which another great, Richard Avedon, would be in agreement. Newton understood that a camera should not be used as a \\"weapon to violate people.\\"<br /><br />There is no rule that says you have to like someone to appreciate his work. On the other hand, it doesn't interfere with your admiration either. Certainly that's true of Mr. Newton.s of unknown people and of men as well.

There is also a previously unpublished speech of Mr. Maxwell's. It is almost as if these writers read each other's notes since they express practically the same sentiments with only minor differences as they each see him through the prisms of their own experiences. They describe him as loving, generous, kind, gentle, modest, dignified, thoughtful, tremendously interested in the lives of other people, never glib. The superlatives go on and on. Born in Lincoln, Illinois, in 1908, Mr. Maxwell apparently had an idyllic childhood until he lost his mother to influenza during the horrible epidemic of 1918. That single event, which he wrote about again and again in both his fiction and other writings, shaped the rest of his life. According to Mr. Wilkinson, when Mr. Maxwell's mother died, he \\"gave up any belief in a god who protected human happiness. No sensible person can fail to be astonished by creation, he thought, but the idea of an old man watching over individual lives, a being who judged, kept track, and intervened, who favored one person over another, a figure from a story-- such a version had no meaning for him.\\" Ms. Davis-Goff says he believed in love, not in God, and that he wrote about the redeeming nature of love. Edward Hirsch in one of the most moving essays in the collection-- that made my eyes burn-- reminds us that Mr. Maxwell's religion was literature. He was happily married to his wife Emily for many years and died at the age of 92 only 8 days after her death. As an editor for THE NEW YORKER for forty years, Mr. Maxwell published many fine writers including Eudora Welty, John Cheever, John Hersey, John Updike, Vladimir Nabokov et al.<br /><br />These for the most part are beautiful essays-- John Updike's contribution is a poem-- written about a most beautiful man. Many of them should cause those of us who already adore William Maxwell to reread him or introduce him to a new generation of lovers of literature. One is reminded again of the difference between fine literature and popular fiction and why Updike and Tom Wolfe should never be discussed in the same paragraph.<br /><br />There are many wondrous sayings of Mr. Maxwell included here: that all he asked of life is the privilege of being able to read, that the the only part he would miss about dying was that he couldn't read Tolstoy, that either you retire from life or you advance to meet it, that when he first read Yeats' early poetry he \\"felt as if fairy dust had been sprinkled on him.\\" And you have to love someone who says that \\"every writer has a lifetime ration of three exclamation points.\\" In addition to the Maxwell quotations, many of the writers discuss at considerable length his works, particularly his novels. The most successful of the essayists, rather than analyze them, let Mr. Maxwell's works speak for themselves. Shirley Hazzard describes the last year of Mr. Maxwell's life, with his wife slowly dying of cancer, when he reread Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE. \\"He said, 'It is so comforting.' We rejoiced together over certain scenes, not 'discussing' or dissecting them but paying, simply, the tribute of our delight.\\" That's the best way to enjoy this extraordinary book.

In this scholarly, well-documented biography of nearly 500 pages, Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy tells you probably all you ever wanted to know about Alfred Kinsey; and he does it in a most reader-friendly fashion. From Kinsey's early life, growing up in the confines of a narrow Methodist family, to his marriage and tenure at Indiana University, to his studies of the gall wasp and his studies of the sexual behavior of males and females that changed forever the way we look at sex-- it's all here. Since Gathorne-Hardy has written the most recent biography of Kinsey (1999) he had the benefit of the research of previous biographers. He thus attempts to set the record straight concerning the 1997 Kinsey biography by James H. Jones, ALFRED KINSEY - A PUBLIC/PRIVATE LIFE. He maintains -- and goes to considerable lengths to prove it-- that Jones ceased to be an \\"objective researcher\\" but rather attacked Kinsey's private sexual behavior. He, in Gathorne-Hardy's words, \\"belongs to what one might call the Kenneth Starr school of biography.\\" Enough said.<br /><br />Kinsey, an extremely complicated individual, was an atheist (he rebelled vigorously against the strict religion of his father), a brilliant professor and scientist, mesmerizing lecturer, intolerant of what he considered shoddy work of other scientists, a loving husband and father, a \\"benevolent despot\\", a bisexual, a compassionate and humane person. (For years he corresponded with both prisoners and their families and often gave and/or lent them money.)<br /><br />Gathorne-Hardy maintains-- and offers considerable proof-- that while some of Kinsey's conclusions may have been erroneous, that no one since him has done the client interview, the heart of Kinsey's research, better than he and his staff did. For instance, he used a face-to-face interview with an elaborately coded chart he devised and did not ask the first question about sex until 20 minutes into the history. Interviewers never said, \\"have you ever\\" but rather \\"when did you first?\\" He abhorred random sampling and attempted whenever possible to take the histories of 100% of the members of a group so as to decrease the chances of error. Just as he went everywhere looking for new varieties of gall wasps, he and his group interviewed everyone they could: prostitutes, prisoners, castrates, the Yale Divinity School, amputees, rapists, lobotomy patients, professors, colleagues, students.<br /><br />Although Mr. Kinsey was denounced by many church leaders including Billy Graham-- after all Kinsey did most of his sex research in the 1940's-- he was revered and praised by many, and was a life line to many persons troubled about their sexuality. He received thousands of letters throughout his career from people hungry for advice and answers and attempted to respond to them all himself. He was incensed and saddened by most of the prisoners he interiewed serving sentences for \\"sex\\" crimes, since he believed that they should never have been in prison in the first place. After all, they were just doing what many other people were doing, or as he put it, everyone's sin is no one's sin. His statistics on the incidences of homosexuality in the general population, though often challenged, have never been successfully refuted even though his numbers may have been slightly exaggerated.<br /><br />Finally, while for the most part, Gathorne-Hardy tells the reader nothing without documentation, occasionally he makes a statement he cannot prove. For example, on page 32, he writes that Kinsey had difficulty expressing intimate personal feelings in public, but that \\"as often with people who have difficulty here, Kinsey loved small children nd was extremely good with them.\\" I'm not convinced that is an accurate statement and Mr. Gathorne-Hardy makes no attempt to offer up proof. Since this book was first published in England, the author offers explanations and illuminations to his British reader about some of the \\"Americanisms\\" here. He, for example, explains the semester system in American universities, defines our corn crop  as \\"maize,\\" tells the reader what \\"tea room\\" means and comments often on the \\"ghastly\\" weather, meaning of course our 100 degree-in-the-shade summers. They would be a far cry indeed from England's dark, damp Decembers.<br /><br />You may love Kinsey or you may hate him; but when you finish this biography, you'll feel that you've got at least a glimpse as to what the man was all about and what he accomplished-- no small feat for any biographer.ample, explains the semester system in American universities, defines our corn crop  as \\"maize,\\" tells the reader what \\"tea room\\" means and comments often on the \\"ghastly\\" weather, meaning of course our 100 degree-in-the-shade summers.

When the writer working on a booklet on West Hollywood's historically important buildings is murdered, Justice steps in to complete the assignment. Of course, never one to leave well enough alone, he gets intangled in that murder and subsequent murder as only he can. Justice is still renting from his beloved landlords, Maurice and Fred--Maurice takes a much larger role in this story than he has previously-- and he is still friends with Templeton, whose own private life takes an interesting twist here. Justice, too prozacked out for much else, delves into late night cybersex here, surfing the many porn sites, an endeavor that ultimately helps him with his murder investigation.<br /><br />Wilson has the geography of West Hollywood down; as we have grown to expect from him, there are references all around to live actors and writers-- and the usual tribute to Walter Mosley: \\"I continued on past Book Soup, where the latest Walter Mosley mystery was displayed in the window, with Tower Records just across the street.\\" Additionally he names a fictional street after the deceased gay writer Paul Monette, a fitting memorial to him.<br /><br />As always, Mr. Wilson comes across as the most decent of individuals, letting his characters speak poignantly and sometimes wisely about what living is all about. For example, here's Maurice on long relationships: \\"'Fred is the great gift of my life, Benjamin. That probably sounds funny, especially to those who see Fred as an old grump, a stick-in-the-mud who's not that much fun to be around at times. But I know him differently, you see. . . the way only two people who have devoted themselves to each other for most of a lifetime can. That's the beauty of growing old, you know. The chance to experience a special kind of love that only comes with time.'\\" I can name a half dozen writers of \\"serious\\" gay fiction who cannot hold a candle to this author. His novels always rise about the mystery novel formula to become serious, thoughtful and often very moving commentaries  on what it means to be gay in America.<br /><br />With the recent death of Joseph Hansen and the apparent retirement of Michael Nava I know of no writer of gay mysteries better than Mr. Wilson.with time.'\\" I can name a half dozen writers of \\"serious\\" gay fiction who cannot hold a candle to this author.

US	51803143	RF8GV2TARRFSS	1400042909	737768410	Villages	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	Updike As Good As Ever	On his twenty-first novel, John Updike shows that he is as good as he ever was. Here he has created another memorable protagonist in one Owen Mackenzie. Born in 1933-- he is roughly the age of the author-- Owen when we meet him is 70 and living with his second wife Julia. He has lived in a series of villages in his 70 years-- thus the reason for the title of the novel-- and has made his money in computers. If Harry Angstrom of the Rabbit novels had lived in the same village as Owen, they would have played golf together, or at the very least, Owen would have purchased an automobile from Harry. Like Rabbit, he is promiscuous, often acts badly, has mild, generic Protestant guilt for his many adulteries but in the end doesn't get off scot-free. There are many references to current events-- the death of JFK, etc.-- as the story is set firmly in the time in which the action takes place. Updike does great catalogues of events and people and makes cogent comments about life. Almost everyone is \\"marriageable\\" because nature has left a \\"tremendous margin for error\\" in marriages. On villages: \\"A village is woven of secrets, of truths better left unstated, of houses with less window than opaque wall.\\" And a village \\"is a hatchery, cherishing its smallest members.\\"<br /><br />There are dull paragraphs here-- at least to me-- all about computers, but you would be the loser if you didn't finish this novel. The last 50 or so pages make the effort more than worth it. Mr. Updike is a master storyteller, and nobody develops more alive characters than he. They may not always be particularly good, but they are always totally believable and all too often act like a lot of us do.	2005-01-03

Here is a really beautiful collection of art by Andy Warhol, many of the works apparently published for the first time. There are color photographs here of men's body parts-- chests, feet, butts, etc.-- a series of color portraits of drag queens labelled \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\", photographs of a few celebrities including Mick Jagger and the artist himself eating a banana. But most of the book is taken up by beautiful line drawings of men-- figures, faces, body parts, even the feet of Christopher Isherwood. Alan Cumming in right on the money in his foreward: \\"just a simple collection of lines on paper that magically produce a sense memory of something so visceral it can actually arouse.\\" And Mr. Warhol had this thing about body hair! This is a very erotic collection beautifully produced that you will go back to again and again.	2004-12-22

While I would not say that these stories bring \\"seconds of pleasure\\" to the reader, they certainly shock and awe. Mr. Labute with sparse language and crisp dialogue creates little stories that provoke us with their relentless look inside the human heart. He is the master of the shock effect. You are reading along, and suddenly he gives you a body blow. Although these stories all are about the conflict between heterosexual men and women, some of them go far beyond the cynical treatment of women by men as seen, for example, in \\"In The Company of Men,\\" Mr. Labute's best-known movie. Here an unnamed narrator recounts the making of a snuff video and muses on what will happen to the soon-to-be dead woman's child: \\"OK, we hear about the kid, that seems fine, few days from now she'll get passed on to welfare, adoption agency, who knows what.\\" Then a woman many years after the fact remembers providing her father with an alibi when he murdered her big sister. Finally a woman picks up her very drunk father or stepfather-- we aren't sure which-- in a bar and beds him. He is completely oblivious as to who she is.<br /><br />Before we send the author to the literary dumpster for his cynical, dark view of mankind-- particularly the man half of mankind, perhaps we should ask ourselves if he is accurate in his assessment. A day or so after I finished this little volume and was wondering if the human male could be so completely insensitive and ugly, I caught on television the prosecutor's opening statement in the trial of the actor Robert Blake, accused of murdering his wife. The comments about the victim she attributed to Mr. Blake could have come straight from the pages of this book. I rest my case.<br /><br />This one isn't \\"The Sound of Music\\" but it's a collection of short stories you won't soon forget.	2004-12-22

Carl Hiaasen in his latest novel does once again what he does so well: he takes a topic he cares about deeply-- in this instance the destruction of the Florida Everglades-- and weaves an outrageous tale around that subject. All the things you expect from him are here: delightfully smarmy bad guys who get what they deserve and then some; (in this instance Chaz Perrone and Red Hammernut) a supporting cast often beyond description-- in this case Tool, for example, a hairy giant of a man who has a rifle slug fired from a poacher lodged in a place in his body where the Florida sun doesn't shine and who collects homemade wooden crosses he confiscates from roadside memorials-- and wonderfully, wickedly funny language and situations. Try Joey's New Zealand shepherd brother Corbett Wheeler whose favorite sheep is named Celine. Then there's a miniature poodle with the name of Rumsfeld. Finally, when you finish this novel, you'll never feel the same about shamrocks again.<br /><br />As always with Mr. Hiaasen, the zany trip the reader takes is so full of laughs that the destination hardly matters.

Nadine Gordimer has brought together here 21 writers, including herself, who \\"tell tales\\"  without fee or royalty to help in the world fight against HIV/AIDS. As you would expect, most of these stories are terribly serious; they are about the awfulness of war, loss, sorrow and at least half of them are about death. These are not stories, however, about dying with AIDS; neither are they always about the death of people. (In fact, only one writer Margaret Atwood mentions the disease in an aside.) Jose Saramago's story is about the death of a centaur; the bulldog in Arthur Miller's tale probably dies from an overdose of chocolate, for example. About the only comic relief comes-- as we would expect-- from a very funny, brief story by Woody Allen called \\"The Rejecton\\" and is about a family's dilemma when their three-year old is rejected from a tony nursery school in Manhattan.  The writers are from many countries and nationalities. Some of my favorite writers and stories are here:  Gabriel Garcia Marquez (\\"Death Constant Beyond Love\\") who can create as much magic in ten pages as he does in novels hundreds of pages long; and Amos Oz's tale of a young Israeli whose parachute drifts into a power line (\\"The Way of The Wind\\"). Susan Sontag (The Letter Scene) makes profound observations about letter-writing while Christa Wolf in \\"Associations in Blue\\" shatters some of the positive notions most of us have about the color blue. For instance, she tells us that \\"the care packages that the Americans dropped in Afghanistan were blue and no longer yellow, so people could tell them apart from the yellow cluster bombs that they [the U. S.] were dropping at the same time.<br /><br />Ms. Gordimer reminds the reader that five of these writers, herself included, won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Additionally, I noticed a couple of Booker Prize winners as well. I do not know how Ms. Gordimer selected the writers she included. I would have expected, however, to see selections by Toni Morrison-- Ms. Morrison because she is black, a woman, a Nobel Prize winner herself and, most importantly, as good a living writer as there is; and Mr. White because he is gay, HIV positive, the winner of literary prizes as well, and has been writing stories about AIDS for nearly twenty years now.son-- Ms. Morrison because she is black, a woman, a Nobel Prize winner herself and, most importantly, as good a living writer as there is; and Mr. White because he is gay, HIV positive, the winner of literary prizes as well, and has been writing stories about AIDS for nearly twenty years now.	2004-12-13

Boyle in his latest novel writes about the famous or infamous-- depending on your point of view-- Alfred Kinsey of Indiana University and those people closest to him: his wife Mac and his three male assistants, their wives, and a movie photographer who joins the group late in Mr. Kinsey's career. Everyone has an opinion about Kinsey and his research and we all bring our own emotional and sexual baggage to this book. I suspect that many reviewers probably reveal more about themselves than they illuminate about Mr. Kinsey.<br /><br />We see Kinsey through the eyes of the narrator Milk, who initially takes Kinsey's class (Kinsey is known as \\"Prok\\" be his associates) in Marriage and the Family at Indiana University where in order to take said class, one had to be married or engaged. Milk became \\"engaged\\" and signed up with a coed with whom he had no relationship in order to get into the course. (The class sounded nothing like the marriage and the family course so popular on the Baptist campus where I attended collage more than 20 years later.)<br /><br />Boyle tells the reader in the \\"Author's Note\\" that \\"all characters and situations have been invented, with the exception of the historical figures of Alfred C. Kinsey and his wife, Clara Bracken (McMillen) Kinsey.\\" He also lists Kinsey's various biographers for his factual material about the Kinseys. What Boyle has created is a totally believable portrait of the controversial, bowtied Kinsey who becomes flesh and blood as seen through the eyes of his disciple Milk.

In Tom Wolfe's latest 676 pager-- almost as heavy as a six-pack of beer--- Charlotte Simmons, valedictorian of her high school class in the mountain town of Sparta, North Carolina, enrolls in prestigious Dupont University and gets a quick crash course in college life. Dupont students are interested in three things: sex, suds and sports. Student athletes are a group unto themselves. Treated as gods on campus, they know all the easy courses to take to get a passing grade. (Can there really be at any major university in this country an advanced French class in the French novel where the students, mostly jocks, read the books in translation?) Fraternity types spend most of their time getting drunk and/or laid. The nerdy brainy types are paid to write term papers for the athletes. All the trademarks of a Wolfe novel are here: easy-to-read language, repetitive words and phrases-- you may get a little tired of the F word-- not so subtle satire and several stories that come together.<br /><br />I always enjoy Mr. Wolfe's wit even if I disagree with his conclusions. In this book he gives a rather large list of people from various major universities around the country with whom he consulted for his information on what goes on in higher education today. While standing in line the other day to get this tome autographed by the author, I heard recent university graduates around me say that Mr. Wolfe's picture of university life is accurate. If that is indeed the case, we may have lost our way. So much cynicism at such an early age. It worked better with district attorneys and rich businessmen in the writer's two previous novels. Charlotte is not a particularly likeable character; at times she's pathetic. Ironically the basketball star Jojo becomes the most sympathetic character for me. He finally figures out that it's okay to use his brain as well as his pumped up body.	2004-12-11

Some of the groups the writer discusses are broken down as to color, size, flowers for cutting, climbers, and what he calls \\"Flowers That Hop Around.\\" He also lists several books on growing flowers in his \\"reference library\\", equipment and the 100 seed list in the end of the book.<br /><br />This book is obviously not a treatise on growing flowers. You'll need to refer to other books unless you have a lot of experience. (I was feeling a bit overwhelmed by all this information until I'm told that Mr. Fenton has a fulltime gardener.) Additionally, there are no color photographs here of the various varieties. Mr. Fenton's list is highly subjective. He tells us why he eliminates some flowers and includes others; there are no cottage pinks, for example, because they all have been either bought or given to him as plants.<br /><br />What I was hoping for in this book I didn't find-- that the writer might somehow tie up poetry and flowers. He certainly didn't have to, but he does make interesting asides on occasion. He opines that one can tell from his photographs that Robert Mapplethorpe \\"loved flowers\\" but that we wouldn't have expected him to like plants. And in discussing false bishop's weed, Mr. Fenton intimates that all bishops are false!<br /><br />You have to tip your hat to a poet who gardens. This little book would make an ideal and unusual gift for your favorite gardener.	2004-12-08

His first mystery opens with the protagonist's release from Federal Prison Camp/Baypoint, a home away from home for white collar types-- not exactly what we would expect for the makings of a sympathetic character. We soon learn, however, that Zack Chasteen was wrongly convicted and indeed is a most likeable mystery solver. He dresses well, eats and drinks even better and is in general a laid-back dude, even when he has to kill to protect himself. This  very well-written novel has an intricate, byzantine plot. Things are not as they seem here. While I anticipated some of the events, Mr. Morris and Zack were usually miles ahead of me. I would call this novel \\"slick\\", and that is not a pejorative term. It goes down as easily as a fine piece of Key lime pie. Actually, I wish Mr. Morris had included recipes for all that wondrously exotic food he discusses.<br /><br />A friend and fellow-reader thinks the writer may have been too hard on Lesbians. (I don't want to give away the plot.) I didn't think so. Perhaps Mr. Morris can give the religious right a hard time next time.<br /><br />I look forward to reading Mr. Morris' next novel.	2004-12-08

When I read this poignant book, I wondered as to how some people seem to get it-- in this instance Gail Johnson who crossed class and race lines to care for Nkosi Johnson, the young Zulu boy who died at the age of 12 with AIDS-- and others either cannot or do not want to get it-- here I refer to President Mbeki of South Africa, Mandella's sucessor, who believes that an \\"omnipotent apparatus\\" is using AIDS as an instrument of genocide against black Africans. These instruments are pharmaceutical companies, scientists, physicians, medical researchers and Western goverments.<br /><br />The author of this book, Jim Wooten of ABC News, says that he is writing \\"about the relationship between a black child who never grew up and a white woman who never gave up. It has neither a happy ending nor even a promising beginning, for the child had no choice and no chance, and the woman knew all along what she was up against.\\" Like the current U. S. deficit, the numbers of AIDS cases in Africa, or anywhere else for that matter, have very little impact on us. They are so large and impersonal. But the story of the courageous young Nkosi puts a face on the pandemic and in a small way brings it home to all of us. As the youngster said so eloquently: \\"We are all the same.\\"<br /><br />Both Nkosi and his adopted mother-- she actually did not adopt him legally and, according to Wooten, made every effort to see that he maintained a relationship with his birth family-- were heroes of the first order. (I kept wishing as I read this book in one setting that Wooten had provided the reader with a photograph of Ms. Johnson. I wanted to put a face on Nkosi's adopted \\"angel\\" mother.\\") It is sad to learn that Nelson Mandela, certainly one of the world's heroes, did not speak out against AIDS as he could have while he was president because he was uncomfortable discussing sex. I would nominate the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, as an unusual hero too who did use his position to speak out about AIDS and when faced with opposition by the Catholic archbishop of the use of condoms by Uganda citizens to curb the spread of AIDS simply said to the archbishop: \\"'Your Eminence, shut up!'\\" According to the president, that's precisely what the archbishop did. He shut up. Finally Wooten is to be commended for breaking the rules of journalism and becoming emotionally involved as he fell under the spell of this young boy. If you read this fine story-- and certainly this is a great book for this season-- you will not soon forget Mr. Wooten's lying down beside the dying boy to say his own goodbyes.<br /><br />This remarkable story of courage and love will warm your heart.d with opposition by the Catholic archbishop of the use of condoms by Uganda citizens to curb the spread of AIDS simply said to the archbishop: \\"'Your Eminence, shut up!'\\" According to the president, that's precisely what the archbishop did.

US	51803143	RW7G1BAU148WK	1582345082	570121918	The Line of Beauty	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	Hollinghurst's Best Novel	Alan Hollinghurst's latest novel, winner of the Booker Prize, is a beautifully written, richly nuanced work and certainly the best of his four novels. The action covers four years during the Margaret Thatcher years from 1983 to 1987 in the lives of one Nick Guest, aptly named, a recent Oxford graduate and in love with all things beautiful, sex, wealth and all the things that money makes happen; the Fedden family: Gerald, a conservative Member of Parliament, his wife Rachel, his children Toby, Nick's friend, and Catherine; Leo; Wani and a host of other lesser characters. The Prime Minister herself makes a brief appearance.<br /><br />This novel obviously is a tribute to Henry James. Nick is doing graduate studies on the style of James. There are referenes, some quite funny, all through the novel to the writer and to many of his novels. There is a clever scene, for example, when Nick and Wani do a line of coke (beauty?) on a book of James criticism. In a passage reminiscent of James' indirectness on the death of Poe, (\\"The extremity of personal absence had just overtaken him\\") Nick wonders how James would have described a certain character's healthy member: \\"If he [James] had fingered so archly at beards and baldness, the fine paired saliences of his own appearance. . . Nick said, 'Oh, it was. . . of a dimension.'\\" Just as in James' novels-- Ezra Pound is quoted as saying THE SPOILS OF POYNTON was a novel about furniture-- style and class are important to these characters. The sitting arrangements at fancy dinners mean everything. This novel, however, is more more than a brittle look at money and manners among the wealthy. It is ultimately about betrayal, sickness and death, the cynicism associated with political ambition and the tragedy of wrong choices. Nick is ultimately brought low; his tragic flaw is that he chooses the wrong people for his extended family.<br /><br />A master of language, Hollinghurst can describe a character or create a mood with one or two words: A piano tuner is a cardiganed sadist. Wani is simply a \\"closeted cokehead\\". A woman has blonde hair in expensive confusion. Nick's calves and thighs ache with \\"guilty vigour\\". Rachel's dark hair has \\"candid streaks of grey\\". The author also writes paragraph after paragraph of beautiful, insightful prose. Take the example of Nick as a gay man not being honest with his parents, whom he isn't very kind to: \\"And Nick thought, really the poor old things, they do as well as they can; but for a minute he almost blamed them for not knowing he was going to Europe with Wani, and for making him tell them a plan so heavy with hidden meaning. It wasn't their fault that they didn't know-- Nick couldn't tell them things, and so everything he said and did took on the nature of a surprise, big or little but somehow never wholly benign, since they were aftershocks of the original surprise, that he was, as his mother said, a whatsit.\\" Finally, even though there have been dozens of novels written about AIDS and we who are living have long since gotten past the hopelessness of the early years of the epidemic, Hollinghurst is able to recreate the utter horror we experienced on hearing of the first deaths of our friends and loved ones.<br /><br />This is a fine novel indeed. It's a shame that in many bookstores, at least in the United States, it will be stocked in the \\"gay\\" section or \\"alternative lifestyles\\", whatever that means. Of course Ian McEwan's novels are never found in the \\"straight novel\\" section; neither is THE SON ALSO RISES to be found on the \\"Caucasian male novel\\" shelf.

In this book of desserts low in fat, sugar and calories Ms. Koch gives the reader information on diabetes, fats, ingredients, and what she calls \\"low sugar baking secrets\\" in addition to the actual recipes. These include hot and cold beverages, muffins, coffeecakes, breakfast breads, cookies, pies, crisps, cobblers, puddings and specialty desserts, sauces and toppings, \\"cakes for any occasion\\" and finally cheesecakes. In a chapter entitled \\"Cheesecakes to Die For\\" she includes 9 recipes including Chocolate Cheesecake, Pumpkin Streusel Cheesecake and Key Lime Cheesecake.<br /><br />Wanting to bake a cheesecake for a relative with type 2 diabetes, I tried the \\"Heavenly Cheesecake\\" on page 102. I was sure it would be inedible, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The cheesecake has a very nice texture, cuts beautifully and convinces you it is the real thing. The secret to Ms. Koch's success seems to be (1) a mixture of low-fat and no-fat cheeses rather than only no-fat cheese and (2)unlike other sweeteners, Splenda has no bitter aftertaste. At any rate, this is one fine dessert. Additionally you get about 200 calories in one piece of cheesecake rather than the usual 600. As the author says, she wants to create desserts to die for, not from. While I can only attest to this one recipe, I suspect the others are just as good.<br /><br />This book is a valuable edition to healthy cookbooks.	2004-11-19

Janette Turner Hospital has written fourteen short stories here, seven of which have been previously published in another short story collection, all of which appear to  have been published in literary magazines or journals. The stories are set all the way from Australia to the Southern United States. The characters are wildly different in their problems and dilemmas; but to a person, they are engaging and alive. It's difficult to select a \\"best of\\" as there are no bad stories here. In the first one, \\"The Ocean of Brisbane\\", Brian-- who appears in several other stories-- is a successful scientist ashamed of his uneducated mother. His treatment of her will break your heart. One of my favorites is \\"South of Loss\\", where two lonely souls connect when a woman whose car breaks down on a back road in South Carolina meets an auto mechanic. They comfort each other from their own sense of loss. Although many of these characters are those whose \\"worlds of possibilities\\" are small, they continue to kick against the pricks.<br /><br />As always, Ms. Hospital is wonderful with language-- from the photographer who is \\"not guilty as charged\\" but \\"framed\\"--to one Australian character's thoughts on Americans: \\"They are a curious people, Americans, Beth thinks, though it is easy to like them. They consider it natural to be liked, so natural that you can feel the suck of their expectations when they push open the door. . .\\" Finally in the story \\"Litany For The Homeland\\" Hospital waxes lyrical as she describes her love for Australia: \\"Homeland is where the senses steer by instinct when the reins are let go. It is always accessible in that small space between sleeping and waking. . . Wherever I am, I live in Queensland. I know to what brown country and to what wet rainforest my homing thoughts will fly in the moment between living and dying. . .\\" Does writing get better than this?

In this, her fifth book, a young woman named Charade Ryan from the Australian rainforest travels to Canada, then to Boston in search of her English father Nicholas Truman. Her earthy mother, Bea Ryan, mother of ten children by as many men, at first offers little help in this young woman's quest as she advises her daughter to \\"let sleeping dogs lie.\\" But as we have come to expect by now, in Ms. Hospital's stories things are seldom as they seem.<br /><br />This writer's trademarks are all here: (1) the many references to other literary works and quotations from other writers: Captain Cook, Robert Oppenheimer, Primo Levi, Jorge Luis Borges, Claudine Vegh's I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE: INTERVIEWS WITH CHILDREN OF THE HOLOCAUST and finally THE BOOK OF THE THOUSAND NIGHTS AND ONE NIGHT-- it becomes apparent that Charade is a modern day Scheherazade as she tells parts of her story night after night to the older MIT physics professor Koenig in an effort to make their affair last. (2) As always, Ms. Hospital writes about serious subjects: memory-- that the process of recollection is imperfect at best-- the Holocaust, a child's continuing effort to know her parents. (3) Of course, this author teases us with her prose-- \\"What quantumleaped me?\\"-- and (4) makes profound statements about relationships: \\". . . a marriage has begun to end long before one partner moves out.\\" \\"On the other hand. . . a marriage certainly does not end with the final decree of the divorce.\\" And finally: \\"It is impossible to live with someone who is deeply and dangerously unhappy.

The narrator of this novel, whose name is Philip Roth, lives in Newark with his family consisting of his father, an insurance salesman; his mother who has been president of the local PTA; his older brother Sandy; and a cousin Alvin, who from time to time lives with this Newark family. They are a fairly contented family, spending most of their time around other Jewish families in their tightly knit neighborhood until the aviation hero Charles Lindbergh, as the Republican candidate, beats Roosevelt for president in 1940. Both Lindbergh and his wife's views about the \\"Jewish Problem\\" are now well documented although when I was growing up in the rural South, what I always heard about this man was that he had flown solo across the Atlantic and that the Lindberghs' young son had been cruelly kidnapped and murdered.<br /><br />A lesser writer might have made this novel into a diatribe against anti-Semitism but not Mr. Roth. Some of his Jewish characters are not very good people, or at the very least misquided while decent Gentiles abound as well. Aunt Evelyn would certainly fall into the misquided and silly category. On the other hand, Mr. Cucuzza, the Italian who moves his family into the apartment below the Roths, is a good man who responds to tragedy the way good people do, as well as Mr. Mawhinney, the Christian from Kentucky who rescues the young Seldon after his mother has been killed. The narrator's parents are both strong and heroic. There is a particularly moving scene in the chapter entitled \\"Loudmouth Jew\\" when the father refuses to be cowed by anti-Semitic treatment in both a hotel and a cafeteria.<br /><br />What Mr. Roth does so well is convey the utter fear that existed in the Jewish community, particularly as seen through the eyes of a nine-year-old boy. And the plot takes interesting twists as well.<br /><br />At the end of the story, Mr. Roth gives a \\"true chronology\\" of the major figures he writes about here so the reader can check out information on Lindbergh, Roosevelt, Henry Ford, Walter Winchell and others. Mr. Roth is more than kind to Franklin Roosevelt, both in the novel, where he is portrayed as a peerless hero, and in the historical information Roth selects to include about Mr. Roosevelt. He omits the sad history of the S. S. St. Louis that left Hamburg, Germany on May 13, 1939, carrying 937 Europeans, many of them Jews, who were fleeing Nazi Persecution.

We would expect someone with the talents of this photographer to produce beautiful portraits, and that he did. Mr. Greenfield-Sanders, using a large format camera, shot each model clothed and nude, against a neutral background, in practical identical poses.  What you probably would not have thought, however-- and Simon Dumenco is quite right when he says so in his foreward-- that after you get over your initial viewing of the full-frontals, you are drawn to the faces of the photographer's subjects. Additionally, you might be surprised that such diverse people as Gore Vidal-- who wrote the introduction-- Salman Rushsdie, John Waters, A. M. Homes, JT Leroy, John Malkovich, Lou Reed, Faye Wattleton et al. have provided thoughtful essays on the subject of pornography.<br /><br />We are not told how the photographer came up with these 30 individuals-- there are both women and men here, straight and gay, or at least the stars of gay movies-- although one would assume, given the nature of these folks' professions, that no one in the business would be camera shy. Both Ron Jeremy--according to his bio he is listed in GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS for having appeared in the most porno movies, over 1,750 adult films-- and Jenna Jameson, who graces the front cover of this volume and whose memoir recently made the NEW YORK TIMES best seller list, are included.<br /><br />The essays cover a wide range of topics from AIDS to the availability of porn on the internet. Mr. Vidal attempts to tell us why pornorgaphy exists-- getting into both religion and the ruling class-- while Rushdie discusses the rise of pornography in the East, opining that \\"If Western pornography is a symptom of Western decadence, [as the Eastern establishment would say] then Eastern pornography is a side effect of Eastern repressions.\\" He also reminds the reader that in today's Iran, distribution of pornography is a crime that carries the death penalty.<br /><br />This is a quite serious book with beautiful photographs beautifully reproduced and one of the most unusual you'll likely to see.serious book with beautiful photographs beautifully reproduced and one of the most unusual you'll likely to see.	2004-10-10

The novel is set in a small town in Massachusetts around 1990 (though written in 1983)when Edward's wife is planning their fiftieth wedding anniversary party. She will invite of course, in addition to friends and former colleagues, their three children; Victoria, who is in a mental institution; Jason, a therapist in New York and Emily, a concert violinist living in England, along with her eight year old son Adam, whom her father Edward has never seen and didn't know existed until three years ago when Emily gave her first concert in the United States.<br /><br />The novel is all about families: how easily we as family members hurt each other; what happens when we don't forgive one other; the awfulness of hypocrisy; how we can redeem ourselves; that we can never really know our parents; that though we travel far away, we never get far from where we came; the roads not taken, lost opportunities; and, finally, that we never stop wanting to be loved by our family.<br /><br />The plot has many unexpected twists, and there are many beautifully written, powerful scenes.

There are three main characters here, the rich and spoiled, handsome and very promiscuous Michael-- the towels in his fashionable bathroom are labeled \\"His\\" and \\"Next\\"-- there there is Robert, his ordinary best friend, an underpaid copywriter, who describes himself as a recovering Catholic, and their lesbian friend Monette. These three set out to find the killer of Michael's \\"boyfriend\\" although he doesn't get done in until the novel is well over half over.<br /><br />There are lots of laughs here, nothing to get upset about, a great way to spend an evening in bed reading, or you can take this one to the beach as well. But amid all these buffed, perfect bodies and endless parties, Mr. Stukas does remind us of one important truth: drag queens-- not the gym bunnies or the leather crowd-- stood up to the police riots at Stonewall. A lesson we should not forget is that these brave \\"ladies\\" made it possible for groups like, say, the Log Cabin Republicans to do whatever it is that they do.	2004-09-19

In Evan Bachner's very imformative introduction to this extraordinary book, he tells of how a photograph of a soldier from World War II caught his eye in the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1997. The photographer was someone he had never heard of before, Horace Bristol. Mr. Bachner in his dogged research discovered that the great photographer Edward J. Steichen had created the Naval Aviation Photographic Unit and then had assembled professional photographers in addition to Mr. Bristol who had made World War II photographs and ultimately printed over 15,000 images by the end of the war. Now seven years after Mr. Bachner's initial discovery, we have this stunning collection of over 150 beautifully composed, exposed and printed photographs by no less than the publisher of fine art books, Harry N. Abrams, Inc.<br /><br />Although there are a few photos of sailors working, for the most part these men are truly \\"at ease\\" as they sun themselves, exercise, swim, read, play games, write letters, horse around or just relax. Had Walt Whitman been alive during this era, he would have written paens to these men and their \\"love of comrades.\\" There is a wonderful innocence about these photographs of men among friends. And we can all be glad that because of the order of President Truman a little later, that no photographer would ever again shoot black sailors in segregated sleeping quarters. (There are a few photographs here of black sailors relaxing together and only one shot of a black sailor and white sailor together.)<br /><br />Surely this book will be on everyone's short list of best photography books of 2004. It's destined to become a classic.	2004-09-18

I've never read a better story about a gay teenager. The narrator is Billy Connors, a sophomore in high school in the Bronx. He volunteers to work in the Eugene McCarthy presidential campaign because (1) he does not want to go to Vietnam and McCarthy was the peace candidate and (2) he has a crush on Al, the college student in charge of the local volunteer office. The novel is set in 1968 around the time when Robert Kennedy was killed, a horrible time in our nation's history. Though small in size, this novel-- novella, long short story, whatever-- will knock you off your feet. (I read it straight through.) Billy is a fantastic character, grappling with all the craziness associated with being a teenager as well as dealing-- very well-- with his emerging feelings for other boys. THE BOYS ON THE ROCK ought to be required reading in high school for all students, both straight and gay.<br /><br />No lesser writers than Edmund White, Richard Price and Russell Banks praised this book. Mr. Banks' prophecy has come true when he predicted that this novel \\"may well turn out to be a classic.\\"<br /><br />Sadly, this novel will have to be Mr. Fox's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD since he is deceased, having been stricken down in the first wave of AIDS cases.	2004-09-13

This certainly would not have been the case with this fine, beautifullly written first novel by Janette Turner Hospital. It certainly is as good as her other two later novels I have already read. David and Juliet, a young married couple from Ontario, along with their two children, travel to southern India where David, a college professor, will do research. They are not quite prepared for the India they discover. Ms. Hospital writes with the sensitivity and succinctness of a poet. The novel abounds in metaphoric language that works-- the image of Krishna and Radha on the swing of carved ivory keeps recurring. And this passage, for example: \\"It seemed that all understanding passed between them, the knowledge of all women who braid their own years into shackles, who weave with love and resentment the silken cages of their lives.\\" The writer creates characters we will not soon forget: the overworldly beautiful  and tragic Yashoda \\". . .like a woman on an ivory swing -- translucent, a trick of the light, an artist's fantasy\\" and the boy Prabhakaran, whom we Westerners would love to tear away from his native land and take him home with us. This novel is all about what happens when two cultures clash, do Westerners have a right to impose their values on other cultures, and if so, how much, and are we ready to suffer the consequences? Do we from the West have all the answers or even the right ones?<br /><br />This would have been splendid as an only novel. How fortunate for us as readers that it was not, that Ms. Hospital continues to write one fine novel after another.	2004-09-13

One of his poems seared itself into my brain and heart and I have never forgotten it: \\"On the Death of Friends in Childhood.\\"<br /><br />  We shall not ever meet them bearded in heaven,<br />  Nor sunning themselves among the bald of hell;<br />  If anywhere, in the deserted schoolyard at twilight,<br />  Forming a ring, perhaps, or joining hands<br />  In games whose very names we have forgotten.<br />  Come, memory, let us seek them there in the shadows.<br /><br />Poetry doesn't get much better than this. Yet in this quite wonderful collection, Mr. Justice includes poem after poem that both engage the intellect and wrap themselves around our hearts. There is a beautiful poem about the death of his grandmother entitled \\"First Death\\", and a poem about growing old, \\"Men at Forty\\": Men at forty/Learn to close softly/The doors to rooms they will not be/Coming back to. \\"On an Anniversary\\" is a beautiful love poem written (I assume) to his wife of thirty years: \\"Time (but as with a glove)/Lightly touches you, my love.\\"<br /><br />The list goes on and on. Unlike many modern poets, Mr. Justice writes in many styles besides the free verse that has had a kudzu effect on a lot of poetry-- sonnets, villanelles, sestinas, etc.<br /><br />I mourn Mr. Justice's recent death but take comfort in knowing that he remains very much alive through his marvelous verse.	2004-09-11

Game: Male Models Revealed	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Not Much To Get Excited About Here	Supposedly the photographer shot these men after they had worked by day as models for fashion ads. They are thus apparently supposed to be being themselves, unposed, etc. If George Bernard Shaw were alive today and saw these boys, I'm not sure that he would say that it's a shame that youth is wasted on young people. With a couple of exceptions there's not a single photograph here that I would even think about purchasing and certainly not hanging on a wall. The lighting is garish, the composition is bad and many of the shots are out of focus. (Deliberately I hope.)<br /><br />Brad Gooch gushes in his foreward. Yes, the photographs remind you of Larry Clark and Nan Goldin; but these two photographers did it much better and got there first. And how Gooch can call Lalli a \\"gay Helmut Newton\\" is beyond me. Paul Cadmus in his afterward makes a lot more sense when he says that these are boys he would not want to know, himself. I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />To quote a line from Robert Browning, suddenly \\"I feel chilly and grown old\\" when I view these photographs.	2004-09-11

In this book of beautiful photographs he captures that halcyon time in San Francisco, never to be repeated, after Stonewall and before the assassination of Harvey Milk and then the plague of AIDS. As the title so aptly says, it was a time of hope, but also of innocent abandon, of a newly won sexual and political freedom when anything was possible. There are photographs here of Harvey Milk, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the young Sal Mineo in a garish 70's coat and wide tie. There are also many photos here of Gay Pride parades, photos of people getting ready for the parade and having a great time afterwards. While there is much laughter here, we cannot forget that many of these individuals, including Barton and his lover Larry Lara, whom he photographed extensively, in a few years would be sick and dying but taking care of their own, showing strength and courage that made us all proud to be gay Americans.<br /><br />This remains one of my favorite books of photography. If you do not know about it, you owe it to yourself to find a copy somewhere. It's a beautiful, sad book and should always remain in print.	2004-09-08

Historians will be kind to the gentle but passsionate Bill Moyers and will rank him as one of our best journalists, both for his skill and integrity. Here he has collected some of his speeches and commentaries--they range in time from the 1970's to the present--about some of the things he cares about deeply: democracy, politics corrupted by money, the costs of war, the possibility of people with diverse religions living in harmony, integrity in journalism. Mr. Moyers also writes about growing up in the Southwest and gets personal about friendship, growing old and dying. He is right-- though not to the right-- on a lot of things here. His essay on why he has worn the flag in his label is one that someone needed to write. He is totally correcct. How about his description of Baptists when he compares them to jalapeno peppers? \\". . .one or two make for a tasty dish, but a whole bunch of them together in one place brings tears to your eyes.\\" And that slaveholder Thomas Jefferson wrote it right but \\"lived it wrong.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Moyers also includes an insightful chapter on President Johnson, reminding us of all the good things he did for this country-- Medicare, Medicaid, federal aid to education, the right of blacks to citizenship-- before he slipped into the great hole called the Vietnam War. I was so touched by Mr. Moyers' chapter \\"Where The Jackrabbits Were\\", that I read it twice. When the author was born in 1934 his father was earning $2 a day working on the construction of a highway from the Texas border to Oklahoma City. He describes the difficulties that the Moyers family and their neighbors had with little money and no doctors. Moyers makes it clear that he is not trying to idealize his past. About his father Moyers writes: \\". . .a seventy-year old man who has buried four of his five children doesn't extol the good old days. . .\\" For me, that's the most poignant sentence in the entire book. Is there any question why Mr. Moyers is unhappy about the way our country is currently going?<br /><br />If you have ever caught Mr. Moyers on PBS-- and if you haven't, you probably won't be reading this-- you can hear his voice with that accent he never completely lost coming through, one of the pleasures of reading this book. I often find books of this nature repetitious and too long. That is not the case here.

This latest by Ms. Hospital may not be as good as OYSTER, but it certainly compares well with any of the works of her contemporaries. Obviously influenced by the events of September 11, 2001-- as well as other cases of international terrorism-- the author has written an intriguing tale of espionage that will keep you reading. An Air France flight 64 was highjacked in September 1987. The hijackers let the 40 children leave the plane but all the adults on the flight perished-- or did they? Ms. Hospital introduces a number of characters, all of them connected in some way with the doomed flight and thus connected to each other: the surviving children, other relatives, friends, professionals et al. The time sequence begins in 2000, 13 years after the hijacking, and goes back and forth to before the 1987 date. I kept thinking, while reading this page-turner, that the writer had the movies in mind when she wrote this-- and that is not a criticism of the novel. I had difficulty casting the movie although surely Harrison Ford should have some role, if he is not too old to play Lowell Hawthorne. Ashley Judd might work as the character Lou, since they are both Southerners. If it's well directed and has the right actors, the movie will be a winner.<br /><br />Ms. Hospital writes about thorny subjects: how far a democratic nation (U. S.) will go or what measures its goverment will take in order to destroy an enemy terrorist cell? Or how much \\"collateral damage\\" is too much? But she writes of hopeful themes as well: in spite of the universality of governmental coverups, that the truth will endure. And finally \\"the dead never stop telling us stories\\"-- and in a moving scene near the end of the novel as they sit in a cemetery, the character Lou tells another character Samantha that \\"the dead never leave us.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Hospital divides her novel into eight books. Each section begins with pertinent quotations from other writers: Shakespeare, Camus, Lewis Carroll, Daniel Defoe et al. With the exception of an ending that I found a tad contrived and really not necessary, this novel is as good as a psychological thriller gets.ception of an ending that I found a tad contrived and really not necessary, this novel is as good as a psychological thriller gets.	2004-08-30

(There seems to be two new books each week now on what the Bush administration is doing wrong.) Ms. Dowd's is a collection of her columns from the NEW YORK TIMES. What this volume has going for it is that (1) you get the full impact of all that is wrong with Mr. Bush, rather than reading a short column; (2) the writer is remarkably consistent in the quality of her writing, no easy feat since she was under the pressure of producing excellent columns often; (3) Ms. Dowd takes no political prisoners. With the sometime exception of the first President Bush, any public figure is fair game. (I would remind Ms. Dowd that the president she calls \\"gracious\\" gave the country Dan Quayle.) Nevertheless, you have to love a writer who describes Anthonin Scalia as Archie Bunker is a high-backed chair, mentions Franklin Graham and Elmer Gantry in the same paragraph, suggests that if the hawks surrounding the second Bush never served in Vietnam, at least they could have read about it and says of Donald Rumsfeld, \\"a blackbelt at Washington infighting.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Dowd can be deliciously funny-- her column on having \\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\\" make the current president over is a hoot--but she can be as serious as a D-Day memorial service. And moving-- her tribute to Michael Kelly is poignant beyond description-- and deadly. She mentions the flag-draped coffins that Bush won't be associated with (we're almost to 1,000 now) and the one flag-draped coffin he embraced wholeheartedly, that of the late President Reagan, the president with whom he wants to be compared.<br /><br />President Bush nicknamed Dowd \\"The Cobra.\\" A more appropriate name would have been Cassandra but Bush wouldn't get the allusion ( practically everyone who writes about him mentions that he doesn't read) but her editors at the NEW YORK TIMES should have since the most amazing thing about this collection is that this writer was dead right about all the things the Bush administration did wrong about Iraq and expressed her opinions early and often. Her prophecies all came true. Too bad her editors didn't take her columns to heart as they and other major newspapers gave the Bush a free ride on his decision to go to Iraq in spite of lack of support from the international community and-- as everyone and his brother has testified to now-- no hard evidence of weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />The author says in her moving tribute to Michael Kelly that \\"the boy could write.\\" Ditto Ms. Dowd.er was dead right about all the things the Bush administration did wrong about Iraq and expressed her opinions early and often.

Near the end of the last century in a small Australian opal mining town named Outer Maroo, so obscure that it is not found on any map, Oyster, a mysterious religious cult figure, mesmerizes almost everyone in the community. (Only Susannah Rover, the teacher, and Charles Given of the Living Word Church and a few others were not drawn to him.) Obsessed with the idea that something of cosmic proportions will happen in 2000, many of the inhabitants of this little town at first buy into the sayings of this stranger, dressed all in white and with \\"limpid blue opalescent\\" eyes. He is a most persuasive speaker: for example, \\"I will make you a fisher of opal. . .if you follow me.\\" Later two strangers arrive in the village, looking for a son and daughter, who have mysteriously disappeared and who (they believe) were under the spell of Oyster. While Ms. Hospital's gifts as a storyteller are magnificent, it's hard to know if she was influenced by say Jim Jones and Jonestown in 1978 when 913 of his followers apparently committed suicide or David Koresh and the Branch Davidians in 1993 when 80 or more people perished. There are certainly parallels to be drawn as Ms. Hospital's subject obviously is timely. We had Heaven's Gate in 1997 when Applewhite and over 30 of his followers committed mass suicides. A cult figure in Georgia was recently convicted of sex crimes against children, and other religious crazy groups-- I personally know of one in Florida-- pop up like dandelions in the spring. This book says so much about religious extremists, sexual depravity in the name of God, mob psychology,  and the nature of evil-- and hope too but only in lower case letters. Ms. Hospital, however, is somewhere way past Joseph Conrad and Nathaniel Hawthorne, just to name two writers obsesssed with the darkness of the human heart.<br /><br />The author tells a wonderful tale and is as good as any writer I can think of at building suspense and dropping clues along the way as the story builds to a devastating climax. Although her prose is dense and chock-full of Australian words and phrases, she is not a difficult read. She does beautiful and totally accurate things with words, making a verb out \\"trampoline\\", for example.

S. today, and Garrison Keillor addresses the problem as he sees it. This usually gentle and always brilliant humorist-- the literary historians will compare him to Mark Twain, another great Midwesterner-- is troubled by what is going on. Simply put, the right wing angry Republicans have taken over, and if not stopped, will run this great country into the ground. I'll state my two criticisms about the book first. Mr. Keillor is not always focused here; therefore,we aren't always sure where he is taking us. Secondly, at places he is quite strident. Certainly he has that right, but his humor is usually so beautifully understated so as to make you smile. Parts of this book will not amuse you at all; and I blame the current Republicans for stifling that wonderful quality in Garrison. We will use his quote from the Presidential candidate John F. Kennedy on Dante, however, to apply to Mr. Keillor himself: \\". . .divine justice weighs the sins of the cold-blooded and the sins of the warm-hearted on different scales.\\" (I had always heard that wondrous quotation attributed to FDR.)<br /><br />Contrary to what Thomas Wolfe said, this writer can go home again and did. He now resides in St. Paul, is on the wrong side of sixty and has just had some heart problems repaired at Mayo Clinic. He opines that the medical community learned this procedure in part from government money that Democratic administrations funded. He lists a whole series of social programs and situations that are the direct work of Democrats or that Democrats sponsored. Some of them are the GI Bill, land grant colleges-- of which he is a product-- the Civil Rights movement, equal rights for women, gay rights, the Peace Corps, Medicare, protection of the environment, abortion rights-- Keillor points out that because of corporate America, that little kids grow up in red-light districts and that nine-year-old girls dress like streetwalkers; thus, we shouldn't be surpised that they get pregnant at 13-- the acceptance of mental illness, better police officers and tolerance in general. This is quite a list; Mr. Keillor may overstate the accomplishments of the Democrats a tad, but he is basically correct, I think.<br /><br />Mr. Keillor waxes nostalgic and remembers a whole list of things that I remember too: public school where everybody brought everybody else a cheap valentine on February 14; where he killed a chicken for his mother to cook; washed with Lava soap; \\"parenting\\" was not a verb and a \\"green Jell-O salad with mandarin oranges, miniature marshmallows, walnuts and Miracle Whip is by God good enough for anybody.\\"<br /><br />There are lots of quotable gems throughout this small volume. Keillor makes no apology for being a liberal and doesn't think the current Republicans have a monopoly on Christianity. He says that 95% of people in the arts are Democrats because the Democratic party has always been inclusive; universal health care is a fundamental right for all Americans; he became a Democrat because he was eager and hopeful, not because he was angry; the current president does not read; and other people count, even broken ones.<br /><br />Finally, Mr. Keillor says that liberalism is the politics of kindness. \\"It is all about opening the castle and letting the air in.\\" Thank you, sir, for throwing open the doors and letting the sunshine and air and a whiff of hope in.\\" All we need if a whiff to survive.rpised that they get pregnant at 13-- the acceptance of mental illness, better police officers and tolerance in general.

A recent high school graduate, he must have been around 18 when the first photographs were shot. Over this time frame Brian changes, both in his body and facial features. Though by no means a gym bunny, he apparently worked out, developing more muscle, and also got heavy into body piercing and tattoos as well. He tried out a lot of different hair styles, growing longer hair, then getting bleached and buzzed. Some of the pictures are quite wonderful, many of them are very erotic, some are funny and a couple of them approach being silly. But the model always comes across as being alive and seems to be having a great time. This is obviously a collaboration. He gives as much to these photo sessions as the photographer does.<br /><br />Mr. Massengill manages to shoot dozens of photos of this young man with practically no repetition, no small accomplishment. The artist says in the introduction to this book that he would like to photograph Brian for many years to come. It would be interesting to see what look he finally settles on and how both his body and face change with age. We can only hope that life with all its unknowns doesn't take the great zest for living that Brian has that is so obvious in these photos.	2004-08-18

One of the many gifts of President Bill Clinton was introducing me-- and I suspect many other white readers- to the great mystery writer Walter Mosley. Early in his presidency on a vacation to Martha's Vineyard, the president laden down with books, including Mosley's then latest, as he left a local bookstore, was accosted by the media. (That Mr. Clinton read Mosley comes as no surprise since Toni Morrison has described him as the first black president in America.) So the press wanted to know what Mr. Clinton read for pleasure-- and what a pleasure reading Mr. Mosley is, particularly when he writes of the adventures of the indefatigable Easy Rawlins. He returns here at the time of the Watts race riots in '65 where he is recruited by a detective from the infamous LAPD to help solve the murder of a young black woman, Little Scarlet, who may have ben killed by a white man. Mr. Mosley weaves a complex tapestry here with many characters of all colors, some new of course, and many returning from previous novels, Mouse, Bonnie, Feather, Jesus et al.<br /><br />As always, Mosley through Rawlings makes cogent statements about race in America. He tackles unflinchingly both self-hatred in the black community and the hierarchy of color there. In the hands of a lesser writer this story would be little more than an angry diatribe about the treatment of blacks by whites in this country; but that does not happen. Mr. Mosley creates black characters who are less than perfect and white ones-- including one from the LAPD-- who are actually decent people. As the writer's fans know already, his prose is as succinct as a grocery list but beautifully descriptive. Rawlins describes his clan as \\"my beautiful patchwork family.\\" A cook prepares eggs \\"just an instant past running.\\" A young black man already has the \\"slouching shoulders of someone who has been defeated by life.\\" I particularly liked Easy's definition of a real cook as someone who can cook up a complete meal in five minute with whatever is available. And when Easy takes an alias, as he often does, he selects names of deceased friends-- because their names are easy to remember and to keep them alive, a beautiful concept and a loving tribute.<br /><br />The author has never written a better novel.

US	51803143	R3VQKLAS1JUCOR	1893329135	141211926	Ode to Lata	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	Ode To Dhalla	I cannot remember when I've read a first novel any better than this one. The writer has a great flair for words and writes beautiful, evocative prose. He has created a unique protagonist in Ali, an East Indian who grew up in Kenya and has recently moved to Los Angeles. He works in a bank during the day and spends many of his nights looking for Mr. Right or obsessing because he cannot find him. There is a bit of Ali in a lot of us. While much of the action takes place in the gay bars, sex clubs and baths of Los Angeles, the territory sounds familiar and has a universal ring to it. Besides having to deal with his own inner demons of self-worth, Ali must contend with a visit from his Indian mother upset about his &quot;life style&quot; and the fact that since he is an only child, she will never have grandchildren. (Only a saint or fool would let his mother visit for three months.) When Ali's mother isn't trying emotional blackmail on him, she's watching American television. Two of her favorite programs are &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; and Jerry Springer. Mr. Dhalla discusses with honesty the problems of race and color in his own East Indian community as well as other communities. As is too often the case, those with lighter skin get treated better. Ari must face his own racism when he meets and falls for Nelson who is black. And the hustler Billy hates black people as well. (Does all this sound too familiar?)<br /><br /> If you are looking for a politically correct gay novel where the protagonist meets and &quot;marries&quot; a gay accountant, proceeds to buy a house with him, complete with a fence and a dog, this novel isn't for you. If you want to read about a character who in all his failings is as real as people you know, some of whom you care about, then this one's for you. In the first lines of this novel, Ali says that there are only two things worth living for: passion and truth. He says he has experienced a lot of passion but the truth eludes him. Mr. Dhalla has written a novel full of both passion and truth.Mr. Dhalla has written a novel full of both passion and truth.	2004-08-06

Here he writes of his father's (Dale, Sr.) leaving an abusive mother and alcoholic father at the age of 13 to live on a dairy farm in upstate New York with his father's loving brother, his Uncle Wallace, and his soon-to-be wife Bessie. There he learns for the first time in his life what it's like to be surrounded by adult love. Peck's prose is descriptive and full of similes and metaphors, my one concern with this book. There is never any indication that Peck, Sr. was particularly gifted in language. While many of the beautiful passages obviously come from the narrator, occasionally there are words coming from Peck, Sr. that belong to Peck, Junior. For example: &quot;As he walks, the ladies (cows) behind him low in anticipation of his arrival. Their calls make him think that he is a finger running a glissando the length of a giant keyboard. . .&quot; I do not believe these words would have come from someone who grew up to learn the business of trenchless sewer line replacement. This is certainly a minor blemish though of a really fine book.<br /><br /> Dale Peck, Junior introduces himself to the reader in the last few pages of the narrative when he and his father return to upstate New York in 2001-- Peck, Senior now lives in Kansas and Junior is a writer in New York City-- to attend a family reunion in what is a very warm finale to this story.	2004-08-05

I first heard of this novel when someone asked Margaret Atwood in a radio interview whom she was reading. Is it any wonder that the author of that brilliant novel THE HANDMAID'S TALE named this one? Set sometime in the near future, this novel is about a world overrun by American big business. The &quot;World Map of United States Federated Economic Blocs&quot; covers all of the Western Hemisphere, a large portion of Europe, parts of Africa and all of Australia. Workers take for their last names that of the corporations for which they work so we have Hack Nike, Theodore Pepsi, Violet ExxonMobil and Jennifer Government et al. (You will hoot when your learn deep into the novel the significance of the barcode tattoo under Jennifer's left eye.) Her daughter Kate attends a Mattel School and carries a Barbie lunchbox. This caustic satire gets started when Hack Nike, through a contract he enters into-- without reading-- with upper management, must murder someone buying a new Nike brand of shoes in order to enhance sales. He goes to the Police who, through a misunderstanding, think he wants them to wipe out the customer and subcontract the job to the NRA.<br /><br /> Mr. Barry's aim is as accurate and deadly as that of his character Billy Bechtel and his pen far more poisonous than the &quot;chemicals&quot; Hack releases in a McDonald's for-- in the words of Hack-- advertising to children, raping the environment and forcing out small business. The author's opinions -- or at least the comments of his characters-- about business and goverment sound eerily familiar: the military has a healthy &quot;disrespect&quot; for democracy, the Government takes months to organize a bake sale and also uses fifteen people to do a task that three people would perform in the private sector.<br /><br /> Mr. Barry is right good at phrase-making or turning an existing phrase upside down. Hack Nike's &quot;chemical weapons attack&quot; on McDonald's will cost the industry twenty million in &quot;brand&quot; damage; and John Nike's dream of big corporations without governmental interference will open up a &quot;brave new commercial&quot; world. John Nike sees in the Nike building in L. A. a &quot;small, shabby cube farm&quot; of low-level managers. Nothing is off-limits to this writer, including his native Australia where the main office of McDonald's is located in Sydney and Hack attacks a store in Melbourne. Here most of the customers had cellphones &quot;pressed&quot; to their ears. The near future is already here!<br /><br /> This novel cries out to be made into a movie directed by Tim Robbins with Susan Sarandon in the role of Jennifer Government.age; and John Nike's dream of big corporations without governmental interference will open up a &quot;brave new commercial&quot; world.

Mr. Quinn tells a good tale. In fact, he is a better storyteller than a writer although his prose is certainly adequate. He gets the Southern experience right-- with sweet tea, Pepsi and Aqua Velva; and rows are &quot;hard to hoe.&quot; A toboggan is a cap worn in winter, something that few people outside the South have ever heard about; and coffee keeps kids from getting &quot;wormy.&quot; Mr. Quinn is dead right-- no pun intended-- in the funeral home scene. Rural Southerners have traditionally been as attracted to funerals as truckers to country music. The author writes about surfing too with complete authority; Matt's surfing accident seems totally believable.<br /><br /> Although I find this story a tad too rosy-- is it possible that two adult men can live together with two male children under the age of 13 in a small coastal area of North Carolina in 1983 and not be run out of the county? Maybe not. I don't know. Certainly Mr. Quinn has a perfect right to see life in any color he chooses and doesn't have to have the dark world view of say a Jim Grimsley or Andrew Holleran. I can see a teenaged gay boy coming across this novel and being blown away. He would find the sex scenes, as Matt would say &quot;totally awesome&quot; and would take comfort in knowing that there is gay life outside the major Eastern cities and that people like him live in the small towns of the &quot;red states.&quot; That alone makes this novel worth reading and a welcomed addition to &quot;coming out&quot; stories.	2004-08-01

I ordered this book sight unseen after viewing some of Mr. Spada's photographs on a website. I didn't know that the author of celebrity biographies was also a photographer-- and a very good one as evidenced in this collection of black and white men. Mr. Spada has a fine sense of composition and understands the importance of lighting to enhance the human body. Many of these photographs were shot using available light, which often makes for beautifully flattering studies.<br /><br /> Some of these photographs work better than others. I like in particular: (1) The torso on page 5. The stripes from the towel repeated in the shadows from the vertical blinds work very well to produce a beautiful photograph. (2) It's difficult to make a bad photograph using a mirror. Check out the portrait on page 14. (3) The man with a shaved head shot from the rear (page 24) exudes strength. (4) The photo on page 39 is quite sexy. (5) &quot;Paul in my studio, Brookline, July 1998&quot;, (page 41) is artfully composed with good use of the black background. I would not have included the shots of the man holding tulips (pp. 76-77). Everybody and his brother have done that one already. These photos add nothing to the pictures already out there.<br /><br /> Finally, Mr. Spada is to be commended for selecting several young men who look as if they might have a life outside a gym. They have attractive bodies by God rather than by Gold. Few photographers doing nudes these days have the courage to do such a thing.	2004-07-31

The reasons given by the Center and Mr. Phillips, as you would imagine, differ widely. I had heard such notables as Joseph Ellis (AMERICAN SPHINX) and Doris Kearns Goodwin (NO ORDINARY TIMES) speak there though before either writer had run into academic trouble over their footnotes or lack thereof-- certainly Mr. Phillips cannot be guilty of such an infraction since each chapter is this extremely well documented book has literally dozens of footnotes. I had to see for myself what all the controversy was about.<br /><br />Mr. Phillips has written a very scholarly and dense book. You may learn more about four generations of the Bush family than you wanted to; at least I did. Once a Republican who worked for Nixon, the author describes himself now as having been turned into an independent by the first President Bush. He makes many startling observations: that since the 1980's the U. S. has replaced France as the major nation with the biggest gap between the rich and the poor. He also gives convincing evidence that the Bush camp outsmarted the Democrats in the Florida recount and that the Gore people did all the wrong things, becoming trapped in what Phillips calls legal sideshows. He piles fact on top of fact as to why Gore should have won the recount if anybody is listening.<br /><br />Mr. Phillips discusses the Bush connection with Saudi Arabia, the influence of both Texas politics and religious fundamentalism (scary) on the second President Bush, describing Texas as the Southern Baptist buckle on the Bible Belt and the buckle on the gun belt, Bush's ties with Enron and Cheney's and Haliburton. It's all laid out for the reader. The writer is nothing is not thorough. And he can be funny, saying that if presidental family connections were a theme park, Bush World would be a sight to behold with Mideast banks tied to the CIA along side of Florida S&L's, etc. (pp. 134-135.) But then Mr. Phillips concludes that the subject is not a laughing matter.<br /><br />Anyone serious about studying or interested in the Bush presidencies will have to consult this well-researched though sometimes tedious tome.Mr. Phillips concludes that the subject is not a laughing matter. <br /> <br />Anyone serious about studying or interested in the Bush presidencies will have to consult this well-researched though sometimes tedious tome.  <br />	2004-07-24

So begins this rollicking novel about the cut-throat world of business. Along the way Scat meets the beautiful 6-- her parents named her zero and changed her name every year on her birthday, but they both died just after renaming her \\"6\\"-- there's also the aptly named \\"Sneaky Pete\\" and the beautifullly blonde @. I suppose we could probably spell her name \\"Ambers Anne\\" because of her lemony looks.<br />In keeping with the tone of this novel, the chapters are marked by bar codes; and marketing case studies are interspersed throughout this tale: for example, mktg case study #1: mktg perfume - TRIPLE YOUR PRICE. THIS GIVES CUSTOMERS THE IMPRESSION OF GREAT QUALITY. HELPS PROFITS TOO.<br />Mr. Barry, who has taught marketing at \\"two major universities\\" in Australia, convinces me that he understands the ugly but funny world he writes about.

The definition of a Southern gay writer and who therefore makes the cut seems to have gotten even milkier here with the likes of Felice Picano making an appearance. According to Mr. Quinn Mr. Picano comes from New York and now lives in California-- and I suppose he has changed planes in Atlanta if that makes him a Southern writer-- in any event, he's included.<br />There are a lot of things Southern here-- bourbon, iced tea, pickup trucks, country music, kudzu. The quality of the stories is uneven, which is not unusual for an anthology. Some of my favorites include Jeff Mann's \\"Emory and Henry\\" which is a fine account of bigotry and prejudice among a group of  high school biology honors students in a small college in Virginia in 1976. The story rings true and is filled with irony as a Jewish kid leads the assault against the gay narrator. I also liked Mr. Quinn's \\"The Kitchen Table\\" in which  a \\"straight\\" carpenter with a grown son must come to terms with his feelings about the gay man whose home he is restoring. But the best was saved for last. Having gotten totally engulfed in all the kudzu in \\"Pueraria lobata\\", I almost skipped the final story \\"Everybody Loves the Musee d'Orsay\\" by Marshall Moore. That would have been my loss. About the conflict between a gay son and his overbearing, controlling mother, this fantastic story is not to be missed.	2004-07-19

I always enjoy listening to Mr. Sedaris, usually when I'm driving and catch him on some public radio station. Here he has a new book with a terribly clever title as well as a hooty photograph of a mannequin on the jacket cover.  Mr. Sedaris then proceeds to dress his family. We can only hope that he is being hyperbolic in some of his outrageous descriptions of his parents and siblings or he may not get invited back to a Thanksgiving dinner any time soon. If one of his sisters indeed is actually named \\"Tiffany\\", then of course she'll never make it in a world outside of a trailer park. Surely no heterosexual brother, even on his worst day, can be as big a pig as Sedaris' brother Paul who makes sure that his bride-to-be's dogs are a part of his wedding. She comes down the aisle in silence-- the DJ is stuck in traffic so there is no Wagner or Cat Stevens or whoever to serenade her-- followed by a pack of dogs.<br />Mr. Sedaris can go from the humorous to the achingly painful in short order. His description of being moved out of his parents' home by his father at the age of twenty-two, not because he was a bum but because he was gay, will break your heart--as it did his mother's. His gentle reveries of his life with his lover Henry and their patterns of dullness will make you smile. Sedaris' father's wanting him to punch out a school bully when the writer spends his weekends making banana nut muffins instead of excelling the \\"art of hand-to-hand combat\\" will amuse you. His description of his playing strip poker at a slumber party for him and his friends in the sixth grade is hilarious.<br />What is not funny-- not funny at all-- is Mr. Sedaris' account of his visit to the home of Anne Frank in Amsterdam. He opines that he has found the perfect apartment and would love to move in and redecorate. \\"The entire building would have been impractical. . . but the part where Anne Frank and her family had lived. . . was exactly the right size and adorable. . .\\" The writer couldn't be more wrong. When I visited this home, I was taken aback at how small the Frank family's hiding quarters were and how so many people survived there for so long.<br />I have no trouble with gallows humor-- if that's what Mr. Sedaris is striving for in the Anne Frank fiasco-- but he falls flat on his face here in what is otherwise for the most part an amusing book. To compare him to Mark Twain and Nathanael West, as someone in \\"The New Yorker\\" does, is a bit of a stretch too. On the other hand some commentator recently compared Johnny Cash to Mark Twain as well. Perhaps I'm the one who is out of step here.be more wrong.

They are Trevor Watson, Tony Butcher, Za-hazzanani and Toni Catany. It should be pointed out, I suppose, that Za-hazzanani is a woman photographer, not that it makes any difference that I can ascertain in the quality of her work. My biggest objection here is that there is a tremendous sameness to the shots. For example, I would be hard put to tell the difference between Watson and Butcher's work if Butcher didn't just do black males. Many of the photographs are framed and composed nicely and beautifully printed; but the models could be made of marble. There's hardly a live one in the bunch. Mr. Catany's photos are sepia in color and grainy. At least you know which pictures are his, but I find his images no more interesting than those by the three other photographers.<br />Finally many of these photographs consist only of body parts with an inordinate number of close-up shots of someone's rear. There are very few images here of complete bodies-- feet, hands, legs-- the head bone connected to the neck bone-- as the old Spiritual goes. If only these bones could rise again.<br />There are many fine books of photography of male nudes on the market that will excite and inspire you. This one sadly is not one of them.

When I first read this little volume through, my first reaction was that this was not much ado about even less. Then upon reflection-- and after I called a couple of friends and read some of my favorite little ditties to them-- the book began to grow on me. Now when I see Mr. Bush stumping-- if that's what he is doing-- or giving sound bites, Mr. Trillin's doggerel comes to mind and makes me smile. For example, when Kerry announced that Edwards would be his running mate in November, the current occupant of the White House, when asked to compare Mr. Edwards with Mr. Cheney, responded quicker than A Texas tornado, \\"Dick Cheney can be President.\\" But Mr. Trillin calls Mr. Cheney \\"Nanny Dick\\" and concludes in another little poem that the current VP only holds his head at an angle when he is lying-- which is all of the time. Wolfowitz and his crowd, those who were hell-bent on getting the U. S. into war, are called \\"Sissy Hawks.\\" After all most of them didn't wear the uniform. (Weekend soldiers don't count.) Condoleezza Rice's name is always followed with \\"Mushroom Cloud\\" in parentheses. While Mr. Trillin takes most of his shots-- and he has tremendously good aim-- at Bush and his administration, the Democrats get zapped a few times too. One of the saddest poems in this entire volume is one for the Democrats: \\"The Loyal Opposition.\\" \\"The Senate Democrats sat mum/Like doves afraid to coo./So history will soon record/This war as their war too.\\" Then there's \\"A Silver-Lining View of George Bush's Not Attending Military Funerals, Lest He Become Associated with Bad News\\": At least there's no Bush eulogy/On why they had to die./It's better that they're laid to rest/Without another lie.\\" (Notice that the titles are often practically as long as the poems, themselves.)<br />Since 1990, Mr. Trillin apparently has written a poem each week on the news. The last one in this slender volume is dated April 19, 2004. Some of his efforts don't work very well as poems, hardly rhyming, something that these sorts of poems must do in order to be successful.

In the January 2004 issue of &quot;Blue&quot;, the Australian magazine where Paul Freeman is decribed as the magazine's &quot;most featured&quot; photographer, the artist says that he has always wanted to keep some link with classical art. &quot;Sort of like a meat pie inside the Sistine Chapel.&quot; Most of these models Michelangelo would have loved, and they to a man are meat pies. There is not a wimp or effeminate-- and it's okay if one is-- man in this collection of over 200 photographs. These men are rugged, hairy, beefy, muscular, tattooed, pierced, sweaty, wet and muddy. Some of them are a bit stylized and wearing gladiator garb. Many of them are at the beach-- Bondi perhaps--there are some beautiful portraits here. And no model has his genitalia airbrushed.<br />In his brief introduction Mr. Freeman says that as a youngster he was taken by the image of the suffering Saint Sebastian (check out the portrait on page 174 of Garth Elliot 2) and that present day influences are Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts (speaking of airbrushing photographs). I think many of his models look more like some of the work of Jim French as well as Caravaggio-- whom he acknowledges as an inspiration-- and Michelangelo.<br />Many of these men are photographed as many as 6, 7 or 8 times so you will probably get to see a lot of your favorites. Where to begin-- the man on page 11 (beautiful shadows), the outrageous Grant Perry (page 24 and 7 more photos), the hairy barrel chested Igor Praporshchikov on page 55, Black Angel No. 4 on page 73, Mat Obelisk on pages 76 and 77-- perfect exposure and lighting--the Gladiator on page 103 that, thank goodness, shows up again and again-- Gladiator 4 on page 126-- this is an unusal and most flattering pose-- the portrait of Ryan Kwanten on page 154, Kane 1 and 1 (pages 158 and 159-- the list goes on and on. The only photographs I don't care for are the ones with a snake  wrapped around the model. Perhaps it's the Garden of Eden story that turns most of us off to these kinds of photographs. Richard Avedon did the snake photographs better years ago anyway.<br />If the test for a book of photographs is whether or not you return to it again and again, then BONDI CLASSIC gets an A+.

On a most ordinary day Stephen walks with his three-year-old daughter Kate to a supermarket. At the checkout lane there is no no other customer behind him. As he checks out, he turns briefly from his daughter, looks around and she is gone. What has to be one of the worst nightmares that any parent can possibly conceive of happens to Stephen and his wife Julie: their beautiful daughter has been kidnapped. With that calamity, Ian McEwan begins another fine novel.<br />The trademarks we have come to expect from McEwan are here: something horrendous happens to people through no fault of their own, and their lives are irrevocably and forever changed. In McEwan's own words, a \\"malevolent intervention\\" occurs. McEwan asks hard questions about the very nature of existence and relationships and life. He makes profound philosophical observations; and as usual, even though his prose is dense, the reader races through his story.<br />McEwan delves into the meaning of childhood-- children always live in the present-- memory-- you remember what you remember; you forget what suits you-- the relativity of time: time is dependent on the speed of the observer; time slows down during a panic.As always, McEwan's language is both precise and concise. And I believe he coins a couple of verbs too: \\"first-naming\\" and Brylcreemed.\\"<br />Without giving away the ending of this incredible novel, I can say that this is the most positive McEwan I've read, and I've read my way through most of his works. Usually the action takes place someplace beyond despair. Here we have the joy of starting over. As Emily Dickinson would say, \\"love is all we know of love.

US	51803143	R1Z4S5Z75ACCI3	1560231610	530438717	Rebel Yell: Stories by Contemporary Southern Gay Authors (Gay Men's Fiction)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Some Good Stories Here	Jay Quinn publishes here 14 stories by, in his words, \\"contemporary Southern gay authors.\\" He doesn't clarify whether or not the writers, in order to be included in this anthology, had to be born in the South or just live there. It is impossible to tell from the brief bios of the writers if some of them meet either of these requirements, if indeed, those are the requirements for inclusion. Some of these stories are not very good, some of them are so-so-- since being polite is an innate Southern characteristic-- I won't name the stories I didn't care for-- and two or three of them are first class. Almost all the writers-- regardless of their abilities-- discuss what makes Southerners different and point out the uniqueness of Southern gays. For example, there is an emphasis on family, a greater amount of prejudice against anyone different, an identification with masculine men; and Southern gays-- at least until very recently-- were probably more prone to remain in the closet and lead double lives, at least in small Southern towns. Of course fundamentalist Christianity is the dominant religion in much of the South as well.<br />The best story here is \\"465 Acres\\" by the editor of this volume, Jay Quinn. In this story Steve, who has recently lost his wife Janet to cancer, is living with his domineering mother whom of course he calls \\"Mama\\" and his two children. He is about to meet for the first time in 22 years or so a man named Robin whom he once loved. Mr. Quinn has perfect pitch when it comes to portraying Southern rural families in the North Carolina-East Tennessee-Virginia area. Janet's death was \\"the Lord's will.\\" Steve's mother will always call friends her son's age \\"boy\\". His children are young'uns. Steve's mother, a perfectly awful human being, doesn't like Mexicans and opines that girls shouldn't go to college since they'll just get married anyway.

When David Leavitt published FAMILY DANCING in the l980's, I was convinced that he would be our next great gay writer as that book of stories was so brilliantly written. I have read everything that Mr. Leavitt has written since; from where I sit, nothing has measured up to his first book. THE BODY OF JONAH BOYD is no exception. I really wish I liked his fiction more. He seems to be a terribly nice person, certainly has a flair for language and often makes profound statements about the world in general. He, moreover, is most adept at character development, piling on detail after detail to make his people come alive. Here we even know what kind of purse one woman carries and what she has in it, for example. But in the end I find most of his characters not very interesting. In this latest novel, they all apparently are heterosexual. (Perhaps Mr. Leavitt is aiming for a larger audience here.) The narrator is a \\"fat\\" secretary (Denny)-- that's her description of her body, not mine-- who jumps into bed with married older men faster than she can type--certainly a little difficult to fathom. Then there's the writer who either does or doesn't get his works accepted by THE NEW YORKER, a recurring dilemma for many of Leavitt's characters.<br />What this novel does have going for it is that parts of it read almost like a decent mystery since Jonah Boyd's novel manuscript is missing.Yes, this book is a book is a book about books. But it has little to do with the brillance of Mr. Leavitt's early work.<br />Finally, whoever wrote the blurb on the inside front of the dust jacket said that this book is a tribute to \\"the sisterhood of secretaries.\\" Surely he or she cannot be serious.	2004-07-03

The critics insist on saying Ms. Parks is influenced here by William Faulkner's AS I LAY DYING, something I don't see much of although I did hear her in an interview recently say nice things about Faulkner. Ms. Parks is certainly a classy lady.<br />And she has written a classy novel. Billy Beede, named after Billie Holiday in spite of the spelling of her first name, is sixteen, unmarried and pregnant. She is joined by a host of other motley characters: Dill Smiles. . . \\"the most honest person I know, even if she ain't nothing but a bulldagger.\\" Then there's Roosevelt Beede, a minister who no longer preaches; his wife June Flowers Beede, who only has one leg; Laz Jackson, named for Lazarus in the New Testament because he was born not breathing, who wants to marry Billy even though he is not the father of her unborn child--actually he's still a virgin when the novel begins--and of course Willa Mae Beede, Billy's mother and Dill's former lover, who is now in her grave and may have been buried with previous gems. There are several other minor characters, just as interesting, not the least of which is Homer Beede Rochfoucault, the son of a Morehouse man and a Spelman graduate. There's also a sympathetic white deputy sheriff, someone we might not expect to find in 1963, the year this novel takes place.<br />Told from several points of view-- perhaps the writer is influenced by Faulkner after all-- the novel ultimately is about the importance of family. These characters-- most of them either dirt poor or, in the case of Homer and his mother, people who have suffered a reversal of fortune-- are as strong as the state of Texas. Like Faulkner's Dilsey in THE SOUND AND THE FURY, they endure.<br />That Ms. Parks first made her mark as a dramatist-- she won the Pulitzer for her play TOPDOG/UNDERDOG-- is obvious from the language here as one dialogue builds on another.<br />For all these characters' misfortunes-- and they suffer many-- you will feel good about the ending of this story. Billy says: \\"Going back home we made good time. I think we did all right.\\" Ms. Parks does much better than \\"all right\\" in this poignant, bittersweet novel.r.<br />For all these characters' misfortunes-- and they suffer many-- you will feel good about the ending of this story.

In this the second of John Morgan Wilson mysteries, Benjamin Justice, the sometimes down-and-out writer who fell from grace after he wrote a Pulitzer winning series about a young man's dying of AIDS that was based more on fiction than fact, is back. And some of his friends we met in SIMPLE JUSTICE make return appearances: Maurice and Fred, Justice's gay landlords; Alexandra Templeton, the statuesque African American reporter and Harry Brofsky, Justice's former mentor before he lost his job at a good newspaper.<br />The victim here is Raymond Farr, an Iranian would-be writer for the movies-- he is HIV positive, and practically everyone who knows him had reason to kill him. The plot is well developed and goes smoothly. What Mr. Wilson does so well in his other novels, he does here: he makes a real flesh and blood person out of Justice.  At the beginning of the novel, he is wracked with guilt over the way he treated his lover who has recently died of AIDS-- he wasn't there for him when his lover was dying. Justice, as the title indicates, is able to change. You will like him much more at the end of the novel than you did at the beginning.<br />Since this tale is about writers trying to get their scripts made into movies, there are many references to old movies and a catalogue of both African American and gay-themed films; additionally Justice keeps running into or just missing stars-- James Caan, Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams, Jack Nicholson, to name a few. My favorite is Wilson's description of George Hamilton as the actor best known for his suntan. Wasn't he also known for escorting one of the Johnson daughters during Lyndon Johnson's presidency? Of course, as he does in each of his stories, the author pays tribute to Walter Mosley-- someone is reading A LITTLE YELLOW DOG.<br />Many of the references to AIDS are almost too painful to read; many of us have had too many of those experiences in the 80's and early 90's. The writer opened up wounds for me that I thought had healed. That is not to say, however, that this is not a great story worth reading.had healed.

He also spends a lot of time obsessing about the recent death by suicide of his father and his relationship with his mother, along with his lack of a lasting relationship with a good man. All these topics get worked on in his weekly visits--when he keeps them--to his psychiatrist, Dr. Goldstein. Was he responsible in any way for the death of his father? Why didn't he see his suicide coming? Is his mother a lesbian? Why must he expect any man he meets to be perfect?<br />The time sequence goes from the present to Matthew's life as a youngster and times in between. There is a poignant account-- getting close to home-- of his being dragged to a baseball game-- when he is in the sixth or seventh grade-- by his parents and being called a \\"strikeout queen\\" by Jimmy Parker, a smelly kid who lived in a trailer park.<br /> Sometimes Matthew can be a real pain; then you remember that he is a little or a lot like too many people you hold near and dear, and in a moment of rare self-awareness, you figure out that he sounds an awfully lot like yours truly.<br />This book is a quick, easy read-- certainly no requirement for a good literature-- it is very well written, has some profound thoughts as well as interesting turns of phrase. I hooted when I read that \\"a little a cappella flute goes a long way,\\" having had a colleague years ago who insisted on serenading everyone who would listen with endless flute solos. If you stay in your room-- described by the author as little tombs-- at the baths rather than walk around, you are like a doggy in a window. When Sheila, Matthew's  mother's friend as he says, \\"sees through\\" him, he feels both pride and gratefulness swirling together like \\"tasty ribbons of a Bundt cake batter,\\" an apt image to be used by this sort of gay guy.<br />Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. Here we have on the jacket cover a photograph of an expensive lemony yellow cable-knit sweater and the book is bright yellow. This yellow sweater plays prominently in one of Matthew's escapades as a young man.<br />The information about the author says he has a law degree from Yale. Let's hope he makes a good living as a fine writer and doesn't have to practice law. We have too few good writers and too many lawyers of any kind.like \\"tasty ribbons of a Bundt cake batter,\\" an apt image to be used by this sort of gay guy.<br />Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover.

I am certainly no authority on Mr. James, having read only two of his novels-- many years ago-- both required in an English course, THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY and THE TURN OF THE SCREW. Having finished this fine novel, however, I'm encouraged to read more James, particularly his letters and maybe a biography about him. Mr. Toibin's novel has the flavor and nuances, as best I can recall, of a Henry James novel, no small accomplishment. Toibin's James, though a bit like Eliot's Prufrock, is nevertheless a likable person and not so different from a lot of people I know. His sexuality is repressed, he has friendships with women whom he doesn't want to get too close to, he is the second child in a family of brilliant people-- William James being his older brother-- his father drinks too much, his beloved sister Alice suffers from emotional problems, he is attracted to men but doesn't act on his feelings, he is cowed by alcoholic servants, and he has a pushy woman friend from whom he has to hid a tapestry he has bought for his home because she told him he shouldn't purchase it. On the other hand, Toibin's James takes comfort in writing, in decorating a new home in Rye-- and while he sometimes may be lonely-- often enjoys solitude, something altogether different. \\"He loved the glorious silence a morning brought, knowing that he had no appointments that afternoon and no engagements that evening. He had grown fat on solitude, he thought, and had learned to expect nothing from the day but at best a dull contentment.\\"<br />James through Toibin has poignant observations about life and death. \\"He realized that he did not even want the past back, that he had learned not to ask for that. His dead would not return. Being freed of the fear of their going gave him this strange contentment, the feeling that he wanted nothing more now but for time to go slowly.\\" About his cousin Minny Temple who dies at an early age, James says that he \\"could control her destiny now that she was dead, offer her the experiences she would have wanted, and provide drama for a life which had been so cruelly shortened. He wondered if this had happened to other writers who came before him. . .\\" What a wonderful way to become immortal, to be fictionalized by a great writer. Near the end of this novel James tells Edmund Gosse that \\"'I am a poor storyteller. . .a romancer, interested in dramatic niceties. While mly brother [William] makes sense of the world, I can only briefly attempt to make it come alive, or become stranger.'\\" The same can be said of Toibin, himself.

Just as Isherwood brought to life  the Berlin of the 1930's in BERLIN STORIES, so does this writer make Prague in the 1990's a very real place. His characters are Czechs, American tourists and expatriates, Jew and Gentile, gay and straight. They teach English, They take side trips to Israel, they study in a desire to convert to Judaism, they make a living drawing pornographic illustrations. When in Prague, they visit churches and synagogues, concentration camps and sex clubs. These characters have blood flowing in their veins; they possess both breath and body odor. In \\"This Ground You Are Standing On,\\" a Jewish woman, along with her husband, returning to Prague, the city her parents fled in 1939, rents a room from an elderly blonde woman she initially mistakes as Jewish who may have aided the Nazis but is not altogether unsympathetic, under this author's pen, however.<br />Mr. Hamburger's language is both precise and poetic. One character's thin wire-framed glasses had narrow lenses, \\"as if all she needed to see of the world could fit within those two rectangles.\\" American tourists wear warm-up suits. Some of them are obtuse: \\"Trying to explain the hazards of privatization to bozos like Jake was like trying to drive a car stuck in neutral.\\" A go-go dancer speaks bad English, \\"which was all right. . . because his body was a poem.\\"<br />In addition to creating ten fascinating stories where something actually happens, Mr. Hamburger, whether he means to or not, has written a fine travel book. Reading this collection made me want to visit Prague. I also look forward to reading his novel we are told in \\"About The Author\\" is now in progress.	2004-06-13

David Leddick continues in this second volume of naked men what he began in NAKED MEN, PIONEERING MALE NUDES, 1935-1955, bringing us up to 2000, the year this volume was published. The genie is out of the bottle as famous and unknown men pose before many different photographers. In addition to George Platt Lynes, there are photographs here by George Dureau, Ken Duncan, Francesco Scavullo, Tom Bianchi, Robert Mapplethorpe, Greg Gorman, Harriet Liebowitz, Jim French, Pierre & Gilles, to name a few. Additionally there are drawings and/or paintings by Paul Cadmus, Michael Leonard, Don Bachardy and George Dureau. Among the famous and sometimes infamous men who bared all are Yves Saint Laurent, Rupert Everett, David Kopay, the exhibitionist Peter Berlin who apparently only photographs himself, Charlton Heston--hello!--Burt Lancaster from THE SWIMMER-- remember that 1968 movie made from a John Cheever short story?-- Peter Hinwood, whose name probably means nothing to you until you find out that he was the god Rocky Horror in ROCKY HORROR SHOW-- and Joe Dallesandro, one of Andy Warhol's superstars, who has not aged particularly well, photographed here by Scavullo. Finally we are graced by at least three porn stars: Ryan Idol; Cal Culver a/k/a Casey Donovan, who died of AIDS in 1987; and the notorious Jeff Stryker, (pp. 86-87) whose photo here is a hoot. He is demurely posed, stretched out on a flower-patterned couch with his back to the camera in the tradition of a 19th Century painting of a nude woman. (Seeing that hilarious photograph alone is worth the price of the book.)<br />Choosing favorite photographs is challenging. I particularly like Harriet Liebowitz's work (pp. 92-93) for her exquisite composition. Both photographs by Pierre & Gilles as always are creative and look like no other artist's work: Midnight Cowboy (pp. 98-99) and Casanova on pages 128-29. The photo of Larry Schleinz by Barry McKinley (p. 9) might have been the sexiest shot in the book had it had not been for the Romain Johnson photo by George Platt Lynes (pp. 24-25) done in 1953. It's easy to see why Leddick chose the photo of Anthony La Fauci by Dianora Niccolina (pp. 76-77) for the cover. Finally I nominate three contemporary photographs of men who have aged beautifully for the \\"Joy Of Aging\\" award: John Eddy (p. 82), Scott Wilson, (39) and Mike Helie on page 59.<br />Collecting these photographs and meeting the models must have been a labor of love.

David Leddick, who has given us many books on the naked male, had a brilliant idea for this one: he would put together a book of photographs of nude models from 1935 to 1955 and include recent photographs of the men as close to the time of publication of this book (1997) as possible. The result is a stunning success. There is a foreward by Quentin Crisp, a male model, himself, for art classes in England in the 1930's (THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT) and a long, sometimes wordy introduction by Mr. Leddick. Of more interest, at least to me, is the biographical information about each of the models, their occupations, whether they married or not, what they are doing now and if they are alive--most of them were at the time Mr. Leddick began his research.<br />Many of the photographs are by George Platt Lynes, who apparently never took a bad picture and to whom every subsequent photographer of the nude male owes a tremendous debt. No photographer since Lynes has lit the human body with such skill and beauty.<br />There are unknown models here but some big names as well: Tennessee Williams, the very straight but most unshy Yul Brynner, Donald Windham, Christopher Isherwood, the famous artist Paul Cadmus, the photographer Horst as well as George Platt Lynes, himself.<br />Two of my favorite photographs: that of Umberto Visbal, a darkroom and studio assistant for Lynes in the early 1950's-- outrageously sexual (p. 127), and Carlos McLendon (p. 87) shot in September 1947; here we have a photograph beautifully composed and printed with many shades of gray.<br />My favorite quote from the written material: Bill Harris (pp. 94-95) saying that he never frequented a bathhouse again after hearing someone say: \\"See that little old Chinese woman over there? That used to be the handsomest man in New York.\\" The writer Camus may have been correct when he said that after the age of 40, we are all responsible for our own faces. He could have included our bodies as well.	2004-06-12

This beautiful book has everything going for it and tells you everything you ever wanted or needed to know about berries. Ms. Hibler discusses in great detail 35 or 40 berries-- many of which I was not familiar with-- along with color photographs of twice that many. About each berry she discusses their common names, scientific classification, habitat, history, where they are grown commercially, how to pick them, how to buy them, how to store them, along with notes for the cook. On cranberries she tells the cook: &quot;Think of them as the lemons of the berry world. Their tartness acts as a flavor enhancer when they are mixed with other fruits or berries, bringing out the best in both.&quot; On blueberries: &quot;They are good mixed with other fruits and nuts, especially almonds.&quot;<br />In the author's introduction she discusses the current problems consumers face in the market. Although berries are now available the year round, we have sacrificed quality for quantity. (Do you ever wonder how growers get those tasteless strawberries bigger than a baby's fist?) She points out that many berries are picked while green and will never taste right when they do ripen. She further states that if we are willing to pay more for good berries for a shorter length of time in the market, that the sellers will do what is necessary to sell berries. But it is left up to the consumer to alleviate the problem.<br />Ms. Hibler covers utensils, cream, dried berries, washing berries, etc., in a chapter she calls &quot;Berry Basics.&quot; Then the recipes follow. The author says she has been collecting berry recipes for years; there are 175 here, according to the book cover: drinks, breads, soups and salads, main courses, sauces, preserving berries, ice cream and other frozen treats, pies, tarts, cobblers, cakes, pastries and puddings. What is so amazing about these recipes is that with the exception of strawberry shortcake, we don't see the ones often repeated in previously published cookbooks: blueberry muffins, berry cheesecakes, cranberry bread, etc. (The strawberry shortcake is from the 1963 MCCALL'S COOKBOOK. Ms. Hibler says it is the best ever and recommends adding blueberries for a patriotic recipe for July 4.) While I'm a basic blueberry, blackberry, raspberry and strawberry person, if your tastes go to the exotic, both in berry and recipe, you won't be disappointed. Try Mahaw Jelly or Marionberry Streusel Tart, for example. Some of the recipes that jumped out at me that I want to try are Madame Rose Blanc's Creme de Cassis, (so we can make wonderful kirs) Fozen Srawberry Yourt, Fresh Raspberry Tart, and Lemon Curd Cake.<br />Two final notes: Ms. Hibler reminds us that eating berries is good for our health and gives us a great quote about cookbooks from Joseph Conrad: &quot;Its object [a cookbook] can conceivably be no other than to increase the happiness of mankind.&quot; Certainly that can be said of THE BERRY BIBLE, destined to become the  book on berries by which others will be judged.cookbooks: blueberry muffins, berry cheesecakes, cranberry bread, etc. (The strawberry shortcake is from the 1963 MCCALL'S COOKBOOK.

The men remain god-like, and the photography again is perfect. Perhaps the artist will combine the two volumes into one lavish coffee table book sometime soon. Oh, we have some variety here-- a little bondage, some leather, and we go from a threesome in the previous edition to four in the floor here. The men this time around come from Brazil, Chicago, Canada, Australia and San Francisco; and at least one model makes a repeat appearance. There are some handsome men here. I recommend Darren of the Beautiful Feet for one.<br />Mr. Bianchi states in his introduction that he wants gay men to be comfortable with their sexuality. He further says that this work FROM THE COUCH is his Sistine Chapel-- maybe a bit of a stretch--although this photographer is certainly not short on talent.<br />For the artist's next book, I'd love to see a series on men who have B bodies or maybe a couple of C pluses thrown in for good measure. Something tells me that a lot of men occasionally would enjoy seeing pictures of men who look a little more like they do as opposed to so many gods from Mount Olympus. It's a little like having only chocolate truffles at every meal.	2004-06-08

Upon arriving, he pulls out a pistol and fires a round of shots at North Carolina's homophobic, racist U. S. Senator Henry Hampton. (Who on earth could Mr. Ferrell have based this character on?)  This is just the beginning of Mr. Ferrell's tale of a small Southern town with all its pretentiousness, customs and secrets. The author understands completely the mindset of Small Town USA where everyone attends funerals, whether they knew the deceased or not, and take obligatory casseroles to the wake. And if there is anything unusual about the deceased-- say a father is buried in the same coffin with his deformed son-- then the funeral may have to be moved to the high-school auditorium to handle the crowds. Everybody knows everybody else's business, or at least they think they do. \\"No, sir. We never leave each other alone or to our own individual devices. I am glad to say I know everybody's business, and I am proud they know mine.\\" But it is in this small town environment, where boys won't \\"let their mothers help them with a necktie,\\" that Jerry Chiffon takes home economics in high school and instructs the local ladies about style. From him they learn many things: that you live in a house; you are \\"at home\\" and that you shouldn't wear too much jewelry to a funeral, for example. Bathrooms should be white; telephones, black. And you never have unlit candles anywhere.<br />Mr. Ferrell has written a brilliant novel, rich in detail, and funny in the tradition of SPLENDORA  but ultimately a sad commentary on being different. Jerry neither fits completely into the glitzy gay life of New York just before and during the worst of the AIDS epidemic nor in the little North Carolina town to which he returns although there is that sort of \\"let's not talk about it\\" mentality of the town, particularly among the women.

If that is indeed the case, the temperature of this \\"thriller\\" has to be at least 450 degrees. I have never seen a hotter book. Mr. Bianchi says in his introduction that he sees \\"our sexual energy as a vibrant aspect of our inner Godliness. I wanted to create an erotic record that demonstrates this truth.\\" Be that as it may, he certainly has found some gods for this volume. Beautiful men-- most of them mature-- came to visit Mr. Bianchi's brown couch: from Amsterdam, Atlanta, Australia, Siberia, the Midwest and just across the street.<br />Mr. Bianchi says that the men here are not professional models. There is certainly a refreshing spontaneity about them, singly and in twosomes and threesomes, as they frolick partially clothed, nearly naked and buck-naked before Mr. Bianchi's camera. (Has anyone gotten more free advertising in the past 20 years than Calvin Klein, thanks to the publication of books and magazines like this one where the hunks often get in and out of underwear that has become known simply as \\"Calvins?\\")<br />These photographs were shot with a digital camera which allowed Bianchi to use natural light, giving these stunning images almost a painterly quality.<br />This volume is Mr. Binachi's finest work thus far and worth every penny it costs.	2004-05-31

Doll Baxter, a feisty young woman, is seventeen years old when she meets and marries Daniel Staten, a well-off land-owner, to save her family's homeplace. The story ends around the turn of the century; Teddy Roosevelt has just gone to &quot;put an end to the Spanish-American War.&quot; Both Dolly and Daniel are strong, fully developed characters. Much of the action has to do with the tension between them.  They reminded me a little of Jane Austin's Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in their verbal fencing but not in their attitudes about the world around them. Both of these characters are grounded in the Georgia soil, and Doll never forgets what it means to be poor. They grow and change and become better, wiser people. The plot, which has many interesting and sometimes unexpected twists and turns, is, nevertheless, totally believable and often very moving. (This novel would make a fine movie if done right.)<br />In addition to Doll and Daniel, there are many other complex characters here-- Maureen, for instance, along with Mrs. Baxter and Estelle. And Ms. Daugharty, a white Southerner, is as gutsy as her heroine Doll. She is not afraid to tackle race and has created three-dimensional, sympathetic black characters.<br />The language in JUST DOLL is both accurate for the time and place and poetic. I had not seen the word &quot;davenport&quot; since my grandmother used it many years ago. These characters say &quot;Howdy do&quot; and &quot;I suspicion&quot; and &quot;bless her heart.&quot; &quot;Pretty is as pretty does.&quot; Daniel is &quot;Santy Claus&quot; at Christmas; and people, when asked about their health, are &quot;fair to middling.&quot; Collard greens are &quot;sobbing&quot; in grease. A woman stirs clothes in a pot of water like a &quot;stiff batter of a fruit cake.&quot; Shadows are paisleyed.&quot; Ms. Daugharty sent me to the dictionary several times; I now know what &quot;cerise&quot; means and have learned several other new words as well.<br />There are many beautiful passages here: &quot;It seemed that people were just passing through only long enough for you to get to loving them, then gone as if they never were, or were somebody you had dreamed up for the sole purpose of bringing suffering. Love was dangerous suddenly; a child or husband might be with you one day and gone the next and leave you gnawing on the corner of your pillow to keep from crying out questions in the middle of the night. Then morning, there was always morning.&quot; This is about as good as good writing gets.

Mr. Dunning begins this novel in 1987 in Denver, the home of Janeway's bookstore. Then the policeman-turned-bookseller travels to Baltimore, Charleston and  then back to Denver in his quest to find the murderer of Denise Ralston, who Janeway believes was murdered because the assailant thought she had a rare book by  Sir Richard Burton, the l9th Century English writer, not the 20th Century actor, as Dunning would say. To paraphrase Faulker, &quot;once a cop, always a cop&quot; as Janeway's sleuthing skills come back to him. He sets about to solve the several mysteries here in a deliberate, meticulous fashion. As we have come to expect from Dunning's two previous novels, Janeway's relationship with a woman he pursues is rocky. And THE BOOKMAN'S PROMISE ends on a cliffhanger!<br />This novel flows more easily than the first two mysteries, I thought; apparently Mr. Dunning has found his stride. The reader learns a lot about Richard Burton; and for those who want to know more about this interesting individual, the author gives a list for further reading at the end of the book.<br />I must say I missed all the referenes to book publishers and first editions and prices that were so entertaining in the first two books of this series and for the most part are absent here, although Mr. Dunning does make a couple of digs at St. Martin's Press.	2004-05-27

Of course, her dilemma is that only people who care about correct punctuation are the ones who will read this fascinating book. Those who are most guilty will not or cannot read her.<br />But for those of us who read this book there are wonderful tidbits. For example, Oliver Wendell Holmes said that We have to dismount from an idea and get back into the saddle again at every parenthesis while the writer Gertrude Stein found question marks the most uninteresting of all punctuation marks. F. Scott Fitzgerald said that the exclamation point (as it is known in America) is &quot;like laughing at your own jokes.&quot; My favorite image from the book is that of the semicolon that &quot;quietly practises the piano with crossed hands.&quot;<br />For those of us who care, Ms. Truss gives a good review of the rules of punctution. She discusses thoroughly the correct use of all forms of punctuation, from the apostrophe to the hyphen, and compares the differences between British and American usage. She also discusses the blight that e-mail messages have brought on us all. &quot;I keep thinking that what we do now, with this medium of instant delivery, isn't writing, and doesn't even qualify as typing either: it's just sending. What did you do today? Sent a lot of stuff.&quot;<br />I fear that punctuation problems are worse on this side of the pond than they are in England. I attended a black tie event recently for over 300 people in which words large enough to be read from the back of the dinning hall were projected on a huge screen behind the speaker. The apostrophe was used over and over to express the plural, rather than the possessive of words. I felt as obsolete as a rotary telephone.	2004-05-15

By definition, a troll is a supernatural creature from Scandinavian folklore that lives in caves or in mountains. It is stumpy, mishapen, and can be as big as a giant or a small as a dwarf. It has been known to abduct children. Trolls have made appearances in such literary works as BEOWULF, LORD OF THE RINGS and HARRY POTTER. With that in mind, you should be prepared for the unexpected in this novel by the Finnish author Johanna Sinisalo. You will not be disappointed. This writer has crafted a bizarre but strangely moving love story between Mikael, nicknamed Angel, a young Finnish photographer, and a troll whom he rescues from a pack of hoodlums one midnight as the young man staggers home from a night of drinking and unrequited lust for one Martes, who says he is only looking for &quot;good conversation.&quot; Angel takes the troll in, nurses him back to health and starts down a path from which there is no return. With each passing day, Angel finds himself becoming more hopelessly attached to the troll with the juniper-berry smell-- whom he names Pessi-- and having to hide his new housemate from his friends and neighbors. As you would expect, a novel about a love affair between a man and a troll will not have a happy ending. Even so, I was not quite ready for the explosive finale.<br />Ms. Sinisalo's prose is  both concise and evocative: &quot;I look him [Martes] in the eyes. His face wears a friendly, open, and understanding smile. He seems at once infinitely lovable and completely unknown. His eyes are computer icons, expressionless diagrams, with infinite wonders behind them, but only for the elect, those able to log on.&quot; The author raises questions about man's relationship with wild creatures-- how much we know or don't know about them and what they know about us. She seems to say something about the animalistic tendences that lie deeply hidden in the most civilized of us just waiting to be let loose.<br />Although on one level, TROLL is just a great story that you cannot stop reading, on another it asks questions about the  very nature of us all.that you cannot stop reading, on another it asks questions about the  very nature of us all.	2004-05-15

This is a good a collection of short stories as you'll find. It's no wonder that the critics have nothing but praise for Mr. Gay. Many of the characters are similar. Alhough they are told in the third-person, the stories belong to the menfolks. They are tough, quiet, often angry and capable of violence at the slightest provocation. (In \\"Crossroads Blues,\\" the character Borum, in describing how he shot his wife and his brother when he found them in bed together says, \\"You need to know what a man's capable of.\\") Sometimes they are the victims of their own inaction until it is too late to extricate themselves from the dilemmas they find themselves, and they do something horrific. They often have difficulties with women, ever seeking the elusive female in their lives. In some stories there is conflict between children and older parents. There are murders, accidental killings, suicides, accidental deaths-- and divorces, infidelities, teenage pregnancies and abortions, cancer and Alzheimer's. These characters inhabit, at least some of them, a place called Ackerman Field, somewhere near Nashville, Tenneseee where there is still a \\"high sheriff.\\" They listen to George Jones, the Carter Family and Jimmie Rogers. But these characters certainly are not freaks and are ultimately very sympathetic. I have known some of these men; they are strong as oak trees.<br />According to biographical information on Mr. Gay, he is largely self-taught and is a voracious reader. A seventh grade teacher gave him a copy of Thomas Wolfe's LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL; and the rest is, as they say, history. Like Wolfe, sometimes Mr. Gay's prose gets a little too ornate; for the most part, however, he's a joy to read. Mr. Gay is a great lover of similes and metaphors; they often work beautifully. Windows are \\"stoned by double-dared boys.\\" A man views his naked, sleeping wife \\"in the filigreed moonlight at once real yet as remote and lost as a dusty nude study stacked in a museum's forgotten corner.\\" A room in a funeral home is \\"a cozy paneled vestibule just one door removed from eternity.\\"<br />This is probably sparrows screeching at eagles but I believe the term is \\"jerry-rigged\\" (p. 120) rather than \\"jury-rigged.\\" But then, even Homer nodded.<br />These are quite fantastic stories.and lost as a dusty nude study stacked in a museum's forgotten corner.\\" A room in a funeral home is \\"a cozy paneled vestibule just one door removed from eternity.\\"<br />This is probably sparrows screeching at eagles but I believe the term is \\"jerry-rigged\\" (p. 120) rather than \\"jury-rigged.\\" But then, even Homer nodded.<br />These are quite fantastic stories.	2004-05-06

Tommy is a 29 year-old Brit who never met a drug or an orifice as found on either male or female that he didn't want to enter. But he's an equal opportunity type of guy. His orifices are there for the taking too. You see, Tommy lives with two close friends, Sadie and Bob, his extended family, whom he takes baths with; he is seeing Charles who has an eight year old son, whom Tommy adores. Then there are India and other women and men along the way with whom he shares both his body and drugs.<br />Tommy is an arm-chair philosopher as well and has opinions on practically every subject. For example, he abhors the term \\"making love\\". \\"Making love sounds like a hobby, don't you think? Like a kit you'd buy from B&Q. It sounds like a Marks and Spencer frozen meal. It sounds like death, and if you didn't get it you were out of the picture.\\" And in what must be a first in fiction, Tommy gives a page and a half treatise on the dilemma men face in choosing whether to stand or sit while urinating.<br />Mr. Cumming is certainly a clever and amusing writer. A character paints the town puce. Another character is described as \\"the aforementioned artist formerly known as girlfriend.\\" And Tommy wonders why no one has ever told the queen \\"how weird her hair looks.\\" (I wonder about that, myself, since the press tells her almost daily how weird her family is.)<br />One of the most entertaining sections of this little tale is Tommy's impressions of New York and the Americans when he arrives in the Big Apple on a two week assignment as a photographer's assistant. (\\"Tommy Takes Manhattan.\\") He opines on the bath as favored by the Brits with American's love affair with the shower. \\"The land of the free is a shower-obsessed country. . .\\" On seeing New York, \\"I've also found that the best way to view the city is to look up, always look up. There are treasures to behold that you could easily miss.\\" Finally there's the American woman Tommy meets in a bar who is crazy about the British. She invites him to the ladies' room for fun and games and says her name is Dorothy but misses his tongue-in-cheek remark that he had always been her friend, i.e., a friend of Dorothy.<br />Mr. Cumming, playing the deus ex machina card, ties up all the loose ends of the plot a little too easily in the last few pages by jumping a year forward. (\\"One Year Later\\") Although this little novel is not Booker Prize material, it certainly has its moments.ree is a shower-obsessed country. . .\\" On seeing New York, \\"I've also found that the best way to view the city is to look up, always look up.

Born in 1942, she grew up on a dairy farm in Mayfield, Kentucky; she and Elvis then are from the same time and part of the country. It is obvious from every page of this work that Ms. Mason likes Elvis's music and understands what his contribution to America and the world was. There is no substitute, as some of us remember, to being alive when Elvis literally burst on the music scene and shook us from the Eisenhower 50's. Of course Ms. Mason, one of our best living fiction writers, says it better than I: \\"For me, Elvis is personal--as a Southerner and something of a neighbor. I heard Elvis from the very beginning on the Memphis radio stations. Many parents found Elvis's music dangerously evocative, his movements lewd and suggestive--but when my family saw Elvis on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW, singing 'Ready Teddy', my father cried, 'Boy, he's good!'\\"<br />My problem with this book is the same I have with the other books in this series-- their required brevity makes any in-depth study of the character impossible. This series works best, I think, in Douglas Brinkley's book on Rosa Parks since no bio of her except one for children had ever been written so he was covering new ground rather than rehashing previous material. Ms. Mason lists her sources, saying she relied heavily on Peter Guaralnick's two books on Pressley that I have not read. I did read, however, the awful book by Albert Goldman whom I believe Ms. Mason alludes to in her introduction: \\"In 1980, a scurrilous biography portrayed him as a redneck with savage appetites and perverted mentality, and of no musical significance to American culture.\\" Ms. Mason provides the ultimate insult by not giving the name of the biographer.<br />Ms. Mason discusses briefly Elvis's movies and his interest in books. I didn't know he read books or that Priscilla got him to burn them. Ms. Mason also says that by the end of 2000 Graceland had become the most visited private home in the U. S. When I visited his grave a few years ago-- Graceland was closed that day-- I was saddened so see that out of hundreds of \\"floral arrangements\\" there was not one real flower.

Regardless of their technical quality-- that depends on the prowess of the photographer-- they often remain those pictures we come back to again and again. The reason is obvious: we are often more relaxed and natural around people we know, and they are better at capturing our essence if that can be captured in a photo. I suspect that June Newton aka Alice Springs and Helmut Newton felt the same way about many of these photographs included in this very fine collection. Some of my favorite shots in this coffe-table sized book are those that each of them took of the other. Helmut's portrait of June as Joan of Arc (p. 43) is fantastic. Mrs. Newton was obviously a great beauty in her youth. The photograph on page 211 of Coral Browne, Audrey Wilder and June is stunning. There are also candids taken by Mr. Newton of his wife nude. She in turn shoots Helmut working, clowning, relaxing (pp. 80-81, 86-87) and pensive: &quot;From My Bed In The Clinic&quot; on page 247.<br />I was not previously familiar with Ms. Newton's photographs, most of which fall into the category of portraits and many of them celebrity portraits. While she is no Helmut, many of these portraits printed here are very fine. Most of them appear to be shot in available light, something that requires all the skills a photographer can muster. Many of them, particularly those of celebrities, according to the text, were shot in less than desirable circumstances and often had to be done very quickly. She obviously can hold her own as a good photographer although I'm sure it didn't hurt her any to learn from someone as talented as her husband.<br />Mrs. Newton in a well-written narrative takes the reader from her childhood in Australia to her marriage to Helmut and their travels in Europe, Australia and the United States. She's obviously a character in her own right. How many women as public as she would discuss a facelift in their memoirs, for instance?<br />Through much of her professional career, Mrs. Newton has used the pseudonym &quot;Alice Springs&quot;. According to her at the urging of a friend, she produced a map, shut her eyes and aimed a pin that landed at the &quot;Center of The Continent - Alice Springs.&quot; A beautiful story but a little bit too coincidental to be believable. What would have happened if the pin had landed on, say, &quot;Kangaroo Island&quot; or Mollymook&quot;? Whether or not that little anecdote is true, however, doesn't detract from this beautifully printed book, another fine edition by Taschen.

These two stories should be forgotten. Mr. McEwan turns up the heat in three of his stories, which I would label the bizarre. \\"Pornography\\" is the tale of O'Bryne who is having a sexual affair with two women simultaneously. When each woman finds out about the other, O'Bryne  meets his Waterloo as the two women descend on him, tie him up and sterilize surgical instruments. \\"Reflections of a Kept Ape\\" is told from the viewpoint of an ape, a former lover of his mistress. The narrator in \\"Dead as They Come\\" is in love with a store mannequin, whom he purchases and takes home with him. The remaining two stories are beautiful and good indicators of what is to come in McEwan's later fiction. \\"In Between the Sheets\\" is a sexually charged account a father whose fourteen-year-old daughter and her midget girl friend visit him. The two girls are involved in something resembling a lesbian relationship or maybe it's just a \\"phase\\" teenage girls go through. There are also undertones of incest in this emotionally tense story. The title has multiple layers of meaning, something we have come to expect in McEwan's novels. He apparently has coined a phrase in \\"Psychopolis.\\" The narrator is a Brit living briefly in California. While there he meets Mary, who works in a feminist bookstore in Venice and whom he chains to the foot of his bed for a weekend-- at her request. There is also George Malone who owns a shop under the narrator's apartment in Santa Monica,a shop specializing in items \\"for party givers\\" and equipment for sickrooms. Finally, there is Terence Latterly, someone the narrator had met \\"years ago in England when he was researching a still uncompleted thesis on George Orwell. . .\\" This story culminates when George throws a farewell party for the narrator who brings Mary and Terence with him to dinner. The evening gets out of hand when the conversation turns to religion, sexism, corporal punishment, sexual inadequacy and violence.

Although many of these people are down and out, few are whiners. They are mildly heroic in that they are able to put their feet on the floor each morning and go to a life-sentence job, if they have one. Some of them are homeless. A few of them have their 15 minutes of glory, an alcoholic bum who catches a child thrown by her mother from a burning building, for instance. Mr. LeDuff's prose is sparse in keeping with his  subject matter; he is the master of maximum discription with a minimum of words. John Byrnes who caught the baby is &quot;just back from an extended alcoholiday.&quot; Someone in a beer hall drinks beer &quot;greedily, like a nursing kitten.&quot; Another character is described as &quot;a conscientious objector to the nine-to-five work world.&quot;<br />Most of the essays here are two to three pages long so you get the essence of the character quickly. This probably works better if you read the essays in the newspaper rather than going through many of these stories at one sitting since if you aren't careful, you may become suicidal reading of person after person living on the edge.<br />On the other hand, my favorite sections of this fine book are the extended write-ups of the slaughterhouse workers at the Smithfield Packing Company plant in Lumberton, North Carolina and Mr. LeDuff's moving account of the death of Dave Fontana from Squad 1 in Park Slope, Brooklyn on September 11, 2001. There are facts about the slaughterhouse that are mind-boggling. the body and mind numbing repetitive jobs day after day, (you hear people say, they don't kill pigs in the plant, they kill people) the tremendous turnover of personnel, (five thousand quit and five thousand are hired each year) the racial tension in the plant, the racial hierarchy with the best jobs going to white workers, then to the Indians, Mexicans and black workers. Mr. LeDuff writes here about some of the things that happened to people who survived September 11. As he says so well, &quot;the story of death has been well documented in these, the first few weeks following September 1. But there is also the matter of living.&quot; He thus takes the reader into how Mr. Fontana's wife and son and his fellow firefighters after September 11 cope as they attempt to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. There are the  difficulties of giving eulogies over empty coffins, the governmental red tape and saddest of all, the little boy who just wants his father to return.<br />These no-nonsense essays should remind us that we are all in this together.favorite sections of this fine book are the extended write-ups of the slaughterhouse workers at the Smithfield Packing Company plant in Lumberton, North Carolina and Mr. LeDuff's moving account of the death of Dave Fontana from Squad 1 in Park Slope, Brooklyn on September 11, 2001.

Mr. Dunning is even more ambitious in this novel than his first with a plot that twists and turns as Janeway sets out to pick up a young fugitive in Seattle. But that is just the beginning of a mystery that takes him back in time as he uncovers murder after murder in some way connected to a 1969 edition of Poe's \\"The Raven.\\"<br />At one point in the novel the character Huggins describes the writing skills of another character Trish Aandahl: \\"The woman is just a sorceress when it comes to words. There's a seductive quality to her writing that hooks you by the neck and just drags you through it. Just wait till you get started reading her book-- you won't be able to leave it alone.\\" That could be a perfect description of the better part of this well-plotted book where only at rare times do you see Mr. Dunning's scaffolding.<br />Of course there's Mr. Dunning's opinions about the book business that I completely agree with, for example, the \\"anal-obsessive who defaces books: \\"You find a grand copy of an old Ross Macdonald and open it to see that some fool has written all over it, destroying half its value and all of its factory-fresh desirability. Why is a book the only gift that the giver feels free and often compelled to deface before giving?\\" \\"Even worse than the scribblers. . . were the name embossers.\\" Finally, Dunning takes aim at \\"the remainder goons at the Viking Press.\\" I  have never understood why people in the book business insist on those awful remainder marks either. I get the feeling they would be just as happy retailing toilet tissue if the profit margin were greater.	2004-04-16

Cliff Janeway starts out as a Denver cop who loves books and winds up in this page-turner as an owner of a rare bookstore who doesn't forget his policing skills. The murders here all have to do with people in the book collecting business so booklovers get a double treat here. Although they are treated to  a first class mystery, just as important is page after page of valuable information about collecting first editions. Ms. McKinley, whom Janeway has the hots for, remarks that when you buy &quot;something unique, and pay twice what it's worth, it's a great bargain.&quot; And one of my favorite passages is about the worth of a good book. Ruby, a store-owner says: &quot;A book has always cost about what a meal in a good restaurant costs. . . I get sick of hearing how expensive books are. Which would you rather have, a good book or a tender steak? I know what I'd take, seven days a week.&quot; I do not know one book lover who would disagree with that statement.<br />Mr. Dunning wastes no time in weighing in on the ongoing debate of &quot;popular&quot; fiction (Stephen King novels) versus the works of writers like Faulkner and Hemingway. (Remember the controversy over King's being given an award at last year's National Book Award Awards?) Janeway opines: &quot;What the hell do I know? I sure can't explain it when a book like SALEM'S LOT goes from $10 to almost $1,000 in ten years. That's half again what a near-perfect GRAPES OF WRATH will bring, if you neeed a point of reference.&quot;<br />Oh, back to the story-- the plot twists and turns with surprise after surprise, right up to the last sentence of the novel.<br />I believe this one is a collectible.	2004-04-11

This book grew out of Mr. Moats' interest in the whole gay marriage debate and the events that preceded the passage in Vermont of the historical civil union legislation. In this extremely well-written account, Mr. Moats covers all the major events that set the stage for this kind of history to be made in Vermont, that is,  the three couples being brave enough to bring suit, the ruling of the Vermont Supreme Court and the ultimate passage into law of civil unions for gay people. He discusses the Stonewall riots, the murder of Harvey Milk, the AIDS epidemic, gays in the military, the lawsuit brought in Hawaii, the increase of adoptions by gay and lesbian couples, and the Matthew Shephard murder. He says in the prologue: In my view, the Vermont story ranks, not just with the Stonewall riots and the murder of Harvey Milk as landmarks of gay history, but with Birmingham and Selma as landmarks of our growth toward a more complete democracy.\\"<br />Governor Howard Dean showed tremendous courage in signing the civil union bill into law. He conducted himself here as he did when he later ran for the Democratic nomination for president. He was open and frank about doing the right thing. There are many other heroes here, Mr. Moates for starters, who is not gay. Certainly the three couples who brought the lawsuit, their attorneys and other gay people in Vermont were brave beyond measure. There were also many fine and decent people in both houses of state government, who were determined to do the right thing by gay people and in so doing, several of them later lost their seats in the state legislature. Two individuals stand out for me--Bill Lippert, vice chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Bob Kinsey, a 72 year-old Republican in the House, an elder in the Presbyterian Church where he and his wife had sung in the choir for fifty-two years. Initially he was opposed to any kind of gay marriage or domestic partnership bill but was persuaded to vote for the bill that eventually passed, probably in part because a teepee on his farm that he had built as a warming hut for skaters in the cold Vermont winters mysteriously burned. He believed the fire was caused by arsonists because of his stand on gay rights. \\"It was the human dimension of the gay marriage bill that touched him. . . He and his wife. . . had learned something about life and love and death. No one was going to instruct him about right and wrong or the disposition of his soul.\\" Mr. Lippert, who is gay, gave an impassioned speech on the House floor that many believed brought his undecided colleagues to his side: \\"There's something strange about sitting in the midst of a delibertive body that is trying to decide whether I and my fellow gay and lesbian Vermonters should get our rights now. . . Don't tell me about what a committed relationship is and isn't. I've watched my gay brothers care for each other deeply and my lesbian sisters nurse and care. There is no love and no commitment any greater than what I've seen, what I know.\\" When Mr. Lippert sat down, Robert Kinsey rose and said that he had just heard the greatest speech he had heard in his 30 years in government. There are many other instances of quiet and sometimes not so quiet heroism here. The jackals of course came out too. The infamous Phyllis Schlafly and Alan Keyes, to name two, made appearances to spread their hate as well.<br />Mr. Moats in the last chapter of the book discusses some of the other significant events for gays and lesbians, The United States Supreme Court's striking down the Texas sodomy law, the ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Court in favor of gay marriage as well as the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Canada upholding a lower court's ruling granting the right for gays and lesbians to marry. This book went to press too early for Mr. Moats to include the passage last week by the Georgia House-- the Senate has passed one weeks ago-- of a bill to allow the citizens of Georgia to vote in November for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage although there is already a law on the books in Georgia making gay marriage illegal. Sad to say, Georgia is not Vermont.nclude the passage last week by the Georgia House-- the Senate has passed one weeks ago-- of a bill to allow the citizens of Georgia to vote in November for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage although there is already a law on the books in Georgia making gay marriage illegal.

There are over 150 photographs here, many in color, of Hollywood actors from the famous to those barely remembered or not remembered at all. For the most part they are placed in chronological order. The chapters are \\"In The Beginning\\",\\"The Thirties\\", \\"The Forties\\", \\"The Fifties\\", \\"The Sixties\\",\\" \\"The Seventies\\", \\"The Eighties\\", \\"The Nineties And Beyond\\", and a final chapter, \\"Man To Man\\" with photographs of \\"men of color\\", \\"pugilists\\", \\"changing body types\\", and \\"Tarzan types.\\" Many of the hunks throughout the years you expect to see are here, and often in two-page color: Clark Gable who set off a firestorm in 1934 when he appeared in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT with Claudette Colbert and revealed, as he prepared for bed, that he wasn't wearing an undershirt, thereby changing the wearing apparel of the American male forever. In spite of his weight now, Marlon Brando will always represent the 50's as the steamy Stanley in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. (pp. 42-43) Paul Newman, still handsome and sexy as he approaches 70, calls to mind the 60's. Burt Reynolds in the 70's became famous for his nude photo in COSMOPOLITAN magazine. One could hardly pick up a magazine in the 80's without seeing the smooth-chested Richard Gere on the cover. One's acting ability obviously has nothing to do with who makes the cut here so we have Tab Hunter on the cover of this book and see the likes of George Hamilton and Pat Boone inside, along with two actors who later became governors of California. Worst photo selection of a very attractive actor is for that of Alec Baldwin. Where did he get that spikey haircut I ask?<br />While I understand this is not as important as whether or not the U. S. found weapons of mass destruction when we invaded Iraq, but missing in action, just to name three, are Warren Beatty, Steve McQueen and Robert Rutherford. How could either of these been omitted when Pat Boone was included?<br />Finally a word about the layout-- the author apparently wanted to imitate the move fan magazines of the past (PHOTOPLAY, for example)-- this works rather well, but the names of the actors in white outlined in black and two different kinds of type, some of it bold and some of it not, make for very difficult reading.e fan magazines of the past (PHOTOPLAY, for example)-- this works rather well, but the names of the actors in white outlined in black and two different kinds of type, some of it bold and some of it not, make for very difficult reading.	2004-04-06

In this loosely-connected string of essays-- Ms. Gillespie finally moves into her home in Capitol View in Atlanta and several of the essays lead up to that move-- she will make you laugh with her raucous humor, marvel at her uncanny ability to coin new phrases (housework impaired,for instance) and identify with the universality of her sense of loss and sorrow. While the essays are chockfull of sailor vocabulary, many of them end in sorrow for lost oportunities. Ms. Gillespie's alcoholic father died alone and she blew a chance to be with him, for example. And she could have been kinder to him by pretending to like the cooking he did for her and her brother and sisters: &quot;Looking back, I wish we could have pretended we liked some of his meals, but when you're young your weapon is honesty, which is perhaps the most merciless of them all.&quot; I would have liked to have known her parents, particularly her mother, an atheist who built bombs for the government, but who, on her deathbed, said that her greatest regret in life was asking for a bicycle for Christmas as a little girl, knowing full well that her parents could not afford to buy her one. Gillespie has aptly named this chapter about her mother, &quot;Jesus Loves Atheists.&quot; There are many other essays like this here that will warm your heart.<br />As I &quot;frolicked through the ottomiss&quot; of these essays--Gillespie's childhood misunderstanding of the words of &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot;-- two thoughts kept popping up in my brain: (1) which of these essays does Ms. Gillespie select to read aloud at signings and (2) that her parents would be proud of her if they could read this book.	2004-04-04

The two men formed a friendship and apparently Mr. Claxton became Mr. McQueen's favorite and most requested photographer. This book of wonderful photographs, covering a couple of years in Mr. McQueen's life from 1962 to 1964, is a result of that brief friendship. Most of the pictures appear to be shot in available light and have a wonderful, informal spontaneity about them impossible to capture in formal portraiture. Both the photographer and subject are comnpletely without pretention.<br />Mr. Claxton caught Mr. McQueen smiling, clowning and pensive. There are photographs of McQueen in fast cars as well as on motorcycles. Many of the shots were done while Mr. McQueen was working on movies. There are also many pictures of him with family and friends. Most of the shots are in black and white with a few in color. Every time I look at them I find yet another photograph that I think is the best in the book. There is a haunting shot of McQueen with his young daughter where the child, sitting on the floor and resting on her arms, looks into Claxton's camera. We only see her father's legs and feet. (p. 79) Another great shot appears on page 73. McQueen is embracing the family cat. Finally, there's a shot of McQueen lying on a blanket in a large field. His profile is beautifully backlit. Both photographs selected for the front and  back covers are fine, informal portraits as well.<br />This book made me remember how much I enjoyed Steve McQueen's movies and made me sad that he is no longer among us.	2004-03-30

I suspect that Mr. Marquez omits many things about himself in this wonderful, rambling memoir of nearly 500 pages; but he gives us story after story on practically every page; and we do get a myriad of fascinating details about both the man, his family and friends and his thoughts on writers and writing. Marquez comes from a large Colombian family, both in and outside marriage, and says that he owes his nature and &quot;way of thinking&quot; to the women in his family who had &quot;strong characters and tender hearts.&quot; His mother obviously fits this description. Although intensely jealous of her husband's infidelities, she brings home one of her husband's children born outside their marriage because &quot;'the same blood that's in my children's veins just can't go wandering around out there.'&quot; In addition to Marguez's parents, whom we recognize in LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA, there are countless other fascinating people and stories  seen and told through the eyes of this great writer. Who else, for example, would know a blind accordian repairman? Or whose family would dig up the remains of Marquez's grandmother Tranquilina and transport her in a sack when they make one of their many moves? It is any wonder that Marquez loved Faulkner's AS I LAY DYING?<br />On writers and writing-- Marquez has always loved poetry and believes that the short story is superior to the novel, this from a man who has given the world ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE and LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA. It is not surprising that he prefers the feature story to an interview or straight reporting. Marquez readily admits that dialogue is not his forte. (We'll gladly settle for his magical tales, however.) He would agree that good readers make good writers as he has read everyone. Writers in English include D.

No one can accuse Mr. Fahrmeyer of not being creative in that there are many exquisite photographs here, beautifully lit and printed and seldom repeated. The first photo in the book is a very strong image and draws you immediately into it and invites you to look further. I particularly like the photographs on pages 16, 29, 87 and 95 for their impeccable lighting. There is a beautiful innocence in the two photographs on pages 38 and 39. The several photographs like those on pages 80 and 81 work, where the models lose most of their eroticism, becoming almost kaleidoscopes in the repetition of their limbs. The artist certainly has a sense of humor as evidenced in the model on page 120 in the classic discus-throwing pose. Here, however, he is all set to throw a plate.<br />What doesn't work are the pictures reminiscent of familiar images of Herb Ritts. I refer to the the photographs like the images on page 27 (a portrait of a man caked with mud or makeup) and page 45, where the model is hiding his face behind a plant of some kind. Ritts did this sort of shot years ago and much better.	2004-03-26

He adds here another fine volume to his several books on the subject. Leddick begins with photographers in the Nineteenth Century and continues to the present in chronological order. All the photographers you expect are here as well as some of the photographs we have seen many times before. (I'm thinking now of Mapplethorpe's infamous &quot;Man in Polyester Suit.&quot;) In addition to Mapplethorpe, there's Thomas Eakins, Wilhelm von Gloeden, Cecil Beaton, George Platt Lynes-- for my money nobody surpasses him-- Bob Mizer, Horst and Herb Ritts. But Leddick also includes David Hockney, Duane Michaels,  the incomparable Imogene Cunningham and one of my favorite photographs by one of my favorite photographers, a shot of Helmut Berger by Helmut Newton. I was also glad to see Leddick include the work of Nan Goldin and Pierre et Gilles, two unique photographers whom I admire tremendously.

The writer gives the history of underwear, beginning with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks and bringing us up to the 21st Century. She gives the gay liberation movement credit for changing the attitudes about men's underwear. There are chapters on the brief, long underwear, boxers, the thong and jock strap-- all well illustrated mostly with color photographs of closeups of crotches--and a chapter on the different brands of men's underwear. Of course, Ms. Engel discusses Jockey and Calvin Klein here. The Jockey Company is famous for inventing the Y-front brief in 1935, and Calvin Klein with help from photographers like Bruce Weber gave us the anatomically correct hunks in skintight white briefs with his name on the waistband in the 1980's.<br />There are photographs throughout the book of the same three men in different styles of underwear. I would have preferred to see more of them-- well, we do get to see all of them on the inside back page. (After all, the crotch does have a body. Even in the catalogue International Male, we see more of the men's bodies than just their crotches in the underwear ads.) Ditto for the 90 or so tiny photographs of these three men near the end of the book. If some of these shots had been blown up to a larger size, the book would have been much more interesting. Ditto the Keith Haring photo (p. 124), the soccor players (pp.8-9), and \\"Jockey's Cellophane Wedding\\" on pages 20 and 21. More photographs like these would have made for a better book. Finally, there are all kinds of tips on washing underwear and getting those \\"stubbor stains\\" out. I'm not kidding.<br />UNDERWEAR is certainly a clever little book, too small for your coffee table, but maybe a nice addition for your nightstand.	2004-03-24

Although consisting of only 170 pages, MY TENDER MATADOR is  a fine, powerful novel. Based on a historical event in 1986 in Chile, the plot is simple and straight forward. A youth group attempts to kill the Dictator Augusto Pinochet. Carlos, a macho, handsome member of the group stores what turns out to be guns and ammunition in the home of the Queen of the Corner, a transvestite who falls hopelessly, shamelessly in love with \\"her\\" young sweaty hero. The story of these two oddly coupled people is told against the historical characters of Pinochet and his wife. At one point their paths actually cross when the Pinochets drive by and see from a distance this attractive couple, Carlos and the Queen, on a picnic. The dictator's wife is envious of the Queen's yellow polka-dot wide-brimmed hat. \\"Gonzalo [The First Lady's hairdresser] says that yellow is all the rage in Europe, it was the color of the spring-summer season. I'm going to tell him to get me one exactly like that.\\" Though a despised aging effeminate homosexual-- the Queen is in his forties with wisps of hair and dentures-- through the brilliant writing of Pedro Lemebel, he becomes the most sympathetic of characters. He who in abject poverty learns to create beautiful embroidery is contrasted with Pinochet's wife, a petty, scheming cellulite laden nonstop talker.<br />Consisting of contrasting and repeating scenes, this very visual novel could be made into either a fine stage production or movie or both. Carlos and the Queen have two tableau-like scenes, for example, early in the novel and near the end, when they go on a picnic. There is also the highly suspenseful sequence, broken down by time, \\"1600 hours\\", \\"1605 hours\\", \\"1800 hours\\", etc., when the happenings of the Dictator's motorcade is contrasted by the Queen's visit to an adult theatre. Mr. Lemebel is masterful with language. When the Queen has just cleaned out her apartment before fleeing to avoid being captured by the Dictator's henchmen--\\"Sitting and facing this view, she blew out puffs of smoke and asked herself, How do you look at something you will never see again?\\" When she sees Vina del Mar for the first time, a resort of \\"tourists and beautiful people,\\" she remembers what Lemebel calls \\"the miracle of the first time she saw the working-class sea.\\"<br />Trite as it sounds, this sometimes highly erotic novel is ultimately about love and how love, regardless of how difficult or unlikely to happen, redeems us. It is also about the triumph of the human spirit and good over evil, the making of something beautiful out of practically nothing (the beautiful tablecloth that the Queen makes) and finally the importance of courage and hope. MY TENDER MATADOR-- I won't give away the meaning of the title by discussing it-- is a moving and wonderful story.facing this view, she blew out puffs of smoke and asked herself, How do you look at something you will never see again?\\" When she sees Vina del Mar for the first time, a resort of \\"tourists and beautiful people,\\" she remembers what Lemebel calls \\"the miracle of the first time she saw the working-class sea.\\"<br />Trite as it sounds, this sometimes highly erotic novel is ultimately about love and how love, regardless of how difficult or unlikely to happen, redeems us.

Jeremy, the narrator, in his  thirties met and married the daughter of June Tremaine and Bernard Tremaine after they had long been separated. The story line is simple. June and Bernard had been been members of the Communist Party. Because of an unfortunate event, their lives are irrevocably changed. &quot;June came to God in 1946 through an encounter with evil in the form of two dogs. (Bernard found this construction of the event almost too embarrassing to discuss.)&quot; The narrator sets about to write a memoir of these two individuals and looks into his own heart as well. &quot;In this memoir I have included certain incidents from my own life. . .  that are open equally to Bernard's and to June's kind of interpretation. . . Rationalist and mystic, commissar and yogi, joiner and abstainer, scientist and intuitionist, Bernard and June are the extremities, the twin poles along whoses slippery axis my own unbelief slithers and never comes to rest.&quot;<br />All the earmarks of a McEwan novel are here. The writer appeals equally to the reader's intellect and emotions, and the story is filled with suspense. For example, we read constantly about the horrible event concerning the black dogs but do not find out what actually happened to June that fateful day in 1946 until late in the novel. Then there is the usual ambiguity with the two conflicting versions of what the dogs may or may not have done previously. As always, the writer's descriptive prose in impeccable. We have the narrator's description of June: &quot;How did a round face become so long? Could it really have been the life, rather than the genes, that caused that little crease above the eyebrows pushed up by her smile to take root and produce the wrinkle tree that reached right to the hairline?&quot; Finally, McEwan, while telling a good story, writes perceptive paragraph after paragraph about the nature of people. &quot;It is photography itself that creates the illusion of innocence.

I finished this fascinating book later the same day I had read in my local daily newspaper that in 2001 a former assistant basketball coach at the University of Georgia  had given a final exam for the only grade in a &quot;Coaching Principles and Strategies of Basketball&quot; course that consisted of 20 multiple choice questions. Two of the 18 questions included how many goals are on a basketball court and how many points does a 3-point field goal account for in a basketball game. So learning about teachers like Ms. Kirschenbaum provides a much needed antidote for the latest news item about education in Georgia. She begins this beautiful book with the following statement: &quot;I will never forget the day that changed my life forever. [With the exception of the wondrous first letter &quot;I&quot; which I cannot describe, I believe those words are in burnt sienna] I was teaching The Canterbury Tales when one of my students raised her hand and asked, 'Ms. Kirschenbaum, how come our books are not in color, like they used to be?'&quot; The author, for ten years a teacher of English at the Bayard Rustin High School for the Humanities, located just a mile or so from Ground Zero, set about to find an answer to that question. The result is this beautiful book of many colors, designed, written and  printed in a &quot;feminine&quot; very reader-friendly font that Ms. Kirschenbaum herself designed.<br />Ms. Kirschenbaum has certainly done her homework. There are 363 pages of text and another 50 or so footnotes. The book is filled with quotations from artists, writers and scientists about the significance of color and all its ramifications. The writer discusses the books before Gutenberg, though not accessible to common people, that were always in color. She also refers to the ancient Greeks, Chinese and Eqyptians who invariably wrote in color. She gives anecdotal evidence from her own teaching experience that an overwhelming number of her students would prefer reading, for instance, Homer, Poe et al in &quot;living color.&quot; I think the writer's two stongest points are (1) we are fast losing a whole generation of nonreading students to television, video games, and movies, all in color and (2) because of digital printing, books in color can now be produced economically.<br />Ms. Kirschenbaum discusses many writers, some who used color effectively in their prose, and others whose works cry out for it: the artist and writer  William Morris, and William Blake, whom she describes as the &quot;only instance after Gutenberg of a great poet and a great painter married into one magnificent soul.&quot; On Emily Dickinson: &quot;Her manuscripts are bubbling with body language [in red letters] -- long dashes, short dashes, angled dashes, crosses, pluses, minuses, waves, curves, line breaks. . . &quot; Finally the writer makes a good case-- Faulkner himself wanted it-- for THE SOUND AND THE FURY to be printed in color.<br />Ms. Kirschenbaum's theory of designer writing has been well received except by some &quot;academics.&quot; (The quotations are mine.) &quot;Some people in the academy have refused to take me seriously because I teach high school and not college; because I have only a master's degree and not a doctorate; because I am not an Ivy Leaguer; and God knows what else.&quot; One professor even called her &quot;Madame Nobody.&quot; She's in good company since Miss Dickinson would say, &quot;I'm nobody/who are you?&quot; And Robert Frost didn't have a Ph.D as I recall.<br />In addition to the brilliant illustrations and colored images here, the text, almost all of it in color, is clear and well written. And Ms. Kirschenbaum is a great punster, both verbal and visual. She sold me on this book when, in first thumbing through it, I found a delightful visual pun at the beginning of the footnotes.<br />What comes through in every page of this book, which I cannot adequately describe, is that Ms. Kirschenbaum is the most dedicated of teachersand decent of people. &quot;Whenever I visit a museum, I seem, unavoidably, to be reminded of my mortality and of the precious chance [red letters] I have been given, as a young American woman, to make a difference in the lives of others.&quot; Chaucer would have said of her, &quot;gladly did she learn and gladly did she teach.&quot;<br />You must see this book for yourself. I am at a loss as to how to best describe it.and decent of people. &quot;Whenever I visit a museum, I seem, unavoidably, to be reminded of my mortality and of the precious chance [red letters] I have been given, as a young American woman, to make a difference in the lives of others.&quot; Chaucer would have said of her, &quot;gladly did she learn and gladly did she teach.&quot;<br />You must see this book for yourself.

The book is beautiful, the layout-- lots of yellow-- is inviting, the photographs of these desserts make your want to cook them, and there are a lot of unusual recipes here.<br />The minus: Last night I baked the lemon tart photographed on the front cover. The recipe is easy enough to qualify for my &quot;quick and easy dessert recipes for the lazy cook.&quot; The problem is that Ms. Longbotham doesn't give enough instructions. Please tell me what the following statement means: &quot; . . . and continue stirring until the dough begins to come together when a small bit is pressed between your fingers.&quot; I don't have the foggiest notion  what she means here. I do know the consistency dough must have before you attempt to bake it so I figured out what to do on my own. And I suppose any fool could look at the photograph and tell that at some point you've got to get the tart out of the pan, but Ms. Longbotham doesn't tell you that. I went to another dessert cookbook and found pages of instructions on tart baking so I found out-- among other things-- that I could use the baking sheet like a huge spatula for sliding the completed and cooled tart onto a serving plate. But shouldn't that information have been here? I think so.<br />In the author's defense, I did read through other recipes later and they seemed to have all the directions necessary. Maybe I just chose a lemon! Seriously the tart was delicious. I took it to work today and am taking an empty plate home.	2004-03-04

John Dugdale lost all sight in one eye and has only 20% vision in the other, the results of CMV caused by HIV. Most of these photographs are of still lifes, Mr. Dugdale's friends and family and himself. The models are invariably posed nude. &quot;This is why I continually photograph people nude, to show that in and under the skin we are all much the same.&quot; Only one or two photographs were done before Mr. Dugdale's blindness. He now shoots with an 8 x 10 camera and gets help from friends in focusing. Most of the photographs, all of which, cover a full page of the book, are accompanied with text by the photographer. He also includes scripture from the Book or Common Prayer as well as poetry by Emily Dickinson. Lines such as &quot;We grow accustomed to the Dark-- When Light is put away&quot; and &quot;And then the Windows failed--and then/I could not see to see&quot; from two of the poems are appropriate to describe the photos.<br />Mr. Dugdale obviously has lived through what Ms. Dickinson would call &quot;the hour of lead&quot; and quietly triumphs. He I think would agree with the poet that &quot;hope is the thing with feathers.&quot; Even though he misses most not being able to read and to see other people's eyes, he still buys books &quot;for the day I may be able to read them again.&quot;<br />Viewing these beautiful photographs will strengthen your faith in the gentle courage of this artist and in his ability to prevail under great adversity.	2004-03-04

If I had to sum up THE ANATOMY OF HOPE in one sentence, this would be it: this amazing book will make you sing. I would have finished it the day it arrived in the mail had I not had a house guest I had to tend to. After finishing the book the next night, I was so hyped up that I couldn't go to sleep for hours. I wanted to give it to everyone I care about, including my doctor.<br />Dr. Groopman discusses hope and its impact on the ability of patients to fight serious, sometimes life-threatening illnesses. He gives the examples of several patients of his over the years and the effect that hope had on their recovery from illness. He also traces his own growth in helping patients. Dr. Groopman learns how to relate to patients through trial and error. \\"I was still feeling my way on how to communicate a poor prognosis to patients and their families. Not once during my schooling, internship, or residency had I been instructed in the skill.\\" The first patient he discusses, Esther, he saw while he was still a medical student. She believed she deserved to have breast cancer because she had had an extra-marital affair. He later learned that she sought treatment too late and died at the age of thirty-four. Dr. Groopman assists another doctor with the treatment of the second patient. She interprets \\"remission\\" as a cure for a serious malignancy. The other physician had given her part of the truth but not the whole truth. When she ultimately learns she is dying, she and her family are angry at the doctor. \\"I guess he [the doctor] doesn't think people like us are smart enough, or strong enough, to handle the truth.\\"<br />Along Dr. Groopman's journey, he encounters a physician patient who insists on a difficult and painful treatment that Dr. Groopman didn't recommend. This patient was alive many years after his cure. \\"It took George Griffin [the doctor patient] to teach me that omniscience about life and death is not within a physician's purview. A doctor should never write off a person a priori.\\" There is a Vietnam veteran seriously ill with a cancer that calls for immediate treatment or he will surely die. The patient is obstinate about not having therapy, that it will not work. Dr. Groopman is able to bargain with him. The patient has the right to stop treatment at any time and must understand that he is in the \\"driver's seat\\" all the way.<br />The most poignant patient for me was Barbara, a 67 year-old woman whose breast cancer has metastasized. We meet her in the chapter called \\"Undying Hope.\\" The good doctor probably would say that he learns far more from her than she gets from him although he of course gives the patient his best. After many months of harrowing treatment, she does not want to stop, however. \\"'There are many moments during the day that still give me pleasure,'she said. 'Let's keep going.'\\" The moment comes when the doctor must tell Barbara that there is nothing else he can offer to help her. After \\"heavy silence,\\" she responds that he can still give her the \\"medicine of friendship.\\" The patient ultimately dies. \\"Although I had expected this outcome for quite some time, I felt a gnawing pain of loss. I accepted that medicine had its limits. It was just that I cared for her so much; it was impossible not to. But I also felt deep gratitude. Barbara had opened herself to me in a way no patient had before. A patient's revelation of her deepest feelings and thoughts is one of the most previous gifts a doctor can receive. It has happened with me when I have reached the level of relationship I did with Barbara, of friendship beyond the professional.\\" And finally, \\"there are some patients whom a doctor grows to love. . . Barbara had sparked that love in me.\\"<br />The author is not talking here about false hope, denial or the information that the Louise Hays of the world dispense when they blame the victim, that patients who don't get better have a need not to and are weak individuals. I still remember someone saying about a friend with AIDS in the 80's who had come down with pneumonia: \\"I refuse to go to see him because he had a need to get pneumonia.\\" (This kind of thinking is maddening.) The author gives us hard data and looks at the changes in the brain when we have hope: \\"It turns out that we have our own natural forms of morphine--within our brains are chemicals akin to opiates. These chemicals are called 'endorphins' and 'enkephalins.' Belief and expectation, cardinal components of hope, can block pain by releasing the brain's endorphins and enkephalins, thereby mimicking the effects of morphine.\\"<br />Dr. Groopman is obviously a brilliant and competent practitioner, but he is also wise beyond measure. \\"I try hard to let patients read in my eyes that there is true hope for them. . . Doctors are fallible, not only in how they wield a scalpel or prescribe a drug but in the language they use.\\" So much wisdom here, much about faith and how it differs from hope. At one point the doctor says that hope has wings. I wonder if he knew that the poet Emily Dickinson said that \\"hope is the thing with feathers.\\"<br />I repeat: this amazing book will make you sing.d with AIDS in the 80's who had come down with pneumonia: \\"I refuse to go to see him because he had a need to get pneumonia.\\" (This kind of thinking is maddening.)

In the depths of a dark, dank winter evening, these photographs of beautiful, swarthy men will bring you summer sunshine. When I see Kristen Bjorn models, I always wonder where he found them. Neither I nor anyone I have ever known has ever had a sighting of one of these gods in the flesh. If they were paintings instead of photographs, I'd swear they came from the artist's imagination.<br />For those familiar with Bjorn's books and erotic videos, this is just much more of a very good thing. Even if you prefer blonds-- and gentlemen do-- you'll change your mind after a run-through of these models ready for action. There's only one man here who could be classified as a blond. But there are lots of Latinos and black men-- and a few with that unique combination of black hair and blue eyes.<br />The models are posed at the beach, on mountains, on leather sofas, in the jungle, and the hooty cover shot with purple irises. My favorite photo is of two nude men with a view of Rio I believe in the background. All the photos are flawlessly composed and in glowing color. Several of the shots have 3 or 4 or 5  buffed men in them, all the same height, in keeping with Bjorn's vision of perfection.<br /> A  Falcon model, himself, before he went to the other side of the camera, Bjorn reminds of that and includes a color photo of himself, along with a short bio at the end of the book. He's every bit as handsome as the men he photographs.	2004-02-27

I was taken particularly with the illustration from the Tate Museum of the family's viewing \\"The Cholmondeley Ladies by British School, seventeen century.\\" One of my favorite paintings from the Tate, a print of it hangs in my home.<br />The story, apparently autobiographical, is about a family-- Mom, Pop and two boys-- who go for an outing at the Tate. Only Mom and the narrator, who ultimately becomes an artist, are really into this visit. Mom asks questions to the children in an effort to awaken their interest in great art. Dad, not to be outdone, keeps a running supply of corny jokes going.<br />The book title comes from a game the author's mother used to play with her dad. \\"The first person draws a shape - any shape, it's not supposed to be anything, just a shape. The next person has to change it into something. It's fantastic. . . And, in a way, I've been playing the shape game ever since.\\"<br />If this beautifully illustrated little volume gets one child to appreciate art, it will be well worth the money the parents paid for it. It's the next best thing to visit a gallery or museum.	2004-02-22

Here he parses the sentences made by the fair right and other monsters to point up their lies, half-lies, innuendoes, quotations out of context ad nauseam. Mr. Franken lists his sources and backs his statements up with references in the back of the book, not that that means anything to his critics. Thank you, Mr. Franken, for reminding us once again of the many good things that President Clinton did for America. That information alone would make the book worth reading.<br />There are lots of funny things here - \\"Operation Chickenhawk\\" in which Lieutenant John Kerry's Vietnam troops consist of George W. Bush, who is usually a little tipsy; Dick Cheney, who in the heat of combat has a heart attack; Clarence Thomas who is into pornography, along with John Ashcroft, Bill O'Reilly, Phil Gramm and Rush Limbaugh. In the midst of this gaggle, Al Gore comes to to an article on Kerry. Delicious. Then there's the \\"No Child Left Behind Standardized Test\\" and the list of people-- Ashcroft, Ralph Reed, Phyllis Schlafly, Condoleezza Rice, the Cheneys, Pat Robertson et al-- whom Franken writes to get their personal abstinence stories. Then some of the scary stuff: I found it incredible when it happened and Franken reminded me that Max Cleland in the 2000 election was portrayed as \\"unpatriotic\\" by his opponent. This is a man who lost three limbs while serving in Vietnam. That that lie stuck and probably cost Cleland the election is scary beyond belief. Don't forget Jerry Falwell's statement on 9/13/01: \\"I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way--all of them who have tried to secularize America--I point the finger in their face, and say, 'you helped this happen'.\\" Well, the right Reverend Falwell forgot the little old ladies who play bingo on Wednesday nights. They are really what's sending this nation to hell in a wheelbarrow. But this book ultimately will make you sad, sad that we lost most of the world's  goodwill we gained after 9/11/01, sad that there is no civility left in government and politics. (I recently heard a taped conversation between President Kennedy and President Eisenhower in which Kennedy was asking Eisenhower's advice on what to do about an international crisis. There was respect and cordiality on both ends of the telephone. I don't believe that would happen in Washington today.) I was saddened that Paul Wellstone's memorial service in the hands of the right wingers became a \\"political rally\\" for Democrats.<br />My one problem with this book is that Mr. Frankel is so good that sometimes I cannot tell if he is joking or not.

US	51803143	R39B1FB4NOQME1	0374128731	414885638	Ultimate Punishment: A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty	Books	5	7	9	N	Y	A Well-researched, Well-written Book	Scott Turow was one of 14 members of a Commission named by the then Governor of Illinois, George Ryan to study and make recommendations on the state's death penalty law. This book is a result of that study. Turow discusses the usual arguments for and against this ultimate penalty. Some of his findings conclusions are expected; others were surprising, at least to me. The usual conclusions are here-- the vast majority of individuals convicted of crimes are guilty. Whether you get the death penalty or not depends on where you live. You are much more likely to get the death penalty in rural areas than in large urban areas. To quote Turow, other factors are \\". . . race, gender, geography, who the lawyers and jurors are, and the sheer serendipity of circumstances. . .\\" Some people are guilty of the crime of having the wrong defense lawyers, and, of course, of being poor. Turow discusses the case of Chris Thomas, a death row inmate, who had been defended by two private attorneys under contract with the local public defender's office that paid them $30,000 per year to defend 103 cases, one of which had to be a capital case. The two attorneys worked together on Thomas' case. One of them had never had any role in a death penalty case; the other had been standby counsel for a defendant, already under a death sentence in Ohio, who had represented himself. The attorneys therefore mounted a six hundred dollar defense for their client. I had always thought that black people are more likely to get the death penalty than whites. Not so, according to Turow; black people just get convicted more. In Illinois 70% of all persons convicted and sentence for first-degree murder are black; their victims have been 60% black. Once convicted, however,  white murderers are sentenced to death at a rate two and one half times that for black murderers. Turow's conclusion is that white people tend to kill other whites and that \\"choosing a white victim--turns out to be the controlling variable.\\" Turow also points out though that because wealth, power and status for the most part still is in the hands of white people, that race of course is a factor.<br />Some of Turow's chapters are \\"Convicting the Innocent\\",\\"Bad Faith\\", \\"The Victims\\",\\"Deterrence\\", \\"Redemption\\", \\"Will They Murder Again.\\" I was blown away to learn that some death penalty advocates can live with the notion of occasionally executing the innocent and make the comparison of childhood inoculations and driving an automobile. The overall good outweighs the risks. Turow disagrees with this logic, saying that the prospect of executing someone who is \\"blameless cases a special pall over the death penalty.\\" Turow discusses with great compassion the plight of victims' families and loved ones. \\"What made the deepest impression on me was my eventual recognition that losing a loved one to a murder is unlike any other blow delivered in our often-cruel lives.\\" He concludes, however, that the expressed desires of survivors should not be permitted in deciding who gets the death penalty.<br />Turow, who described himself as a \\"death penalty agnostic\\" when he began this study ultimately became a believer against the death penalty although he respects the judgment of the greater number of U. S. citizens who believe the death penalty should be given for the most horrific of crimes. Turow's conversion  certainly came not for religious reasons. Unlike Sister Helen Prejean, he maintains if his job called for it, he could \\"push the botton\\" if the crime were heinous enough. Even though Turow comes down ultimately against the death penalty, he says \\"I admit I am still attracted to a death penalty that would be available for the crimes of unimaginable dimensions. . . The pivotal question. . . is whether a system of justice can be constructed that reaches over the rare, right cases, without also occasionally condemning the innocent or the undeserving.\\" It is Turow's belief that the answer to that question is \\"no.\\"<br />As youwould expect from someone who is also a novelist, Turow writes with a great deal of flair in this insightful, well-reasoned book. Whether it will change anyone's opinion, who's to say? Everybody has opinions on abortion, gun control, gay marriage, the death penalty, etc. although people cannot express any logical reason their their views. Regardless of whether this book changes the way you think about the death penalty, you will come away from it better informed and should have an opinion you can back up with facts.would expect from someone who is also a novelist, Turow writes with a great deal of flair in this insightful, well-reasoned book.

The subjects are all photographed in the same fashion. They apparently showed up for the shoots wearing street clothes, were photographed in them and then photographed \\"naked.\\" Friedler explains the difference between the words \\"nude\\" and \\"naked\\", and I think he is correct here. \\"As I see it, photographing someone naked is about trying to get at some kind of truth, whereas photographing someone nude is linked more to sexual gratification, eroticism, or our conventions of beauty.\\" The subjects to a person all stand looking straight-on and unsmiling into the camera. They are all shot against an ugly brick wall and lit with unflattering, shadowless flat light. Ranging in age from 19 to 75, they are for the most part white with some black models and and a couple of what job applications might label \\"other.\\" There is a pregnant woman, a grossly overwight woman, skinny folks, a breast implant or two, tall, short, et al. As the photographer says in his definition of \\"naked\\", there's not much pretty here. And being \\"naked\\" certainly is a great equalizer. A walk through a steam room or communal shower proves Mr. Friedler's theory of equality. All we know about the models is their occupations and ages. While there are a couple of upper income types here-- a pediatrician and an attorney, for instance, most of them are at the other end of the pay scale-- school bus driver and cashier-- to name two. Perhaps they had less to lose by baring their all. There are some occupations on the edge here, transexual karate instructor, porno star, prostitute, dream interpreter, closet queen-- whatever that means--junkie-- I thought that was a condition rather than an occupation--piercer's apprentice, erotic masseur. Then there is a limo dispatcher aka New York's most tattooed man.<br />While these photographs show the influence of both Richard Avedon and Diane Arbus, the differences are obvious. Avedon for the most part shot unsmiling  celebrities looking straight into his camera against a white background. Friedler obviously goes one step further or several feet downward for the full monty here. Arbus apparently did some of her work without the cooperation or knowledge of her subjects, something she should have been ashamed of. Friedler, on the other hand, had the full cooperation of everybody concerned.<br />This book generates a lot of questions. How did Friedler select his subjects or weed out the bad apples, to mix a metaphor? (How could there be any bad apples in this 20th Century Eden shoot?) Age, sex, occupation and race must have entered into his decision but he doesn't tell us that. Could this project have been so successful in a much smaller, city or town, say Columbus, Georgia or Dayton, Ohio? Did the subjects tell their friends and family about their afternoon of exposure or wait to be discovered at the bookstore? Why did the models do this? Two or three models say why on the back cover of the book, and the photographer has some ideas on the subject as well. I suspect there may be as many different answers as there are people here.<br />What impressed me most about this book is that the Norton Company, that staid keeper of truth when it comes to college literature, is the publisher. That says volumes-- speaking of which, Mr. Friedler has done a similar work for LA and London. Lady Thatcher naked? Wouldn't it be great if Friedler could do a series like this for U. S. Senators or big city mayors or CEO's of big corporations? Imagine the books he would sell.nd Diane Arbus, the differences are obvious.

Age, sex, occupation and race must have entered into his decision but he doesn't tell us that. Could this project have been so successful in a much smaller, city or town, say Columbus, Georgia or Dayton, Ohio? Did the subjects tell their friends and family about their afternoon of exposure or wait to be discovered at the bookstore? Why did the models do this? Two or three models say why on the back cover of the book, and the photographer has some ideas on the subject as well. I suspect there may be as many different answers as there are people here.<br />What impressed me most about this book is that the Norton Company, that staid keeper of truth when it comes to college literature, is the publisher. That says volumes-- speaking of which, Mr. Friedler has done a similar work for LA and London. Lady Thatcher naked? Wouldn't it be great if Friedler could do a series like this for U. S. Senators or big city mayors or CEO's of big corporations? Imagine the books he would sell.	2004-02-15

This book reminds me-- I swear I'm telling the truth-- of Dolly Parton's \\"Hard Rock Christmas.\\" Something tells me Ms. Parton would like this book if she saw it. If you own this book, you can have Christmas the whole year long. The words \\"sated\\" and \\"abundance of riches\\" come to mind in describing these photographs. There are approximately 350 pages here, beautifully reproduced in color, of sexy young men whom Walter Kundzicz photographed in the 1950's and 1960's. To avoid the clutches of \\"Big Brother\\" and get around the laws against nudity, Mr. Kundzicz posed many of his models in see-through posing straps. According to his interesting article here about Champion Studio, he was not always successful in avoiding prosecution, however, particularly from a police force heavily influenced by the Catholic Church. From what we know now, the church would have spent its time more productively \\"policing\\" its own. But that's another story. It's scary to see what the laws were and such a short time ago.<br />Kudos to Reed Massengill for, in the words of Mr. Kundzicz, \\"managing the publication\\" of this book and seeing to completion yet another fine book of male photographs. You'll return to this delicious book again and again for more candy!	2004-02-12

The men are young, handsome, built well, and all appear to be having a good time in this book of color photographs by Sam Carson. Much has been made that this is the first book of this sort by Carson who is an architect by profession although apparently he has been doing this kind of photography for sometime. Additionally, all the models are amateurs and doing this for the first time. Hence the title FIRST EXPOSURE. It shouldn't be a great leap, however, to go from designing well-constructed, beautiful buildings to photographing well-built beautiful bodies. After all, f stops and apertures can be learned by taking a class or picking up a camera manual; people with a photographer's eye are born, not taught.<br />About half the models here are nude; the others, just as fetching, are advertisements for all the brands of men's underwear. Some of the companies represented here should pay Mr. Carson a fee for all this free publicity.<br />Almost all these stunning photographs appear to be shot in natural light. No strobe light will ever light a photograph as beautifully as nature does.<br />There isn't a mediocre photograph in the entire collection here. Finally, thank you, Mr. Carson, for not telling us what we are seeing. There is not one word of description or explanation about any of the photographs. Nor do we need any.	2004-02-12

Sarah Wode-Douglas, the editor of a poetry magazine in London, travels to Malaysia with one John Slater a writer a little like Truman Capote without the mincing-- that is, he is more famous for being a famous writer than for writing--a man she thinks had an affair with her mother and is responsible for her death. There they meet a Christopher Chubb, an aging Australian. Chubb tells a story that has shades of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, Joseph's HEART OF DARKNESS, Coleridge's &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; and is as convoluted as The DA VINCI CODE.<br />Central to the story is a literary hoax based on an incident that actually took place in Australia, according to the Author's Note at the end of this fairly short novel. (266 pages)You may not care a whit about poetry, pretentious intellectuals or literary hoaxes; on the other hand, you will race through this novel with the speed you read any first rate mystery. I had no abiding love for any of these characters but was fascinated by this great tale.<br />Mr. Carey is nothing is not a master of the language, should I say Australian. There are nice Australian touches: &quot;he said he would give me a hiding if I did not get off his irises straight away&quot; and &quot;I therefore was forced to take shank's pony to the city but I am used to walking. . .&quot;<br />Surely Carey is saying something about literary criticism, which can be one of the world's most pretentious endeavors. There is the question of what is real and what isn't and how significant is poetry after all? Sarah, the first person narrator, opines that there is no value that can be put on fine poetry: &quot;. . . but what price would I put on a Shakespeare sonnet? How much for Milton, Donne, Coleridge, Yeats?&quot; W. H. Auden, whom Slater knew, is quoted in the novel. I remember, however, that Auden said that &quot;poetry makes nothing happen.&quot;<br />Hey, I don't believe you have to be an English major to like this novel.

A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the chagrin of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is wealthy. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married.  Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I recently reread this comedy of manners that I hadn't read since high school. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married. Even though we in the U. S. have lived through the 60's and the &quot;Women's Movement,&quot; sixty percent of law students now are women, and many things have changed about the way young women are brought up and what they do with their lives, I still saw a lot of families I know here. Everything changes; yet everything remains the same.<br />Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are quite wonderful in what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than &quot;venison&quot; or &quot;meat.&quot; While people often &quot;color&quot; when they blush, the only color named in the entire novel is blue; Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play. We do know that Elizabeth plays rather badly. I kept thinking that these young girls have too much free time on their hands. They need more hobbies or part-time jobs. Of course young women of a certain station in Austin's day didn't work.<br /> The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.&quot; With that great opener, we are off and running.<br />Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own.these young girls have too much free time on their hands.

Horst, Herbert List, George Hoyningen-Huene, Wilhelm Von Gloeden and Man Ray. (I suppose we should add Andy Warhol to the list although I believe his greatest talent was his indefatigable self-promotion.) There are also photos here by Harriet Leibowitz, Roy Blakey and Tom Bianchi. My three favorites are by Henning Von Berg from his series &quot;Factory Boyz&quot;, the beautifully lit photograph of Robert Blanchon by George Mott, and Greg Friedler's &quot;Untitled.&quot; But where is the fine work by Bruce Weber, Herb Ritts, Greg Gorman, George Dureau,Thomas Eakins, John Dugdale, Jock Sturgis and Helmut Newton? Yes, both Newton and Sturgis did photograph nude males occasionally; I have seen them. Since this book is called &quot;a celebration of the male nude from 90 of the world's greatest photograhers,&quot; certainly the inclusion of any or all of these artists would have given more credibility to the editor's claim. Speaking of credibility, this collection would have more of that if both the editor and writer of the foreward had not been included in this collection. (Certainly the photographs of both Reed Massengill and Phil Braham are good ones-- I'd be happy to own either one of them. I just think this is more chutzpah than is necessary here.) Any collection of this sort that doesn't include a photograph by George Platt Lynes has lost its chance of coming close to being considered a definitive work. Finally, if &quot;beefcake&quot; photographers like Bruce of Los Angeles, Champion, Lon of New York and Bob Mizer are here, then why not include something by Kristen Bjorn? Nobody is better at beefcake than this gentleman.<br />The photographs of older men with less than perfect bodies add a nice dimension to this book as well as those that show a sense of humor on the part of the photographer. I refer here to &quot;Shoe Ad 1&quot; by Terry Richardson. The photographers are shown in alphabetical order. That seems as good a way to categorize them as any. The biographical sketches are informative. I'm not sure we need Mr. Braham's explanations of what we are seeing, however.

They marry quickly, live with his mother whom he works for in the family grocery store, have two children quickly, then a third and live lives of quiet desperation. Sound familiar? Tyler maintains that this couple is mismatched and that they were amateurs about marriage. I would argue that there is a little bit of them in almost every married couple I know, that we are all &quot;amateurs&quot; when it comes to choosing a mate. Pauline and Michael could fit atop almost every  wedding cake I've seen.<br />Here are more examples of Pauline and Michael as every couple. They often quarrel but are not sure why they are angry with each other. Pauline often describes their children as &quot;my&quot; children rather than &quot;our&quot; children. (I wish I had a dollar for every time I've heard one spouse make that statement.) Because of what their oldest child Lindy does-- she runs away from home-- &quot;it meant that Michael never again had a moment of pure joy.&quot; About Pauline, Michael says that &quot;she was a good person, really. Well, and so was Michael himself, he believed. It was only that the two of them weren't nice. They weren't always very nice to each other; he couldn't explain just why.&quot; George, Pauline and Michael's son, feels that he married his mother. (How often have we heard that statement?) Michael has no hobbies. Pauline has had the same women friends for years, but has &quot;lost the ability to pass judgment on these women. She didn't even know if she liked them, in fact, and perhaps she didn't like them, but by now it hardly mattered because how would she ever start over with somebody new, at this point?&quot; At one point late in the novel when the children are telling stories about their mother, Michael doesn't recognize the woman they are describing.<br />Although Ms. Tyler writes about the everyday dullness of a marriage, this novel is never, never dull. You know dozens of things about these wonderfully developed characters and ultimately care desperately about them. I found a sorrow sometimes just under the surface and other times palpable that I do not recall from reading other Tyler novels. Perhaps it's because the author is older now or we have lived through September 11, 2001-- the novel ends after 9/11/01-- or because we experience Pauline and Michael's lives over such a long period of time. At any rate, even those these two characters often didn't like each other very much, they never stopped loving each other on some level. I could rename them after a dozen couples I know.<br />This most perceptive novel is as good as any Anne Tyler has written.rites about the everyday dullness of a marriage, this novel is never, never dull.

As always, Maida Heatter continues to amaze with her fantastic recipes. Apparently she has travelled this country far and wide to collect the very best of dessert recipes once again. There are certainly other fine authors of dessert cookbooks out there, but no one surpasses this lady. She has information on ingredients, equipment and techniques. (I now know how to make my own brown sugar, should I ever want to.) She has chapters on cakes; pies and tarts; yeast cakes; sweet breads, gingerbreads, and muffins; cookies and crackers; custards, mousses, souffles, etc.; fruit desserts and finally ice cream and other frozen desserts.<br />Ms. Heatter seldom spends less than two pages on the simplest of recipes so there is practically no way you can make a mistake when making any of these desserts. Who else, for example, would spend over three pages describing how to bake a pie shell? A cake she has labelled &quot;The Best Damn Lemon Cake&quot;, a simple loaf cake, takes up two pages. Fine as this cake is-- I have baked it--the East 62nd Street Lemon Cake in another of Ms. Heatter's books is even better and clearly the best lemon cake I've ever baked or tasted.<br />There are two other recipes in this cookbook I swear by. One is the Chocolate Souffle Cake on pages 36-38. This darkly rich flourless cake with the texture inside of a chocolate mousse bakes at 300 degrees for 2 1/4 hours. You can put this cake together in no time at all, and you will be rewarded four-fold for your efforts. It's as good a flourless chocolate cake as you will find. The second recipe is the Old-Fashioned Butterscotch Pie. Once again this recipe covers over three pages, 178-181. Heatter describes this pie as an &quot;old Southern recipe.&quot; My own mother has been making a similar pie for over 60 years and has helped clog the arteries of many a partaker at church socials in her neighborhood with these desserts. This pie has a rich butterscotch taste, not too sweet, and has the consistency of poured silk. Although I have watched my mother make this pie dozens of times-- she swears it must be made in an iron skillet-- I am intimidated by what looks like an effortless endeavor on her part and was glad to find this recipe on my own.d silk.

I do not pretend to know much about Italian desserts, but I have baked enough cheesecakes to know a good one when I bake one. I am basing my evaluation of this cookbook on one recipe alone, the outrageously good crustless Sicilian Ricotta Cheesecake on pages 220-221. You can stir up this light concoction in minutes. You don't need to beat this one, unlike American cheesecakes.  It is the easiest cheesecake I've ever made and qualifies for the &quot;quick and easy&quot; category of cooking. The cake is light and airy, almost like a souffle, and probably has fewer calories than the usual ones heavy laden with cream cheese. Your guests can eat this delicious cheesecake without guilt.<br />There are literally dozens of dessert recipes here in chapters on yeast-risen pastries, fried pastries, puff pastry, cream puff pastry, plain cakes, cakes with fruit, layer cakes, biscotti, ices and frozen desserts, etc.<br />I have tried many of Mr. Malgieri's dessert recipes from his other cookbooks and have never found one that didn't work. I would therefore try any of these with confidence.	2004-01-26

For those of you, like me, who think the color blue is one of  the best things God ever did for us will find this book fascinating. Ms. Recio divides the book into an introduction, four chapters-- Feeling Blue, Seeing Blue, Creating Blue, Discovering Blue and a conclusion, Into the Blue. The book contains literally hundreds of facts about the color blue, some of them well-known and others quite obscure. Some of her conclusions are well-founded, others are speculative; and that's okay. Blue is symbolic of virtue, quality, heaven, the divine, purity-- the Virgin's cloak is often a beautiful shade of blue. For Hebrews, blue is the color of the glory of God. The flag of Israel is blue and white. The flag of the U. S. contains the color blue. Blue is associated with law and order-- as in police uniforms-- serenity, calmness (doctors' offices are often in shades of blue.) As seen from space the earth is blue. The ocean is blue. Many people do their bedrooms in blue or blue and white, a restful combination of colors. Ms. Recio discusses the color blue in art-- the Impressionists' obsession with blue-- in music-- the blues, bluegrass, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, &quot;Mood Indigo,&quot; et cetera-- peacocks, butterflies, morning glories. The significance of blue in fashion, blue jeans, a navy blue suit for confidence and sobriety. I can testify that when I wear a navy pinstripe suit that the Red Sea parts for me. People are drawn to me like moths to a flame-- a blue one of course.<br />In addition to lots of facts and suggestions about blue-- my favorite is that the abstract painter Wassily Kandinsky, an accomplished cellist, considered the cello to be dark blue-- there are many beautiful blue photographs here illustrating the author's thesis.	2004-01-26

Hayes has written seven stories here, six of which are as good as any I've read in a long time. The stories are all set in South Boston. Most of them are about boys on the verge of being adults who are experiencing sexual awakenings that the Catholic Church, their parents and society have told them are forbidden and shameful. These boys are tough and sometimes bullies. Some of them live in the projects; all are from blue-collar famillies. Their futures in general are bleak. If they survive, they will be forever scarred. For most of these young men, their happiness of loving completely another man lasts for just a moment. Sooner or later, they will die in South Boston.<br />Who can forget Jimmy Callahan, a fireman with three children, two boys and a fragile daugher, and a shrew for a wife? Jimmy has one night of love with another firefighter. \\"But under June's [the wife] watchful eye, it wasn't long before Jimmy was back leading the life that had been so carefully planned for him.\\" The reader understands that Jimmy will attend mass every Sunday for the next 30 or 40 years, will never see his friend again and will die a broken, old man.<br />Then there is the narrator of the title story who has to live with what he has done to help ruin the life of his high school gym teacher who, unlike the narrator, showed great dignity and grace under pressure. You won't quickly forget either the homeless, crazed Joey who sleeps in a \\"washer machine box\\" and talks to squirrels. When you find out why he is crazy-- what happens to his beloved Kev in addition to Joey's homophobic parents-- his father thinks all gay people should be put on an island and then have an \\"A-Bomb\\" dropped on them-- he will break your heart.<br />Hayes is a powerful writer who is so good at what he does that you can almost hear his characters breathe with forbidden desire. In these stories, although you are on a roller coaster ride that you know will end in tragedy, you cannot put the book down.	2004-01-24

BLIND EYE, the latest volume in John Morgan Wilson's mysteries about Benjamin Justice and the first without the word \\"justice\\" in the title, could have just as easily have been called \\"Blind Justice.\\" Justice, our ex-newspaper reporter, is back with a vengence and has recovered from much of his self-pity that permeated THE LIMITS OF JUSTICE. I like him much better this time around. He takes his meds regularly and only occasionally lapses into immobilizing depressions. He also has moments of self-awareness and becomes quite a sympathetic character.<br />Justice, when this novel begins, has just received an advance to write his autobiography and in order to set the record straight, attempts to find a Catholic priest who began molesting him when he was twelve. As you would suspect, the plot gets quite byzantine as more and more high church officals are implicated. The story obviously is as current as the news of the last couple of years. Although there are some evil church people here, there are good priests and nuns as well.<br />Some of the previous characters return-- they are almost like old friends now-- and Justice is still reading Walter Mosley. This time it's BAD BOY BRAWLY BROWN. He also reads Graham Greene, an appropriate writer for such a Catholic story.<br />With Michael Nava apparently in retirement, Mr. Wilson gets my vote for the best writer of gay mysteries around.	2004-01-20

In addition to the recipes, there is much information about almost everyone on the Sopranos. The introduction is by Artie Bucco; he then interviews several members of the Soprano family-- Janice, Junior, Carmela. Tony et al. Carmela on why she does all the cooking for her family herself and doesn't hire a cook: &quot;I don't like strangers in my house, nor does Tony.&quot; I bet. Tony gives advice on how to grill perfectly and points out that grilling is almost genetically a masculine activity. We can only hope that he doesn't pass out from an anxiety attack and fall into the lighted grill. There are lots of food tips here--party tips by Carmela and Charmaine-- as well as Junior's advice on how to live long and well.<br />These Italian recipes, which Artie tells us when the world thinks Italian food, they really mean Neapolitan food, to my unpracticed eye appear to be quite comprehensive. I know that a lot of good desserts are included. I can testify to the quality of Mom's Pear and Grappa Pound Cake on page 71. It's moist and light with a nice flavor of alcohol that does not overpower. There are also recipes for Baba au Rhum, Cannoli, Tiramisu, Zabaglione and a Ricotta-Pineapple Pie that Carmela made for a local professional woman on one of the shows. &quot;She must have really enjoyed it--she came trhough so nicely,&quot; Carmela tells Artie. Hey, I don't want to take anything away from this lady's cooking skills, but as I remember the series, the professional &quot;came through&quot; after Tony turned up the heat on her.<br /> There are many color photographs of members of the cast as well as of the food. This cookbook is a lot of fun.	2004-01-20

If I hadn't read two previous John Morgan Wilson mysteries, I would like this one a lot more. Although I continue to like immensely Mr. Wilson's novels, THE LIMITS OF JUSTICE is my least favorite so far and suffers when compared to the other two, SIMPLE JUSTICE and JUSTICE AT RISK. My criticisms are two: first, the main character Benjamin Justice should get on with living. I understand that his life has not been easy. We learned three stories ago that he murdered his own father when he caught him raping his own daughter and Benjamin's sister. I won't give away the plot of this novel, but nobody has sympathy for a whiner forever. Secondly, Mr. Wilson gets a little carried away with both plot and subject matter here. He covers AIDS, incest, pederasty, the cult of man-boy love, castration, alcoholism and sleazy biographers. There are a couple of what I call Steve McQueen car chases as well as other near-death adventures for Mr. Justice. This is not to say there aren't touching scenes here. Rod Preston's ex-wife's remembrance of the difficulty of being gay in the 50's is quite moving as well as Justice's landlord Maurice's repeated attempts to get him out of his depression.<br />In addition to Justice's landlords, his PNB (potential new boy friend) Oree returns in this novel as well as Templeton, Justice's reporter friend, who now has landed a job with the LA Times. (This time she is the one reading the latest Walter Mosley mystery as Wilson continues his tribute to Mosley.)<br />This book may be better than I think or I may have read it at a bad time.

The men have nice, natural bodies without being &quot;buffed and waxed.&quot;  And believe it or not, they have hair, both on their heads--some actually have tresses to their shoulders-- and bodies. For that reason they look very 70's. They also look very innocent and appear to be having a good time. Some of them smile directly into the camera. I couldn't help but ask the question though-- there is no information given about who these models are-- as to how many of them are still alive today.<br />All the photos are shot in a studio with incredible lighting. Some of my favorites are found on pages 53,54 and 104.<br />Reed Massengill, who edited this book, remembers the first time he saw a Blakey photo in a short-lived magazine of the 70's called &quot;After Dark.&quot; I remember fondly my first enconter with that magazine as well. I still have all my copies somewhere. (It was the rag that the now Governor of California chose for his full monty spread.) Mr. Blakey to his credit was shooting male nudes when almost nobody else in the U. S. was. This book, however, is much more than just a nostalgic picture of life before the awful 80's. These beautiful photographs will endure.	2004-01-13

If you are looking for a nice mystery where everything gets worked out almost mathematically in the end, this book is not for you. If, however, you are prepared to be blown away by a story that stetches the very limits of the mystery genre, then this one's for you. Mr. Wilson creates larger-than-life characters, many of whom you will care about desperately. And all the good guys don't win in the end. Sound like life? The novel ends with important questions not answered. Perhaps we'll get those answers in the next in this series if we find out whether or not Benjamin Justice is at risk.<br />Mr. Wilson, through the main character and narrator, Ben Justice, grapples with difficult subjects: corruption in the LA Police Department--there are references to the Rodney King debacle--corruption in the newspaper media, the insanity of &quot;barebacking.&quot; Along with Justice, we meet again Harry and Templeton as well as Justice's older landlords. (Actually they're touring Europe on a sort of second honeymoon while Justice looks after their animals and housesits for them.)<br />Wilson secondarily has almost written a travelogue for a great part of Los Angeles. I got a better feel for this city from him than I have gotten from other &quot;serious&quot; travel writers.<br />Early in the novel, Ben stops at a mystery bookstore to buy the last copy of Walter Mosley's GONE FISHIN', as Wilson once again pays tribute to another fine California mystery writer.	2004-01-13

You get a good sense of that from looking at all of the small copies of all the photos published at the end of this volume. That is no small accomplishment. Many of the nudes and/or erotic photographs have been around for so long and reproduced so often that they have almost become cliches. For example, the series of \\"Fred With Tires.\\" These show up in calendars, refrigerator magnets, posters ad nauseam. The nine photographs of Bill T. Jones, one of which graces the cover of this hefty volume, should be called \\"Eunuch, I-IX.\\" The poor man has been castrated by the stroke of an airbrush. I assume we are politically rather than anatomically correct here. This show was clearly no repetition of the  Mapplethorpe Exhibit in Cincinnati!<br />Celebrity photographs are often just that. They are interesting only if you know the model. A fine portrait photographer can shoot someone we do not know and make that person interesting to us. Many though certainly not all of Ritts' photos rise to that level. For that reason, he will always be revered as an artist. I would put the photos of Whoopi Goldberg, William Burroughs and Mike Ovitz in that category, to name three. Even if we did not know who these people are, Ritts makes us want to know them. Proof of this, at least for me, is that I was mesmerized by the photo of Ovitz and didn't have the slightest idea initially  of who he was. These photographs are intriguing and draw the viewer in. Finally, for my money, the three incomparable shots of Eunice Kennedy Shriver are simply the best portraits in the book. The first time I leafed through this volume, these fantastic shots jumped out at me.<br />I treasure my signed copy of another of Ritts' books. I'm sorry that he will never take another photograph.time I leafed through this volume, these fantastic shots jumped out at me.<br />I treasure my signed copy of another of Ritts' books.

It must be something about the California climate, but that state keeps producing one good mystery writer after another: Joseph Hansen, Walter Mosley, Michael Nava and now John Morgan Wilson. His first novel SIMPLE JUSTICE is told from the viewpoint of Benjamin Justice, a former journalist who had to give back a Pulitzer-- hey, this character is right up to date-- for writing about what appears to be two fictional characters, one of whom is dying of AIDS. He is coerced into coming out of his alcoholic retirement by his former boss Harry Brofsky to work on a story about a murder outside a gay bar in Los Angeles. Besides these two, Wilson creates other memorable characters. Justice's landlords, Maurice and Fred, could have become stereotypes, but they don't. Alex Templeton, a black heterosexual reporter, makes for an interesting character as does the closeted tennis chamption Samantha Eliason. Wonder whom she's based on.<br />Wilson avoids doing what many mystery writers do, i.e., he doesn't make the story a treatise on some profession-- journalism, college professors, police departments, for example. Also, the narrative is fast-paced and you do not see the scaffolding underpinning the story line. Most importantly, the characters, particularly Justice, are fully developed as people. Justice actually becomes more self-aware and actually grows as a character, something I don't expect from a mystery character. Finally, Wilson makes a political statement but does it with finesse and subtlety.<br />There are nice touches. Wilson pays tribute to Walter Mosley by having Samantha Eliason's beefy bodyguard reading Mosley's mystery BLACK BETTY, for instance.<br />The novel is ultimately quite moving as Wilson takes on difficulty subjects: relationships, homophobia, single gay parents, dysfunctional families, love, forgiveness. SIMPLE JUSTICE is simply a very good mystery.	2004-01-02

I did not know about this writer until I heard Toni Morrison in a radio interview recently praising this novel. Since I hold her in high esteem, I would try any writer she recommended. Apparently I'm a little behind the times since according to the information on the front of the book, there are \\"more than 2 million copies in print.\\"<br />The action of the novel begins in Nigeria a few years before white missionaries brought Christianity and accompanying colonialism to that part of Africa. The central character is the very complex Okonkwo, a tribal leader with many strengths and weaknesses. He is therefore not unlike many of us, at least in part. He is ambitious, sometimes cruel to his wives and children, fearful of failure but also at times a very loving father.  For example, he struggles to be better than his own lazy father and worries that his eldest son Nwoye will amount to nothing and turn out to be just like his grandfather. He has no idea, of course, of what Nwoye will eventually become. Okonkwo has great affection for his daughter as well as for Ikemefuna, a young lad who is 16 when he comes to live with Okonkwo's family. One of the central tragedies of the novel has to do with what Okonkwo, according to the Oracle, has to do to Ikemefuna. Mr. Achebe, to his credit, shows Okonkwo with all his warts as well as the good and bad of Nigerian culture before the missionaries came.<br />As one would suspect, the white Christian missionaries don't come off very well.They go about converting the \\"primitive tribes of the lower Niger\\" with little or no regard for their customs and traditions. One has to ask if the Nigerians were better off before or after Christianity and accompanying colonialism?<br />One of the rewards of reading this novel is learning so much African folklore and sayings. In a delightful story, we find out why the turtle does not have a smooth shell, for example. Also, \\"There was a saying in Umuofia that as a man danced so were the drums beaten for him.\\" Finally, \\"Whenever you see a toad jumping in broad daylight, then know that something is after its life.\\"<br />The title for this novel comes from Yeats' \\"The Second Coming. Truly \\"the center cannot hold\\" for the tragic Okonkwo. You will remember him long after you finish this short novel. I guarantee it.r him.\\" Finally, \\"Whenever you see a toad jumping in broad daylight, then know that something is after its life.\\"<br />The title for this novel comes from Yeats' \\"The Second Coming.

With not an ounce of self-pity, Price recounts his diagnosis, treatment, continuous battle with pain and his &quot;whole new life&quot; as someone who now uses a wheelchair with brutal honesty and humor. If you have ever doubted for an instant that we as individuals are ultimately left to put our lives back together after a traumatic illness, Price's story should put that myth to rest. He alone with the help of hypnosis learned how to deal with constant pain, a subject that many of his doctors ignored.<br />Mr. Price gives every indication that he has a new and happy life. He certainly has gotten on with it and continues to turn out books almost as rapidly as Joyce Carol Oates. It is fortunate that someone with the literary stature of Price chose to write down his experience. This book, along with Abraham Vergese's book about his experience as a doctor treating AIDS patients in East Tennessee in the early years of the epidemic-- MY OWN COUNTRY-- should be required reading for all med students. If reading these two books has no effect on them, they should get out of medicine and into computers.<br />A WHOLE NEW LIFE is truly an amazing book and as good as anything Price has ever written. It may be his best effort. I cannot recommend it too highly.	2003-12-28

The reader becomes acquainted with her through a series of lectures.  Although she had published critically successful novels a long time ago, she is now reduced to the lecture circuit. Ms. Costello is often bored with the endless dinners and interviews at colleges and television stations; but she has no trouble, however, taking the money for her trouble. She at one point describes a young college instructor, who picks her up at the airport before a lecture, and people like her, rather cruelly, I thought: \\"His mother has a word for people like this. She calls them the goldfish. One thinks they are small and harmless, she says, because each wants no more than the tiniest nibble of flesh, the merest hemidemimiligram.\\" She goes on to say that she no longer answers fan letters from these \\"goldfish\\" because they sell her letters on the autograph market. Many of us have witnessed similar condesending attitudes from \\"visiting\\" writers who cannot wait to get out of an auditorium and God help you if you ask them for their autograph.<br />Ms. Costello gets into trouble because of one lecture when she equates the Holocaust with the modern day slaughter of \\"innocent\\" animals. \\"She had spoken on that occasion on what she saw and still sees as the enslavement of whole animal populations. A slave: a being whose life and death are in the hands of another. What else are cattle, sheep, poultry? The death camps would not have been dreamed up without the example of the meat-processing plants before them.\\" I doubt that many Holocaust survivors would agree with this analogy.<br /> An extremely complex character, Ms. Costello has qualities that are endearing. She makes a most unselfish offer to a dying man for example. Her account of her first encounter with pure evil is moving as well. A humanist, she also discusses with her rigid Catholic sister-- who is a Sister-- why she believes a living Christ makes much more sense than a dying one. She does not have a systematic philosophy. She doesn't have to; she is a mere teller of tales. The final chapter, \\"At The Gate\\", is in the tradition of and as good as anything Kafka wrote.<br /> ELIABETH COSTELLO is a strange though beautifully written novel and very different  from what Mr. Coetzee usually writes-- or at least those novels of his I have read-- but I found it altogether intriguing.

For dead writers, she ranks with Melville, Camus and Tolstoy for that honor. LOVE begins with these words: \\"The women's legs are spread wide open, so I hum. Men grow irritable, but they know it's all for them. They relax. Standing by, unable to do anything but watch, is a trial, but I don't say a word.\\" When Morrison finishes her story about 200 pages later, we have met a host of unforgettable characters, mostly women-- Heed, Christine, May, Junior, Vida, L, all who are obsessed with one Bill Cosey. I always marvel at the strength of Morrison's characters. Although they often face untold hardships, they seldom whine and often prevail. As usual, Morrison's plot is not linear but goes back and forth in time from the Civil Rights era to before and after that time. We get the story little by little and ultimately get the whole story, and what a story it is.<br />The book obviously is about love. Although there are other kinds of love here-- erotic love, lust masquerading as love-- the central love is that between two children, a love that was ruined by grownups. Years later as adults Heed and Christine finally get around to talking about their lost opportunities: \\"We could have been living our lives hand in hand instead of looking for Big Daddy everywhere.\\"<br />There are memorable lines throughout the novel. Christine opines that \\"her last good chance for happiness [is] wrecked by the second oldest enemy in the world: another woman.\\" Cosey says that \\"you can live with anything if you have what you can't live without.\\" Finally, Sandler in a lecture to his teenage son gives a moving tribute to women: \\"A woman is an important somebody and sometimes you win the triple crown: good food, good sex, and good talk. Most men settle for any one, happy as a clam if they get two. But listen, let me tell you something. A good man is a good thing, but there is nothing in the world better than a good good woman.

Vernon Little, the narrator of this novel is fifteen and best friends with Jesus, another kid in the local high school in Martirio, Texas. Last Tuesday Jesus, wearing silk panties, blew sixteen of his classmates away and then killed himself. The town has to have a \\"skate-goat,\\" so the position goes to Vernon even though he was running an errand for a teacher at the time of the tragedy.<br />Mr. Pierre has given the world a unigue character in Vernon. He is a master of malapropisms; in addition to being a \\"skate-goat,\\" he may have to \\"tstse fly\\" in his own behalf while a court \\"stainographer\\" takes down his testimony. Vernon is also proficient in swearing and knows more ways to describe a girl's panties than Larry Flynt. He is ultimately more sinned against than sinning, however. He has a penchant for getting into trouble as, spinning out of control, he goes from school to jail to Mexico and back to jail again to death row. In addition to developing this great character, Pierre is just as good at creating a convoluted, hilarious plot.<br />Mr. Pierre satirizes wickedly 21st Century America: the court system and law enforcement officers and their obsession with getting a conviction regardless of the evidence or lack thereof; the feeding frenzy of the media in an effort to \\"create news,\\" the \\"smallness\\" of small town America; America's obsession with fast food and resulting obesity. Then there is reality television. The TV audience gets to vote for which death-row inmate gets executed and when. \\"'. . . we're not talking about executions here--we're talking the ultimate reality TV, where the public can monitor, via cable or internet, prisoners' whole lives on death row. They can live amongst them, so to speak and make up their own minds about a convict's worthiness for punishment. Then each week, viewers across the globe can cast a vote to decide which prisoner is executed next.

George Bush should buy up copies of this book by the dozens and and distribute them as he goes around the country raising money for his re-election campaign. Mohammed al-Rehaief in 212 pages does more to make the case that the U. S. should have invaded Iraq than all the rhetoric that continues to pour out of Washington. Simply put, Mr. al-Rehaief is a hero if risking your life and the lives of your family to save a total stranger defines a hero.<br />In addition to giving us the details of Mr. al-Rehaief's part in saving Jessica Lynch, a  story that  has all in's and out's of any first-rate suspense novel, roughly a third of the book is about the author's life before Jessica Lynch--his childhood, adolescence, marriage, his hatred of the Saddam  Hussein dictatorship. &quot;In adolescence I grew more subversive. I'd make fun of Saddam's crooked mouth, mimicking him before my friends. Or we'd find an empty classroom at recess, load spitballs onto rubber bands, and fire away at the president's picture.&quot; Always known as a &quot;long tongue,&quot; the author was always getting both himself and his family in trouble. A thirty-three-year-old Shiite from Nasiriya, Mr. al-Rehaief is an expert in kung fu, a skill that saved his life on more than one occasion. Though trained a a lawyer he no longer practiced as he says in a country where there is no law. Although from an affluent family, the author learned early on from his beloved father that &quot;there is no shame in being poor&quot; and &quot;each life is precious.&quot;  Mr. al-Rehaief is a very fluent storyteller with a good sense of humor. While a Muslim, he is not a fanatical fundamentalist and admits that he has never been able to fast an entire month for Ramadan. In a word, he's someone you'd want to invite to a dinner party.<br />Mr. al-Rehaief, now in the United States with his wife and his daughter, whose hospitalization in Iraq is just one of the many horric experiences he describes, says that when he made the decision to live in the U. S., he felt as if he were &quot;going home.&quot; And finally in this decent and good man's own words: &quot;I read everything I can about Jessica's progress. When the hospital released her to her home in West Virginia, I felt like we had won all over again. More than anything, I wish her a full and happy life. . . Finally, I regret nothing.

That analogy certainly works for his just released book about Jessica Lynch. I can think of no writer more qualified to tell Jessica's story than Bragg. He is a first class journalist, having won the Pulitzer, and comes from a region of the country, rural Alabama, not unlike the West Virginia where Lynch grew up. (Since I grew up in rural East Tennessee, I'll take the temerity to make that judgment.)<br />Although Bragg had to have written this book quickly, it does not suffer from haste or sloppy writing. Bragg doesn't waste words-- and while I miss his humor, I understand that what he is about here is serious business. His account of the ambush of the now famous ill-fated convoy from the 507th Maintenance Company captures the immediacy and horror of battle. It's as good writing about the awfulness of war as you'll read.<br />The narrative is slim. That's as it should be. The event in Lynch's life that the world wants to know about is her capture and what happened to her while she was a POW. There is little of that information available and we may know now most of what we'll ever know. Bragg also discusses Lynch's growing up in West Virginia as well as her immediate and extended families. Her appeal is obvious: she is hardly more than a teenager, blonde, green-eyed, fragile and, from everything Bragg says, honest. She is our daugher, sister, cousin, and rightly or wrongly, hers is the face the public most associates with the American soldier in Iraq.<br />Jessica Lynch does not consider herself a hero. (I'm reminded that Senator John McCain, another famous American POW, said that there was nothing heroic about getting captured by the enemy.) Bragg discusses the initial sainthood bestowed on her by the government and media and the later disillusionment in some circles because she didn't immediately disown the hype and inaccurate information that was fed to the hungry public. They expect this from a twenty year old who has had many of her bones broken and crushed, was suffering from malnutrition (it is the consensus of everybody involved that she would have died shortly if she had not been rescued by U. S. forces) and in her own words \\"cannot go to the bathroom.\\" As one of her neighbors said, \\"She was courageous to do what she done in the first place. . . I couldn't have done it. . . How was she going to set the record straight from days of surgery and fleeting consciousness?\\"<br />If she is not a hero-- does it matter-- she comes across as a decent, brave young woman. Her best friend was Lori, a Native American, whom Bragg pays tribute to, along with Lynch's other comrades who died in that awful massacre. The Lynch family, along with the Palestine community, are decent, salt-of-the-earth types as well. I bet I could identify most of those dishes the women brought in as the family awaited news of their \\"baby.\\"<br />Lots of potato salad and banana pudding. It was heartening to read that Mr. Lynch, Jessica's dad, said that you cannot hate a whole country, particularly since Iraqi doctors apparently gave their own blood to help keep Jessica alive and an Iraqi civilian--Mohammed Odeh-al-Rehaief risked his own life to save hers.<br />Whatever your feelings are about the rightness and wrongness of the U. S.'s invasion of Iraq, you have to feel empathy for this young woman.

To paraphrase Ms. Hazzard when she lets one character describe another's beauty by saying &quot;no one has a right to look like that,&quot; I say that no one has a right to write like this. Her prose is graceful, concise and descriptive. I was hooked by page 7 with this description: &quot;The man had a deep, low voice. If one had to put a colour to it, it would have been dark blue; or what people in costly shops call burgundy.&quot; Ms. Hazzard is able to say so much about the world in such few words. For example, a bridegoom is described as &quot;pinstriped and trembling.&quot; On the brevity of life, a character says &quot;'We are told that possessions are ephemeral, yet my God how they outlast us. . .'&quot; There are succinct observations about women: &quot;Balked of love, women will turn to religion, to nursing, to pets and plants, to things inanimate.&quot; And a woman taking a typing course is described as getting a life sentence. (A former woman colleague of mine said she always avoided taking typing so that she would never get a dead-end job.) One character says that there is no greater lottery than marriage. Is there a better way on earth to describe the risks involved in a marriage than that I ask. The main characters are good, decent people: Leigh, having been wounded and now returning from the Great War, is a model of decorum in his love for Helen, a young woman sixteen years his junior. She is the life line for her mortally ill brother Benedict. Peter Exley, friend of Leigh, risks everything to save a dying child of another race. You care about these people deeply. Ms. Hazzard's themes certainly meet Matthew Arnold's requirement of high seriousness-- the awfulness of war, the power of love. All we have to do to experience the timeliness of this novel is to watch or read the news. I put aside this great read briefly last evening to see the interview on the Bill Moyers program on the local public television station of a young wounded soldier forever maimed who had recently returned to the U. S. from fighting in Afghanistan. I suspect this young man would agree with Leigh who says the following about war: &quot;Having had one go at setting the world right, I decline a second opportunity.&quot;<br /> This book was nominatead for the National Book Award; it's certainly worthy of such an honor.station of a young wounded soldier forever maimed who had recently returned to the U.

(This was not my experience in cookbook number 1.) It's all subjective on my part-- food always is I suppose-- but I think one can get too many flavors in a dessert if not careful. For example, I cannot imagine baking Prune, Coffe, Chocolate and Amaretto Tiramisu. Additionally, and once again this is just my personal bias, I enjoy baking cakes. There are few cakes included in this collection. Finally you don't four letter word with some classics. Key Lime Pie is one of them. Mr. Lebovitz for his lime pie does a &quot;creamy homemade marshmallow topping and instructs the cook on how to make homemade marshmallow topping as well as homemade graham cracker crust. Does anybody on earth want to know how to make these two items from scratch? And do they have time?<br />I have a suggestion for the author's next cookbook. He should  all it READY FOR DESSERT and include only quick and easy recipes for those of us who are (a) very busy, (b lazy, (c) poor-- some of these recipes would cost bunches--(d) all of the above.<br />But if you are looking for very exotic recipes with lots of contrasting flavors, this cookbook is for you.	2003-11-07

Set in present day New York City, the novel is about several characters, both gay and straight and how their lives intertwine because of the theatre. Frank, who now directs amateur/children's productions for fun, is involved with Jessie, who is the personal assistant of Henry Lewse, the \\"Hamlet of his generation,\\" who now has sold out to New York theatre. He has the hots for Toby, a would-be actor recently arrived from the Midwest, whose best asset is a pretty bottom. He has been thrown overboard recently by Caleb, brother of Jessie and promising playwright who has just been trashed by the Times second string theatre critic Kenneth Prager. Mr. Bram manages to bring all these characters together in a decent finale. As I read this book, I kept thinking that it would make a good comic play. Flush from his recent success of having FATHER OF FRANKENSTEIN made into a major motion picture, perhaps Bram had another movie in mind for this bit of fluff.<br />The most serious mishaps here are living through bad theatre reviews and performing badly in bed-- Mr. Bram seems to want to give the staight and gay characters equal time here-- the last death from AIDS was six years ago so Mr. Bram is squarely in line with his contemporaries here as he depicts life after the awful early years of the AIDS epidemic.<br /> Mr. Bram, who has the talent to amuse, is a facile writer whose prose moves effortlessly. My favorite character is the Britisth actor Henry who has such lines as \\"Toby or not Toby; that is the question.\\" Now is his 50's, Henry has lived long enough to take life pretty much as it comes. After a less than successful sexual foray with the young Toby, he opines that \\"he should be feeling angry and defeated right now, but he felt fine. Somewhat sad, but not terribly so. He had reached the point in life where even bad sex was good sex.\\" With the exception of an accidental shooting, this is about as serious as Mr. Bram gets.\\" With the exception of an accidental shooting, this is about as serious as Mr. Bram gets.	2003-10-29

Everything that Mark Doty touches turns to something beautiful, whether he is writing poetry or writing about art as SEEING VENICE illustrates. This tiny book would make a wonderful gift to lovers of Venice, art, poetry, Mark Doty or all of the above. In a brief essay, Mr. Doty illuminates Bernardo Bellotto's (1722-1780) Venetian painting &quot;Grand Canal&quot; completed when the artist was all of 19.<br />What I find so wonderful about this little treasure is that Mr. Doty writes straightforward, unpretentious prose about a beautiful painting; and, as always, he convinces me that he is accurate in what he says. He apparently does what a lot of us do not-- he simply looks closely at a work of art and makes sensible observations. For example, in this painting he is not sure whether the season is spring or autumn since the artist doesn't indicate a time. &quot;Spring, fall? No way to distinguish, not in this landscape. Do the clouds promise whether to come, or speak of turbulence passed? These boatmen, of course, would know precisely how to read them.&quot;<br />Not content just to explicate, Mr. Doty compares the isolation of the figures here with the works of Edward Hopper. He also contrasts Venice with modern New York City and quotes both the writers Henry James and John Ruskin. James on Venice: &quot;Of all the cities in the world it is the easiest to visit without going there.&quot; Mr. Doty concludes that the painting is about time and makes a good argument for this premise.<br />The book contains 20 or 30 closeup photographs of various details from the painting as well as a large complete picture that folds out for a better view.<br />Mr. Doty is one of our treasures.I'd love to see him write an entire book on painting.	2003-10-20

In his first book in several years, Clyde Edgerton tells a haunting tale of Aunt Lil, her nephew Carl and L. Ray Flowers along with several other memorable characters, several  who &quot;live&quot; at Rosehaven Convalescence Center in Listre, North Carolina. The time is the present; the movie &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot; is still playing at the local theatre. The themes are timeless, however: old age with all its problems and sorrows, missed opportunities, the ills of fundamentalist religion, the warehousing of those who can no longer look after themselves--and trite as it may seem-- the redeeming power of both music and love.<br />Truth breaks through on every page. Homecooked, delicious meals have been replaced by cafeteria lunches and/or-- heaven help us-- fast food chains. On religion, Reverend L. Ray wonders why the local Baptist church sends missionaries to Alaska , England and South Africa. &quot;It seems like church members often have a desparate need to be unaware of the local needs of the local wrecks of local women stacked along the local grim halls of local nursing homes, places in conditions far sadder than merry Rosehaven--places like Shady Rest.&quot; (All too soon L. Ray will witness firsthand the awfulness of Shady Rest.) Then there is the sad truth of the lot of women like Aunt Lil, women who because of their age and community, had their entire lives determined by whom they selected for a husband. Neither Aunt Lil nor her friends got out of a bad marriages. &quot;Until death do us part&quot; was taken quite literally, often to women's great detriment. Edgerton with much grace and compassion depicts the truth of these women like Lil-- they always outlive their spouses-- who are in out and of nursing homes and often in and out of reality because of advancing dementia. Sure, the author makes much gentle humor of Aunt Lil's driving skills or lack thereof. But she also says on a rare visit to her old apartment, &quot;I used to come home. . . Now I visit home.&quot; She describes life in a nursing home as &quot;life after life.&quot; Finally it is no accident that the novel ends with Carl, who is an altogether decent man, feeding the words to L. Ray of one of the saddest bluegrass songs ever written, &quot;Rank Stranger.&quot;<br />This gem of a novel with make you smile, even laugh out loud in places, but be careful. It will ultimately break your heart, particularly if you have just spoken to a parent who isn't sure what day of the week it is or who talks to you about you in the third person.<br />One final note: Mr. Edgerton has Reverend Flowers come up with the plan to unite churches and nursing homes as one where &quot;The First Breakfast&quot; would be served instead of &quot;The Last Supper.&quot; While this may be a novel idea, Messers Edgerton and Flowers have been trumped by a progressive thinking Presbyterian congregation in Atlanta that has turned their sanctuary into a dormitory for homeless men during the week. On Sundays volunteers come in and remove the beds and install the pews for the morning service. Sometimes churches do really wonderful things.ys on a rare visit to her old apartment, &quot;I used to come home. . .

There is also a section on cheesecakes from different lands.<br />I have baked at least a half dozen of these recipes several times over the years and have baked one or two of them dozens of times.

Leonard Schecter, who describes himself as a Polish Jew, is an American who goes to England to gather information for a TV series on the real Princess Diana. She has already left Charles when the novel begins. As in every good novel something happens. In this instance Lennie and Di fall hopelessly in love. A stretch of the imagination? Maybe but why not. What transpires is deliciously funny. Leonard, along with Princess Di and her two sons, flees England for the U. S. Their flight will make you smile. We learn that Di reads both Danielle Steele and Jacqueline Susann and that Princess Margaret likes the poem &quot;The Congo.&quot; We also meet Fergie and her un-named rich famous American lover, whose identity we can guess anyway. One of the funniest passages in this fun book is the account of Di and her sons' learning to speak &quot;American.&quot; And you will never feel the same about a McDonald's again after reading this book.<br />I suspect that this little concoction suffered because of the later tragic death of Princess Diana although it should not have. The tale is told with a great deal of affection and good humor and is quite harmless. Certainly a book that makes you smile as much as this one does is good for you.	2003-10-09

If we are to believe him in this very readable autobiography, Helmut Newton is one of them. He has always listened to his own drummer and has walked away from assignments that lesser individuals would have been afraid to leave. A lover of both beautiful women and fast cars, he names names although he does say that some of the names have been changed to protect people's privacy.<br />I'm a great admirer of Mr. Newton so I read this chatty memoir with relish. Born in Berlin of Jewish parents, he has lived in and travelled to many places in his career as a fashion photographer. Although obviously a perfectionist when it comes to his art, Mr. Newton doesn't appear to take himself too seriously, a great attribute for one so talented as he.<br />Mr. Newton's life has not always been fun and games, however. He understands the horrors of Nazi Germany from first-hand experience and spent time during World War II in an internment camp for Nazis in Australia because he was a German. Never mind that he was a despised Jew and hated Hitler as much as the Allies did.<br />The last third of the book is entitled \\"Part II: The Photographs.\\" Here Newton shows and discusses many of his now easily recognizable images. There is no particular order to this section. There is one photograph that he calls \\"pornographic\\", in case you are interested. And we learn that he hates the PR people who surround famous actresses. I doubt that anyone would be suprised to learn that tidbit.<br />If you are looking for a good collection of Newton's work, you should buy any of the books that are collections of his fine photographs printed on high quality paper. (I own his book of portraits, one of my favorite photography books.) The paper here is so-so, and the photographs are not identified on the pages where they are reproduced. While this is customary in fine art books, at least the many photographs from Newton's own life that accompany the text should be captioned. I understand that this is probably the fault of the publisher and not Newton's, however.<br />If you are a fan of this great photographer, as I am, you will enjoy this book thoroughly.hotographs from Newton's own life that accompany the text should be captioned.

Remember those tiny valentine candies with words on them? Three of those candy hearts with \\"boy\\" \\"meets\\" \\"boy\\" on them adorn the cover of David Levithan's gentle, sweet novel about Paul, a gay sophomore in high school and his friends. You can hardly call this a coming out novel since Paul, who is also the narrator, was outed by his kindergarten teacher when she wrote on his report card: \\"Paul is definitely gay and has very good sense of self.\\" He ran for and was elected class president in the third grade on an openly gay ticket. In eighth grade Paul saw PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT, and he met his good friend Tony at the Strand Book Store as they both were looking for a used copy of THE LOST LANGUAGE OF CRANES. One of Paul's friends in high school is a drag queen/homecoming queen/star quarterback who is faced with the real dilemma of how the homecoming queen can introduce herself/himself as quarterback at a pep rally. Cheerleaders ride motorcycles. Because of the National Boy Scouts' stand on gays, the local chapter has disbanded and is now an organization called \\"Joy Scouts.\\" P-FLAG is more important than the PTA. The land of Oz? Maybe. Tony's parents may come as close to being wicked witches as anyone in this almost perfect world the author creates since they are fundamentalists who only let him study with Paul in their kitchen in plain sight of them.<br />The shy Mr. Levithan-- even when you go to his website, you don't learn a lot about him-- has written a seamless beautiful novel about a lucky, well-adjusted gay adolescent. In describing something he saw on television about a teen football player who had died in an auto accident, Paul remembers that some of his \\"big hulking\\" friends were in tears because they had loved him so much. \\"I started crying, too, and I wondered if these guys had told the football player they loved him while he was alive, or whether it was only with death that this strange word, love, could be used. I vowed then and there that I would never hesitate to speak up to the people I loved. They deserved to know they gave meaning to my life.

My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.\\" With those famous opening lines, Nabokov begins a sordid tale told by Humbert Humbert, one of the most fascinating characters in all of American literature. Even many people who have never read this novel know the basic story here since the word \\"Lolita\\" has become a part of American culture in that that someone with a \\"Lolita complex\\" is attracted to very young girls.<br />Published in 1955, this novel caused a storm of controversy; it is still provocative today even though there is not a four letter word in it. That is not to say that the book is not extremely erotic in many places. What Nabokov does with words is brilliant. As always he plays constant word games with the reader. Someone goes on a \\"honeymonsoon\\" to India. In seaching for Dolores aka Lolita and her run-away suitor, Humbert finds the name \\"Will Brown, Dolores, Colo.\\" in a hotel register. Humbert and Dolores have breakfast in the \\"township of Soda, pop. 1001.\\" There are allusions to Poe (\\"in a kingdom by the sea\\") and other writers throughout the book. You skim paragraphs at your peril.<br />The book is wondrously satiric. Nabokov captures the vapidness of the motels in small and middle America in the 40's and 50's with great brilliance. Humbert, with all his perversions, is often a terribly funny character as well. The scene where he wrestles with Quilty comes to mind. \\"We rolled all over the floor, in each other's arms, like two huge helpless children. He was naked and goatish under his robe, and I felt suffocated as he rolled over me. I rolled over him. We rolled over me. They rolled over him. We rolled over us.\\"<br />We cannot forget, however, that Humbert is ultimately guilty of an ugly sin. In his own words he has deprived a \\"girl-child\\" of her childhood. In their cross-country journey, she cries every night. The picture is not pretty.<br />In an essay written in 1956 Nabokov writes about writing LOLITA. HE says that he is \\"neither a reader nor a writer of didactic fiction, and. . .. LOLITA has no moral in tow.\\" He further denies the charge made by some readers that the novel is anti-American. Finally he says there are three subjects \\"utterly taboo as far as most American publishers are concerned.\\" Obviously the theme of this novel is one. The other two, in Nabokov's words, are: \\"a Negro-White marriage which is a complete and glorious success resulting in lots of children and grandchildren; and the total atheist who lives a happy and useful life, and dies in his sleep at the age of 106.\\" A most interesting observation. I wonder just how much has changed in 47 years.e picture is not pretty.<br />In an essay written in 1956 Nabokov writes about writing LOLITA.

For starters, the jacket artwork by Steve Walker sets the tone for this tale. If  you prefer Armistead Maupin to Edmund White or if you find a steady diet of books by Jim Grimsley and Andrew Holleran (good writers through they are) makes you suicidal, then this novel is for you. No character tests positive for HIV, let alone gets sick, only old people die-- after all, old people always die-- and boy gets boy. There is enough money for sex-change surgery and lesbians get pregnant because they want to. We meet a whole host of characters, most of whom are easy to like, some of whom are quite lovable.<br />This is yet another story set in Boston and Provincetown-- does this mean New York is no longer where everything gay is happening? That might not be so bad after all.<br />Mr. Ford writes with a good deal of wit. I laughed out loud, for instance, when a particularly nasty fictional novelist/teacher gets most of his novels replaced in the local bookstore by those of E. Lynn Harris.

With over 100 artists represented, this is one of the most inclusive collections of male nudes I have seen. There are photographers, painters and sculptors represented. The only requirement seems to be that the artist be living. Several of those represented are well-known, Greg Gorman, George Dureau, Michael Leonard, Tom Bianchi, Christopher Makos, Arthur Tress, Nan Goldein, John Dugdale, Chuck Close, David Hockney and Don Barchardy, to name a few. But most of the artists are unknown-- at least to me. There is literally every kind of nude male you can imagine here and some you probably didn't. Mr. Leddick arranges the art in what seems a rather arbitrary grouping to me: experimentalists, neoclassicists, eroticists, fantasists, sensualists, realists and romanticists. He could just as easily have grouped the artists alphabetically, for my money.<br />There are a couple of dozen previously unknown artists I was crazy about. I particularly liked Steve Underhill, Jack Balas and Terry Gaskins. (There is a brief paragraph about each artist with a small photo included with each work of art; then there are addresses for the artists printed as well.)I would love to have seen all the people who got culled, or at least those who deserve honorable mention.<br />My only complaint about this beautiful book is that it is printed in a paperback edition only.

For example, I doubt that I'll ever prepare rabbit pate or roast and stuff a suckling pig. Miss Lewis' whiskey cake recipe is from another world, however. The cake is made in a tube pan and has a cup of bourbon in it--and tastes as if it does. (Miss Lewis says that you should never cook with any alcohol you wouldn't drink.) The cake comes out of the oven a beautiful pale yellow color, almost like salt-fired pottery. Dense and moist, it slices like a thick piece of fine cheese. I didn't believe the author when she says that you can listen to the sounds of a cake to know when it's done. I can testify that she is quite right about that. This is a really fine cake.

It is too bad that in this country we insist on putting witers into categories: Jewish, black, women, black women, Southern, gay, Lesbian et al. There is certainly no gay writer in America tody who writes better novels than Mr. Russell, and he certainly holds his own with any other contemporary novelist (of any category) I can think of.<br />The novel is about Cameron, a middle-aged gay man who had moved to a little rural town in upstate New York with a lover who he no longer has. Once very ill with AIDS, he has been given his life back because of a new drug regimen. His already complicated life suddenly becomes more so when he hires two local \\"redneck\\" brothers Kyle and Jesse, both recently out of high school, to do some work for him.<br />This novel is about so much--what happens when affluent gays (or any other group for that matter) move into a poor, depressed area and \\"take over\\"? How does a long-time survivor of AIDS have a relationship in these difficult times? And most poignantly, what is a young man to do about this feelings for other men, given the repressed, straight family that surrounds him?<br />Russell is such a good writer; he is both so good with the English language and insightful about people and relationships. A woman is described as \\"face-lift beautiful.\\" And a \\"persimmon smudge of a moon\\" climbs into the sky. Here is Russell's description of the enthusiasm and glow of youth that most of us lose as adults: \\" Regaining his [Cameron] health, he's regained a certain sense of wonder he'd lost through the gray days of his illness. Still, it troubled him to realize he's probably never again feel longing--or anything else--as intensely as he's felt it when he was a teenager. The scar tissue thickened. Books, music, friendship, sunsets--about none of those things did he care the way he had once cared.\\"<br />This is a dark and troubling novel. Although some of Russell's characters are capable of ugly, cruel acts, they are never stereotypes but are complex and densely drawn. Jesse, for all his bad deeds, becomes a sympathetic character and someone I desperately wanted to do the right thing.<br />The novel ends ambiguously. What really happened to Cameron?

He had warmed up earlier, however, by wondering what is wrong with politicians who come from Arkansas. Buckley apparently does like some Democratic politicians but only dead ones since he seems to like John and Robert Kennedy. At least he doesn't trash them.<br />If you can work around all this gushing, when Mr. Buckley gets down to business and starts walking, he manages to give a lot of information about a truly beautiful and great city, sometimes with great wit. He can be quite funny and entertaining. In Washington an agenda means \\"sinister intentions, for example. I found out why the White House is so called, that Thomas Jefferson was a very poor speaker and that George Washington was the only president whose slaves were freed at his death.<br />Mr. Buckey discusses the design and layout of Washington in some detail, does a good job I thought on The Vietnam Memorial and both the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials. But by the time we had gotten to the Franklin Roosevelt Memorial, I didn't expect much. Never mind that there is beautiful artwork here by both Robert Graham and George Segal, world class artists. That all goes unmentioned. Mr. Buckley remembers instead that Roosevelt was always spoken of in the family he grew up in as \\"that man\\" and Mrs. Roosevelt as \\"that woman.\\" Well, in the family I grew up in they were kin to the \\"Holy Family\\" and remain so.<br />Mr.Buckley finishes up with a visit to Arlington National Cemetery. Parts of this chapter are very moving. I must admit though that I keep coming back to that image of the Cheneys' appearance at a publication party for Lynne Cheney celebrating her children's book AMERICA-A PATRIOTIC PRIMER. I'm glad it was Buckley's night out and not mine.ok AMERICA-A PATRIOTIC PRIMER. I'm glad it was Buckley's night out and not mine.	2003-09-04

Mr. Palahniuk is certainly upfront about what path he will take in this book. After all, the title is \\"Fugitives and Refugees\\" and I believe those are leopard skin pasties with tassels on the cover. I still hoped, however, that I would read about how vibrant Portland's downtown is, how Powell's Bookstore is unique for Portland and all the world and how Portland is a mecca for artists. Instead I get chapters on strange museums, strange restaurants and all the sex clubs in Portland-- and more about the author's own life than I care to know, most of which he tells in his \\"postcards\\" between the other chapters.<br />Oh, sure. It's nice to know that there is an annual Emily Dickinson Sing-Along at Cafe Lena, for example. The bit about the Santas in the Portland SantaCon '96 is amusing. The chapter on Portland's zoo I found by far to be the most interesting, a telling commentary on my reaction to this book since zoos are usually the last place I visit in a new city.<br />This book would not make me want to visit Portland.	2003-08-23

George Platt Lynes has to be one of the most influential of Twentieth Century American photographers. This beautifully printed book by David Leddick illustrates that. In his narrative, Mr. Leddick says that both Bruce Webber and Herb Ritts were influenced by Lynes. I would add Arnold Newman-- his environmental portraits recall those of Lynes--Irving Penn, Robert Mapplethorpe, Jack Shear and Arthur Tress, just to name a few. Mr. Leddick divides the photographs in five categories: portraits, ballet, nudes, fashion and mythology. The very first photograph in the series of portraits is one of Lynes' first ever, a stunning portrait of Gertrude Stein, proof that one can learn apertures and lighting but that genius is by birth.<br />Certainly Mr. Leddick's commentary is adequate; but if you want to really enjoy this book, just look at these photos. Certainly no one was better at lighting a face or body than Mr. Lynes. And he did his work before the advent of the strobe lights, something that seems to make a lot of later photographers lazy.<br />A word about the photographer's nudes. Some of these models, both male and female, had less than perfect bodies. They are lit beautifully, however, and prove the theory that lighting can make most anyone beautiful, and if not beautiful in the case of portraits, at least interesting. If you are tired of looking at book after book filled with color photographs of endless buffed bodies that look like all the other buffed bodies and about as interesting as passport photographs, spend some time with these incredible works of art. You'll be glad you did.	2003-08-20

Jane, a youngster when her beloved father has an accident and is killed, grows up believing she is responsible for his death. This misconception follows her into adulthood and colors her entire life and is what much of the novel is about.<br />Ms. Dark is very good with dialogue and verbal fencing. When the uoung man from England Nigel tells her he is gay and asks if she's bothered with learning that, the conversation goes like this:<br />\\"'Of Course not. My uncle is gay,' she offered, and immediately regretted it. 'I'm sorry.That was stupid.'<br />'Quite all right. My sister's a girl, if that makes you feel any better.'\\"<br />Dark delves into the complexity and difficulty of family relationships that sound all too familiar to many of us. Once again she writes about lost opportunities and living with the consequences.<br />Oh, the title for this novel comes from wedding-night advice for Victorian brides: \\"Just close your eyes and think of England.\\"	2003-08-19

(At one point she opines about taking speech lessons from a Hungarian voice specialist: \\"'Great,' I said. 'So I'll talk like a Hungarian woman.'\\")She is obviously a fine writer and reading her story is quite effortless. For me this is a bittersweet memoir because of all the anguish that Ms. Boylan's transformation causes, particularly for the wife Grace, who comes across as being terribly decent and loving. (I do not mean to imply that Boyland is not decent and loving, quite to the contrary.) Grace expresses her feelings about all that is going on very poignantly: \\"You asked me if I thought this was necessary, and yes, I do. I think it's taken incredible bravery and courage for you to be the person you need to be, and I'm not going to stand in the way of that. I would never keep the person I love from being who she needs to be. But I can't be glad for you, Jenny. Every success you've had as a woman is also a loss for me.\\"<br /><br />Both Jennifer and Grace are brutally honest in how they feel; at times I found their honesty almost too painful to read.<br /><br />But shouldn't everyone have a friend like Richard Russo! What a supportive and thoroughly caring person he is. Boylan's best friend, he writes a warm and loving afterward to this story.	2003-08-19

S. Eliot he describes as a \\"great stuffed owl\\" who \\"didn't get out of the house much.\\" Allen Ginsberg was \\"something of a gasbag\\" while Anne Sexton is a \\"hot number.\\" Opinionated? Yes, but I find I agree with Mr. Keillor more times than I don't. I read this obviously honest and thouthful introduction three times and then called up friends who love poetry and read portions of it to them.<br />Mr. Keillor includes a lot of poets here, many of whom I did not know previously. You guessed it. There are no Ginsberg or Eliot selections included. The criterion is that the poems should have \\"somehow stuck\\" with Keillor and with \\"some of the listeners.\\" Keillor obviously is guided by the time restraints of his radio show since the poems must be short. (I do not believe for a moment that he does not care for Matthew Arnold's \\"Dover Beach,\\" a poem probably too long to include here.)The anthology is short on 19th Century poets although Ms. Emily does take first place with eight selections.<br />Even though Mr. Keillor would not be happy with long-winded paise, suffice it to say that, as the Brits would, that this book is altogether \\"lovely.\\" And, Mr. Keillor, you are one of those Americans who make me happy I live here. Didn't you say it best in one of your essays, something about seeing the firelights of other gentle people?	2003-08-08

Woody White-- he may or may not be aptly named, depending on whether his hormones are challenged or not-- is a senator from Vermont who has major obstacles to overcome if he is to be re-elected. He goes from one scandal-caused crisis to another as his feisty female opponent attempts to upseat him. He suffers from the &quot;zipper&quot; problem, accepting bribes, family problems, an extramarital affair and what is the politial kiss of death if discovered, intermittent impotence. Added to his mounting list of problems, a Democrat, he has hit Trent Lott's car in the Senate parking garage.<br />There is never a dull page in this delicious romp. If many of the problems faced by Senator Woody sound familiar, of course are are supposed to.<br />The artwork on the hardback edition of the book is a clever introduction of what lies ahead for the reader.	2003-08-03

William Mann's premise in this novel is that gay people have our own families apart from biological ones, that we make our own rules up as we go and that we will make mistakes. Mr. Mann expounds on this by continuing the story he began in THE MEN FROM THE BOYS. Jeff and Lloyd have now lost their best friend Javitz to AIDS but must somehow continue without him. Mr. Mann introduces new prominent characters, Henry, Eva and Anthony as well as the subjects of circuit parties, drugs in the gay community, barebacking, new age jargon, gay bashing, internalized homophobia, \\"fag hags,\\" male prostitution and what is described as \\"sacred sex workers.\\" Yes, the chef emptied out the entire refrigerator to make this pot of soup.<br />For my money, the character Anthony works very well and is one of the best things about the story. Mr. Mann handles the mystery and intrigue surrounding his background very well. He is not so successful in the portrayals of Eva and Henry. Eva is so needy and manipulative as to be for the most part totally obnoxious. And I groaned when Henry became what he calls a sacred sex worker.<br />Also, Mann ties all the threads up too quickly in the end, I thought-- was he running out of pages? On the other hand, I've read dozens of gay novels that were neither as entertaining or well written as this one.	2003-07-31

This memoir should be required reading for the people running our country and all censors of books. Azar Nafisi, currently a professor at Johns Hopkins University, recounts her time in Iran during the time of Ayatollah Khomeini, the eight year \\"Holy War\\" between Iran and Iraq--\\"Holy War\\" has to be the ultimate oxymoron-- until her departure for the U. S. in 1997.<br />Ms. Nafisi, a professor of Western literature, every Thursday taught works of fiction seven young women in her home after having been expelled from the University of Tehran for refusing to wear the veil. She concentrates on some of her favorite Western writers: Nakokov, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James and Jane Austin.<br />There are scary facts here. Women who painted their fingernails could get a year in prison. In a divorce proceeding, the husband always got custody of the children. Virgin women in prison were married to prison guards and then executed, the philosophy being that if a virgin were killed, she would go to heaven. Finally, Ms. Nafisi can use only the real names of the deceased since no more harm can come to them.<br />This warm and extremely well-written memoir is ultimately about hope and the transcending power and freedom of literature. This book will make your heart sing. Ms. Nafisi teaches literature because she loves to; that comes across in every page of this book. I would love to audit a class of hers. She convinced this reader to take another look at Henry James, no small feat since I have never read a word by him that wasn't required reading.	2003-07-29

And you have Lawrence Welk damage.\\" You just know that a short story with that for an opening line has to be outstanding. And it certainly is. In the title story, one of seven in this first collection of stories by John Rowell, the narrator is a ten year old boy growing up in North Carolina who at that early age understands all too clearly what it means to be different. As do many gay children, he learns quickly to hide his true feelings. He would rather read \\"Photoplay\\" magazine than play baseball. He thrives in the classroom-- the teachers love him-- \\"But then there's the playground.\\" The story certainly cut to the bone as I read this youngster's account of getting way out in the outfield in a ball game so that he will be far away from any flyball. It all sounded too, too familiar.<br />The other stories in this remarkable first book are just as good. I particularly liked \\"Saviors.\\" \\"Jean Nimocks Sloops is a woman on a mission.\\" She tries to match up her divorcing niece Bitsy Nimocks Evans with the bachelor church organist. She invites both of them to her \\"antique infested\\" home for tea and like so many heterosexuals doesn't have a clue as to why the church organist has never married.<br />The endings of both these stories are quite amazing. Unlike many short stories that are little more than character sketches, these stories actually go somewhere.<br />Mr. Rowell got endorsements from a lot of people whose writing I admire, one reason I bought his book: Jill McCorkle, Mark Childress, Stephen McCauley, David Ebershoff, Lee Smith.<br />These most impressive stories will not disappoint you.	2003-07-22

Joel Lingeman is gay and 45, makes good money with a job in Congress, has a receding hairline and an expanding waistline, likes to eat fatty foods, is in a relationship of 15 years with Sam but is so out of touch with his lover that he is totally surprised and  blown away when Sam leaves him for a twenty-three year old. He opines that he is probably alive today because of this stagnating relationship since he and Sam, by their monotonous monogamy,  have managed to avoid the plague. Joel is a civilian example of the military's \\"Don't ask; don't tell\\" in that he is out to practically nobody but his friends. In his defense, he does manage to come out when backed into a corner. One more thing: he discovers sex with African Americans. He is for the most part unappealing but totally believable. Unfortunately, he is pretty much like most every gay person I have ever known in D. C. They have some mid-level position connected with the government, they wouldn't be seen leaving Lambda Rising Bookstore, but they'll dress up in a tuxedo in a flash and attend an expensive gay fundraiser that does not use the word \\"gay\\" in any of its advertisements. One suspects they are closet Log Cabin Republicans. Sound familiar?<br />Yet in spite of this less than admirable set of characters, Mark Merlis has managed to spin an interesting yarn, which is proof positive that he is an exceptionally good writer. He appears to have gotten the cynicism of lawmakers on Capitol Hill and their underlings accurate as well. I had a good time trying to figure out of some of the lawmakers Merlis describes were based on real people.<br />Merlis is one of the half dozen or so gay writers whose novels I eagerly await to read.	2003-07-21

This book is a beautifully illustrated account of his success, along with the other artists of the village who learned from him. Becoming familiar with these artists should lay to rest the notion held by many Americans that Mexican imports are second class. These paper-thin pots are as beautiful as any you will ever see. This book has color photographs of many of the potters from Mata Ortiz as well as pictures of their pots. There is information on how the pots are made-- they are all built by hand from native materials, painted with brushes made from the artists' children's hair and fired over cow dung.<br />The book has a lot of interesting details-- for instance, when the Pope visited Mexico a few years ago, he was given three of these magnificent pots. Another fascinating tidbit is that one of every seven citizens of this village makes these pots. They have gone from doing manual labor to creating works of art.<br />Owning this book is the next best thing to owning a Mata Ortiz pot.	2003-07-18

I picked up this book because I like the work of George Platt Lynes and Paul Cadmus a lot. I also read and liked very much Mr. Leddick's first novel and own a couple of his books on male nude photography. (I have little interest in Lincoln Kirstein or ballet either.) I finished this book not having learned much about either of these two men that I cared to remember. Part of the problem is that Mr. Leddick attempts too much. He is art critic, photography critic, dance critic, literary critic as well as consummate gossip. Additionally since there are no footnotes in this book, the reader has no idea whether Leddick's conclusions about anything are his or something he gleaned from the list of sources at the  back of the book. Take the opening sentence from Leddick's chapter on Katherine Anne Porter: \\"Katherine Anne Porter is among the most esteemed women writers of the twentieth century in America.\\" Is that Mr. Leddick's opinion-- and what qualifies him to make such a judgment-- or the literary critics who tell us whom we should read? Incidentally, Ms. Porter comes off as a most distasteful person. Mr. Leddick paints her as homophobic although she obviously hung out with a lot of people whose lives she couldn't tolerate. He might have discussed her racism as well if he wanted to really give us a rounded view of this pretty ugly woman.<br />I would have preferred more insight into what made Mr. Lynes one of America's great photographers and less information and speculation as to whom he did bed or might have taken to bed. Mr. Leddick does discuss at some length many of Cadmus' paintings. Without the actual reproductions preferably in color, however, it is impossible to know whether or not this writer has a clue as to what he is discussing.<br />Mr. Leddick does briefly discuss Lynes' influence on later photographers, particularly Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. For my money, Lynes is the best photographer of the male nude this country has had. His studio lighting is creative and quite wonderful. Just look at the photographs of anyone who followed him to see the long shadow he cast. (And all this inventive and difficult lighting before the strobe. At least there were no monotonous umbrella reflections in the eyes of Lynes' models.) Robert Mapplethorpe--whose work I admire a lot-- but who lit every photograph he ever took pretty much the same way-- could certainly have learned a plenty from studying Lynes' lighting.<br />So if you want to appreciate these two men-- study their works and made your own judgments. Mr. Leddick has edited a fine book on Mr. Lynes' photographs and there are several fine books on Cadmus in color.e and quite wonderful.

The story is set in 1994 and '95 in both Boston and Provincetown. These chracters make their own rules and refuse to base their lives on heterosexual patterns. For instance, Javitz and Jeff were once lovers; now Jeff and Lloyd are but the three function as a loosely knit family. Jeff and Lloyd have an \\"open\\" relationship in that both of them \\"trick\\" with others.<br />What Mann does best in this very accessible novel is to take characters and situations that a lesser writer would have made trite and to make them alive and interesting. There are lots of scenes that hit home. Jeff's description of visiting his parents-- the men sit in the living room watching sports on TV while the women sit in the kitchen talking. Jeff is sort of in a no man's land somewhere in between. In a discussion about the future, Ernie, who is HIV positive, tells Jeff who is not: \\"Jeff, you can still plan for tomorrow even while you're moping around over your boyfriend. You can daydream. That's the difference. I no longer have the luxury of indulging in daydreams.\\" (I have heard similar discussions many times over the last twenty years or so.) Finally, Mann describes accurately a lot of gay people in the 90's: \\"Back in the days when we marched through the streets, it was easier. It was a way to pilot our grief, our rage, our fear. In a strange and twisted way, it allowed us to be hopeful--and this in the days when Reagan and Bush sat in the Oval Office. It's different now: the government still has blood on its hands, but we no longer march in the streets. It's more than simple complacency lulled by the honeyed words of a deceitful president. It's a sense of holding on. . .and hoping to God to still be there when it's all over.\\"<br />There are many passages like these in this thoughtful, unpretentious and altogether pleasing novel.tious and altogether pleasing novel.	2003-07-11

It will never fully recover, though it is accustomed to loss. . . Provincetown possesses, has always possessed, a steady, grieving competence in the face of all that can happen to people.

I'll be curious to see what shw writes about in her next novel.  Set in seventeenth-century England, this novel tells the love story of Jacob, the narrator, and Christopher. Ms. McCann apparently has done her homework as the historical details ring true. Or if they're not true, she's good at convincing the reader they are, which is almost as good. This reads like old-fashioned novels so rarely written any more. There is an interesting plot and good character development. Once you get started reading, you're crave this story like meat needs salt and will quickly kill an afternoon reading.<br />While I cared desperately for both these characters and hoped against hope that their love would last, I found Christopher too much the dreamer.

There is a good reason why it's called a classic. Sure, it's a little long and the catalogues get a bit tedious. But I was totally blown away by how totally modern this story remains. The battle scenes are as bloody as anything about modern warefare we see on the nighly news. (The book cover has a photograph taken of World War II soldiers landing at Normandy entitled \\"Into the Jaws of Death.) And while reading this, I opened up an issue of USA Today and see that Brad Pitt will be starring in a movie based on this epic.<br />The Iliad does have so much universal appeal. For example, the scene where Hector's son is frightened by his father's helmet and cries as Hector attempts to say goodbye before going into battle. Or when King Priam comes to plead with Achilles for the body of Hector and Achilles suggests that he eat in order to assuage his grief for his beloved fallen son. How many times have we all taken food to our bereaved friends and family. Sometimes it's all we know to do.<br />If the purists are upset about this translation, I am not. Parts of this work read like a modern novel. In addition to an occasional four letter word, we see phrases like \\"get the hell out,\\" \\"put me out of commission,\\" \\"tough customer,\\" and \\"you're nothing but trash,\\" to name a few. There are beautifully constructed phrases as well: in one of the many battle scenes \\"death enfolded them\\" and Priam describes himself as being on the \\"threshold of old age.\\"<br />Sheila Murnaghan has written a long, interesting introduction to the work. There is also a catalogue of \\"Combat Deaths,\\" and who killed whom if you are keeping up with that sort of thing, as well as a list of the speeches and an index of the major Greeks, Trojans and, of course, Zeus and his crowd.<br />A thoroughly enjoyable reread!	2003-07-02

She discusses much of her father's and her family's lives. The relationship of her parents, at least as she remembers it, was intriguing. I would like to have known either or both of her parents. Also, I bought the book from having read the first few pages in a local bookstore about James Nichols'-- the name of Ms. Miller's father-- feelings about pacificism. This is a brilliant first chapter that make you want to read more. Ms. Miller writes clear, beautiful prose.<br />Just as important as Mr. Nichols' story  is also the story of Ms. Miller and her own frustrations, anger, love and all the other emotions that a child/caretaker feels as she watches the disintegration of a brilliant, scholarly and loving father.

S. in 1981, the ironic title, the complexity, the psychological tension, the ambiguities, the questions left unanswered. I was handicapped in reading this novel in that I had already seen the movie so it was impossible not to see Rupert Everett and Natasha Richardson getting lost in those maze-like alleys in Venice. (Nowhere in this slim novel, however, does McEwan name the city where the sinister action takes place.} On the other hand, since I knew the outcome, I could look for and admire the clues the author gives as to what will happen. McEwan does an excellent job of setting the tone for what ultimately occurs early in the novel. As early as page 17: \\"Colin and Mary had never left the hotel so late, and Mary was to attribute much of what followed to this fact.\\" There are lots of references to the  sexual tension between men and women in addition to many homoerotic allusions throughout the book that prepare you, at least in part, for the shattering climax of this horrific little novel.<br />McEwan always gives the reader a story that appeals both to the intellect and the emotions. As usual, he doesn't disappoint us. One of the joys of living in these times is awaiting a new McEwan novel.	2003-06-11

Paul Woodruff, a Professor of Humanities at the University of Texas, writes about what he maintains we have lost sight of, reverence. While he admits the word is difficult to define, Mr. Woodruff says it \\"begins in a deep understanding of human limitations; from this grows the capacity to be in awe of whatever we believe lies outside our control--God, truth, justice, nature, even death.\\" If we have reverence, we respect people lower than ourselves; we are kind to children. Woodruff differentiates between religion and reverence. He says that some people the most fervent about their religion do not have reverence. There is reverence outside religion. Reverence moderates war in all times and cultures. Reverent people do not say they speak on the authority of God either. Mr. Woodruff describes how a group of young people without traditional religion can experiene reverence at a memorial service for a friend when they share both their sorrow and silence.<br /> The author gives many other examples of reverence or the absence thereof, citing references in both ancient China and ancient Greece as well as calling up the Victorian poet Tennyson.<br />I bought this book after having seen Mr. Woodruff discussing reverence in an interview by Bill Moyers. I must say that while the book is both thought provoking and thoughtful, it is far too long. The author repeats himself over and over. I could have gotten the point from a chapter or two on the subject in a book of essays or in a  long journal article.<br />Having said that, I was so taken by Mr. Woodruff's comments on The Iliad that I ordered the translation he cites to reread this work for the first time in many years.	2003-06-08

The recipes in this slick cookbook are neither for beginners, the lazy or the poor. One could invest a good deal of time and money in preparing some of these elaborate dishes. There are some fairly simple bread recipes in this book that I want to try; and I can testify that the Key Lime Cheesecake with a Toasted Nut Crust (page 258) is as good a cheesecake recipe as I have ever seen. I believe the secret is that the eggs are separated. The cake is as light as a souffle when done. I have baked it three times now, and my friends cannot get enough of it. (This recipe alone makes the book worth owning.) Directions are minimal, however, so you're on your own. (For example, you are never told to grease the springform pan. Neither are you given any indication as to how the cake will look when done.)<br />What this book does provide, however, is insight into what a meal would be like at Norman's Restaurant. Also, all information about the wonderful fresh vegetables and fruit of South Florida--complete with great photographs-- makes those of us who must drive half a day to see the ocean hungry for salt air.	2003-06-07

I read several years ago ENDLESS LOVE, a novel I liked immensely and was therefore eager to start this one. The novel is certainly an easy read. You can race right through it. It's all about Daniel Emerson's obsession with Iris Davenport and his pursuit of her come hell or high water as he rides out his passion in a fragile \\"paper boat,\\" if you want to mix your metaphors. The characters for the most part are well developed although I thought Iris's husband may have been almost a stereotype. Spencer tackles head-on the dicey subject of an affair between a black woman and white man, certainly an area not every writer is willing to explore.<br /> Having finished the novel, I was troubled by the character Daniel, however. Although his lover Kate continuously describes him as a good man, I'm not at all sure he is. I believe the moral question is this: does anyone have a right to insist on getting whatever he thinks he wants, no matter who gets hurt or destroyed along the way, in order that he can have an all consuming affair? There are of course similarities in Daniel and the young man in ENDLESS LOVE who, as I recall, in a fit of passionate love, burns down the home the young girl he's crazy about lives in. We may be able to forgive youth their folly. I'm not sure we can overlook as easily the sins of people entering middle age.<br />Having said that, if you accept the premise that everyone here gets hurt or destroyed, you'll find this compelling reading.	2003-06-05

I have read &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; three times. It is as good a short story as I have ever read. The writer manages to say more in about 20 pages than many modern fiction writers say in hundreds of pages if ever. In this somber, heartwrenching story, a hung-over young doctor from a county clinic visits a patient out on the prairie, a forty-four-year-old woman suffering from depression. Neither the young doctor nor the reader is ready for what he discovers. I literally gasped out loud when I discovered how this woman lost all her fingers on one hand. Reading this story was a first for me. I do not believe any short story (only a few novels) had ever made me weep. This story did. So much going on here. The young doctor tries so hard, but we have to ask just how &quot;good&quot; he is. Many of us have had the sad experience of having a &quot;professional&quot; not listening to us.<br />When I finished wonderful book, I had to ask: why on earth is this writer attending law school?

Just when it seemed there was nothing else to be said about southern cooking, Edna Lewis and Scott Peacock print this outrageously wonderful book. All your favorite Southern recipes and then some are here-- from pimento cheese to pigs' feet to pecan pie to pound cake. This book is far more than a collection of recipes, however. There are tips on everything from the best cornmeal to use for different cornbreads to the use of peanut oil versus homemade lard. Most importantly, this book is the story of a friendship that transcends generations and race and distance.<br />The color photographs by Christopher Hirsheimer are exquisite. Many of them approach art--particularly the photos of fruits and vegetables-- and should be enlarged and framed. This cookbook opens with the famous Scarlett O'Hara line: &quot;As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again.&quot; She would if she read this cookbook.<br />A great book to give to both those who cook and those who don't or to anyone interested in the rich heritage of Southern cooking.	2003-05-31

The plot meanders and loops around, but Mr. Marlette connects all the dots eventually. His attention to detail is great. For instance, I had forgotten that women of my grandmother's generation in the South dipped Tube Rose snuff. I notice that Pat Conroy gave this novel a glowing review. I can see why.

Like all fine poems, these should be read again and again rather than explicated. Mr. Schultz writes about everyday things-- a dog's marking his territory, an answering machine, playing solitaire. He is a master of understatement. In the moving poem \\"Darwin, Sweeping\\" about an apartment superintendent, Mr. Schultz says \\"Bernice, his wife of fifty-one years, died last week/and that's why he's sweeping the steps, the walk, the street too.\\" Those lines are just as poignant as Emily Dickinson's \\"the bustle in a house the morning after death.\\" So many memorable lines in these poems-- how about \\"before Christ discovered America\\"? Or a mulatto who committed suicide is described as \\"born only half out of luck.\\"<br />There are three related poems apparently written about the poet's mother, \\"Alzheimer's,\\" \\"Nomads,\\" and \\"Apartment Sale\\" that go straight to the heart. I read them recently while visiting my 83 year old mother as she wandered from room to room looking for something she had just lost-- and found-- and lost again.<br />These are indeed beautiful, sad poems.	2003-01-11

The narrator, Kevin Doyle, is dealing with the recent death of his mother who may have committed suicide because of the affair his father was having and at the same time is trying to hide his sexual feelings toward other boys-- all that in addition to the common problems of being seventeen. Altogether believable and lovable, he thinks and talks just like an adolescent does and is certainly an empathetic character. There is an innocence about Kevin and his friends that we will not see again. It is a time before AIDS and hard drugs and metal detectors in schools where the drug of choice for these students is beer.<br />There is a beautiful passage early in this novel when Kevin's English teacher, referring to Robert Frost's \\"Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening,\\" asks him why he would stop in a woods to watch the woods fills up with snow. Kevin responds: \\"Without thinking I say, 'To remember my mom. She loved how the snow covered up all the garbage and dirt. She's sit for hours on the porch watching the snow fall. She grew up in Ireland and the snow doesn't last long there. She always said the snow was like a million fairy lights when the streetlamps caught the flakes just right.'\\" This is a perfect, sensible answer to the pedantic question.<br />One could do worse than have a son or brother so perceptive.	2003-01-03

I have five of her bookbooks and from pleasant experience know that she has no bad recipes in any of her books. This one is no exception. If you can read English and own an oven, I'm not sure how you could possibly screw up one of these cakes. Ms. Heatter spends two to three pages on the simplest of cakes. She tells you where to place the rack in the oven, how many minutes to beat the sugar and butter together and what the batter will look like. For example, in the recipe for Cranberry Upside-Down Cake on page 201, she says: \\"The mixture might appear slightly curdled--it is okay.\\" I'm happy to say I cooked this cake for the first time a few days ago. My friends thought it was wonderful. The best lemon cake I have ever baked and/or eaten has to be East 62nd Street Lemon Cake(page 22.)Over 20 years ago, when I had never melted chocolate in my life, I cooked a perfect Queen Mother's Cake (pp. 54-56.)The Robert Redford Cake(59-61)is a wonder to behold. Then there is the Oreo Cookie Cake, and on and on they go.<br />There are sections on all kinds of cakes here: plain cakes, chocolate cakes, layer cakes, fancy cakes, cheesecakes, fruitcakes, cakes with fruits and vegetables, yeast cakes, sweet breads and more. And all kinds of tips-- even how to wash a pastry brush.<br />There are no photographs in this book but who needs them? Your own cakes will be pretty enough to photograph. If you own other Heatter cookbooks, be forewarned; these recipes have been previously published in two of the author's earlier dessert books but here the cake recipes are all together.<br />I must admit that I find the cheesecake recipes-- at least most of them, a little over the top. I suppose that's because cheesecake recipes have been anthologized to death and Ms. Heatter sought out the most exotic ones. And I, being a lazy cook, an unwilling to fool with baking a cheesecake in a pan of water.

When I used to grade student themes, I could find something good to say about the worst of papers. Here goes for this book. The title is clever; some of the chapter titles are clever; the writer can turn a phrase. I'm thinking now, for example, of his description of his mother's Georgia accent making everything she said sound \\"like it went through a curling iron.\\" I suspect Mr. Burroughs would be a scintillating dinner guest, but I did not need, however, 300 or so pages about these people none of whom I cared a whit about.<br />My first problem with the book is the author's note: \\"The names and other identifying characteristics of the persons included in this memoir have been changed.\\" Doesn't changing \\"indentifying characteristics\\" make this book fiction? At the very least, the reader has the right to ask how much of these events really happened. For the author's sake, I hope many of them did not.<br />This is simiply the worst book I've read this year with no other book coming anywhere close to being second.

Like the characters in this rich novel, she has reached thoughtful middle-age. According to the jacket blurb, the story is based on a a real life incident that Ms. Smith and other friends experienced while students at Hollins College, a ride down the Mississippi on a raft. This novel is the story of women who went down the river on a raft in 1965 and those who made a similar journey in 2000, but this time they are on a river boat and much older and wiser-- well, sort of. On this trip there are four women. One of them, Harriet, has the ashes of one of the original participants in the young frolic. Ms. Smith is totally on target about the 60's; all her allusions ring true from STEPPENWOLF (the novel, not the rock group)to Simon and Garfunkel to the fashions of the times et cetera. What has happened to these characters reminds me of what another 60's Icon John Lennon said, \\"Life is what happens when yuou're busy making other plans.\\" Or not making plans in the case of Harriet. For us English majors it was old home week as well with references to Yeats, the crushes on professors, the earnest student poetry. And certainly all of us knew at least one student more pretentious than we were who named his or her dog not Fido but after a literary figure--I remember a yappy dog named \\"Pip\\" from GREAT EXPECTATIONS--Ms. Smith got it all just right.<br />There is a myriad of details about these characters; both the men and women characters are complex and richly developed. Although the device of having characters ride down a river has every chance of being trite and artificial, the author avoids these pitfalls just as the original rafters must have avoided the dangers of the Mississippi. The excitement and wonder of youth have given way to trecherous middle-age where the prospects of early Alzheimer's, breast cancer and suicide loom. To paraphrase another writer Ms. Smith obviously likes, \\"things fall apart.\\" This is particularly so in middle-age.<br />One thing Ms. Smith seems to be asking is how much do we really know about our closest friends, a chilling thought.<br />I raced through the last hundred pages of this book. For me that is the ultimate compliment you can give to any writer.le-age.<br />One thing Ms. Smith seems to be asking is how much do we really know about our closest friends, a chilling thought.<br />I raced through the last hundred pages of this book.

'I couldn't quite get us back without incident  for the burial of my father.\\" With that opening sentence, Michael Collins begins the most intriquing tale of the death of a family member since Faulkner's AS I LAY DYING.\\" There is not a dull paragraph in this  compelling, seamless novel set in New Jersey and Michigan in the 1970's in the dead of a winter described so well by the author that you can feel the cold.<br /> Mr. Collins certainly has his finger on the pulse of a certain portion of American society: they are blue collar workers who  either didn't go to or never finished college. Their finest hours were often in high school. They travel by automobile because they cannot afford to fly and stay in Holiday Inns and  steal the bedding from when they leave. They eat TV dinners and measure out their lives in TV soaps if they are so lucky as to remain alive. They are the poor underclass who cannot afford good lawyers so they receive the death penalty for their crimes, the ultimate joke on the poor from the rich in America. Yet out of this group Mr. Collins has created sympathetic characters whom you root for and care about desperately. Like Faulkner's Dilsey, some of them endure untold hardships and still survive. Who can know, for example, the pain of Frank Cassidy's stepson Robert Lee who must grapple with the burden of teenage angst plus knowing his father on Georgia's death row will soon be executed. Or the narrator Frank, who has had his brain fried from shock treatments, needing to know just what happened thirty years ago when his parents died.<br /> Even better than Collins' THE KEEPERS OF TRUTH, this novel is an amazing story of suspense, sorrow, death, despair and ultimately love. I'm not sure when we as Americans can start claiming the Irish Mr. Collins as our own writer but the time ought to be now. It is difficult to believe that the author of this page-turner was born in Ireland and not the U.S.  I only caught him in mistakes twice. Women in America paint their nails with polish and would never say \\"varnish.\\" Also, boys in the U.

This book is full of them. And in keeping with my theory that each book should have at least one dynamite recipe, the green tea pound on page 42 makes the cut. I'm pleased to say that a slice tastes great straight from the oven with a glass of cold milk. In addition to this great recipe, there are certainly many others I want to try.<br /> If you are on a diet or do not bake, however, just looking at these great photographs makes the book worth having.

I've read three of his novels and think he gets better with each one. THE BLACKWATER LIGHTSHIP was an altogether fine book and deserved the Booker Prize I think. So I couldn't wait to start this one. I confess that I'm not sure what is going on here. In the introduction Mr. Toibin presents some of his favorite artists. He says that he writes about \\"gay figures for whom, in the main, being gay seemed to come second in their public lives\\" writers who write in code, whose works are not published during their lifetime, who use vague pronouns in their poetry. (Certainly I  wouldn't have wanted to miss a novel like \\"DEATH IN VENICE,\\" for instance.) Toibin goes on further to say that writing this book helped him come to terms with his \\"own interest in secret, erotic energy,\\" his interest in  both Catholicism and Irish Protestants, his admiration for \\"figures who lived in a dark time and were not afraid,\\" and his fascination with sadness and tragedy. Herein lives Mr. Toibin's problem. He takes on too much in too little space. Additionally his treatment of these artists he admires is wildly uneven, both in depth and space. For example, the chapter on Oscar Wilde covers almost 50 pages; the chapter on Mark Doty-- one of my favorite writers-- covers only 7. And for the life of me I'm not sure what Mr. Toibin is trying to say in the concluding chapter entitled \\"Good-bye to Catholic Ireland,\\" a chapter I read twice. Like many Catholics who attempt to say what is wrong with their church, Mr. Toibin is too \\"tentative,\\" a word he uses elsewhere in this book, in his taking on the church. Certainly he is not alone in his dilemma, however. It's easy for me to make that criticism, never having walked in a Catholic altar boy's shoes either. In Toibin's chapter on Elizabeth Bishop, we are told that \\"like all orphans, Bishop was clever at making friends and inventing a family for herself.\\" I suspect that that statement is true for many people but for \\"all orphans\\"? I'm not sure that that is a true statement.<br />There is a lot to like about this book, however. Mr. Toibin is never dull and is best when doing a narrative, something we would expect from a fine novelist. For example, when he describes a party that both he and Almodovar attended in Madrid, I wanted to be there. When I finished this book, I wanted to reread James Baldwin and read for the first time both Elizabeth Bishop and Thom Gunn. Toibin is also good at giving us delicious trivia about people. For example, we learn that Francis Bacon slept with a dog the night before being examined for military service in order to exacerbate his asthma and flunk his physical.<br />I'm certainly glad I read this book and would read anything by this writer.

The writers manage to strike a happy medium between a scholarly treatise and a popular biography, something I find very appealing. In addition to being a biography of the Carters, the book also is a history of country music in the first half of the Twentieth Century roughly and a statement on rural Southern sociology of the time as well.<br />The book is full of information that I suspect is told for the first time as well as trivia many of us knew but had forgotten: For example, there was a time when soft drinks were called \\"dopes\\" in East Tennessee. I had forgotten that and that my aunt wore Blue Waltz perfume. (There is a funny account of Maybelle's breaking a bottle of this dreadful perfume she was using as a slide for her guitar in a recording session.) I laughed out loud to learn that Helen Carter, who could learn to play any instrument almost immediately, was having trouble with her first accordian. It took Pee Wee King's telling her she was playing the instrument upside down to get her on the right track. The Original Carter Family was the first group to let the women lead as opposed to being backup singers. The less than admirable Ralph Peer of the recording industry coined the term \\"hillbilly\\" for the kind of music Carters and other country Southerners played in the early part of the 20th Century. There is a good account of A. P.'s collecting mountain songs all over the South. That contribution alone would make him a giant in folk/country music. Finally we learn a great deal about both generations of this great family, from A. P., Sarah and Maybelle to \\"Mama\\" Maybelle and her daughters. I was pleased to learn, for example, that Maybelle was as good and kind a person as she always seemed to be. (She even sat with sick people for part-time employment at one point in her later life when country music was in an eclipse.) There is a poignant contrast between what apparently was the long and happy marriage of Maybelle and A. P. Carter's brother Eck and A. P. and Sarah's marriage that ended in divorce. Certainly there is nothing more heart wrenching than Sarah's dedicating a song over the radio (apparently in the presence of A. P.) to the man she married after her divorce. The song was \\"I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes.\\" Coy Bays, the intended recipient, heard the song all the way in California and came to Texas for his woman. In the many years that A. P. lived alone thereafter, he never stopped loving Sara. She was preceded in death by him. Both of them are buried, however, only two rows from each other (even though Sara died in California and had been divorced from A.

I am deeply moved each time I reach this book; I cannot imagine how it would have affected me had I read it in 1964 when it was first published. This novel covers one day in the life of George, an English professor at a nondiscript college in California. The time is just before the Christmas season, that time in America dreaded by many of us who live alone. His lover Jim has recently died in a traffic accident. George is an outsider on many levels. He is British living in America, he is gay living in a heterosexual world, he is brillliant among mostly dull, uninteresting and uninterested college students, he is a man of good taste surrounded by tasteless neighbors.<br />Isherwood makes brillilant observations about people: that straight women friends often refuse to give up on making their gay male friends. \\"Do women ever stop trying? No. But, because they never stop, they learn to be good losers.\\" And George says what I have been saying for years, that all too often minorities hate all other minorites. Another observation is that middle-aged gay men look better than their straight counterparts: \\"What's wrong with them [straight men] is their fatalistic acceptance of middle age, their ignoble resignation to grandfatherhood, impending retirement and golf. George is different from them because. . . he hasn't given up.\\" Finally, Isherwood describes poignantly the unawareness of friends: \\"How many times, when Jim and I had been quarreling and came to visit you--sullking, avoiding each other's eyes, talking to each other only through you [haven't we all been in that awkward position]-- did you somehow bring us together again by the sheer power of your unawareness that anything was wrong?\\" There are countless gems like these through out this wonderful book.<br /> A perfect novel about loss and loneliness, A SINGLE MAN constantly gets named near the top of \\"best gay\\" lists of books as well as one of the great novels of the 20th Century, both distinctions it richly deserves.vels of the 20th Century, both distinctions it richly deserves.	2002-09-23

After the deaths of both their sons from AIDS, they took on Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina in an effort to upseat him. We all know they did not succeed in their efforts; nevertheless, they are winners of the highest sort. Althought the two women had led very different lives-- one was a Democrat, the other a Republican, they found they had much in common. In the words of Patsy Clark after these women's first meeting: \\"Both of our sons were named Mark--and that seemed huge to us. . . Both of us had led very mainstream, privileged lives. . . Each of us were widowed before our sons died, so each of us had to deal with that trauma alone. Neither of us had known that our sons were gay. . .\\" Another thing that they had in common was unconditional love for their sons and a consuming belief that no one, including the mighty Helms, would treat their sons as second class citizens because they were gay.<br />So we have another beautiful account of two ordinary women who did the right thing and we are the better for having heard their story. It is altogether fitting that Bishop John Shelby Spong, the kind and decent man also from North Carolina, should write a recommendation for this book and that Allan Gurganus should write the foreward.<br />A final word to \\"Phillojo,\\" who wrote the next review of this book: Homophobia is homophobia, whether it is yours or the senator's. Unlike HIV, it can be cured, but only if you are a willing patient. May I remind you that for years there was precious little funding for AIDS research because of people like Helms and a president who could not bring himself to utter the word. The truth is the truth, whether you like it or not.	2002-09-20

I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. The story gets off to a slow start and doesn't get a lot better. The story is told from the viewpoint of Bong Bong, a Fhilipino whom we first met in 1977 when he is eight. Much of the story concerns Bong Bong's-- he is later named Bob by foster parents-- attempt to find his parents who are victims of the Marcos regime and who have sent him to the United States to live with an aunt.<br />The book title comes from the letters that Bob writes to Montgomery Clift. Apparently we are to see the parallels between Bob and Monty. They both hide their sexual feelings for other males and are both self-destructive. Bob emulates Clift to his detriment. I found it difficult at times to have a lot of sympathy with Bob. I wanted him to get on with his life, difficult as his situation  was. I think the novel might have worked better told from the third person rather than the first, but then it would have been impossible to use the letters as a framing device.<br />The book is, however, worth reading but not anything I would call a great read. Perhaps the writer will get better  with his next story.	2002-09-17

His characters arise above stock characters to become people we care about, and his stories reach an emotional depth that many writers who consider them \\"serious\\" writers should envy. All the elements for failure are in this novel: incest, child pornography, child molestation, AIDS, national origin discrimination, the stigma of being gay, bigotted police officers. And yet from these diverse topics that would become cliches for a lesser talent, Mr. Nava produces a fine, believable story that rings true both psychogically and from a legal standpoint.<br />As always, Mr. Nava doesn't waste words. A detective who drinks too much is described as \\"Gimlet-eyed.\\" Enough said. And Mr. Nava's observations are too true: in the words of our old friend, Henry Rios, the gay Hispanic lawyer in this series of mysteries: \\"Society is a conspiracy and everyone who's different is its target.\\"<br />I read that this writer has written his last Henry Rios novel.

I hardly know what to say about the book lest I  trivialize such a horrible event in our nation's history. Mere words become cliches in the face of such courage and bravery of the passangers and crew of United Flight 93.<br />Two things jumped out at me when I read this book. First, several of the passengers and/or friends or relatives had premonitions that they should not take this flight. Second, many of the passengers changed their flight plans at the last minute and got on this plane because there were so many empty seats.<br />I was also taken by the diversity of those aboard. (After all, wasn't that one of the problems of the misguided monsters, that they did not believe in the diversity of the U. S.?) There were Caucasians, African Americans, a Puerto-Rican American, a Japanese student, a gay man, a married Baptist couple, Jewish folk, a disabled person, older people, young people, people on vacation, others on work assignments.<br />The book is extremely well written although I suspect that it almost wrote itself. I do not mean to take anything away from Mr. Longman, but a writer would have to work hard to make such a tragic event uninteresting. He includes photographs of the crew and passengers and fleshes out their lives. One passenger is on his way to pick up the remains of a loved one. Another passenger we find out collects refrigerator magnets from cities she has visited, a fact that made we smile since I have the same quirk.<br />Although these 40 people lost their lives, they did not go gentle. From the flight attendant who boiled water to throw on these devils to the other passengers who apparently stormed the cockpit, surely they are the best of our country's best citizens. There are goverment officials walking around Washington today who most assuredly owe their lives to these valiant passengers and crew.<br />One final thing. The people who got to the plane after it crashed in that field in Pennsylvania said that had they not known better, they would have thought the plane was empty, that it was as if the plane had made a previous landing and let off all the passengers. And I learned a chilling new phrase. The official cause of death of these passengers and crew was \\"death by fragmentation.\\"<br />It is fitting that someone in this book compared the resting place of these good people to Gettysburg.

This cookbook certainly gets 5 stars. My requirement for a cookbook is that the recipes should be doable by mortals and that there should be at least one recipe in the book worth keeping. This cookbook meets both requirements. I have tried only the passion fruit poundcake and the ginger cake. They get rave reviews because they are perfect recipes and easy to do. I came to the ginger cake with reluctance simply because I don't care much for either ginger or molasses in anything and am not into pepper as an ingredient in cakes. Since the author says that this recipe is the favorite of many people, I took the chance and, boy, am I  glad I did. In this recipe what you get is a beautifull deep brown, moist cake with great texture and subtle flavors. Mr. Lebovitz suggests fresh peaches to accompany this cake. A glass of cold milk goes well with it too.<br />In addition to 110 dessert recipes, many of them beautifully photographed, Mr. Levobitz has a chapter called \\"Essentials\\" in which he discusses equipment, ingredients and fruits. In his introduction he gives his philosophy of dessert-making, that they be simple and that less is often more. In this instance I would say less is just right.<br />If you like to cook unusual desserts, you will love this cookbook.	2002-09-08

However,  I decided if this man could live through this awful day and write about it, I could finish his story. This is the account of Chief Picciotto and other New York Firefigters' heroic rescue of many people in the north tower of the World Trade Center, then the tower falling around them, their being trapped for 3 or 4 hours in a tiny space, not knowing if they would ever get out, and thank God, their ultimate escape to safety.<br />The book is very well done and is full of painstaking details. For example, we learn that the sky was totally clear that awful day; otherwise the misguided monsters would not have been able to fly into the tower. As Picciotto and other firefighters are clearing the tower, he comes across on a twenty-seventh floor &quot;a well-dressed broker-type hunched over at his desk, typing crazily on his keyboard. . . at first I thought I was seeing things.&quot; (Can you believe this?)  There is also the account of the rescue of a group of disabled people who had somehow gathered on the same floor. When Chief Piccioto first sees them, he doesn't realize that they are disabled. &quot;And as they moved toward me, I thought I was seeing things. There were people in wheelchairs, people on crutches, people moving with the aid of walkers and canes, people hardly moving at all. There were people old enough to have been my grandparents--and they moved with the kind of hurry you usually find in tortoises.&quot; When the tower falls and Chief Piccioto stops moving, he is in a small space in total darkness. &quot;I thought I was dead. Really, I actually wondered if this was what it felt like to be dead. Think about it: It was pitch dark. There was no sound, no movement, no nothing.&quot; For me this is one of the most touching passages in the entire book.<br />So we have yet another account of one decent man of many responding with valor and courage in an impossible situation.

There is so much to say about the bravery and courage of the passengers and crew of Flight 93 and yet nothing that can be said to adequately honor them. <br />Mr. Longman writes compelling prose but I suspect that the events he describes practically wrote themselves. To the bare facts of what we knew already about the passsengers and crew members, their names, etc., he has fleshed out each passenger, including the misquided murderers-- not that I care to know much about these bastards-- bringing them closer to us as real people.

Peter Carey spent 30 days in Sydney in 2000 and we readers are the lucky recipients of his account. He clearly loves Sydney and demonstrates this love in every page of this little volume. His love is contagious. For example, on viewing what he calls &quot;the great Pacific Ocean,&quot; he writes: &quot;It is one of a hundred places you will find in Sydney which take your breath away, and I, familiar but disoriented, was in a state of constant amazement that any metropolis could be so blesssed.&quot; He also obviously cares deeply for his friends who still live there. About his friend Jack Ledoux he says: &quot;I have lived in more than one house Jack has designed and would be a happy man if I could wake up in one tomorrow morning and live in it all my life. Every time I walk into one of his constructions, it makes me happy.&quot; What an extraordinary way to describe a friend!<br /> Mr. Carey sets out to describe this great city in terms of earth, air, fire and water. He does this by having several zany friends of his-- some of them friends of thirty years-- tell their stories. Any one of these characters ought to be found in a novel, at least one of Mr. Carey's. In his hands they become flesh and blood and as interesting as the city they describe. Good stuff jumps out on every page. Mr. Carey admits that he cannot drive over Sydney's famous bridge without having a panic attack, a fact that is particularly significant to me since I suffer from the same problem with high bridges. Then there is the delicious account of the word &quot;Eternity&quot; and the little man responsible for writing the word everywhere or anywhere he felt his God called him to write it. Carey's handling of the &quot;Aborigine problem&quot; is particularly poignant in his discussion of Vicki, who was taken from her parents and raised by a white family.<br />Carey, now living in New York, did not move to Sydney, the city his mother said was just like Liberace, until he was almost forty-- &quot;. . . even then I carried in my baggage a typical Melbournian distrust of that vulgar crooked convict town.&quot;  I for one would love to see him write similar books about both Melbourne and New York.<br />So much good writing-- so many marvelous stories in 248 pages.

I get the distinct impression that Mr. Severgnini--and I do want to get his name spelled correctly since he says we Americans can't spell-- really had a good time the year that he spent in Georgetown. I know I certainly had a good time reading this often very funny book. He pokes fun at Americans and all our foibles with great wit and little or no mean spiritedness.<br />There are few aspects of America that Mr. S.-- I'm not taking any chances on misspelling his name-- misses. He covers malls,  freeway drivers, obesity, casual attire, overly friendly waiters, political correctness, our obsession with shopping, being in control, being organized, numbers and air conditioning, to name a few.<br />One of my favorite paragraphs from this book is Mr. S's take on America's bad taste or what he calls &quot;large-scale wanton tackiness.&quot; &quot;The hero figures of this America are Mae West, Liberace, Muhammad Ali, Joan Collins, and Ivana Trump. Larger than life personalities who at first sight, and often at second or third, are beyond comprehension. How can they like that stuff? The sacred places of this America are Las Vegas, Atlantic City, every bar in the state of Texas, and every swimming pool in California, as well as 90 percent of official ceremonies and any sports event you care to mention.&quot; This is a statement difficult to dispute.<br />I'm not completely convinced that this writer  could get an objective view of the U. S. from hanging out with Washington types. I wouldn't say that  people inside the Beltway, as the media would have us call them, are good examples of what Americans are like. I wonder if he would have sung a different tune if he had spent a year, for instance, in Nashville, Kansas City or Miami or some other large U. S. city besides Washington. At any rate, this book is a great read. I recommend reading it during these Dog Days of summer in a very cold air conditioned room!	2002-08-23

In this dark but often humorous novel, much of which is set in an English boys' school, the abomination ostensibly here is the one that the narrator's father quotes in a letter to him: the reference from Leviticus of a man lying with a man. Of course the irony is that there has been none of man lying with man here; it's all been men and boys-- more specifically, the narrator's ongoing sexual encounters with teachers at the school. I would argue that more abominable is the attitudes of the parents of the narrator (whose English name is James Moore), each most unattractive in different but unique ways.<br /> More sinned against than sinning, James is the most admirable character in this dense novel of few decent people-- the nanny, a minor character, comes to mind-- a better description would be that he's the least despicable of the main characters. He manages to survive boarding school by his sheer wit and considerable bravado.<br />  Some sections of this very well written novel  are extraordinary: the scene in which the narrator dons a flapper dress and shows up at a school dance is quite remarkable. The section near the end of the novel when the narrator rhapsodizes about the brave gay men who came out after Stonewall, many of whom died in the AIDS holocaust, is fine writing and approaches poetry, I think.  \\"We remember them walking with their heads held high against the winds of catastrophe, walking with that special nonchalant grace that so characteriazed them; or their heads thrown up for drama, telling tales of a luminous blue about themselves, about people like us, about the outcast children of Sodom and Gomorrah. Bless you, darling boys; and thank you.\\" This quotation from a passage that goes for several pages and is almost an epiphany made me long for a different ending. But to take the words of the narrator for my own: \\"I'll get over it, I promise you that much, I swear to it.\\"<br /> Certainly it is the writer's right to take any view he prefers. I'm just mildly disappointed that a writer so young could be so cynical. Shouldn't that be a trait for the middle-aged? I felt a little like Peggy Lee singing \\"Is That All There Is\\" upon finishing this novel.

His prose literally flows like honey. In his latest, it's 1964 and Easy Rawlins is back. His old friend Mouse is dead, he smokes too much, can't run like he once could-- Easy always needs to make quick get-a-ways, as his readers will remember-- but he has a new, strong independent woman in his life. We are treated to a great plot as usual, and I suspect few people will figure out the ending. Mosley appears to know the city of Los Angeles, the setting of this novel, as well as he knew his buddy Mouse.<br /> Mr. Mosley's usual trademarks are here: real flesh and blood characters that rise above those often found in mysteries and a convoluted plot with unexpected twists and turns. Certainly  Mosley addresses the race issue. The LA Police Department doesn't come off very well-- and Mr. Mosley wrote this story before the latest scandal of California police officers caught on tape by an amateur photographer for all the world to see.<br /> What I always like best about Mr. Mosley is that he can create a character or a scene with the fewest of words. For example, remember the ugly duckling from high school. &quot;She was the kind of girl who would turn beautiful overnight.&quot; Or how about Mosley's description of factory workers that less talented writers would take paragraphs to describe: &quot;They were citizens of a nation that had won the major wars of the century and now they were enjoying the fruits of the victors: mindless labor and enough of anything they wanted to buy.&quot;<br />My only gripe about this book is the dull, uninteresting cover. Certainly this is no criticism of Mr. Mosley-- unless he selected it-- but I would have never been tempted to buy this book had I not known that Mr. Mosley always delivers. Let's hope this cover gets tossed in the paperback version.	2002-07-23

I particularly like his autobiography SONGS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME. There is certainly nothing wrong with Ms. Bosworth as a writer. The book is an interesting, easy read. My objection is not to Ms. Bosworth but to the constraints of the format of Penguin LIVES. It appears to me that a writer cannot do an in-depth examination of someone's life in such a short book-- assuming that anyone will ever get much into the inner recesses of Mr. Brando's mind. Perhaps his private life should remain private. For instance, do I need to know that he has taken the drug librium for years? I think not. Additionally I would have liked to see footnotes. Ms. Bosworth makes a lot of statements about Brando with not the slightest hint of where shes got such information. Granted, she does list other biographies she consulted as well as the people she interviewed for writing this bio. I assume that extensive footnotes would have make the book too long. Having said all that, I am now in need of a Brando film festival, having finished the book. Ms. Bosworth made me want to revisit the Brando movies I've seen and see others for the first time.	2002-07-13

He has written a very fine first novel about the horror of molestation told from the child's standpoint. Fee, a Korean-American growing up in Maine, is molested by his choir director Big Eric. Not one to shy away from thorny subjects, Mr. Chee, nevertheless, treats the delicate subject of molestation with restraint and grace. He is very good at creating a certain mood with few words. This novel is full of colors. The dark Fee is attracted to the gold of blondes. White, the color of death, is associated with the absence of color. The final section of the book is entitled \\"Blue.\\"<br />My one criticism of this novel is that I was unable to distinguish the voice of Fee from that of the character Waren.

I'm a big fan of his, having fallen in love with his essays after reading \\"The Man In The Water\\" several years ago. Mr. Rosenblatt convinces me that he is just as much a patriot as, say, the current White House inhabitants, perhaps more so. In these 30 essays, many of which were written before 9/11, a fact that shouldn't be overlooked, Mr. Rosenblatt tells what he finds good about this country.<br />There are essays on gun control-- Mr. Rosenblatt believes it is an idea whose time has come-- baseball, lawyers-- he says we are glad for them when we need them-- he even includes a chapter on being out of this world... Rosesnblatt writes with wit, good humour and a gentleness even when he is describing a theory or person he disagrees with completely. There is much that even arch conservatives should like in these essays.<br />In a sweet, nostalgic essay called \\"We're Old-Fashioned,\\" the author describes three aged spinsters who took him in as a five- year-old boy and read to him, taking him into the \\"kindom of words.\\" Such a phrase is a perfect way to describe this fine collection, Mr. Rosenblatt's Love Letter to America.	2002-07-02

We should thank Mr. Hall for sharing his most intimate thoughts on such a private and painful subject.<br /><br />Mr. Hall's imagery is beautiful. Listen to the opening lines of \\"Kill The Day.\\"<br /><br /> \\"When she died it was as if her car accelerated<br /> off the pier's end and zoomed upward over death water<br /> for a year without gaining or losing altitude. . . \\"<br /><br />In the poem \\"Ardor\\" lust is described as \\"grief that has turned over in bed to look the other way.\\" Finally in the concluding poem in the book \\"Affirmation\\" Hall describes the indifference of the young to growing old with this wonderful image: \\"we row for years on the midsummer pond, ignorant and content.\\"<br /><br /> These poems bring, if not comfort, at least the knowldge that we are not alone in our own losses. As in all good art, the particular becomes the universal.	2002-07-02

Jason is a jock and has a girl friend so he is sure nobody knows he is gay. Nelson dyes his hair lemon-lime and paints his nails, so everybody knows. Kyle, though not good at contact sports, is on the swim team and is somewhere in between. These boys are all seventeen; they all deal with coming-out in their own individual ways-- from their relations with other students, their parents and each other.<br />Even though the novel is a bit predictable, it is very upbeat and instructive without being preachy. This book, of course, couldn't have been written a few years ago so things are better for gay teens now even with the advent of HIV. I cannot imagine  the thrill of finding something like this book in my high school library in the 50's. As Lily Tomlin says in one of her monologues: \\"there were no gay people then; we were just shy.\\"<br />I liked all three boys immensely and was pleased with the ending. From what little I know of gay teenagers, I'm convinced  Mr. Sanchez has created honest, believable characters.<br />A usual addition is a list of services available to gay teens at the end of the book. RAINBOW BOYS should be required reading for high schools students-- both gay and straight, their parents, their teachers and high school guidance counselors as well.	2002-07-01

You can go home again, at least if you are Noble Norfleet, Reynolds Price's latest character. While there is a lot to like about this wondrously complex novel, the African American characters seemed to be too perfect. I understand tha race is often an issue in American novels, particularly those written by Southerners. I also know that many black Southerners and white Southerners have always been friends and care about each other. Noble Nofleet says, however: \\"No black person had ever lied to me or done me the least unkindness I could think of.\\" Perhaps this is a true statement made by a seventeen year old boy, but Noble says similar things all through this novel. I find that statement difficult to believe. Also, at first I was taken aback by the explicit sex in this novel, certainly explicit if we compare this novel to Price's earllier writing. But would I have made that criticism of, say, John Updike or Norman Mailer. Certainly not. So Mr. Price can describe sex in any fashion he chooses. These are just minor complaints about what is as good a story as Mr. Price ever told. Noble is like  many of Price's previous male characters. They are ordinary, quiet people who will never made the newspapers. They pretty much live within the law; but they are decent beyond measure. No one else writes about these types of men with the empathy that Mr. Price does. Noble ultimately does the right thing-- by his mother, by Hesta, by practically everyone he encounters. For all his imperfections, he does become what his name implies, noble. He is in the tradition of many fictional characters, going back as far as Odysseus, who are trying to get back home.<br />A teller of wonderful tales, Mr. Price has few peers when it comes to writing prose.	2002-06-29

You won't be able to put this book down once you get started. There is not a dull page here. Events take many twists and turns. Even though Noble may be ordinary, many awful things happen to him. But isn't that true of the lives of many people who have lived to be over 50 in the late Twentieth Century?<br />There are so many things I liked about Noble: for example, his attitude toward organized religion-- I suspect he is speaking for the author here when he describes ministers during the Civil Rights and Vietnam era-- \\". . . almost none of them stepped out and said what Jesus would have said about rights for black people or about the filthy war.\\" Then there's Noble's comments about physicians: \\"Doctors, if you'll notice, mostly call themselves Doctor. They'll walk in a room where a scared patient's waiting; and instead of saying, 'hey, I'm Jonathan Daniel,' they'll almost invariably say 'I'm Doctor Daniel'-- just in case the white coat isn't magic-badge enough.\\" I particularly liked Noble on frozen vegetables: \\"Why does any live human ever buy frozen vegetables, I ask myuself every time I eat a mouthful: why not eat wet newspaper instead?\\"<br />No contemporary writes better prose than Mr. Price.

As everybody must know by now, this is the story that turned Atlanta upside down. I had read so many bad reviews of THE WIND DONE GONE that I expected not to be able to finish it. It's not nearly as bad as the critics say and parts of the tale are quite intriguing.<br />Yes, the characters are black and white-- no pun intended here-- many of them-- and there are a lot of them for such a small book-- aren't developed very much. This is not the great American novel-- it's hardly more than a long short story-- but then GONE WITH THE WIND is not the great American novel either. The title is awfully clever. Ms. Randall's idea is a good one-- we all know that slaveowners had sex with their slaves, that is, everyone except Margaret Mitchell apparently-- but Ms. Randall's execution is not nearly as good as her ideas are. She throws in enough \\"stuff\\" here to make a gumbo from the cliche about trying black and you'll never go back to the story of why \\"Amazing Grace\\" was written.<br />What I found most compelling is Ms. Randall's portrayal of the narrator's-- we all know by now she's Scarlett's half-sister-- relationship or lack of  relationship with her slave mother since they had been separted. This was very well done and quite moving.	2002-06-21

David Leavitt has accomplished almost the impossible. He has managed to make what is in my opinion one of the most beautiful cities on earth dull. This book opens with such a great first line: &quot;Florence has always been a popular destination for suicides.&quot; After a few interesting pages, however, I found myself in page after page of virtually unreadable prose. Leavitt even manages to make the moving of Michelangelo's famous statute of David not very interesting.  I'm not quite sure what went wrong. I had read his previous book ITALIAN PLEASURES written with Mark Mitchell. While I did not find it the greatest travel book ever written, it was certainly a pleasant enough read.<br />I was amused to see that Leavitt describes Franco Zeffirelli's autobiographical film &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot; as making &quot;for a camp spectacle that  recalls some of the graver excess committed by Zeffirelli in his career as an opera director.&quot; Would that we had a little more camp excess here. Near the end of the book Leavitt's account of the young people or &quot;mud angels&quot; who came to Florence to help save books and art after the flood of 1966 was interesting. If we only had more such stories.<br />If I didn't already love Florence, this book would not convince me to visit.	2002-06-21

Ben, who is eleven, after the death of his mother is left alone with only his father and a very old dog Hilda for company. And a couple of friends. \\"He was the only boy in school who had a girl for his best friend, and he could usually smile at Robin's [his cousin] joking. After his mother died, though, Ben's outlook changed; and he went on feeling sad for a long time.\\" Rather than attempt to answer the unaswerable, Mr. Price lets Ben tell his story. And a fine and moving story it is. In this marvelous little tale, Ben prays for an elephant, the animal his mother has taught him to draw. \\"See, there's really no question at all that elephants are better than people. They always take care of their young, they never kill anything unless they have to, and they talk to each other over miles of distance in voices so deep we can't even hear them.\\" This lad may be onto something here in my favorite passage from the story.<br />The characters are all well drawn and completely believable-- from Ben's friend Dunk to his father who sometimes handles his own grief by getting  drunk. Ater all, malt may do more than Milton cab to justify God's ways. . . Ben's grief for his mother and loneliness are palpable. The story, however, never becomes maudlin. Ben copes and survives; and there is not a \\"grief counselor\\" within a thousand miles.<br /> No one writing today is better with words than Mr. Price. His evocative, concise language is both beautiful and moving. I bet children love this story. This adult certainly did.	2002-06-18

Similar themes run through several of these stories. In many of them a male character, often young, is dealing with his sexual feelings for other males and the realization that he is different. They range in age from a ten year old (\\"The Dress\\") to the middle-aged Roland--who has the least self-awareness of any of these characters-- in the title story \\"The Rose City.\\" There is not a happy male among them as they grapple with who they are or who they are becoming. I found the youngsters particularly poignant. But perhaps the saddest character in any of the stories is Roland. Obsessed with his appearnce, he is 48, has had a nose job, constantly works out, is forever looking for a new \\"hubby-hub.\\" Nothing much ever changes in his life. I fear that Roland is not as different from some of us as we would hope. A most interesting if not admirable character.<br />So these stories, while they may not get you up and dancing, ring completely true. Mr. Ebershoff is a very fine writer. He has a wonderful gift of setting a tone or describing a character or situation in few words. Here are only two examples: An AIDS victim is someone \\"who died in his sleep, boiled over with fever.\\" We experience immediately the horror of this man's death. Another example: Jon in \\"Regime\\" describes his mother as \\"custardy in the upper arm.\\" A wonderful image. There is nothing left to be said.<br />These are bleak but thoughtful stories. I recommend them highly.	2002-06-04

He certainly does not disappoint in this small memorial of some of the brave men who lost their lives on 9/11, the day of infamy. FIREHOUSE is the account of the thirteen firefighters of Engine 40, Ladder 35 who answered the emergency call to go to the World Trade Towers. Of the thirteen who left on the mission, only one returned.<br />Inside the front and back panels of the book is a reproduction of the actual list of firemen who were posted to answer the call on 9/11; their photographs are printed on the back cover. These become a makeshift memorial to these men not unlike the Vietnam Wall or the AIDS Quilt. I found myself looking back at their names and photographs as Halberstam introduces each of the thirteen.<br />These men's bios are sketchy as are the actual facts of what they faced on 9/11. They were overwhelmingly white, most of them married or about to be, many of them the sons or brothers or cousins of other New York firefighters. An interesting tidbit: most of these men were fine cooks as well.<br />There is hardly a negative statement about any of these men, a fact that shouldn't surprise anyone since Halberstam interviewed surviving relatives and colleagues shortly after 9/11. It is human nature to remember only the good of loved ones so recently after a tragedy. I did learn, however, that Jimmy Giberson, described as a natural leader, was separated from his wife. Certainly I, a complete stranger, do not need more details of his failed marriage. I'm much rather learn that in a video shot by a contract cameraman on 9/11 Giberson is identified as the man going into the  south tower ahead of the captain, an unusual fact that at first puzzled the remaining firemen. But a close friend resonded: \\"Jimmy was always in front. Always. With those long legs, you couldn't keep up with him. And no one was going to stop him on something like this.\\"  We can reserve expose journalism for another day and another subject.<br /> There are poignant facts: the fireman who would have been on that truck had he not had a medical appointment, the friend who filled in for him. Especially sad are the brand new firemen fresh out of school, one of whom had never gone to a fire before. There is finally the accounts of the memorial services, often two: one before the body is found, the other after, sometimes months afterwards when the body has been identified. The body of one of these twelve men, Steve Mercado, had not been found when Halberstam wrote this book.<br />I was so glad to see that Mr. Halberstam, no stranger to tragedy in his own life, did not take the view, so often taken by glib journalists, that the surviving friends and family of these brave men achieved \\"closure\\" by simply attending a service or identifying a body. Here is Halberstam's description of Jack Lynch, the father of Michael Lynch: \\"In the meantime, Jack Lynch understod that there was a void in his and his wife's lives, and in the lives of all their children, and that nothing else would be quite the same, that a part of them was missing. There would always be a part of them all that was missing.<br />The tragedy, he said, was the only thing in all his life that had truly challenged his faith.\\"<br />Apparently these men were just ordinary men doing what firemen routinely do: answering emergency calls that put them in harm's way.

The quilt has almost become a cliche for some of us now-- we have seen it so many times in so many different variations and sizes-- that I did not believe I could be so moved and relive that intensely emotional and poignant day in October. I was wrong. I was taken by Mr. Jones' sincerity and utter lack of egotism. He is remarkably candid about his own life as he takes the reader through his own experiences as a young gay activist in San Francisco, his role in the history of the quilt and his own diagnosis with HIV.<br />Mr. Jones reminds me of things I had forgotten or repressed: a lot about the heroism of Harvey Milk, for example, the awfulness of Anita Bryant, the indifference of the first President Bush who was too busy to see the quilt, of President Clinton, along with Mrs. Clinton and the Gores, who was not too busy to pay tribute to those who had fallen. We get to see some of our national celebrities in a new light: the gentle Rosa Parks, the beautiful Elizabeth Taylor frightened at making a speech, and finally Jane Fonda who can only be described as totally silly in her adoration of Tom Hayden.<br />A friend of mine who has seen the quilt in its entirety many times and is active in the Names Project in his hometown in Maine says that he can only read this book a little at a time. Yes, it's very viseral, sometimes painful, and it will make you cry.<br /> In the Epilogue Mr. Jones writes: \\"My hope is that one day AIDS will be over and we will have to look upon all its different aspects: how it drew a country together from across cultural, ethnic, and religious divisions, and how it was, like the Holocaust, a crucible of definition. I think the Quilt will have a role in this discussion and a place in our history as memory is preserved and recreated imn this symbol of our natural desire for commuity.\\"<br />And you, Mr. Jones, will have a place in that history. Many Americans cannot thank you enough for that.a role in this discussion and a place in our history as memory is preserved and recreated imn this symbol of our natural desire for commuity.\\"<br />And you, Mr. Jones, will have a place in that history.

US	51803143	R1VPEV2J3GBBS2	0312420234	482567189	Hooking Up	Books	4	2	4	N	N	The Write Stuff	I can think of no essayist writing in the U. S. today in the class with Tom Wolfe with the exception of the venerable Gore Vidal. As usual, Mr. Wolfe delivers up insightful satire on a variety of subjects: the sexual mores of America's youth, the awfulness of most modern so-called art, the decadence of the \\"literary\\" novel, to name a few. Then there is a short novel AMBUSH AT FORT BRAGG. I totally agree with Mr. Wolfe in his assessment of the artist Frederick Hart called \\"The Invisible Artist.\\" Is is common knowledge now that the \\"art\\" world, that world that  Wolfe describes as \\"scarcely a world. . . some three thousand curators, dealers, collectors, scholars, critics, and artists in New York\\" refused to ever acknowledge or even review Hart's beautiful sculptures at both the National Cathedral and the Vietnam Soldiers. (Something tells me that Michelangelo would have given Mr. Hart a fantastic review.) As Mr. Wolfe says so well, Hart was doomed; he had a quality not found in many  so-called modern artists, he was skilled.<br />Another great essay is \\"My Three Stooges.\\" Here Mr. Wolfe gets the last laugh on Messers Mailer, Updike and Irving, all of whom attacked A MAN IN FULL as mere entertainment. While I disagree with Wolfe's assessment of some of the writers he lists as having written \\"wonderful\\" novels-- I'm thinking in particularly of WAITING TO EXHALE; I would never call that novel wonderful but a quick, mindless entertaining read-- certainly he is right that some of the Mailer and John Irving \\"stuff\\" is basically unreadable-- I've never known anyone who could have read ANCIENT EVENINGS even if they had wanted to. So Wolfe gets the last laugh on these \\"literary\\" writers. I believe many people would say, however, that Updike's  Rabbit is a great character and as American as Huck Finn.<br />But even if you disagree with Mr. Wolfe, he entertains you, makes you smile, and, yes, makes you think.	2002-05-18

After a laborious slow start-- I was tempted to abandon reading this book-- this dark novel suddenly became everything I have come to expect from McEwan-- I was so glad I heeded Mr. Potok's advice as I was gloriously rewarded for my efforts. ATONEMENT is the best and most ambitious of Mr. McEwan's novels, even better than his Booker Prize winner AMSTERDAM. The action covers a long period of time: from 1935 to 1999; the characters in this dark novel are unforgettable: Cecilia, Robbie, Briony. Although I finished this book weeks ago, I cannot get Briony out of my mind. Is she just a silly, selfish 13 year old girl when we meet her or the essence of evil? She commits an ugly, vicious deed that changes irrevocably the lives of both Robbie and her older sister Cecilia. While Briony as an adult may carry as many bedpans as she wants to and bind up the wounds of every British soldier who is sent to her hospital, she cannot undo the awful thing she has done or atone, try as she may, for her evil deed. ATONEMENT stands for a difficult truth: we are responsible for our actions. We sometimes cannot make amends for the harm that we do to these people closest to us.<br />Mr. McEwan deserves all the critical acclaim he has received for this fine but troubling novel. It's too bad he couldn't have shared the Booker Prize with Peter Carey for this book. Is anyone who has read her surprised that Ann Beattie loved this novel? I bet Joyce Carol Oates-- speaking of a writer who does not find the truth on angels' wings-- would be crazy about this book too.<br />This novel had the same profound impact on me as other novels I consider world class: SOPHIE'S CHOICE, BLINDNESS, DISGRACE, THE SOUND AND FURY, to name a few.	2002-05-13

Whether the news will be death or deliverance I do not know.\\" Thus, Brendan Lemon begins this very engaging novel, the story of John Webster, an American, and his lover, Eduardo, a younger Cuban boxer. The story is told from the perspective of John, who as the novel begins, is writing from a jail cell in Cuba to Eduardo and does not know whether he will live or die. Webster is accused of murdering a young teenage Cuban, a crime actually committed by Eduardo. Although in his Acknowledgments page Lemon lists Reinaldo Arenas' BEFORE NIGHT FALLS as one of his influences, he assures the reader that he has never \\"set foot\\" in Cuba. This tale, however, is quite believable. It is refreshing to read something that isn't another gossipy New York \\"gay\\" novel with brittle characters so smug about having escaped the provences.<br />Wondrously suspenseful, the book is quite a page turner. My chief criticism is that after all the buildup-- we literally do not know if this is John's \\"last night\\"--  the story ends rather abruptly and not totally to my satisfaction. The novel is still a good one, however, with interesting characters and a poignant love story. A great find, well worth reading. I hope Mr. Lemon writes another novel soon.	2002-05-03

I remember liking THE LURE a great deal and recommending it to all my friends. I certainly thought LIKE PEOPLE IN HISTORY was well worth the read. I do not know what went wrong with ONYX. I read that Mr. Picano lost a lover to AIDS. Any gay male in any major city in the United States in the last 20 years who is fortunate enough to be alive certainly understands the writer's loss. That, however, is no excuse for this book. Mr. Picano should have written another AIDS memoir or worked harder on this novel. The characters are basically black and white. I had difficulty believing they were real. For example, Ray, an Adonis, in the most graphic of scenes, has sex with the \\"straight\\" blue-collar worker Mike, who is also an Adonis, over and over, then rushes to give a blow by blow description of his adventures to his dying lover Jesse, who is without jealousy, can't wait to hear such stories and encourages Ray, who feels no guilt.  Mike and Ray do not practice \\"safer\\" sex either. Certainly we have all known too many parents of AIDS patients who are awful people; but Jesse's mother, Adele Vaughan Moody, nee Carstairs-- if one can belive that name--is totally bad, a complete caricature. The basest characters must have some glimmer of goodness if they are to be believed at all. Finally the awful hospital scenes were so graphic as to be unreadable. I think Mr. Picano achieved a first in his minute description of how a body is burned in a crematory. Surely the Greeks, who were right about so many things, were absolutely correct when they had some things happen off stage. <br />Many fine books about AIDS, both memoirs and novels, have been written in the past two decades. Monette's BORROWED TIME: AN AIDS MEMOIR, Mark Doty's HEAVEN'S COAST, the wonderful HOLDING THE MAN by the Australian writer Timothy Conigrave, Allen Gurganus' PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERS, Edumnd White's THE MARRIED MAN, come to mind. Sadly this novel does not make thelist.<br />Reading this novel was not a total waste, however. I think I'll rent some of the Astaire/Rogers movies one of Picano's characters keeps watching to entertain himself. I kept wishing I were watching the graceful Astaire and Rogers instead of plowing through this novel.	2002-05-02

Certainly we have all known too many parents of AIDS patients who are awful people; but Adele Vaughan Moody, nee Carstairs-- do you belive that name--is a total caricature. The basest characters have some glimmer of<br />goodness if they are to be believed at all. Finally the awful hospital scenes were so graphic as to be unreadable. I think Mr. Picano achieved a first in his minute description of how a body is burned in a crematory. Surely the Greeks who were right about so many things were absolutely on target when they had some things happen off stage.<br />Many fine AIDS books, both memoirs and novels, have been written in the past two decades...Sadly this one does not fall in that category. It's far too much, far too late.	2002-05-02

The tragedy of this book is that thoughtful people who might overwise read it may not because they perceive it as a \\"gay\\" novel, whatever that means. This is a gay novel in the way BELOVED is a black novel or PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT is a Jewish novel. A book that anyone who loves serious literature should read, it has all the things I look for in a good novel: an involved plot, wonderful character development and beautiful language. If you believe the old fashioned novel is dead, At SWIM TWO BOYS should convince you otherwise. It actually feels like a 19th century novel in its epic quality. Yes, the three main characters are gay; and this book is as good as any-- perhaps better than any with gay characters I can recall. Almost 600 pages long-- you will be amazed at how quickly the pages fly by-- the novel is set in Ireland in 1915 and 1916. The three main characters, two teenage boys, Jim and Doyler and an adult, MacMurrough, become as real to you as your friends and family.  These characters possess a resilience and courage that will make you care for them desperately. Ultimately they will break your heart.<br /> Mr. O'Neill's prose is fine indeed. One example: there is a wonderful scene when MacMurrough watches Jim leave him. \\"A terrible fear shook him, a fear for his boy and what the future might hold. Lest he should stumble and the crowd should find him. For we live as angels among the Sodomites. And every day the crowd finds some one of us out. . . There is no grand mistake. Aristotle wrote something that Augustine got wrong that Aquinas codified in law. . . What hates is madness. There's no reason, only madness. . . Who but a madman could revile this boy?\\" This is NOT the love that dare not speak its name.<br />  Words used to describe this novel sound trite: \\"honor,\\" \\"optimism,\\" \\"friendship,\\" \\"patriotism,\\" \\"love.\\" We can only hope Mr. O'Neill does not take 10 years to write another novel.	2002-04-30

He then meanders to memories of his \\"Mamaw\\" from long ago in East Tennessee-- surely only Southerners call grandparents by that name-- to a poem by Cavafy, to buying an old Italianate Victorian House in Vermont with his partner who later died of AIDS. Along the way, Mr. Doty muses on the subject of balance: the desire to be in a relationship and the need to be free, the balance of order versus clutter, of staying rooted in one place and the need to travel-- and the joy of collecting simple, everyday imperfect things picked up in flea markets rather than perfect expensive objects.<br /> There are so many good things to say about this little 70 page gem that one hardly knows where to begin. Too often I read a work of nonfiction and wish it had remained a short magazine article. That is not so with this book. I wanted it to go on and on. Whether or not the author is correct in his analysis of still life painting, he is completely convincing. Of course, his language is always both concise and beautiful and never gets in the way of what he is saying. Near the end of the book Mr. Doty says \\"What makes a poem a poem, finally, is that it is unparaphrasable. . . I may try to explain it or represent it in other terms, but then some element of its life will always be missing. It is the same with painting.\\" Such a statement perfectly describes this little masterpiece.	2002-04-11

Quite an accomplishment for Ms. Dark. &quot;In The Gloaming&quot; is the story of a young man with AIDS who comes home to die and his mother's caring for him in his last illness. Early in the story Laird and his mother Janet are sitting on the terrace at the close of day. &quot;'The gloaming,' he said, suddenly. She nodded dreamily, automatically, then sat up. She turned to him. 'What?' Although she'd heard. 'I remember when I was little you took me over to the picture window and told me that in Scotland this time of day was called the 'gloaming.'. . .'I always thought it hurt you somehow that the day was over, but you said it was a beautiful time because for few moments the purple light made the whole world look like the Scottish highlands on a summer night.'&quot; Thus Ms. Dark sets the mood for this beautifully and delicately understated story. Janet seizes the waning days of her son's life. Each fleeting moment is precious as both of these individuals seek to know more of each other in the little time they have left. Laird's father Martin husband is not so lucky. He is one of Ms. Dark's characters who suffer from opportunities lost, a recurring theme in several of these stories. I must say the only jarring note in this exquisite story is Janet's deciding on a bagpipe for her son's funeral. I understand that this is a Scottish instrument. I just have heard &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; played on the bagpipes one too many times at memorial services for friends and acquaintances who died of AIDS. This is purely my own bias and probably unfair to Ms. Dark.<br />To me, many of these stories are equally as good as &quot;In The Gloaming.&quot; I particularly liked &quot;Home.&quot; This is again another story of the waning of life and the way loved ones react to the coming loss. In this instance,Gordon and Lil are being moved into an assisted living home--what a euphemism-- and Lil, who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's, asks and is granted permission to visit her home for one last time. There are no villains here, just decent people trying to make the best of a sad situation, the loss of health and ending of life as these two old people know it and their daughter Charlotte's trying to do what she perceives as the right thing for them. One can hardly fault her for doing what she has to do. Although she tries, she cannot know completely the utter horrow her mother faces at the loss of both her home and her intellect.<br /> These fine stories go straight to the heart.ved into an assisted living home--what a euphemism-- and Lil, who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's, asks and is granted permission to visit her home for one last time.

It is the searing account of his childhood in New Mexico, his life as a drug dealer in San Diego and Arizona and his five year sentence in a maximum-security prison for a crime that he says he did not commit. The things that happen to Mr. Baca would have killed a weaker person. He is abandoned by both his parents, his father is an alcoholic, he spents time in an orphanage, he becomes a drug dealer, he is in and out of jails, he is illiterate, he spends most of his five year sentence for dealing drugs in solitary. While in prison Mr. Baca teaches himself to read and becomes a poet; he quite literally is saved by language. He is awakened to the beauty of language by poets like Wordsworth, Lorca and Whitman. I think he would disagree with W. H. Auden's line that &quot;poetry makes nothing happen.&quot; Mr. Baca's account of his discovery of language is as moving and transcendent as his searing account of prison life is an indictment of America's racism. One has to admire the writer's courage, his refusal to become an animal in horrible prison surroundings. But I must say I was put off by his repeated use of the words &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;fag&quot; The African American Mr. Baca attacks because he shows a sexual interest in him is called a &quot;black ...&quot; I wondered if he used the N word in prison but could not use it here for his readers. In my optimism I always hope that one minority-- Mr. Baca is Latino-- does not need to put down another.	2001-08-14

It is certainly printed well, a requirement for an art book. The closeups of the Murano glass are beautiful. I wish the smaller photographs of the same glass objects in the back of the book were bigger. I got no real impression  as to what the glass actually looked like. There must be bigger, more comprehensive books on Murano glass, if you cannot take a trip to the J. Paul Getty Museum, where these treasures are, or in the best of all possible worlds, go to Venice and Murano and see glass until you cannot look at another object.<br />The poem &quot;Murano&quot; though beautiful is not my favorite Doty poem. Written for his deceased poet friend Lynda Hull, the poem contrasts the permanence of Murano glass with the stench and death often associated with Venice. &quot;Is this what becomes of art, the hard-won permanence outside of time? A struck match-head of a city, ungodly lonely in its patina of fumes and ash? Gorgeous scrap heap where no one lives, or hardly anyone.&quot;<br />There is no need to combine pictures and poetry. One usually dominates the other. First class poetry does not need to be illustrated. (I certainly think Mr. Doty is a first class poet; his poems often bring me much pleasure. I'm also of the opinion that poetry should be read, rather than explicated. The good  poet always says what we cannot explain very well.)  Fine art does not require commentary. Books like this are difficult to pull off and seldom satisfy completely. This one is no exception.	2001-08-08

But that is like saying Moby Dick is about whaling. This historian from Australia has written a superb treatise full of hard truths on both illness and memory. After all, the truth is not always carried on angels' wings. Along the way she also has written fiction-- short stories-- and some of the history of Australia. After her diagnosis of Active Auto-Immune Hepatitis, she began writing this memoir on her laptop computer, not knowing if she would live or not. She writes searing accounts of her hospitalization: the good, the bad, the indifferent hospital personnel. The visitors who came late and leave early, to get back to their lives outside an institution.<br /> Ms. Clendinnen writes: &quot;What distinguishes the healthy from the ill--which is a more significant division in any society than class or gender or possibly even homelessness--is that the healthy consider feeling well to be the normal state of things.&quot; Then there is memory and all the attendant problems. For example, two children of the same parents have different recollections of their parents, but they are both right. &quot;Being ill had taught me how much of ourselves there is in all the stories we tell about the past.&quot; Ms. Clendinnen wanted to preserve the memories of her parents, to try to discover what they were like before she was born. The portraits, &quot;as accurate as memory allows,&quot; the author would say, of her parents are the best thing I think in this book. Her descriptions of her mother Catherine, born in Melbourne in 1897-- and her futile attempts ever really to know her mother made my eyes water. Her mother's hard life was in some part her own making. Not all her sisters, for example, were as miserable as she. About her mother's death, Ms. Clendinnen writes &quot;how could her life be ending when it had not yet begun? Bound from childhood in a net of unsought obligations, she fought hard, but with weapons which always turned and lacerated her own flesh. In the desolation of old age, with death imminent, I think she finally knew herself to have been trapped, and defeated, from the beginning.&quot;<br />Ms. Clendinnen named this memoir Tiger's Eye after her favorite animal, the tiger, &quot;because he was the only animal who did not acknowledge he was in a cage. . . I too was in a cage, with feeding times and washing times and bars at the side of my cot, and people coming to stare and prod, but the kaleidoscope of the horror of helplessness ceased to turn because I withdrew my consent from it.&quot; Like Melville's Ishmael, the now wiser writer lived to tell her tale: &quot;Illness granted me a set of experiences otherwise unobtainable. It liberated me from the routines which would have delivered me, unchallenged and unchanged, to discreet death. Illness casts you out, but it also cuts you free. I will never take conventional expectations seriously again, and the clear prospect of death only makes living more engaging.&quot; There is so much to learn from Ms. Clendinnen's ordeal-- about illness, about courage, about getting on with our lives.

The worst possible thing had already happened, so what else was there to fear?&quot; Too many of us said too many unnecessary goodbyes in that first onslaught of AIDS deaths in part because of a government that did not care about those of us who were different. More Maso: &quot;Why shouldn't the old models, which are working with less and less success, be challenged--the world reimagined? Heterosexual privilege and power--and all its attendant rigmarole. Such a system, if it were to be taken seriously, would have precluded me from having a child. Luckily I have never taken it even the least bit seriously. But I have been outside of everything from the beginning--except the system of love.&quot; Passages like this one make this book wonderful. Besides the sorrow, there is so much joy, so much hope, so much love here.<br /> As always, Maso paints with words.

I loved Garp, but I often found the comings and goings of the Lion Man only mildly amusing. The usual elements of an Irving novel are here. The befuddled characters, the repetition of the story line, the easy language. Although I still remember the &quot;undertoad&quot; from my reading of Garp years ago and the mantra that &quot;Sorrow floats&quot; from Hotel New Hampshire, I found no such chestnuts in this one, at least not to my liking. A dumb dog who eats her &quot;own poo,&quot; something we are reminded of over and over, or the wad of gum on the alarm clock, for example, are not images that I care to remember.<br />The novel certainly has its moments. The satire of twenty-four hour news television networks is one of the best things in the book. Irving ridicules nicely the vanity, the egos, the in-fighting of the TV personnel as well as the news readers who become the news. Much is made of the incessant TV coverage of both the death of John Kennedy Junior and the crash of the Egyptian jetliner. (I remember from the real world two news people from one of the national TV networks standing in front of the Kennedy compound at Martha's Vineyard making small talk, when there was no new news about the awful tragedy, saying that they had never been inside the Kennedy home.) Descriptions of Patrick's attempting to care for his infant son are quite moving. I suspect that Irving is a very decent man. He is the only male writer that some feminists I know read. Certainly Patrick, womanizer that he is, gets more knocks from the opposite sex than they from him-- I'm not punning here. And I won't spoil the title of the book for you.<br />Patrick unsuccessfully keeps attempting to find a passage from THE ENGLISH PATIENT that both he and Doris like. Irving says: &quot;Good novels and films are not like the news, or what passes for the news--they are more than items. They are comprised of the whole range of moods you are in when you read them or see them. You can never exactly imitate someone else's love of a movie or a book, Patrick now believed.&quot; Perhaps at another time or place I would like this book better.

They are recollections of Mr. Maxwell's Lincoln, Illinois. Published in 1992 when the writer was 84 years old, these beautiful stories possess a nostalgic, almost elegiac quality as Mr. Maxwell remembers friends and family members long dead. We meet Miss Vera Brown, Maxwell's beloved fifth grade teacher who dies of tuberculosis at twenty-three and Billie Dyer, a local Black lad who became a doctor, among others.<br />In &quot;With Reference to an Incident at a Bridge&quot; for Eudora Welty, Maxwell's longtime friend, he recounts a childhood prank that teaches him never again to be taken totally by surprise by cruelty, in this instance his and the other boys'own. My favorite story is &quot;The Man in the Moon.&quot; The title refers to a picture of Maxwell's Uncle Ted, a handsome and carefree young man, and an unnamed young woman posing on a crescent moon in a photographer's studio. Uncle Ted was one of those folks with good looks and brains-- we have all known someone like him-- who never get their lives together. This story contains a wealth of wisdom. Mr. Maxwell says it far better than I can paraphrase. About Ted's luck, the writer says &quot;Looking back on my uncle's life, it seems to me to have been a mixture of having to lie in the bed he had made and the most terrible, undeserved, outrageous misfortune. About Ted's death: &quot;He must have been in his early sixties when he got pneumonia. He didn't put up much of a fight against it. Edna (his wife) believed that he willed himself to die.&quot; Finally on old age: &quot;The view after seventy is breathtaking. What is lacking is someone, anyone, of the older generation to whom you can turn when you want to satisfy your curiosity about some detail of the landscape of the past. There is no longer any older generation. You have become it, while your mind was mostly on other matters.&quot;<br />For forty years Mr. Maxwell was a fiction editor at THE NEW YORKER and published a relatively small number of novels and short stories for one who lived into his nineties. I'm sure we will never know, however, how much readers have been enriched by this master's pruning of other writers' unwieldly prose.d published a relatively small number of novels and short stories for one who lived into his nineties.

If White is attempting to produce a work that ambles, he is certainly successful. One just wishes that he didn't get so bogged down with French phrases that he doesn't bother to translate. Perhaps he is of the opinion that all literate people speak fluent French. (Isn't that what some native Parisians think as well?) Well, this only mildly literate chap doesn't.<br /> There are interesting tidbits here and there, but you have to dig for them. For example, I found the section on Josephine Baker both amusing and enlightening. And if White selected the photograph used for the cover, he did a fine job. But this is not a book of photographs of Paris after all. White has a large list of books for further reading. If he read all of these, it's a shame that the result is no better. I noted that he suggests a novel of his as one for further reading. I wonder if a book about another city, Barcelona, for example, would be so dense, so full of Spanish phrases and almost unreadable. I would hope not. I doubt that this little book will find its way into many travelers' bags.	2001-07-27

Put off by the size of the book-- there are over 700 pages-- I had decided to skip yet another book about Marilyn. Then while driving recently, I heard Ms. Oates give a brilliant radio interview about the book; I drove straight to my favorite Atlanta bookstore and bought a copy.<br />I am not an authority on Norma Jean Baker's life, having only read almost 30 years ago Norman Mailer's book, so I do not know how accurate the facts are here. (Ms. Oates in the Author's Note says this book is not meant as a historic biography and lists several sources she has used to get her information.) But whether the book is historically accurate or not hardly matters. I will go to my grave believing that Ms. Oates has captured the essence of Norman Jean/Marilyn.<br />We already know how the book will end. We know the bare facts of Marilyn's life, the mentally ill mother, the marriages, the affairs, the pills. But along the way Ms. Oates takes us into the very soul of Marilyn. She is abused, victimized, misunderstood but strangely resilient. The novel takes on a life of its own; we are pulled into it and 700 pages quickly pass by. Parts of the book are sheer poetry. The first chapter called &quot;Special Delivery&quot; reads like Walt Whitman without the optimism. Death comes in the form of a bicycle messenger bringing a gift with no return address to &quot;MM&quot;.<br />&quot;There came Death hurtling along the Boulevard in waning sepia light. There came Death flying as in a children's cartoon on a heavy unadorned messenger's bicycle.&quot;<br /> This wonderfully dark metaphor of Death continues through the first chapter of this marvelous book. Writing does not get better than this.<br />I do not know what the book is about. I only know I was in the presence of a genius while reading it. I had the same sensation I have when I see a Bergman movie. Even if I don't know what the movie is about, I know I have witnessed greatness. There is a mystery to this many-layered book as there is with all great literature. Surely it is a criticism of Hollywood, of the movie industry, of the cruelty of men, a metaphor of the dark side of the American Dream.<br />I've used up my gush quota.

Or as Poppy says about the icing from his birthday cake: &quot;It melted in my mouth. I held a bite in my mouth and it sat for just a second and then trickled, trickled down my throat, all that melting sweetness.&quot;<br /> Rebecca Davitch is a fifty-three year old mother, stepmother and widow who wakes up one morning and decides that she has gone down the wrong road in her life. Ms. Tyler says it much better than I: &quot;Once upon a time, there was a woman who discovered she had turned into the wrong person.&quot; (What a great first line!)The story is about how Rebecca wrestles with this belief and her ultimate conclusions about her life.<br />As we expect from a Tyler novel, nothing earth shaking happens. There are no murders, train wrecks, no escaped prisoners, just the usual array of zany characters who are mired down in their day-to-day existence, not unlike many of the people I know and care about. Even though not a lot happens to these characters, they are far from dull. The writing is beautiful. There isn't a bland page. A delicious book. Ms. Tyler is one of our best writers.	2001-07-20

Mr. Nava's narrative is seamless, his style sparse; but we know with brief descriptions everything we need to know about his characters. Mr. Nava never adds superfluous verbage to show off his knowledge of other novels, poetry and literature in general, something that many mystery writers seem not to be able to avoid-- they often want to show off their English degrees.Additionally, there are no cardboard characters here. Mr. Nava makes statements about homophobia, gay relationships, coming out issues, self-hatred and AIDS without preaching. A friend who is a therapist swears that the scene when Henry meets his new, younger lover's parents for the first time is totally accurate. When Henry tells Larry goodbye as he leaves for Paris for treatment for HIV-- shades of Rock Hudson?-- we are treated to writing both as poignant and good-- and often better-- as anything writers who attempt to write serious gay literature have accomplished. With the right cast, this novel would make a great movie.	2001-07-20
US	51803143	R1UIMWQ21RPHO8	0060928360	99047112	Tales of Burning Love	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A Great Read!	I read this my first Erdrich novel after a writer whose opinion I respect recommended her. This is the tale of Jack Mauser and his many wives-- maybe five altogether. The plot has as many twists and turns as a blizzard in North Dakota where much of the action occurs. Watch for what Ms. Erdrich does with the title near the end of the book. She's always ahead of us.<br />  At times I thought that Jack isn't worth all the attention he gets from his women. He is after all a drunk, a womanizer and a cheater in business, truly one of the types that George and Tammy sang about. But his women often get the upper hand, sometimes quite literally. One of them in order to show Jack that &quot;it hurts to be a girl,&quot; ties him up and plucks out most of his facial hair in what has to be one of the funniest scenes I've read in a long time.<br />The story, sometimes outlandish, probably wouldn't have worked with someone with less talent. But these characters with all their warts breathe. I never doubted for a moment their humanity. Erdrich is wonderful at describing a character with few words -- or with many if the occasion calls for it.<br />Finally, don't you have to love a writer who says that &quot;no blue is ordinary. Blue is the stuff of the soul&quot;?	2001-07-18

I read this book before a recent trip to Australia and found Mr. Bryson's comments about both the country and the people to be right on the mark. Additionally he has a great sense of humor. I saw Australians reading the book, perhaps the ultimate endorsement. Althought I only went to major cities, Mr. Bryson made me want to go deep into the continent. A great read.	2001-07-12

Not being an Episcopalian, I got bogged down at times in some of the writer's discussions of church ritual and disagreements amongst members of various congregations over such things and found them trivial compared to the larger issue of what the author is all about. I came away from the book, however, feeling that here is the most decent of human beings-- a trait too often not found in members of the clergy, in my opinion-- one who has grappled with issues of race and homosexuality as few in the church have and is not afraid of the consequences of going against many of his fellow clergy for what he believes. I can't think of anyone since Justice Douglas whom I admire and respect more than this man. I am always amazed that the same region can produce both a Senator Helms and a Bishop Spong.	2001-07-12

This time we are introduced to the character of Fearless Jones, obviously aptly named. We have here what we have come to expect from Mr. Mosley: a convoluted plot with lots of good guys and lots of bad guys. Then there is the completely accurate depiction of Southern California in the 1950's-- if it isn't accurate the author convinces us it is, all the more astonishing. Finally Mr. Mosley does as good a job as anyone  I've read of depicting the daily lives of ordinary-- and some extraordinary-- African Americans. There are wonderful touches: for example, the narrator's account of being told by a white librarian that he would never be able to check out books from a library when he was growing up in Louisiana, something that particularly touches the hearts of those who love to read. A great and entertaining book. You won't be disappointed.	2001-07-12

This book is not like anything you have ever read. There is never a dull moment. You think you cannot be suprised again; then the author takes you to yet another outrageous situation. I'm thinking now of the followers of the boy with fins who decide to have their fingers and toes removed over a period of time in order to be more like him. Ms. Dunn is clearly an original. Certainly she hears a different drummer, or in this case a circus barker. I had almost decided that the book perhaps is just too grotesque. Then I turned on Larry King; he was doing a recapitulation of interviews with Jim and Tammy Fay Baker. Suddenly the characters in this novel didn't seem so strange after all. So art does mirror life. In this case it's the crazy circus mirror from the fun house.	2001-07-10

But it doesn't; it never gets off the ground. If Mr. Kafka-Gibbons bases these characters on people he knows, he has some of the dullest friends on earth. (And they are so inordinately politically correct.) If the characters are totally creations of his imagination, surely he can do better than these. For starters, the gay couple has to be two of the dullest people you do not ever want to meet. And you just know they wear boxer underwear: Tommy Hilfiger or Joe Boxer? They remind me for all the world of two characters from a David Leavitt novel on a very bland day. Next we are expected to believe that a twenty something law student falls madly in love--and he with her, of course-- with a sixty something widower judge. I never figured out what the author wanted to say. That the gay couple had a better \\"marriage\\" than anybody else in the novel? That messy is as good as organized in the case of the two law clerks? That heterosexuals are the bad guys who by mistake get pregnant in the case of the crazy sister Valerie or again the judge's two law clerks-- and the gay guys are the good guys who take care of unwanted children?<br />Then there is a whole host of minor characters who never get developed. To have fleshed them out would have called for a novel twice this long. Maybe it's just as well we just meet them in passing. I'm thinking in particular of Eve's parents. Or David, some long lost dead lover of Jon. Was he introduced to try to make Jon have some blood in his veins?<br />I suppose the writer is to be commended for his position that gay marriages should be legal. I'm just not sure that this novel advances the cause all that much. [...]	2001-07-08

For those of us who aren't taken with the Bushes, either the elder George or the present president or the governor of Florida, the book gives us something to smile about. While I kept wanting the book to be better-- although some of the descriptions of GB and BB, as they are called in the book, are quite delicious-- the quotations of George Bush that start each chapter alone make the book worth reading. I had forgotten just how inarticulate the elder Bush was. It must be generational.	2001-07-02

I had read many &quot;AIDS&quot; memoirs--  including Paul Monette's Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir and the very fine Heaven's Coast&quot; A Memoir by Mark Doty and thought there was nothing else to be said on the subject. I was wrong. I cannot say enough good things about this book. It is so well written. In addition to being a poignant account of a beautiful love affair and sad, sad, death in the time of AIDS, it is a quite wonderful account of what it is like to be a gay teen as well. When I finished the book-- and yes, it will make you cry-- I felt an overwhelming sadness that this young man will never write again and that both these young men's lives were snuffed out at such an early age. And I wanted to see John's beautiful eyelashes. [....]	2001-05-22

You can literally smell and touch the trees and bushes and everything else that's growing. And I swear, I could use her directions and find my way over all of South Georgia. Of course, that's not worth a pecan pie, if we didn't get another great story. And it may be subjective on my part, but I usually have to care about the characters to care much for a story. You will come away from this slim novel loving &quot;Sister.&quot; (Most of us who grew up in the South have known a &quot;sister&quot;-- sons often are &quot;John Junior&quot; or simply &quot;the boy&quot;)Some of the events I figured out but was totally unprepared for the ending. Just a great little read. And I disagree with the readers who thought they were reading worked over Faulkner and/or Welty. Ms. Daughtary to her everlasing credit doesn't write like any other writer I know. Go ahead. Treat yourself to this story.	2001-02-21
