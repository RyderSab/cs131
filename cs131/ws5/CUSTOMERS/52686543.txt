Last year, after meeting author Emily Giffin in my bookstore (where she was buying her first copy of her first book), I read her debut novel SOMETHING BORROWED during a long plane ride. Even though I knew it was better-than-average chick lit. Even though I'm a guy.<br /><br />Its tale of a nice girl named Rachel - who finds romance while misbehaving with her best friend's fiance in the weeks before his wedding - was very fun. In it, I liked how Rachel came off as sympathetic and interesting, someone you could root for, in spite of the terrible thing she did to her \\"best\\" friend, Darcy the bride. In SOMETHING BORROWED, Darcy came off as an entitled, spoiled, superficial, mean girl who always got what she wanted, and watching a villain like that get her comeuppance was part of the book's fun.<br /><br />Of course, Emily Giffin had a twist in mind for the sequel to SOMETHING BORROWED, and the resulting book is a terrific pageturner that surpasses the first one in pretty much every way.<br /><br />The heroine of SOMETHING BLUE is the same spoiled, mean, jilted bride Darcy Rhone. And the new book, thankfully, finds her just as mean and spoiled as before. Giffin doesn't make the mistake of \\"changing\\" the character's voice from the original book. Darcy's self-centered, delusional, greedy, wicked and ... pregnant with a groomsman's baby at the beginning of SOMETHING BLUE. It's a bad situation that would jar anyone, but her fiance's betrayal with her best friend Rachel is what really throws Darcy for a loop.<br /><br />As Darcy tries to recapture her fabulous life, she finds that things are more difficult for her. Accustomed to getting any man she wants to fall in love with her, she suddenly has to fend for herself without her friends, with her reputation tarnished and with morning sickness.<br /><br />At one point, Darcy finds herself robbed of all her usual resources, and, with that, things finally start to turn around for her. But, again, Darcy never changes her voice or changes her methods. If you hated her in SOMETHING BORROWED, you'll still find yourself hating her in this book. But you won't be able to ignore her or turn away.<br /><br />SOMETHING BORROWED, about basically nice people who find themselves doing bad things, was a fun read. SOMETHING BLUE, about awful, manipulative, lying people who learn that they can't always get things their way, is more of a juicy, guilty pleasure. Darcy's hilariously bitchy, and I found myself laughing out loud, unable to put the book down, especially after Darcy meets her match.<br /><br />The fact that Giffin was able to establish a layered antagonist in one book - and then dare to tell another whole book from that antagonist's perspective - shows that she's a very smart, very capable and very good writer. I didn't think SOMETHING BLUE could equal the first book. But it topped it.<br /><br />I bought SOMETHING BLUE on Saturday, and I finished it this afternoon. And I never, ever read things that fast unless they're really, really fun. And the ending, which ties both books up, is terrific and touching.<br /><br />I only hope to see Emily Giffin again soon so I can tell her how much I loved SOMETHING BLUE.r voice or changes her methods.

Jeff Lindsay's DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER, though flawed in terms of the mystery it contains, is mostly redeemable because it introduces a really great main character with a really distinctive voice. And Dexter Morgan, the great character who's both a savage serial killer and a nice-enough guy, keeps this novel compelling and readable even when the mystery that drives the plot takes a turn toward the completely preposterous.<br /><br />When the book focuses on Dexter's birth as a serial killer-as-avenger and his relationship with his late foster father Harry (who taught him how to redirect but not fight his urges to kill), it's at its best. We hear tales of Dexter trying to behave as though he were a human with emotions, how he rationalizes his behavior by only killing murderers. And we see Dexter at his most vicious, stalking his prey while the \\"Dark Passenger\\" within him directs him on how to kill. (The first chapter, in particular, is good.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, this stuff shows up only occasionally in the book. The majority of the book is devoted to the Miami police's hunt for another serial killer whose style is very much like Dexter's. Dexter, who by day is a blood-splatter analyst working with the police, is brought in on the hunt by his sister Deborah, an attractive, blonde cop who wants to solve the case so that she can get promoted off \\"hooker duty.\\" Standing in Deb's way is the politically-savvy, additionally hot yet boneheaded Det. LaGuerta, who is so attracted to Dexter that she can't see he's an emotionless shell who kills people.<br /><br />When the story includes them, it weakens, even though LaGuerta makes for a very interesting, developed character.<br /><br />And Dexter's a great character, as I said. He's torn in his loyalties to his family, his sense of \\"right\\" and his nature as a killer at all times. The latest case, because this killer's style is so like Dexter's own that he can sense the other criminal, leads Dexter to both doubt his sanity and make a lot of messy mistakes when creating his own crime scenes.<br /><br />But, as a satisfying mystery, the book overuses dream sequences and intuition, doesn't provide enough tangible clues and it never gives a voice or name to ANY of the victims, perhaps because it wants to remain tidy and quick in spite of lingering questions. And the book, sadly, has a sorta boneheaded ending.<br /><br />But, from the looks of things, this is just the beginning of Lindsay's books about Dexter.

I'm a guy - and thus my chick lit reading is pretty much limited to \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" (which I loved), \\"The Notebook\\" (which I despised) and \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" (which was OK). I was introduced to \\"Something Borrowed\\" when I met the author Emily Giffin, who is only a few years older than me and really nice, in a bookstore.<br /><br />I bought her book to support her, and I read it last week during a long trip. This sort of book, smart enough to be interesting and clever yet light enough to not bore the heck out of you, is an excellent \\"plane read,\\" if that makes any sense. It's fast, funny and genuinely engrossing - particularly in its opening chapters.<br /><br />Rachel, its main character, is the typical nice-girl-turned-doormat. Even though she's a pretty, Manhattan-based lawyer, Rachel, when she hits the ripe age of 30, doesn't view her own life as successful or impressive. And she spends the majority of the book - and the majority of her life, it seems - comparing herself to her best friend Darcy.<br /><br />Darcy's dynamic, beautiful, blunt and used to getting what she wants. Through Rachel's eyes, though, Darcy can come across as deceitful, manipulative, self-centered, inconsiderate, needy, pushy and far too lucky.<br /><br />So, when she turns 30, Rachel gets drunk and sleeps with Darcy's hot, successful fiance Dex by \\"accident.\\" Even though she's the maid-of-honor in Darcy's upcoming wedding. This single, not-so-nice move prompts Rachel to start changing how she views herself, how she views Darcy AND how she really feels about Dex.<br /><br />The book is fun. Rachel, even though she does what she does, is charming. Giffin's really good at sorta-not-quite redeeming Rachel, making you root for her in spite of her deceptions.<br /><br />Toward the end, the book takes a couple missteps, by having Rachel not speak up for herself until it's past time for her to do so and then sending Rachel away from the center of the action at a key point in the story.<br /><br />All in all, though, it's a very good, fun book. And I'm excited to know that Giffin's working on a sequel.point in the story. <br /> <br />All in all, though, it's a very good, fun book.

Richard Russo's EMPIRE FALLS builds slowly, concentrating on developing the characters while the plot seems largely incidental. Every few chapters, an italicized section will take the reader back into the past, shedding some light on the characters' current relationships and motivations. Then, the last 100 pages or so feature an event-filled, shattering climax that you won't see coming. Then, the author cleverly sums it all up, answering every possible question about these characters and this town that you could want to know.<br /><br />It was a great book.<br /><br />Miles Roby, the central character stuck in his hometown despite his desire and his late mother's desire for him to move on, is such a kind, decent, put-upon man that you, the reader, are eager to fight for him or wait patiently until he's willing to fight for himself.<br /><br />This book was hilarious, insightful, interesting and personal.<br /><br />If you've ever felt trapped by your own circumstances, you'll be able to relate to Miles and to celebrate as he goes through his life, learning that there are dark secrets that led to his particular situation.<br /><br />I highly recommend EMPIRE FALLS.	2004-07-26

I'm not sure if this book ever would've been published if Madonna wasn't Madonna, first of all. But, that being said, \\"The English Roses,\\" about a clique of fun, young girls who resent someone new and pretty in their class rather than getting to know her, is a pretty charming, well-told story. And the illustrations are absolutely beautiful.<br />The best, most original part of the narrative were the interjections made by the storyteller to her audience. Occasionally interrupting the flow of the story (but not to the book's detriment), Madonna will write to her readers, \\"Don't interrupt. I'm trying to tell you, silly,\\" and other interjections like that.<br />All in all, I'd let my eight-year-old cousin read it. And I didn't mind flipping through the pages myself.	2003-09-17

Meg Cabot's THE PRINCESS DIARIES takes its readers into the mind of Mia Thermopolis, an insecure, hysterically odd 14-year-old girl, introducing us to her understanding of trends, manners and her take on normal teen problems. She's failing algebra. She's got a crush on the most popular boy in her class, not realizing he's a complete tool. Her body just doesn't seem right to her. Her best friend Lily is a know-it-all. Nothing seems to be going quite right in her life.<br />And then the book throws Mia and its readers a twist. Mia's actually royalty, the crown princess of a small, fictional European municipality named Genovia, though even she didn't know it. Her father, unable to have more children, tells her one day, thinking that this will bring her joy beyond her wildest dreams.<br />The author knows teens so well that she deals with Mia's newfound title realistically, though. As a princess, she feels like more of a freak than ever. And when her grandmother, the Dowager Princess of Genovia, shows up to instruct Mia about how to deal with her future as a princess, the situation just gets worse.<br />This novel is absolutely wonderful, painting Mia as a fully-formed, intelligent girl who, sadly, doesn't realize all of her strengths or jump to any good conclusions about her own self-esteem, even though her good qualities shine through to everyone around her. Any older child who's ever had self-image problems will be able to relate to her plight, having to find the princess inside herself - even though she doesn't always think of herself as one.<br />In the novel, additionally, Mia is surrounded by a wealth of rich, incredibly funny characters. Alongside Lily, who hosts her own cable-access TV show and frequently makes situations far worse than they actually need to be, there's Michael, Lily's mysterious brother. Also, there's the quirky, amusing, romance novel fan Tina Hakeem-Baba, whom Mia thinks is horribly unpopular because she's the only other girl in school besides Mia with her own bodyguard.<br />Those of you who only know of this story through the weak, weak movie that Disney made out of it ought to treat yourself to this high-quality book, which deals more realistically with Mia's situation. (A warning, though, some of the topics that the book addresses, like testicular cancer, are not fit for younger children.)<br />This is the first and best book in a very long, consistently funny series, and I highly recommend it.es Mia with her own bodyguard.<br />Those of you who only know of this story through the weak, weak movie that Disney made out of it ought to treat yourself to this high-quality book, which deals more realistically with Mia's situation.

HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS picks up the summer after SORCEROR'S STONE, a terrific book, leaves off, with Harry back at the Dursleys' house on Privet Drive suffering through another miserable birthday. Soon, though, the prospect of returning to Hogwarts School brings him the promise of more adventure and, of course, mortal danger.<br />With this book, J.K. Rowling showed that the first book wasn't a fluke, that she knows how to craft an involving children's fantasy that doubles as complicated, twisted and dread-filled mystery. She also shows that she's creating a universe for her readers full of endearing, believable characters and plot cornerstones.<br />It's no mistake that each book follows roughly the same course, starting in pretty much the same place each time. The things Rowling is able to do within the plot structure and pattern that she sets up in HARRY POTTER is nothing short of remarkable.<br />These are great books, and, though CHAMBER OF SECRETS isn't my favorite or the most complicated and satisfying, the ending, which you won't see coming at all ... unless you've seen the movie, is startlingly inventive.	2003-04-23

John Haskell's first short story collection takes key figures from history, identifies them at defining moments in their existence and builds a story around them to explain their significance. It's an interesting take on the short story, which some say is a dying art, and Haskell does good work, for the most part.<br />His premise, though, turns the \\"stories\\" into more analysis of moment than a narrative. Occasionally, the stories become bogged down and feel like essays, though this is itself is intellectually stimulating.<br />He gives the reader a look inside Jackson Pollock's head in one piece, granting you the opportunity to follow Pollock's reasoning.<br />In \\"Elephant Feelings,\\" the best of the stories, Haskell takes three figures from culture and history and draws parallels between them. (It feels like a shorter version of \\"The Hours,\\" even, except with mythical characters and an elephant playing the Virginia Woolf part.) But not enough is done with the premise, in my opinion.<br />As with all the stories, I felt like the characters and moments were well-drawn. But, to justify going into all this detail, I wished it'd featured less analysis and more plot.	2003-04-18

I bought it on a recommendation from a friend and because of its huge buzz when it was first published. But, when I read the first few chapters of it, the whole \\"Harry Potter\\" thing seemed to me like a knockoff of Roald Dahl books, which I'd read when I was a kid.<br />The book sat on my shelf after that first attempt, collecting dust. When someone would ask me about it, I'd honestly tell them that it didn't seem all that revolutionary to me. At the time, before I'd completely read the book, I just assumed that J.K. Rowling was doing her own version of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" or something like that. The book became one of those things that I'd hoped to eventually read, but it wasn't a priority.<br />That changed when another friend of mine recommended it to me, telling me specifically that he'd never, ever been able to guess the surprise villain or twists at the end of any of the books. He dared me to figure out the mystery myself. Seeing the book from an entirely new perspective as a challenging mystery, I was able to finish it. And I wasn't able to guess the ending of it.<br />The character development is absolutely great. The books are well-written, challenging and funny for adults and children. Both the self-contained plot of this book and the overarching plot that affects the entire series of seven planned books are so complicated and filled with dread that it's virtually impossible not to become so involved in the book that you finish it in a couple days.<br />With \\"Sorceror's Stone,\\" you get the shortest book, the simplest mystery and an introduction to the books' basic structure. But, as an introduction into the world of Harry Potter, it's top-notch.<br />Once you realize all that \\"Harry Potter\\" has to offer its readers, it's really hard not to just adore these books. They're great.	2003-03-12

This book, published originally as a newspaper column about six months after the original &quot;Tales of the City&quot; series, is notable mostly because it clarifies all the mysteries surrounding Anna Madrigal, the elusive landlady featured at the center of all the novels. When the truth about her identity comes out, explaining why Norman was after her in the first book and for whom he worked, prepare to be stunned. Though the truth has always been just out-of-reach regarding Mrs. Madrigal, you're not going to believe the doozy in store for you.<br />This book is also notable because it continues the story of Michael and Jon, featuring a touching scene in which Michael finally outs himself to his family. Also, since Michael spends much of the book coping with a case of temporary paralysis (which I still don't quite understand), there are all sorts of new jokes the howlingly funny, sarcastic character gets to make.<br />As for Mary Ann, she opens up a bit more, which is welcome, and deals with a rather twisted mystery. And DeDe evolves into a far more interesting individual with the help of D'or, of all people.	2003-03-11

If you've read or seen Michael Chabon's &quot;Wonder Boys,&quot; you know that Grady Tripp, the author at the center of that book, had written one masterpiece of a debut novel and was unable to finish a second book that he considered a worthy follow-up. Well, Chabon's writings are all a bit autobiographical and since &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; is his second novel, I decided to track down his debut piece, the one that set Chabon's own bar so high. And after reading &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,&quot; which is still one of my favorite novels, I can see why it would be so hard to follow.<br />Though elements of the plot are, as with most books, a bit preposterous (for the lead character Art is the &quot;son of a gangster&quot; you don't usually find on the street), &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; cements these elements in the real emotions and situations surrounding a coming-of-age. In the summer after you finish college, you do find all of these confusing choices in front of you: what you want to do with your life, how you want to fill your time, who you want to sleep with, what your relationship with your parents should be and where you stand among your friends. None of these choices, in life or in this book, are easy ones. Often, the decisions Art makes have heartbreaking consequences. Sometimes, he operates on a whim that doesn't make sense to him. He lies, he deceives, he hurts himself and others, but he's young, he's learning and he means well.<br />Chabon's complex and poetic sentence structure, his somewhat-bisexual hero, his approach to the coming-of-age novel and his sense of humor were on full display in &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,&quot; which signaled the arrival of an important literary talent.	2003-03-05

Even though I read and adored THE MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH, which was Michael Chabon's debut novel, I was not at all prepared for the scope of this work of his, which deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.<br />It's an epic story about growing up Jewish in WWII-era New York. It's about the history of comic books, the way humans find means to escape the traps (both figurative and literal) in their lives.<br />The character Joe Kavalier, a master escape artist and master comic artist, is one of the most fully-developed characters I've ever read. The odd romantic triangle that he, his cousin Sam Clay and their muse Rosa Saks find themselves in the middle of is original and charming.<br />This is a great read.	2003-03-01

Armistead Maupin's TALES OF THE CITY, which first ran as a series of newspaper columns in 1976-77, is a great, twisted, plot-filled soap opera, which commented as much upon its times and location as Charles Dickens' TALE OF TWO CITIES did long before it. The fact that, in addition to having characters with interwoven stories and histories, Maupin's characters also cope with drug use, bisexuality, transgendered characters, child porn stars and underwear-only dance contests just speaks to the time in which the story is set, God bless it. If the '70s were really like this (and if I didn't know what the consequences of all this were), then sign me up for a disco trip back in time.<br />Reading this book, the first and best of the six, made me (briefly) want to move to San Francisco. It also served, to me, as a cautionary tale, for the lives of the characters in this book are far too wacky and occasionally downright scary. But, while all of the plot is going on, Mary Ann, DeDe, Beauchamp, Michael, Brian, Mona, Jon and Mrs. Madrigal do seem to be having more fun than I usually do. And they're funnier than I am.<br />The chapters are brief and compelling, and they read quickly - like the best gossip. And the cliffhangers at the novel's end are straight out of Hitchcock.<br />The original miniseries taken from this book is incredibly faithful, but TALES OF THE CITY is the most fun in written form - where it feels like the sort of newspaper you don't want to put down.<br />(NOTE:  I recommended this once to a nice Christian woman at my bookstore as a good poolside read. One of the more shocking twists made her drop the book in the water.)	2003-02-20

Thus, she becomes the primary caregiver for the children, who end up drugged, scared and sick. At the same time, she's still just a child herself, questioning her own bravery. Her relationship with the teen terrorist becomes key, as well, for she's the first girl with whom he's had any contact.

Thus, she becomes the primary caregiver for the children, who end up drugged, scared and sick. At the same time, she's still just a child herself, questioning her own bravery. Her relationship with the teen terrorist becomes key, as well, for she's the first girl with whom he's had any contact. She senses his feelings and wonders if she can use them to her advantage, if she even dares to do so.<br />The third narrator, the son of the general who's negotiating the standoff, is the one in the institution, telling the story in flashback. Though this same device was used in THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, it's used for a different purpose here, and it leads to a rather shocking ending. The general's son becomes directly involved in the hostage situation at a point late in the game, and his life is placed at risk while the two sides come to terms with the situation.<br />The title, \\"After the First Death,\\" takes on several meanings throughout the course of the book. Taken from a Dylan Thomas poem, it seems to reflect on how the death of a child is no more and no less significant than the death of any person. Additionally, though, the title, if considered in a Biblical context, deals with the \\"first death\\" - the murder of Kane - and the ramifications of a juvenile's violent actions.<br />The book deals with teens having to face the consequences of their own actions, having to face the dangers in a troubling situation where their are adult consequences. There's also a subtext surrounding children trying to please their parents.<br />The ending passages are shocking, foreboding and heartbreakingly sad. The book stays with you in the manner of a resonant nightmare.<br />It's a fascinating, layered book thick with plot and harrowing situations, and it's one of the best books I've ever read.	2003-01-30
US	52686543	R26ZXOO38YRCXY	0449911519	207158162	The Secret History	Books	5	4	9	N	N	Stunning prologue, great book.	The prologue of Donna Tartt's &quot;The Secret History&quot; is the best thing about it. It jumps you right into the center of the mystery plot, giving you the basic information that a group of friends has killed one of its own to protect a secret, and it leaves you feeling almost as haunted as the narrator, Richard Papen, feels.<br />The suspense in this novel comes, though, from wondering not who did it but why.<br />Jumping then to the beginning of the story, Richard begins to explain how he started taking Latin classes on his campus and how those classes introduced him into an odd clique of friends, all obsessed with their studies, all snobbishly superior to everyone else on campus. But something's amiss with this group of friends, for they share a lot of secrets. And one of the friends, Bunny, is threatening to confess them all.<br />And so we learn with Richard the basics of the mystery.<br />The book is well-written and compelling, and Tartt, who took 10 years to write a follow-up novel, became a bit of a legend for a time. Coming out of nowhere, her debut novel garnered tremendous, earned buzz and became a bestseller.<br />A friend of mine once told me this book made him want to write again.<br />For me, it kept me up nights and proved to be a rather fulfilling tale. I recommend it highly.	2003-01-22

The accompanying CD for this book of song essays, for I don't know what else to call them, is really good, but I wish that all the songs featured on the disc had been included on the CD. I understand that's not the fault of the publisher, for McSweeney's is a great company. (Licensing is probably the key factor keeping this book from having a complete CD.) But I don't want to have to go through the book, downloading the songs I'm unfamiliar with, just to better understand the book.<br />The essays are personal and quirky, like a lot of Hornby's other work, particularly his pieces in the SPEAKING WITH THE ANGEL compilation.

The doomed love story of Bendrix and Sarah in \\"The End of the Affair\\" forced me to reflect on the power of faith and God himself, a creature I'm none too eager to embrace. Because it did this, I found myself very wrapped up in this book, moreso than I even wanted to be, for I was just browsing through the bookstore when I picked it up. I read the first eight chapters while I was still sitting in the store.<br />At the point where I was still reading it after my fourth cup of Earl Grey, I realized that Graham Greene is a genius, and the book is incredibly smart. It's a fictionalized account of an affair between an author and his married neighbor during the air raids in WWII London that ended suddenly one day without explanation. Though their love was passionate and real, though Bendrix and Sarah were mad for each other, she ends the affair and all contact with him the day one of the shells goes off near the house they're occupying, momentarily knocking Bendrix unconscious. Something happened to Sarah while Bendrix was unconscious, something intangible, spiritual and rooted in her love, that scared her to death and forced her to break things off. But Bendrix, knowing Sarah is not one for cruelty, won't explain what happened and won't really even see him.<br />Months afterward, Bendrix is still obsessed and hires a private investigator to find out what's become of Sarah and figure out why she dumped him so abruptly to return to the life with her husband that she didn't want or enjoy.<br />All of this makes for, of course, fascinating mystery. It also leads in an unexpected direction regarding spirituality, the existence of God, the need for suffering and the occasional torture that rational thinkers face when dealing with the unexplainable. Bendrix, being a skeptic regarding God, can't quite deal with exactly what happened to Sarah, which he eventually discovers but cannot completely accept.<br />This book affected the way I think. Brilliant novel.	2003-01-16

This edition of Oscar Wilde's work - in addition to its inclusion of much personal correspondence - is a fascinating look at the author and, notably, his personal travails.<br />The novel, of course, and the plays are classics, but I found the letters to be a juicy narrative all their own. The twists and turns of his doomed affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, affectionately called \\"Bosie\\" in touching - and bitter - love notes from prison, are here to peruse. Reading them, you get a sense of Wilde's personal feelings at the time of his famed trial and arrest for sodomy, his anguish at losing Bosie and going to jail. It's fascinating, juicy stuff - made all the more touching by the fact that it all occurred without shame, in plain view, over 100 years ago.<br />Wilde's a great character, a great author, a good role model for gay life and a hysterical wit.  And this book is a must.	2003-01-16

Familiar with his stories for years, I finally decided to buckle down and read one of Arthur Conan Doyle's stories of Sherlock Holmes, and \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" the most famous of the novels, was the one I decided to pick up. To my surprise, I tore through it. It was a simple read, yet a complicated and satisfying mystery.<br />As with all the Holmes stories, his assistant Dr. Watson is charged with telling the tale of the bloody Baskerville curse. Sir Charles Baskerville, who was the charge of the family estate, has recently been gored to death by some sort of animal, and Sir Henry, the new heir to the household and the family fortune, fears that the mythic curse of a hellhound stalking the family grounds is true.<br />A strange twist occurs in this investigation, though, for it's not Holmes who goes to investigate the house. It's Watson, who studies the suspicious neighbors and staff, keeps close watch over Sir Henry and begins to notice that some very odd things are lurking about the moor.<br />Is the curse behind this killing, or is it a villain of flesh and blood?<br />The lead characters are defined well, and, though this is my first Holmes story, I understood the basics and the rhythm almost immediately. The narrative structure that Doyle is famous for is, as expected, charming, and the characters are well-defined. The mystery is properly twisted, and I didn't really guess the middle or the ending.<br />The best twist, to me, wasn't the reveal of any villain or method. It was the twist involving the shadowy figure on the moor. I didn't see it coming at all, and, when I read it, I realized that this old novel still had the narrative tools to surprise me.<br />It's a classic for a reason.	2003-01-15

This book was so short yet so compelling that I flew through it, and I ran to the store immediately to pick up the second one.<br />Other reviewers who've said that the lead characters aren't as well-defined as one should hope are correct, for you're not truly invested in the uniqueness of Klaus, Violet and Sunny. They're not so much characters as they are tools of the plot. They're the things that monstrous plot twists are built around.<br />By the book's end, after Klaus has been beaten, the infant Sunny has been trapped in a birdcage dangling from a tower and the 14-year-old Violet has been forced to participate against her will in a marriage ceremony, the wicked humor of the book wins you over.<br />Though unfortunate for the Baudelaire children, it was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours for me.	2003-01-14
US	52686543	R2QWR7JD9HAXZQ	0446676098	430421115	The Notebook	Books	2	1	4	N	N	Simple, syrupy romantic nonsense with a bizarre ending.	I read this in its initial release in hardcover years ago. I thought, at best, that it would try to maintain the spirit of THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, which was popular at the time, while coming up with an original story.<br />The story is original. An old man visits the hospital room of a woman with Alzheimer's, his wife of many years, and he reads her their love story. This story involves a guy named Noah Calhoun, who loved a woman named Allison when they were kids and loves her still, even though she's involved with another, more successful man now, who is himself a rather nice guy. In the past story, of course, Allison must choose between the two men.<br />This is all pretty blase, considering that you know from the outset of the story, though the author doesn't out-and-out identify which man the old guy telling the story is. Anyone who's ever read any sort of romance novel will be able to figure out who she picks.<br />The Alzheimer's story, which frames the other narrative, is the more interesting yet less successful aspect of this novel. It seems that whenever the old man reads Allison the history of their love, she is able to remember him and escape the cloud of her Alzheimer's. It's a nice twist on an old story, and it's touching.<br />Then Sparks, and this was his first novel, goes and ruins everything with a third act twist that's pretty creepy, if you ask me. He gives the old man a debilitating stroke, keeping the old lovers apart until, in the final pages, he's able to return to her.<br />Whether she remembers him, what they do and how it all works out I'll leave to the reader. I, personally, found the ending jarring, particularly when the story introducing it was nothing more than sweet and slight.	2003-01-08

I wandered into the room of my best friend's three-year-old son, preparing to read him a book before he went to bed. When I saw this book among the pile on his floor, I got nostalgic. Really nostalgic. My mom read me the same book when I was his age, and I love, LOVE this book.<br />Not only does it teach you that sometimes the answer to all of your questions is right in front of you, but it does so by giving you pages of Grover, one of the most hysterical, lovable Muppets. The rattling of Grover's nerves, and the actual building of suspense in a picture book, keep the reader turning the book's pages -- even though Grover BEGS you not to do so. The reader is actually included in the narrative, for the book involves only Grover talking to the reader. The book thus becomes involving very quickly and entertaining throughout it.<br />Plus, the final punchline is a great payoff.<br />If you have children, this is an absolute must. Unlike other books from children's shows, this one's intelligent, maintains proper values and isn't beat-me-over-the-head annoying.	2003-01-06
US	52686543	R1B5HINNX19QJR	0679720200	882163178	The Stranger	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Deeply affecting work about a completely detached man.	After reading this book in high school, I wrote an essay about what it would be like to spend the day with Mersault, the completely unsympathetic, detached main character of this novel. My essay had him doing many of the things he did in the book, going to the beach, eating, messing around with his girlfriend and completely ignoring everyone around him. I understood, sympathized with the character and, to my shock and horror, identified with what Mersault was going through.<br />Are we truly alive if we exist only to please ourselves, if no one else matters to us and we, in turn, matter to no one else? Is empathy a necessary aspect of humanity?<br />In the second half of the book, Mersault's situation teaches him to care for others, to care about how his own actions (primarily the killing of the Arab, which he did because the sun was in his eyes and because he was annoyed) affect the people and the world around him. He learns to weep for himself, as his death approaches he sees how little his life matters, because of the way he conducted it.<br />The first sentence of the novel is key. \\"Maman died today - or maybe yesterday.\\" The sentence speaks to how little anyone, even his own mother, mattered to Mersault. People in his life were just there to provide means to an end. That she's dead is an annoyance, taking him away from other things he'd rather be doing. It's very, very sad.<br />He's a \\"stranger\\" because he doesn't care to know anyone - not because no one knows him.	2003-01-03

The graphic novel \\"Road to Perdition,\\" the basis for the movie of the same name, is a grim, bloody work about the grim, bloody world of an assassin for the Chicago mob whose family gets pulled into the violent fray of his business.<br />Michael O'Sullivan is a man conscious of morality, though he is not a good man. His \\"business,\\" which he does because he's expert with a rifle and because his boss raised him like a son, is kept separate from his normal life, in which he's a loving, churchgoing husband and father of two boys. The boys are curious about his life outside of home, so one day the oldest son tags along on a mob hit - and endangers the family.<br />The book, based upon the Japanese \\"Lone Wolf and Cub\\" series, is gorgeous to look at - the art really looks like old newspaper photos of actual crime scenes. This gives the work an authentic feel that evokes the period and is incredibly haunting.<br />The book's plot goes differently in some ways from the film's, and the book is actually better than the film. Michael is never portrayed as a soft man - even as he saves his son. The son is soon drawn into the world of killing people, unlike the son in the film, and has to save his father many times.<br />The ending of the book, which is different from the movie's ending and which I won't give away here, is a nice, ironic touch.<br />This is one thought-provoking, consistently interesting piece of art.	2003-01-02

The set piece, shiny and with its own basket holding the wizard, jumps quite literally off the pages, then swings back and forth in front of you. The amount of joy I experienced with this book at that moment was immeasurable.<br />What's fun about the book, which also has this huge, swirling cyclone in its opening pages that jumps out at you, is that it also remains surprisingly faithful to L. Frank Baum's original WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ, keeping much of the text intact (though, for obvious reasons, the book is not taken and reprinted verbatim) while having the pop-up art serve as a variation upon the original illustrations when possible.<br />I got one of these for myself, one for all the little girls in my family and one for a friend in my office who just needed cheering up one day. It inspires you to read the great story.

Though the Apocalypse is on them, complete with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse riding Harleys and a switched-at-birth Antichrist who doesn't realize that he's the Antichrist, perhaps the world shouldn't end after all.<br />Crowley is an intensely cool character, neither completely bad nor completely good. He takes his job of condemning souls to Hell not too seriously, for he realized a couple centuries ago that human beings faced with enough daily aggravations could condemn themselves.<br />The angel Arizaphale, I believe his name was, runs a bookstore collecting rare books and, most aptly, prophecy Bibles. (This and the footnotes in the book are the funniest, most \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\" moments in it.) Arizaphale realized that human beings should be allowed to continue on in order to keep making art.<br />So the two team up with witches, parents and other veddy British personalities to save the world from its supposed end.<br />This is very funny.	2002-12-02

Immediately, the book brought me back to the days of playing with my GI Joes and reminded me that, even then when I was 11, I wondered how on earth you could fund your own private army to do battle with a United States elite force.

But that's giving too much away.<br />Clarissa Vaughn is getting flowers for a party honoring her friend Richard, who was once her lover but is now dying of AIDS. In going through her day, she wonders if her life, in the long run, has really mattered much to anyone. Her daughter seems embarassed by her. Young, politically-minded lesbians look at her calm, tension-free relationship with a woman somewhat derisively. She spent her life living for others, and now they're dying on her or departing.<br />Laura Brown, a '50s housewife, is coping with depression that seems to mount as she's attempting to make the perfect cake for her husband's birthday. What Laura really wants to do is withdraw from the world and read her copy of \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" but convention is dictating what her life is supposed to mean to her. She's supposed to love the baby growing inside her, though she doesn't. She's supposed to love her marriage and son, but they are alien to her. She wants to be normal - yet she also wants the world to swallow her whole. She doesn't have a place where she feels she can be herself and belong.<br />Virginia Woolf, the writer of \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" is going over plot points in her head while also trying to cope with the small choices she's made in her life. She's going slowly insane, as she has before, but, in her quest to hide it, she finds that she can't just be alone with her thoughts. Something is always expected of her, even by well-meaning friends.<br />Michael Cunningham's \\"The Hours\\" is a book that draws parallel from \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" but also delves into the questions surrounding what it means to be an individual and what it means to be alive. Through the different settings and times, he shows that, though many opportunities are afforded to the women as time passes, the key questions and issues remain constant.Through the different settings and times, he shows that, though many opportunities are afforded to the women as time passes, the key questions and issues remain constant.	2002-12-02
