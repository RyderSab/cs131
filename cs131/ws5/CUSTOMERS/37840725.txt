I enjoy a deep psychological thriller as much as the next person but although this author grabbed my attention, he failed to hold it.  The writing was too one dimensional for me and I just couldn't feel connected to any of the characters or care what happened to them.  The suitable plot line was there, deep dark secrets were there, grammer and the rest were there but somehow it did not add up all together to form a compelling story.  But maybe it's Richard Laymon's fault since I just finished his book \\"Blood Games\\" and that story just couldn't be beat for creepy atmosphere and a tension building plot.	2005-07-22

This book was very well written and told in an intriguing way of having the story unfold through different characters' points of view. Whenever I read a chapter by Sarah, I felt the weakest connection but it made sense that she was a willing victim. The authors really brought each character to life (which was a welcomed relief given my recent reading material) and the killer was a masterfully crafted character instead of the usual psychotic whose actions are made to be as shocking as possible just to sell books. Again, a welcomed relief from the numerous pedestrian thrillers out there. All of this made the climax all the more disappointing. The father/daughter team easily dupes the FBI to face the killer mano a mano. The father throws the daughter off the scent to protect her and faces the killer on his own in the one \\"safe\\" place of the killer. Of course the father is so smart that he's figured everything out and is two steps ahead of the killer when he confronts him. This reader was not surprised when the daughter shows up unexpectedly at a critical stage and throws a wrench into things. I knew the killer was going to injure the father despite his meticulous planning. But of course the father and daughter would prevail although the slight of hand trick used to achieve this was unbelieveable. This part of the story was too pat and the same old same old not to mention a major disappointment for this reader. It ruined the brillance of the earlier chapters and left a sour taste. Overall, a good read but.......	2004-11-30

However, the disappointment was due to the writer's skill in vividly portraying a time in her life that left this reader wanting more.  Although I agree with another reviewer who felt there were holes in the recounting of her life, who could reveal every little nook and cranny of their life? especially; when it concerns the subject matter at hand.  I believe subsequent books by this author deal with her life in even more detail (Family History).<br /><br />This book tells the story of a young woman who lost her way early in life.  Her whole self image is caught up in her looks (through no fault of her own) and since there seems to be no consequences to any of the bad choices made once she enters college, her life spirals downward fast.  She ends up having an adulterous affair with the stepfather of her closest friend, drinks heavily, and has a mega cocaine habit.  As she withdraws into the four walls of the cage of her own making, Dani Shapiro's withdrawal from the real world shatters when she receives the phone call telling her that her parents have been in a terrible car accident.  This part of her life is even more emotional as we view the family dynamics.  We find out more about her life growing up and what her father and mother were like as parents and as people.<br /><br />Her whole story was fascinating and hard to put down.  One thread really stuck one for me: Dani and Jess (her best friend in college) relationship.  They  become estranged when Jess finds out (from her stepfather) that Dani has gone out with her stepfather.  Dani apologizes and confesses that all they've done is kiss and she was repulsed by it.  She promises she won't ever see him again and they become close friends once again.  Then Jess invites Dani to her birthday party at her house.  Dani refuses telling her that she doesn't want to run into her stepfather but when Jess assures her he will not be there, Dani agrees to go.  The stepfather is waiting there to greet her and Jess avoids her for most of the party except to give her a look which Dani can't interpret.  Of course Dani ends up having an affair with the stepfather and years later, after it has ended, Dani runs into Jess who calls her a \\"whore\\".  They talk and Dani tries to mend fences but too much has happened. Dani asks a question that has haunted her - why did Jess invite her to the birthday party?  Why was she set-up?  Jess replies that it's too complicated and that Dani should consider herself lucky that she's gotten rid of the stepfather since Jess never can......  This was an emotional moment that never really answered any questions but instead, only raised new ones.  Was Jess motivated purely by self-interest?  Was the expensive sports car Jess received a reward for getting Dani to attend the party?  Or was it darker still and the stepfather had a relationship with Jess too?  My mind raced through numerous possibilities and never knowing the answer made the story all the more real for this reader.<br /><br />Sharp and poignant writing made this story well worth reading.  Dani Shapiro shares a very painful period in her life and even though she didn't give everything away on these pages (and who would?), she gave enough to make me pause and reflect on my own life.  She was brutally honest about herself and those around her and I commend her for this magnificent effort!agrees to go.

Strictly personal choice and no reflection on those great authors.  So I was a little leary when I began this book but decided to give it a try due to several recommendations.  I was hooked from the start and kept turning pages to find out what was going to happen next.  The author (Tamara Thorne) writes with dry wit that I found highly amusing and she kept the spooky factor to a close to believeable level.  I do not believe in ghosts but this story made me pause for thought.  The whole voodoo plot with the mother/daughter struggle was spine chilling.  Not one slow spot in the book.  \\"Haunted\\" is a well written story with a creepy plot that never stumbles, contains dialogue that easily flows from scene to scene and has memorable characters.  As soon as I finished this story, I ran out and bought another book by this author.  Definitely a keeper!	2004-11-18

After learning about the childhood of Tatum O'Neil, I had to literally pause to absorb what I had just read.  That this woman is alive today and functioning (by any definition) is a miracle.  Overall, a fascinating read despite some of the uneven recounting of Tatum O'Neil's life story.  Despite the neglect and abuse at her mother's hand, Tatum has forgiven her mother and the love she feels comes shining through each page that remembers her mother's later years in life.  Even her ex-husband (although this portion of the book felt like it was written in reaction to John MacEnroe's book) was dealt with objectively.  However, her father - Ryan O'Neal - is a whole other story!  The anger she still feels toward her father is almost tangible.  You need to read this book to find out if it is warranted.......  Made me stop and think just how important parenting really is to any child.  I don't even want to think about what life was like for her brothers Griffin and Redmond.  The only gripe I had was the  jump in timeline from childhood to marriage.  I would have liked to hear more about the Ryan/Farrah factor in her life.	2004-11-09

This story was very well written and takes place in the late 1970's in a small prison town in Upstate New York.  The setting provides a character rich background to the colorful story as told through the eyes of the youngest daughter (Penny); and although she is only 8 years old at the time, the narrator wrote this story as an adult and provides for mature reflection as well as the child's first person point of view.  The oldest daughter (Mahalia) is 15 and just beginning to enter womanhood during these turbulent times while the mother is charismatic and revels in her womanly charms and beauty.  Mahalia is uncomfortable in her own skin and resents her mother's flamboyancy not to mention drinking problem and as a result is drawn to the town's self proclaimed defender of all things good, as proclaimed by The Bible.  The juxtaposition of characters and events are beautifully woven into a great story that touched issues at the very core of what it meant to be a female in the 1970s and is just as relevant today:  pregnancy, abortion, concept of beauty, love, family duties, and the role of a female in society.  The only issue I had with this book - and it is a personal and slight one at that - was the portrayal of  Mahalia. Even in spite of Isabel's fanatical bent, we saw her inherent goodness.  Marguerite might have been over-the-top and an alcoholic, but we saw her sacrifice and love for her family.  I felt Mahalia was the only main character who was never viewed in a kind light.  This was a well written and emotionally charged story that can only get better with repeated readings. This book is a keeper!!	2004-10-06

It begins with a young woman in a bad relationship who doesn't really want to leave, thereby cutting off the  possibility of getting married, but knows she should try something......and ends up at a sad excuse for housing called the Alamo House, which at first glance appears to be full of a bunch of weirdos and losers or as the frat house residents across the street call them - dykes (the ultimate macho jerk insult).  These guys harass them unmercifully.  As we met the inhabitants of this book and take a closer look, we smile in recognition.  By the end of the story we are rooting for Alamo House and plotting the destruction of the frat house right along side the girls.  The reader forgets how the characters were first described and see them in a much kinder light.  This plot is just the backdrop to the real story of the friendship formed between three girls, our narrator, an overweight girl away for the first time from her bible thumping family and a drama major who is a beautiful whirlwind that dresses up as doomed women (Marilyn Monroe, Sylvia Papth, etc.).  Their story is the most compelling and emotionally touching.  Oh yeah, the concept of feminism from all perspectives is also present in this story.  The author delivers all of these themes in one well written novel.  Kudos to Sarah Bird.  I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading other books by this author.	2004-09-14

She feels guilty because it's due to her that the two even met so she decides to do some sleuthing on her own as the police obviously have the wrong man.

The fact that this story was written by a 17 year old is as amazing as the story itself: a documentary-type story of one week in the lives of a certain group of kids who go to private school. I disagree with reviewers who stated that the book has no depth or likeable characters. Most of the flashback sections contain deep philosophical views (albeit skewed by White Mike) such as the meaning of death, organized religion, the meaning of friendship, knowledge, and most importantly, life. Granted, most of the outlooks are a little brutal but that is the whole point. Life is extremely brutal even in the pampered lives of the rich and the fact that most of these characters make their own misery is ironically pointed out to the reader in blunt and cutting prose. So many scenes stick with you such as: (1) White Mikes's introspection on the real meaning of death as his mother is being buried is honest and raw and (2) the statement, &quot;Can we please all stand and have a moment of silence for those students who died. And can we now have a moment of silence for those students who killed them.&quot; It's very powerful especially given the context. I found White Mike to be a tragic character whose anger against God (the view he expressed about the reason behind kneeling in church) and recent choices express the overall theme more forcefully than the surrounding scenes, despite their physical or emotional violence. The author uses various characters sympathic (White Mike, Hunter, Mollie & Andrew) and not (Jessica, Sara, Lionel Claude & most of the parents) to illustrate their struggle over getting the whole point of life and one's purpose in it. Obviously, the author prefers the nihilist point of view (although hope of the future is always present) which is sad given the setting of youth just beginning adult life. At the end of the story, all of the character's lives intersect momentarily for a New Year's Eve party - amid imagery of settling debts, cashing in your markers, re-birth and possibly starting anew - the resulting extreme violence is an x-generation cinema moment to be sure and almost certainly surreal, but, then the prominent narrator (White Mike) informs us that maybe he took some liberties with the retelling of that moment but it sure seemed that way to him. This doesn't make the preceeding story a dream or less true as some reviews think; but rather, it points out that the images so eloquently presented before us are colored by 16-18 year olds. Don't you remember what that was like? Makes me glad I'm in my 30s.

The narrator is an independent minded female in her mid-twenties who lives in the 1700s and chooses to become a vampire as a way out of her restrictive times. She thinks being immortal will give her freedom. The story isn't sensationalist in the least - no real sex or gore to speak of.....so if that's what you're expecting, you should look elsewhere. This work is not a masterpiece but not junk either. The historical overviews were interesting and the plot kept me reading on. Theresa (the narrator) is a remarkable protagonist in this genre - she is unique in that she wanted to become a vampire and doesn't have any subsequent moral dilemmas over this choice. In fact, her only moral issue occurs as a vampire in a situation with another vampire (Mara) who Theresa believes gave humans too much info on their kind due to her empathy with them and vampire guilt (we're talking strains of &quot;Angel&quot; here). Theresa does feel guilt over her handling of this situation and spends the rest of the story trying to make amends. It was disappointing having Theresa's character sell out and become the repentent female type. Overall, an entertaining and different read.	2004-08-04

Yup.  The plot was full of holes and the characters were too corny to be believed.  Let's see, we have a heroine who had a traumatized childhood and has issues with trusting men and a hero with a strong but silent streak but really loving underneath it all who also had a traumatized childhood.  I won't even bother going into the surrounding cardboard characters.  Of course these two fall in love against all the odds and well, you know what happens........they fall in love, have mind altering sex, have a fight, break up and then get back together to live happily ever after.  We all know what's going to happen and I'm okay with that as long as it is done with a few surprises along the way or great characters.  Did I mention that the story is suppose to be about a dangerous serial killer?  There was no thrill or even chill in the thriller part of this story.  I knew who the culprit(s) was/were fairly soon into the book despite the false leads and the whole plot was pretty weak.  However, if you are looking for a romance where love conquers all - then this is a book that fits the bill.	2004-08-04

The very first scene - BAM - you start riding on the roller coaster called &quot;Serpent's Dance&quot;. A story by no means meant for the conservative crowd. This book started out really, really great but ended less than stellar for me but still, a better than average book. Definitely a thriller that presents gripping plot twists with interesting characters. I won't bother summarizing the plot because I don't want to give too much away and even though you finally figure out who the bad guys are (who they may be anyway) - the rest of the story isn't too predictable. I liked that. A lot. Without a doubt I will be reading other books by this author. However, the ending to this one could have used a lot more editing. For one instance, when Charlotte (kick a** heroine) and best buddy are going to confront the bad guy - he says going it alone might not be such a good idea given the stuff that's happened so far - Charlotte agrees and says hey, won't it be great to see their faces when all the cop cars with their flashing lights show up? The scene that follows goes against all logic internal (logic given by the author) and external (the reader's own logic). The plot was tight and smartly written until the end where it unravels quite a bit; but still, a very good thriller!	2004-08-04

I was sucked in by the first paragraph and read straight thru to the end. It's the story of a young woman (Ruby) who settles for a relationship just to be in one and never reaches out for what she really wants because her fear of failure is overwhelming. But then she decides to take a chance - you know the one, where one minor decision ends up effecting your entire life - and that's when the story really takes off. Ruby's narration of her life is hilarious and entertaining. I loved Ruby's circle of friends (hence the name &quot;Girl's Poker Night&quot;), her co-workers and love interest. The author has the gift of bringing written characters to life. Although there are more than a few laughs found in this story, there is also a very serious underlying theme dealing with her father and subsequent issues with relating to men or people in general for that matter. The author blends the light and heavy issues perfectly. I have my fingers crossed that there will be lots more from this writer and hope I won't have too long to wait until the next one.	2004-08-04

I like suspense novels that have romance on the side but keep the plot focused on solving the mystery. The heroine was great - her tragic past made for a complex and strong woman. Having a hot hero didn't hurt either. But the real star of this show was the brilliant storyline. A madman is kidnapping woman two at a time and quickly kills the first one so she can be used as a compass in his intricate and twisted murder map leading to the second one, who might be found alive if they can find her in time. This thriller delivers. I felt everything was well plotted until the very end - ummm, why would you have a quasi-suspect on a mission searching for the victims? and could somebody please tell me what the only surviving victim was doing on their team since her &quot;dreams&quot; contribution hadn't panned out? I know they had already broken the rules so what the heck but the other members were all well qualified.... Granted, these two items are not outside the realm of possibility and they certainly did not destroy the riveting storyline. I wholeheartedly recommend this book.	2004-08-04

This fifth book in the Mallory series was the best one I've read yet and I love the fact that each one of these books stand alone.  Instead of repeating whole sections of previous books to fill the reader in, O'Connell sums up everything you need to know in one or two sentences here and there.  She is truly a gifted writer.  This story finds Mallory in the middle of a revenge murder surrounded by magicians.  The regular cast appears yet they are much more in the background this time as Mallory is front and center.  For the first time the reader becomes much more emphatic with her character as we see a softer side and watch Mallory evolve into this more humane person (she opens up and shares a deep dark secret - her pysch evaluation as a child - with another character and we also see how hurt she is when those closest to her don't believe her).  However, just when we think Mallory has changed and gone all sappy on us, the plot ends with Mallory being pure Mallory which is pure genius.  I've always thought Mallory was a misunderstood character as she does stand for moral principles and maybe you have have to be somewhat cold to be willing to go to the lengths she does when choosing between right and wrong.  We even understand why Mallory is the way she is given her background......and although there are no obvious &quot;Stone Angel&quot; references, the revelations of Mallory's past in that book have visibly and profoundly affected Mallory as her story continues in this murder mystery.  Speaking of which, I'm thrilled the whole haunting love story of Louisa and Malakhai was the focal point as it was always hinted at previously and the real narrative was fascinating.  This author knows how to write a spellbinding tale.	2004-07-16

After reading the previous three books in this series, I'm afraid this story was a bit of a disappointment but maybe that's because I hold O'Connell to too high a standard and certainly any Mallory book is well worth reading.  However, I found some of the town's characters to be a little far fetched not to mention stereotypical and the mystery surrounding Mallory's youthful years which ended on the streets of NYC had a few holes (so much was made of Mallory only having this telephone number and we never found out who it belonged to although we know it was a female and can assume it was Augusta and why didn't her mother just tell her to run to either of their closest neighbors since surely Augusta or the scupltor would have helped?, etc.).  The resolution to this story was not as crisp as all the others and I felt that so much more could have been done with the revelation of Mallory's past; but don't get me wrong, the murder mystery of both past and present was well crafted.	2004-07-16

There were many suspects presented in this serial killer storyline and the suspense was well plotted.  However, the characters in this book were the real gems.  They almost became flesh and blood before my eyes as the author painted such loving images of not altogether loveable characters.  First off, Kathy Mallory is a tough as nails young cop trying to avenge her sort of adopted father's death - Markowitz - and oh by the way, she was a runaway who was &quot;found&quot; on the streets by him when she was around 11.  Her terrible and traumatic background is hinted at but never revealed.  Mallory is unconditionally loved by Markowitz and his wife and even though both of these characters are dead as we read this book, the reader can see them as relevant characters and we feel her loss.  Then there's Markowitz' band of poker buddies (The Rabbi, the Lawyer and the Doctor) who are three dimensional characters as well.  Last but not least, there's her two sidekicks of Charles Butler (a modern day Ichobod Crane figure) and another cop named Riker(a drunkard with redeeming qualities).  Sure her characters are flawed, but they all have principals that they hold true to and all of them can be admired.  Kudos to the author for her skill in presenting such intriguing characters that seem so real.  As soon as I finished this book I immediately picked up the next one in this series (The Man Who Cast Two Shadows).	2004-07-11

When a young woman is found murdered and mistakenly identified as Mallory, our Mallory moves in and uses her expert computer skills to try and trip up three suspects who all live in the same building.  Some creepy moments ensue until all is resolved at the end. The whole gang reappears and their characters are further developed to this reader's delight.  Once again the author serves up a fascinating suspense that I hated to see end.  Some reviewers seem to think that Mallory is this inhuman character that makes the story and author heartless and if you have one shred of decency, you won't like this book.  Ummm, what version were they reading?  Mallory is a little ruthless and heartless at times (she certainly maintains a &quot;ends justify the means&quot; mentality) but don't mistake that for having no emotion.  Knowing her background of having to survive on the streets as a very young kid, the death of her foster parents who kept her somewhat grounded, and you begin to see the tight control she maintains over her emotions as a necessary function.  Mallory is so intricate a character that she seems to be a real human being, albeit a flawed one, and not on of those cookie cutter females that pass as heroines.	2004-07-11

All the characters I've come to love are here as well as the introduction of J.L. Quinn (pretty please let him reappear).  This was an intensely emotional story that ends with a bang.  Art cricits are being killed off and it has something to do with an old crime handled by her late foster father.  All hell breaks loose when a determined Mallory reinvestigates.  We've gotten to know these characters so well by now that when Riker's past is delved into or Mallory is proven to be as destructible as the next person, the reader is there.  The ending left a quite a blow and I couldn't wait to get my hands on the next one in this series (The Stone Angel).  I really can't praise this series enough for it's deep character development, unusual as well as strong heroine and well written plots.	2004-07-11

This story fell way short.  The heroine and the entire surrounding characters were interesting but the hero was a big bland nothing.  There was no real development of the love story and I couldn't have cared less what happened to him.  I was fascinated by the female lead, her wacky co-workers and meddling mother - the author just needed a better male lead.	2004-07-01

Maybe as a heartbreakingly vivid portrayal of life for the remaining members of a family who's daughter was killed - as told by the dead daughter.  A 14 year old girl is killed on her way home from school.  How does life go on for her mother, father and sister is the premise of this highly original novel.  I can't go any further without giving too much away so I'll just say - a must read!	2004-06-02

The characters contained therein were very memorable and provided haunting images. I'm not quite sure why I never heard of this book before but I'm just glad I stumbled across it.  Although it isn't a very short book, it was a fast read because I just couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.  The unanticipated ending was poignant.  The author has provided a well written and plotted story and presented it in an almost lyrical fashion.  This love story is set in the pre-WWI french countryside and certainly provides the taste and feel of that time and culture.	2004-06-01

I, however, am not as keen.  It's a good book, great even.  I give it five stars!  It's just that a true rendition of this counting book by dogs and their number of barks can be a little wearing on the adult reading the book.  But it's well worth it when it's all said and done just to see the huge smile of my kids as I'm barking, woofing or ruffing.  HELPFUL HINT: hide this book for special occassions!  otherwise be prepared because your kids will always pull this out out for bedtime reading......	2004-05-31
US	37840725	R29EZN8DV8GC4F	0060256656	945451465	The Giving Tree	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Fantastic Story	A great and yet simple story of a young boy, a \\"giving\\" tree and unconditional love.  But me thinks this tale was meant more for the parents reading it than the kids since I have a feeling the moral goes over their blessed little self-absorbed heads.  But I'm sure than after numerous readings the beautiful message does sink in.  A child's story that touches all ages.  Be prepared to tear up the first couple of times you read it and whatever you do - DON'T read it when you're pregnant unless you have plenty of Kleenex on hand.	2004-05-31

The novel starts with a forelorn ten-year old, Katrina, singing alone and wondering why no one of her old crowd gets together anymore.  When you finish the story you realize just how creepy the beginning of the story was and how accurately it foretells the horrors to come.  One reviewer complained about how they felt no connection to the characters in this story - that would be an extremely good thing!  The whole point of this story is how the adult world perverted the  innocent fumblings of budding sexuality and created these cold unfeeling and scarred children who will turn into scary adults.  The usual intimacy associated with these forays are turned into isolating and cold sexual deviant acts.  What effect would this experience have on young impressionable children?  The answer is given with no holds barred.  I appreciated the way this disturbing subject was dealt with - there is no tabloid graphic storytelling here yet the horror is still relayed.  Should we stand back in abhorrence and point accusing fingers or take responsibility?  This story is set in the countryside of Italy but the setting could be anywhere, don't fool yourself.  If you deny the possibility then have something in common with the parents of these children who were sent out to play in the courtyard.	2004-05-28
US	37840725	RKXHVIDZQM08A	1569471886	80230928	First Fruits	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Chilling Story	My review doesn't ruin anything for the potential reader: At first glance, the protagonist's (Kate) life seems perfect and the reader assumes her gripes are the usual teenage angst.  As you read on you discover the subtle creepy undertone becomes more and more ominous and real.  Being the constant center of attention isn't all it's cracked up to be - as Kate shows us.  Her fundamentalist preacher father and bitter grandmother are the mak'ins of one scary a** family.  Kate's grandmother is especially chilling once you discover what is REALLY going on.  The fact that this novelist does not resort to a tabloid description but rather, uses subtle hints and slow reveal of the true nature of this family made it all the more frightening for me.  There are so many layers and issues to this story which makes it a true work of art - I consider it a modern masterpiece.  The whole novel is a mystery - the circumstances leading to Kate's crippled leg, the mother's disappearance and so on......Nothing is as it appears to be which includes Kate herself.  The issues of religion, being a \\"good mother\\" or person for that matter, sex, concept of beauty, being part of the \\"in\\" crowd, self-confidence, manipulation, and love are all touched in this story. The end was a little too pat for me but didn't ruin the overall beauty of the storytelling.  This work made me want to read everything else written by this author.  No heavy handed writing or fad sensationalism here, just a pure gem regarding a heavy and disturbing subject.	2004-05-27

It started out a little too smart-and-hip-speak for me but I got sucked into the book with her entertaining characters by the second page.  I loved the romantic conflict, the banter, the main character (hands down one of the best) and her unusual side kicks were very amusing.  The plot is the usual in this genre: good vs. bad vampires, but the route taken in this book is hugely entertaining and different.  Although some sex scenes were interesting to say the least, she coulda spared us the \\"oh it soooo huge\\" bit.  I can't wait to read the next installment (\\"Undead and Unemployed\\") due out soon.  Overall, this witty book was a great read! I couldn't read it fast enough and was sorry when I finished.	2004-04-06
US	37840725	ROI48SFHYECKC	0345404785	835692581	Dark Lady	Books	5	1	1	N	N	dark and edgy	This is the first book I ever read by this author and it was a page turner.  The plot reads like a NY Post headline and takes the reader on a roller coaster ride on the insider politics of a fictional town where a gruesome (and I mean graphic and icky) murder occurs.  Some of the scenes had too much of a realistic ring for my peace of mind. I liked the anti-hero protagonist.  Hugely entertaining.  I highly recommend this book as long as you aren't easily offended by violence, sex or reality.	2004-03-28

A fascinating and macabre tale of a woman and what she discovers as she tries to unravel the horrific death of a street hustler.  Kay, a color blind photographer, has grown close to this young male hustler during her forays into \\"street realism\\" for her photography.  I enjoyed the great character development and the way the author slowly peels away their layers.  However, some of the subject material might be offensive to certain right wing types as this book has been banned.	2004-02-25

A very interesting premise which involves the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar and the Priory Of Sion. Brown beautifully interweaves fact and fiction concerning these fascinating subjects and prodded me to read related works.  Now onto the problems I had with this novel:  annoying references to previous novel (the Vatican incident); too many of the scenes are just outright unbelieveable and the inclusion of hollywood blockbuster action scenes forces the reader to question whether Brown was counting on a movie deal as he wrote; major reasoning flaws scattered throughout the second half of the novel (to name just one, a mirror image that the most brillant code detecting minds couldn't figure out? come on); and lastly, the totally smarmy ending tempted me to scream.  Overall, an entertaining read.	2004-02-24
US	37840725	R3BC9QRPHKE2X3	0380731851	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	0	1	N	N	well worth the time	The story of three young boys and what happens to them in life.  It shouldn't give anything away to know that something bad happens to one of the boys as a child and I really liked the way Lehane dealt with this issue.  He provides a haunting scene without the graphic minute-by-minute writing that most recent novels seem to include.  You never knew where the characters were going to lead you.  I applaud the author for this rare gift of great storytelling that covers issues of family, retribution, friendship, loyalty, love, betrayal - bascially, life.  A nice take on master of one's fate theory.  I recommend reading this Lehane novel first before going on to other works (most of them are a series containing a dectective duo).	2004-02-24

I will, however, provide a warning: this story is not for the warm and fuzzy romance reader.  This author is refreshing and I keep looking to see if she has written anything else; although, it would be hard to top this extremely original plot.  The main character, Grace, ends up killing her beaus - through no fault of her own mind you - and her latest has a dark side of his own.  The back blurb touts this as a \\"Bridget Jones gone homocidal.\\"  Not even close, this one is much better.  One could never be sure what the ending would entail.  I couldn't put this book down.  This author writes with wit and verve.  One of the best finds I've made yet. The novel was an Edgar Award Nominee.  I predict this novel will be turned into an independent movie one day.	2004-02-13

Kudos to the author for creating a good villian - a memorable and creepy one.  Granted, the plot follows the usual formula of this genre (girl in trouble meets boy - girl falls for boy - but is he the hero or villian? - boy gets girl in end), but it was an enjoyable and somewhat suspenseful read nevertheless.  Well written and engaging despite some loose ends.	2003-11-20

I doubt I'll try any other books because I choose this one due to the sterling recommendations given. It didn't strike a cord with me due to: (1) three seperate love story lines which I felt diluted each one and I couldn't feel connected to any as a result; (2) the constant stressing of the protagonist's age (mid 40s) and her life experiences which weren't dealt with in-depth or made revelant to the story; (3) although I did like the protagonist herself when reading through her eyes, I would much rather not have to have read throw away descriptions about her life and the love dilemna felt like it was thrown in there and hoped it stuck - it certainly needed more development - way too many issues were brought up and none of them were fleshed out to the extent needed for this reader's involvement; and most importantly (4) the love stories seemed to take center stage rather than the thriller plot which I found much more interesting.  I feel that there are many other authors that blend the thriller/love interest story line more succesfully (e.g. Erica Spindler & Anne Fraiser).  It was a mediocre read - neither horrible nor great.	2003-07-23
