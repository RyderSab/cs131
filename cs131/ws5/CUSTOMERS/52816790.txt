Smith's a writer on the verge of a major breakthrough, IMHO. Read this book so you can be among the first to discover this talent.<br />Briefly, it's the story of a boxer (Tommy Cochrane) whose health is forcing him to hang up his gloves, and his friend, (\\"T-Bone\\"), in the \\"big city\\" to raise money to save the Cochrane family farm. They go to Toronto where T-Bone works as a sparring partner for a brutal new boxing talent and Tommy works as a doorman, unaware of the punishment his loyal friend is taking in an effort to help raise the $5000 to save the farm.  <br />Lee, Tommy's former girlfriend, sings at a nearby nightclub, and Herm, a young gambler who's riding a string of good fortune, befriends the couple and tries to help them achieve their goal of saving the family farm.<br />Smith weaves 1950s Toronto, a good working knowledge of boxing and a dark sense of forboding to give us a marvelous tale of friendship, trust, and loyalty.  Highly recommended!	2002-10-12

Milo Milodragovitch is after the man who stole his inheritance.  C.W. Sughrue is after the guys who shot him and left him wounded outside a bar. The personalities of this unholy pair demand Old Testament styled punishment.<br />So begins a crimson swathe surging from Seattle to Texas to Mexico as Milo looks for his money, and Sughrue for the men who hurt him.<br />\\"Anybody who speaks badly of revenge ain't never lost nothing important\\" says Sughrue early in the novel.  As the body count mounts, Crumley weaves a tale that blends Hollywood movie producers, Mexican drug lords, good cops, bad cops, and a string of violent men (as well as similarly violent women) while keeping the issue of revenge front and center, simmering.<br />Crumley's point of view bounces between Milo and Sughrue with each taking a first person turn spinning the yarn.  In less capable hands, there'd be a clunky shift as the story passes one to the other. Crumley pulls it off seamlessly.<br />Bordersnakes is a fine novel. It's challenging, violence- filled and slightly philosophic without being preachy. It deserves a spot on your shelf.	2002-09-19

Ms. Andrews presents us with not only a new character in Turing Hopper, but perhaps a new sub-genre -- the artificial private eye.<br />While Turing may have started out as tens of thousands of lines of code, she's become something more. She has a personality, a sense of humor, and a willingness to explore.  When her programmer, Zach, disappears, Turing's search initially has the appearance of a pet looking around the house for its master.  Yet we see her grow and develop, and Ms. Andrews skillfully shows a personality in flux as it becomes something else; something which takes purpose and meaning in hunting for her friend.<br />While her ability to show affection is admittedly limited, Turing learns to care for her friends, both real and artificial. She also learns to take chances and risks -- unique concepts for a computer program.<br />Ms. Andrews makes both her real and her artificial characters interesting and engaging.  While I doubt this is the hook upon which to hang a major series, I am hopeful Ms. Andrews develops this theme and gives us more opportunities to read about the (artificial) life and times of Turing Hopper.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-04-25

Lumley has a very effective touch.  The first story in the anthology, &quot;David's Worm&quot;, hit so hard I had to put the book down for a few days before trying the next.  Masterfully done.<br />I *really* appreciate the fact this book is so well-constructed. So many of today's hardbacks have a squishy feel to them; this doesn't. It's solidly put together and I am confident it will survive future readings and re-readings.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-04-25

The Iowan is a capable writer who also has several mystery and adventure series under his belt.  This venture simply adds to his reputation.<br />His novelizations resonate well with the source films and yet are enough different to warrant handing over a few bucks. You get more than a sorry re-hash of the movie; you get a great story teller who backgrounds you and spins a yarn as complex and compelling as anything on the screen.<br />The pace in book version *The Scorpion King* is wildly frenetic. Action is fast and furious, and enemies fall by the hundreds. Yet it's a fun ride.  Mathayus is more fully developed as a character, albeit an action character.  Mr. Collins gives Mathayus enough brains and brawn to get into, and out of, trouble. Plus Mr. Collins pays gentle homage to the first of the fictional warrior kings, Conan the Barbarian.<br />What a sequel! Conan the Barbarian meets The Scorpion King. . .<br />Highly recommended.	2002-04-25

He starts with a fragment of history -- the fact that Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of the Tarzan of the Apes and John Carter of Mars yarns) was at Pearl Harbor Dec. 7, 1941, and witnessed the attack -- and blends history and mystery in equal parts to present an ultimately satisfactory dective-styled procedural novel.  He styles the book much like Burroughs did his, alternating points of view with each chapter and building to the climax we all see coming.<br />Collins leavens the tale with observations about Burroughs' career, personal and family life, and other tidbits Burroughs fans will find engaging.<br />An excellent novel, well worth the investment of a couple of afternoons in an easy chair.	2002-04-08

Dark and brooding, it tells the story of a retired Detroit cop whose accomplishments during his tenure on the force have given him near mythic standing. Imagine, if you can, Luca Brasi packing a badge.<br />Detective Sgt. \\"Fang\\" Mulheisen takes a backseat througout much of this novel, his powerful intellect grinding away at the clues Grootka feeds him while Mul slugs away at the apparently unrelated murders of a Grootka acquaintance plus a wealthy elderly socialite. All this while balancing the career-threatening antics of Grootka against his own personal code.<br />The novel opens with Grootka finding a body while riding with the abandoned car (\\"Ay Ban\\") man for old times sake. Grootka recognizes the body, and identifies it as \\"Books\\" Meldrim, a former snitch, with whom he shares a decades old dark secret. During the investigation of the body in the trunk, Grootka tells Mul of a sensational murder from the 1950s, and how Books joined him in \\"solving\\" it in a typically violent Grootka fashion.<br />Jackson blends local history and the sights and sounds of Detroit into this cunningly effective procedural. Grootka is a lost soul seeking to save himself, and in his attempt at salvation, threatens Mul's career, and life.<br />It's a tough, fast-paced novel peopled with interesting characters and leavened with a smattering of local history and gentle social commentary. Like all Jackson books, you put *Grootka* down satisfied, and perhaps feeling a little smarter, thinking you have learned something about people and history while absorbed in its pages.	2002-03-31

Sam has loved, and lost, and loved again, and the concept of missed opportunities runs through this novel as a unique backdrop to the murder mystery within it.<br />The great Red Scare is in full swing and even McCain's beloved Black River Falls with its quirky citizens and unique history fall to the whipped up hysteria.<br />Sam keeps his cool, though, despite tripping over more bodies than a medical examiner trainee. A fatally wounded man stumbles to his office to die; a famous man, or as famous as a man from Black River Falls gets.  Richard Conners -- rich, successful, and connected -- had wanted to hire McCain to \\"hold something\\" for him, and comes to McCain's office to die.<br />McCain doesn't expect the bumbling police to solve the murder so he begins to look into it and almost immediately runs into a buzz saw in the form of Karl Rivers, a professed FBI agent looking for communists and communist sympathizers. When Rivers turns up dead in McCain's closet, Sam realizes there's somthing really serious going on in Iowa.<br />The novel is introduced with a quote attributed to W. H. Auden: \\"I smell blood and an era of prominent madmen.\\"<br />Gorman does a marvelous job delivering the late 1950s to us as seen through the prism of a modest-sized Iowa town.  The Red Scare is not limited to big cities. There are witch hunts everywhere, even in small town Iowa where a spinster teacher is seen as possibly subversive and has to publicly defend herself.<br />Gorman populates his stories with interesting and engaging characters and does more than tell a good yarn. He leaves you feeling reminiscent of those long ago days when you could get a good breakfast for 60 cents, where a triple feature at the drive in costs a buck, and where a man could make a decent living as a private investigator in a small town, solving a murder.<br />The story moves quickly and is satisfyingly layered.  ....ingly layered.  ....	2001-09-03

Is &quot;The Huntsman&quot; it a mystery? In the sense there is a murder, yes. Is it social commentary? In that it deals unblinkingly with the nature of racial relations, yes. Is it a coming of age story? A buddy story? A love story? Police procedural? Noir? Yes. Yes. Yes, yes, and yes. Which is why this book is so engrossing.<br />Terrell blends genres without drawing attention to them. He does it capably despite this being his first title.<br />&quot;The Huntsman&quot; starts a little slowly, admittedly. You have to plug through roughly the first quarter of the novel before seeing it take off. But when he gets it in gear, hang on; he's tanked with high octane and burning nitro.<br />The story turns on the life of Booker Short, a young black man with reasons to be bitter. Betrayed by family and friends, he ends up in Kansas City, Missouri, a city with a clear racial division, and strikes up a relationship with Mercury Chapman who served as the white commander of the black truck and transportation company Booker's grandfather served with during World War II.<br />As a caretaker at a small hunting club, Booker comes into contact with a young white woman -- daughter of a prominent federal judge -- and they become a couple. Her body is fished from the Missouri River near the hunting club, and Booker quickly becomes a suspect. Some reviewers may dwell on the racial aspects of the novel. Don't let that dissuade you. Terrell doesn't preach; he coolly reports. And his approach is dispassionate; a telling of a story that spans half a century, two continents, and all the divisions that have occurred in the years since Brown vs. Board of Education. He has a marvelous vocabulary, communicates effectively, and is a master and scene-setting and dialog.<br />Two minor criticisms.<br />The story starts slowly. It appears Terrell expends a great deal of time re-writing and re-casting his story. The first few dozen pages have a wooden, re-worked feel to them; as we delve deeper, though, the book becomes more lively and engaging, probably because the number of re-writes is fewer the deeper we get into the novel.<br />Second is the casual way in which Terrell plays with law enforcement procedures. Kansas City detectives range far outside their jurisdiction with little attention to the limitations to their authority. A minor point, noticeable only to those within the law enforcement community.<br />Even with those small blemishes, it's still a marvelous story, well worth the investment of your time.his story.

The dog is quietly buried, in a simple family ritual, in the garden where most of the spices and vegetables for the Tsil cafe are grown.<br />&quot;We didn't eat him, Wes,&quot; says Wes' father, the cook and proprietor of the the titled restaurant, pointing to a joke about the dog's name. &quot;But as he becomes earth, and as we live off this small patch of earth we've made ours, he will nourish us in his death as he did in his life.&quot;<br />And here, briefly, is the crux of the novel, which uses food as a metaphor for life -- the blending and mixing of spices and ingredients that make it interesting or bland.  And as in life, there are comings and goings, births and deaths, tragedies and triums to remind us of our own place in the world.<br />Thomas Fox Averill creates characters you connect with.  His story has been almost universally described by reviewers as a &quot;coming of age&quot; tale, which I guess is technically true.<br />Yet more importantly, it is a book about life, as told through young Wes' eyes, and it points at all the traditions, secrets and passions that run through a family.  Scattered throughout are recipes -- which I have not yet challenged -- along with brief descriptions of the ingredients.  And we're given engaging histories of the New World meats, vegetables, spices and fruits that appear throughout Averill's engaging little book.<br />This is a book that quietly draws you into its pages, keeps you there for a few hours, and when you leave, you are as satisfied and as filled as any of the customers of the Tsil Cafe, and just as eager for another entree.	2001-08-16

He was a massive talent.	2000-01-14
US	52816790	R3FA3V2YEAATS6	158396018X	338037761	The Monster Men	Books	4	39	40	N	Y	Quirky blend of science fiction and jungle danger	Burroughs wrote a lot of fiction for the pulps of his times, and followed a formula: girl gets in trouble, is saved by the hero, is lost to the hero, is captured/abducted by an evil force, and the hero spends the rest of the  novel trying to find her and thus reclaim his love.<br />In this story,  Professor Maxon has set off to a secluded island to proceed in an  experiment in hubris -- the creation of &quot;human&quot; life -- so that  his daughter, Virginia, can marry the perfect man.<br />His ultimate project  -- Number Thirteen -- exceeds his wildest expectations.  But the other 12  examples of his work -- the &quot;monster men&quot; of the title -- leave  much to be desired.<br />Rather modern issues that, in light of the recent  debate over cloning, are quite topical are discussed here: science and  technology, human greed, creation of new life, elements of hubris.  But it  is a broad canvas onto which Burroughs paints one of his more common  themes.<br />Still, for a non-series Burroughs title, this is an enjoyable  read; bubble gum for the mind that even after 70 years still manages to  deliver the goods.<br />This book has one of the best opening paragraphs  you'll ever read:<br />&quot;As he dropped the last grisly fragment of the  dismembered and mutilated body into the small vat of nitric acid that was  to devour every trace of the horrid evidence which might easily send him to  the gallows, the man sank weakly into a chair and throwing his body forward  upon his great, teak desk buried his face in his arms, breaking into dry,  moaning sobs.&quot;	1999-10-11

The collection here -- introduced by Robert Bloch -- nicely spans Brown's career and while heavy  on the science fiction elements, still presents a fine selection of Brown's  output. Mostly short stories and not a dog in the bunch!	1999-06-28

He manages, and all these stories are satisfying.	1999-02-08

This has a nice variety of authors and an excellent blend of styles and stories.  Well worth the price of admission.	1998-12-29
US	52816790	R3OJIKG18B2CDG	0879725915	932389052	Martians and Misplaced Clues: The Life and Work of Fredric Brown	Books	5	28	28	N	Y	Nicely written summary of Brown's life, and work	Jack Seabrook has turned a mountain of research into a compact and readable book.  Fredric Brown was a complex individual, and Seabrook paints an accurate (often painfully so) picture of the man.  Seabrook's book also  includes a list of Brown's pulp fiction and novels for the collector, has  thoughtful analyses of Brown's work for the critic, and has humor and  insight for the curious.  An excellent job and well worth the price of  admission.	1998-12-02

In a 1948 edition of Ellery  Queen's Mystery Magazine, the editors noted that Derleth generated over 1  million words a year!  That, in addition to overseeing Arkham House,  editing numerous anthologies, generating a column for a local newspaper,  and acting as a one-man advocate for his beloved Wisconsin.<br />These 17  evocative and well-written short stories were incredibly written in one  month's time to, as Derleth says, &quot;swell the log of (the pulp  magazine) Weird Tales&quot;.  The title story -- &quot;Mr. George&quot; --  is alone worth the price of the book.  If you've ever been bullied, you'll  empathize with Priscilla, the tiny protagonist in the title story, and her  mysterious imaginary friend. When greedy relatives plot to do the tyke in  to capitalize on her inheritance, this &quot;imaginary&quot; friend comes  to her side.<br />Derleth has a marvelous way of telling a story whether a  science fiction venture, a mystery, or a spine tingler (as are the stories  in this title).  If you can find a copy of this book get it!	1998-08-28

Thoughtful and engaging, it shows the  affection Derleth has for the strangers in our world -- those quirky men  and women who don't quite blend with our society.  This anthology brings  together most of Derleth's science fiction writings under one cover, and is  well-worth the price of admission.	1998-08-28

In light of recent world events, it would do us all good to  pay attention to what this man has to say about readiness, anti-terrorist  tactics, and our ability to counter terrorism at home and abroad.	1998-08-23
