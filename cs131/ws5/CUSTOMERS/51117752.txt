She doesn't want to know them, be around them or be with them. In her mind, they are not good people and she wants nothing to do with them. <br />It seems that she is spoiled, selfish and only thinks of herself. The twin brothers that are betrothed to her seem to only want to care for her and pleasure her beyond belief. But, it isn't until they are joined inside her that she begins to care for them... The sex in the book is good, but the story leaves something lacking. I would suggest going with one of Lora Leigh's other series.	2005-07-18

It's got all the favorite quotes spanning over the entire seven season. It's broken down into easy to follow categories with the quotes displayed in the show's sequential order. It also gives which show it's from so you can go back to that particular show - either on tv or in your head - and remember the entire scene. <br />Even if you're relatively new to the world of Buffy, this is the perfect book to get caught up on the series. By the quotes used, it goes through the series without giving any of mysteries of the show away for those who haven't seen certain episodes or even seasons.<br />If you never pick up another book about Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this should be the one you read.	2003-12-16

I could especially relate to everything that happens after she gets married. I didn't truly care for her first book, but I found this one to have more humor and be more relatable. In this book, she seems more human.<br />The book picks up where \\"Idiot Girls...\\" left off. She's looking for a good man, gets married, her sister has a baby and she decides she wants a house in downtown Phoenix. Of course, those of us that live here are wondering what was she thinking, but that's beside the point. Downtown Phoenix has it's special charms. All her trials and tribulations in the book are understandable if you know where she's coming from. It also helps if you have been in similar situations of marriage and home-owning, etc.<br />Try it if you must, it's definately better than the first. Yet, there are more valuable things you could waste your time with.	2003-07-25

What I found was that Holden was a pain in the rear teenage boy whose mission in life was to complain about everything except his stupid red hat. I was sorely disappointed. <br />As I got deeper into the book, the more I wanted to just beat some sense into the boy for being such a complainer. He thinks that the world should bow down to him and it just doesn't work that way. <br />I also don't understand why this book was banned. Holden has feelings that every teenager has and complains about everything. How is that different or bothering in any way? We have to go through it everyday, why not be allowed to read about it? Read it if you want, but please tell me if you find the point that makes this book so important.	2003-07-25

While some of his ideas are wonderful, there are several that are completely ludicrous and unnecessary in a classroom or in any environment. In this book, he presents himself as someone who has to have his way no matter what. His no Doritos rule?!? What is that all about? Just because he had a bad experience once upon a time doesn't mean he has the right to ruin it for everyone else. His line rules are also somewhat excessive - the no talking what so ever not just in lines, but everywhere else. That may be fine for younger children, but as children get older, they are not going to follow this either because they don't want to or because they know it's going to bug the teacher. <br />When I picked the book up, I liked the idea of the book from the back. As I got into it, however, I decided that Mr. Clark has too much time on his hands if he thinks that everyone should follow his rules than he is outrageous.	2003-07-23

She has one week before she becomes \\"revirginized.\\" In several disasterous attempts at trying to avoid this at all possible costs, she fails miserably.<br /> I was thinking that she was challenged by some supernatural love force from reading the back of the book. Instead, she is just told by her best friend that she would be a virgin again after a year of no sex. Why would she follow his advise about things if she's as independent as she claims?<br /> The book actually wasn't too bad until the end. The last night before reclaiming her virginity, almost every person Stacy tries to have sex with during the previous week comes together and states their case for wanting to be with her. It's like deja vu of the end of \\"There's Something About Mary.\\" That was really the only super hokey part. <br /> Read it if you must, but I would and could find better things to fill my time with.	2003-07-19

This is the one pregnancy book that I could get through without worrying if my baby is going to come out with two heads or not at all. Iovine's blunt talk about being pregnant and having a baby is quite a relief from other pregnancy books. While I wouldn't take all the information to heart - some of it is dated, even for the mid-90's - it was a fun, relazing read in the cesspool of pregnancy books. Again, I wouldn't follow some of the advise - drinking a glass of wine, borrowing old furniture, etc. read it as a way to smile through all the changes that are happening. Then make your husband read it - he'll wonder what's so funny anyway.	2003-07-19

I understand that they had been great friends and of course, should mention things like their first meeting and things they did together, but that should be it.<br /> This book was supposed to be about her, not him. Berg spent almost half the book talking about his research for his Goldwyn and Lindbergh bio's and talking to Irene Selznick than about Kate herself. I was expecting some of what he gave, but more of what should have been there. <br /> I was expecting there to be recounts and memories of Kate, but I thought it would be more Berg talking with others about their favorite &quot;Kate experiences.&quot; While I expected him to interject some of his views and times with her, I wasn't expecting him to talk about himself throughout the entire book. <br /> I was also disappointed in the lack of pictures. They were only at the beginning of each chapter and were not on gloss pages. I was hoping that there would be pictures of Fenwick and Old Saybrook and many of the other things, places, and people he was talking about. <br /> The only reason I gave this book 3 stars was because it was about her. While I suggest that you read it as a completor to other books about Kate, stick with &quot;Me&quot; or the biography that Barbara Lemming did about her. Even the Garsin Kanin book that she absolutely hated would be better.	2003-07-17

I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;The Stranger Beside Me.&quot; However, before I began reading, I was expecting something totally different. I was expecting a story of about someone and their crimes, etc. - what a normal true crime story usually goes through. What I wasn't expecting was the inner torment of the author on whether or not she should believe her friend.<br /> I can understand that Ann Rule was friends with Ted Bundy and that caused torment for as she hunted for the &quot;Ted&quot; murderer and wrote her book, but this book about SOMEONE ELSE was written in the first person - and not from Ted's point of view. It's all about her thoughts and feelings as things are happening in the Ted case and what she's going through. <br /> The book was insightful because she actually knew Ted as a person - sociopath that he was. She felt that she could trust him and share with him. I do understand that would put anyone in an uncomfortable position when you find out someone is a serial killer and, yes, it should be mentioned in said book about this serial killer you are writing about. However, it should not be the basis of the entire book.<br /> Read it for the information on Ted, but try to ignore the fact that the book is more about Rule than him.	2003-07-07

She tries to move up the social ladder by pretending to be someone she's not while living her life vicariously through her friends.<BR> I was extremely disappointed in this book. I was expecting something completely different. I'm not quite sure, but I know that it wasn't this. Amanda is a conceited character that doesn't really care about her family or friends. She is surrounded by other characters that aren't developed as to make the reader possibly feel sorry for her (I wasn't quite sure). <BR> All she does is complain. She tells her husband that she isn't happy and wants to do something like go back to work. While he agrees that she should do whatever will make her happy, she's not satisfied with his answer. She whines that the house is always a mess and that she never cooks and eight million things go wrong everyday yet, she does nothing to better her situation. She doesn't get things done while her kids are in school and when they are home, she doesn't engage them into helping her in fun ways. <BR> Everything that is wrong with Amanda's life is brought on by her own doing. Crittenden either didn't realize what she was writing or did it on purpose. Amanda is the only one in charge of her own destiny yet is only happy when her husband gets a job making a lot of money after she has a baby she didn't want. Had some things not worked out as she wanted or planned, Amanda could have changed the way her life was going, but instead felt sorry for herself and worried that her husband would leave her for getting him fired. <BR>  Do yourself a favor and skip the book.	2003-06-22

It is then decided that it is to be Anne that takes her place as the king's lover and the family's hope is for her to become queen in place of Katherine of Aragon.<BR>  Through lies and plotting Anne eventually marries Henry and strives to give him the son he always wanted. When after a few attempts, she fails to do so, she and Gregory commit the ultimate sin so the family stays in favor even though he is in love with another man. As history will tell, Anne is eventually executed and Henry marries four more women before his death.<BR>  The story is extremely engaging and the book kept my attention throughout.

While I did have to get this book for a survey course, I was pleasantly suprised at the vast range of work represented in the text.<br />Not only does the book include &quot;Cannonical&quot; writers but also more obscure writers that may not be as well known now but were popular during their timeframe. The text has an equal amount of work represented from both women and men and explains the viewpoint of each in relation to what was going on at the time. An example are the women Romantic writers; they viewed things differently than their male counterparts and therefore wrote about different things, had different styles of writing, etc.<br />Of course, as with all Norton books, there are bios of each author before their selections, introductions to each period, apendicies, bibliographies, essays and a section of goegraphic nomenclature.

As a lifelong resident, I was looking forward to a book that really showed where I was from. I had heard wonderful things about the pictures and the stories behind them. I am sorry to say that I was quite disappointed in the book. <BR> While Dutton did have beautiful pictures of an extensive part of the state, he left out several key places that many people associate with Arizona. While he focused of all the 'major' places of the state, Dutton forgot places like Lake Havasu, Canyon de Chelly and the rest of the Navajo Nation as well as the Hopi nation and the AZ parts of Monument Valley - just to name a few. How can someone do a comprehensive book about something or some place without inclucing ALL the elements? I can understand that there may not be many pictures of certain places, but surely there are some that people could have offered. <BR> While the book is severely lacking in this aspect, the pictures are absolutely breath-taking.

It has truly been a lifesaver so far.<BR> The book has several sections (like cribs, strollers, toys, etc.) broken down by manufacturer and gives descriptions and ratings of each. Also, the book is guaranteed so that if it doesn't save you money, they will give you your money back! The sections are easy to follow and nicely arranged. If you can't find something specific, you can go to the index or to thier site at babybargains.com and it will be there. They are much like Consumer Reports, but I find myself liking what they have to say a little better. They give you direction to find quality items for bargain prices.<BR> I am thoroughly pleased with this book as I have already gone through it (I've only had it for 2 days) and have a better idea of things that my baby will need and things that I can blow off. I have already told several expecting friends that they HAVE to get this book. Now, I'm not so lost.	2003-04-14

I believed it to be a book that discussed helpful hints as your baby grows and information on what moms go through as they adjust to having a new baby.<br />I was completely shocked after the first chapter. I figured that Dr. Sears would have some opinions about certain things however, I wasn't expecting to feel patronized after every page. While some of the advise is relevant and helpful to new moms, I feel that I can get the same information elsewhere without feeling as though I'm not doing everything right. This book and others of the Sears' series made me feel as if I were reading another series like &quot;What to Expect&quot; and I didn't want to feel guilty and believe that I was doing everything wrong because it wasn't the same way Dr. Sears would have done it.<br />If you like being preached at about baby care, get the book. But, if you want the same information without feeling uncomfortable go for another series or book. I will keep it around for some info though so that it wasn't money wasted in vain.	2003-04-11

For a woman about to turn 50, Liddy's life seems like the life of a twenty something turned decidedly sour.<BR>While the book has redeeming value as a light read, Clare has used a dictionary of cliche's to come up with an over the top story. A controlling older daughter, a bulemic younger daughter and a gay son - the situation is completely predictable. The most vived characters in the book are the 90-something lesbian great-aunts Cleo and Cyn. In the mess of everything that's happened, all Liddy wants is to make things right with her husband who feels he needs to decide between her and his lover. (Honestly, would you take a cheating man back?)<BR>Although the book is very predictable, I actually enjoyed the light, simple read - I could even understand the British vocab. Not bad if you don't want something as depressing as Oprah picks.	2003-04-06

A little over a month ago, we got an advanced copy of this book and a letter from the publisher and thought nothing more of it. The next week, we got a letter from our home office asking us to read the book before its release. I was the first to read it. I was completely amazed, suprised, and delighted to find The Da Vinci Code a very refreshing read.<br />The book is based on the idea that the Holy Grail is actually Mary Magadaline and that the early church hid documents and changed who she actually was in order to further its own cause. Taken from actual historical and theological works and ideas, Dan Brown crafts a remarkable story around a 2000 year old controversy.<br />Robert Langdon is a professor at Harvard suddenly finding himself mixed up in the bizarre murder of the Louvre's curator. As the story moves on, there are many twists, turns and shocking suprises that are completely unexpected. Helped by Sophie, a French cop, Langdon helps to unravel the mystery of the Holy Grail and the secret society that watches over it.<br />This book is truly amazing and has lead me to consider other books with similar ideas like \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" and the \\"Templar Revelation\\" among others. If you have any interest in Christianity at all, read the book!	2003-04-05

I instantly read this moving account of a young man's quest to stay alive in Nazi Poland. Playing the piano on the radio, knowingly leaving his family as they get ready to leave on transport, hiding in a destroyed building - I couldn't imagine ever having to deal with that myself and knowing that someone did has changed my view of the world.<BR>This book is moving, disturbing and timeless in its thoughts and portrayals. Szpilman knew how to capture the feeling of his time without judgement or anger against his inprisonment. That makes him relatable. I only hope I can read more things like this in years to come.	2003-03-24

I read it in a couple of hours and began to implement what I had learned into my routine immediately. This book is a short, no-nonsense guide to getting your life together - whether in buiseness or your personal life.<BR>    I also found that this book can be easily applied to almost any business whether it's in marketing, teaching, direct selling, etc. you can focus on the book as if Tracy were writing specifically to what you do. He is good on focusing on steps to get you where you need to be rather than mentioning the steps and going into great detail and analysis about it. And I would recommend this to anyone who is wanting to either get a jump start or wanting to move up. Work with what he gives you and you will get there quickly.	2003-01-31

Patricia Cornwell may be a wonderful mystery writer (I've never read her, so I wouldn't know), but she should stick to what she knows - writing fiction. I have done extensive studies on Jack the Ripper and other serial killers and while her &quot;evidence&quot; is quite intriguing, it is fallible.<BR>     She believes that she has solved this great mystery as have other, more acclaimed Ripperologists. However, where she errs greatly is by saying that she is 100% absolutely positive and there is no margin for error. Her theory may be correct, but it will only be added to the other Jack the Ripper as a theory.    <BR>     Cornwell has received scathing reviews from others who have studied Jack the Ripper more extensively and longer than she has. Why should she suddenly have the magical key that everyone's been looking for. Her suspect has been studied before along with countless others - what makes him different in this instance? <BR>    She purchased most of his art and reviewed letters sent to Scotland Yard and obtained DNA samples. However, the only thing she was able to prove with this was the fact the her suspect may have sent a letter or two taunting the police. Crime experts over several generations have concluded that the real Ripper only sent maybe one or two letters that the press and police received if any at all.<BR>    Read it if you have extra time to waste, but don't take it to heart. There are many other, better books about Jack the Ripper that are more thorough and informative.	2003-01-15

Being brand new in the marriage world I have had no idea what's going on. I saw this book and thought the title was interesting so I picked it up. <BR>     I laughed out loud so much my husband thought I was going nuts. I can completely understand everything Jenny discusses. I can especially relate to \\"dating\\" other couples and wondering if they liked you as much as you like them. Will they call? Which couple is the 'guy' and which couple is the 'girl'? And her husband driving around for like 2 hours for a closer parking spot! I live in Arizona where parking is abundant, yet my husband insists on circling around until we find the \\"perfect\\" spot. Usually, I can do what needed to be done and home before he even parks!<BR>    This book is clever, smart and totally relatable. I would suggest giving this to a bride-to-be so they can at least get a little glimpse into life after the dress - even if they don't take it to heart until six or seven months after they've been married and wonder what they were thinking.	2003-01-15
