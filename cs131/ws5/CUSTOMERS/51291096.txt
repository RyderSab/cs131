US	51291096	R3E8YTIBC900LV	0767915593	238389596	Straight Talking: A Novel	Books	5	0	1	N	Y	Excellant!	I love Jane Green's books.  They never are a disappointment.  I thought she did an excellant job developing each characture in the book and you really understood why Tash acted and reacted the way she did with the different men in her life.  I think anyone who ever was in a situation where they didn't truly appreciate something until it was lost will understand what Tash was going through.  I think anyone who has a hard time understanding a healthy relationship because they are used to unbalanced ones will understand Tash.  I think anyone who has ever been self distructive will understand Tash.  I think this book was very honest about what may single women go through and feel about relationships.  This really was a British, When Harry Meet Sally.  I think it was great.	2005-08-12
US	51291096	R2XVDH4RMBIMP2	1594480001	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Excellant!!!	This book is a good as everyone is saying.  I was curious about this book since it was getting rave reviews, but I did not expect that I would like it.  I was afraid it was going to be about war and very anti-American.  I was in for a big surprise.  This book was such a touching story and totally moving.  It is so sad to read about how a country was ruined by \\"religious\\" men and how a person could be shaped by one turning point in their life.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.  It is such a heartbreakingly beautiful story that I can not imagine anyone not being touched by this very moving story.	2005-08-06

Others have commented that it could have been shorter, but I do not agree.  I thought by the end of the book your really knew each person and saw how they evolved during the story.  Jack was totally Devine!  I got so into this story that I actually had sushi for lunch today!!!! <br /> <br />This book was better than the Other Side of the Story.  All chicklit fans will enjoy this one.	2005-08-03

I have been waiting all summer for it to come out and was worried it would not be as good as her previous books, but it was just as good, if not better!  The story was wonderful and I think this would make a great movie.  I can not understand any other reviewer who say it was to light and unrealistic.  Kinsella is the queen of light hearted romantic comedies. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the story.  And the raspberry scene made the purchase of the book well worth the cost!  I am only sadden to know that I will probably have to wait another year for the next Kinsella book. <br /> <br />Anyone who loved her other books, loves Chicklit or is looking for a good romantic comedy should buy this book! It was very enjoyable and I totally loved it!	2005-07-24
US	51291096	R3TI3PZN5NOR5C	0670034045	46714252	The Other Woman	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	I liked it.	I just finished reading \\"The Other Woman\\" and thought it was a good book.  It held my interest and I liked the way the book ended by taking care of all the loose ends.  I think Jane Green is a very enjoyable author and will continue to read all of her books. <br /> <br />But, I did wish the book was more up beat and light like Mr Maybe and Jemima J.  I found this book insightful and made you think about family relationships, but it lacked the escapism and fun of her other books.  I felt like she sat down to write this when she was really angry at her husband and/or mother-in-law.  I hope her next book is more like Mr Maybe and more lighthearted.  This was a serious and mature Jane Green.	2005-07-19

I found the book annoying and did not like the subject matter.  I did not find anything funny or amusing about writing a light hearted story around Osama bin Laden and terriorism.  I am really disappointed in Helen Fielding's choice of subject matter for her book.  I loved Bridget Jones and can not believe how disappointing this book was.  I would not recommend it to anyone.	2005-07-16

In fact I actually liked it better because I liked the central people.  Hannah and Daniel had such a touching love story.  She really was a \\"fool\\" who learned to be a woman.  I hope the next book is as good.  I look forward to reading it.<br /><br />If you liked TOBG I think you will like this book.	2005-07-07

This was my third Jane Green novel and I think she is the best author of \\"Chick-lit\\".  It was such a feel good story and you really end up loving Jemima.  I can't wait to read all of Jane Green's books.  I do have to note that Mr Maybe is still my favorite so far. <br />	2005-07-01

I did not realize that it was the first in a series until I got to the end and I can't wait to read more.  Before I read this book I knew nothing about the Forbidden City and I found my sell totally captured by the tale.  It dragged alittle when the were heading back to the city at the end but overall I would recommend this book.	2005-06-26

It took my alittle while to get into it but half way through I was hooked.  I could really relate to Cath and couldn't believe how lucky she was to meet a guy like James.  Truth be told,  I can't believe any guy would put up with that much in real life!!!<br /><br />This is my second Jane Green book and she is definetly one of the leaders in Chicklit.  But I do have to admitt that I liked Mr Maybe better.	2005-06-23

Well it was really a wonderful story and I loved it.  I loved reading this historical fiction tale and I would highly recommend it.  Anyone who loved The Other Boleyn Girl will also love this book.  I also think that a few of the reviewers were critical of John and that they do not get that he was just a product of his time and was a good man and very good to Katherine.  I thought he was very sexy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-22

Although it did pick up halfway through when Kitty got involved with the woman's right to vote movement, I can't say that I would recommend anyone to buy it.   I think if the focused less on the cemetary and funeral rituals and focused more on the people in the book and the relationship between Kitty and Richard it would have been a better book.  The Girl with the Pearl Earring was definately beter. <br />	2005-06-19

I actually laughed out loud at parts and I could not put it down!	2005-06-11

The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk.  I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding.  He was kind of shallow.  But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk.  I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them.  I have read better chicklit.	2005-06-02
