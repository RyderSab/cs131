US	52920787	R3DGTBMPNVNJK6	0312423268	94188349	The Evening of the Holiday	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Elegant work	To read Shirley Hazzard is to venture into times and spaces restricted by social mores. Evocative of Edith Wharton, her characters are ensnared by the prevailing right and wrong of the times in which they live. In this case, it is post World War II Italy. With an economy of words, she paints a magnificent sense of place, imbues it with ordinary people and requires them to make life altering decisions.     Unlike contemporary writers, Hazzard does not pin every detail on the page - readers are required to think. There is always an elegance in Hazzard's work, even in this early, straightforward novel.	2005-08-18

I am sure I have forgotten a few adjectives as well. With remarkable characters, Plascencia moves the reader through his own reality, dreams, conjectures and thoughts of events that happened, might have happened and couldn't possibly have happened. His dialog runs stealthily from religion and sex to field workers, Hollywood starlets, broken romances, planetary movement, physical disabilities and war and revenge. It will blast you out of your seat and take you on the wildest literary ride imaginable. It is a rare, astonishing and totally satisfying book to consume.	2005-08-15
US	52920787	RK5QJ4C2VUFKU	0375410856	169036087	A Meal Observed	Books	4	13	13	N	Y	Perceptive	The best dinners are those slowly savored with friends and loved ones. Years afterward, one might still recall much of the fare of a memorable evening, the warm ambiance and the stylish dcor, or an incredible waiter, a magnificent seafood dish, souffl, or the fifty year old Bordeaux. In France, Guide Michelin starred restaurants are intended to be the ultimate French dining experience employing the best chefs, lush furnishings, unparalleled service and a magnificent wine cellar.  <br /> <br />Yet, unless one is accustomed to formal French dining, there is a certain apprehension, the dread of committing some unpardonable dining room faux pas that will draw glares from the haughty staff and muted mirth from in-the-know fellow patrons. Andrew Todhunter invites the reader along to a memorable dinner at Taillevent, the world renowned three star restaurant and, arguably, the best restaurant in the world. Todhunter shares his apprehension and appreciation of this dinner-of-a-lifetime at the mecca of haute cuisine. <br /> <br />A Meal Observed will not leave the reader drooling over the cuisine served nor will it divulge secret recipes from the celebrated Parisian restaurant. What it will do is reveal to the reader the dedication of those who have chosen cooking as a career and the complexities of flawless performance night after night.  <br /> <br />The premise of each of the book's chapters is to unhurriedly savor every exciting course from amuse-bouche to the complimentary cognacs that conclude the evening and to recognize the varied skills of the matre d', table captain, sommelier, head chef, sous-chef, pastry chef and the entire kitchen \\"brigade.\\" The author incorporates not only apt descriptions of the courses laid before him but sprinkles in reminiscences of his own culinary life, a few interesting philosophical observations as well as a smattering of gastronomic history. Todhunter served several months as a sort of apprentice - reporter at large at Taillevent before making the anonymous dinner reservation for he and his wife.  <br /> <br />A Meal Observed is more than just a recitation of ingredients of artistically arranged plates. The author interviewed several of the chef/craftsmen that daily toil long hours in obscurity, many with minimal pay, their years of endeavor, their singular mindedness, their near maniacal dedication to churning out masterpiece after masterpiece. Unlike much of America, where advancement is the goal and each rung on the ladder a mere stopping off point, European culture is still tied to apprenticeship and mastering the job at hand - imbuing each step of the career path with proud accomplishment. In the end, the reader is left with a deeper appreciation not only of the glorious presentation of food but the intricacies of preparation, coordination and management of a world class restaurant.  <br />	2005-04-11

Yet, there is meaning that goes well beyond the obvious story line; it is angst and the burden of history. <br /> <br />I do not know the time frame that Schlink wrote these short stories but \\"Flights of Love\\" is more college level writing than professional. The stories are trite to say the least. There are only a few all to brief glimpses of the Schlink of \\"The Reader.\\"  <br /> <br />Something is always lost in translation of a foreign tongue, a different culture. I thought perhaps the translator was being overly simplistic with his approach - transcribing words and not meaning. Yet, the biography of the translator indicates he is highly respected and experienced. The onus reverts to Schlink. Sorry, I had hoped for more. <br />	2004-09-13

I am a frequent traveler to Provence as well and know most, if not all, of the non fictional places he refers to in his books. Reading Mayle is a pleasant reminder of the south of France. In past books, he has excelled in character development, devotion to detail and his obvious passion for his Provencal subjects. <br />Sadly, most of that is lacking in A Good Year. The plot is as thin as a watered-down Rhone, his characters as underdeveloped as June Pinot Noir. His affinity for Provence still shines through but other than a recipe for vinaigrette and a few brief mentions of French food here and there, this tale could as easily have unfolded in Spain or Chile or New Zealand - just rearrange the names.<br />Mayle has enjoyed, at least in my small opinion, a distinct advantage over Frances Mayes and her &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; series. He understands characters and character development. While Mayes focuses on a sense of place with incidental characters Mayle  develops his characters intertwined with a sense of place. <br />None of that development occurs in A Good Year. This ultra light weight novel is so wafer thin from cover to cover one would think that Mayle wrote it in his sleep, it simply has no legs. I cannot imagine this novel being transcribed into a motion picture, yet, apparently, that is what is going to transpire.	2004-07-01

It is clear that Zadie Smith is an intelligent woman and has writing potential. However, the primary function of writing is communicating and that just does not happen with this book. Maybe it's a generational thing or a cultural thing but I simply could not empathize or warm to the any of the characters and that is why the book was so difficult to read.<br />Dialog came in fits and starts from a handful of superfluous characters that didn't seem to add much to this slow developing story either. When many of the fringe characters did speak it was in a colloquial manner and I had an arduous time deciphering what it was they were actually alluding to which was usually nothing significant to moving the story line forward.<br />This book required too much effort for too small a payoff. In the end, none of the characters were memorable. In fact, I was happy to finish so I would never have to encounter them again. To her credit, Zadie Smith does a marvelous job developing a &quot;sense of place&quot; in the novel with an economy of words. I wish she could have imbued her characters with as much appeal. The plot itself is trite.	2003-10-11

Revenge is pretty cool. It a story in pictures but who cares about the stories when the images are this sensual and erotic and the models so luscious. Each photo stands on its own and suggests a story within a story. In fact, I like looking at the pages out of order. Just put your finger in the book, open and make up your own story on whichever picture your finger lands on. The book is sexually edgy like Roy Stuart without the murkiness of Tony Ward. The all black and white format suggests a dreamy quality of innocence even though the book depicts sexual violence albeit mild. My sole complaint is that the I wish the format was larger.	2003-04-23

Books	2	16	24	N	Y	Self Indulgent	I read with interest the opinions of the other reviewers and find myself heartily disagreeing with many of their conclusions. I do not view this book as brave or groundbreaking nor is it insightful or erotic. It is most like someone on her psychiatrist's couch blurting out the minutia of her life. It is all about her, most of her sex partners were just nameless, faceless genitals. Who could conceivably care about this other than her? Talk about self-indulgent.<br />I agree that it is an unapologetic look at her life but the world is full of ninnies that feel justified in however they choose to live their lives and then feel compelled to us all about it. I don't give a whit about her sexual escapades whether she had one lover or one million lovers. That is her business but the real issue here is why she has lived her life in this manner. That is what interested me in the book. Sadly, she alludes to some childhood issues but never delves deeply enough into her own psyche for any revelation, any insight, an epiphany of any kind. I struggled to get through this short book.	2003-01-19
US	52920787	R1GWFYORFP5HL1	1892041642	615881481	Peter Lindbergh: Stories	Books	2	6	8	N	Y	Disappointing	Peter Lindbergh's earlier books are far superior to this. Maybe I am missing something here but this book isn't really \\"Stories\\" at all. I thought the stories would be mysterious, enchanting, romantic, sensual or at least interesting photographs. Nothing here is. Everything is overly contrived including a ridiculous invasion by midgets in flying saucers. Really!? ...<br />True there are a few, very few in my opinion, gorgeous pictures of beautiful models. Most of the models have disgusting cigarettes hanging from their lips or dangling from their fingers -- not very sexy. In fact this book seems more a tribute to the Marlboro man than to the beauty of his models.<br />Wim Wenders wrote the introduction and I admire and respect his work very much. He apparently sees things in this book that I am clearly missing. I have paged through this book three times now to see if I could \\"get it\\". I don't. Wenders introduction drones on with the continuing question \\"How does Peter Lindbergh do it?\\" I don't know what Lindbergh has done except contrive and exaggerate to absurdity. I am disappointed.<br />The fashion industry is largely based on hype. Evidently, those working in that industry begin to believe all this hype themselves. Perhaps that is what has happened to Lindbergh, he believes everything he puts out is a masterpiece -- it isn't.	2003-01-10

Incorporating an imaginary correspondent, Mario Vargas Llosa writes a series of letters to a young protege sharing his years of literary experience and outlining the principles that make a novel.  It is an interesting vehicle for an instruction book and it works. Most books of how to write are overloaded with superfluous detail and have the annoying tendency to be academic in the approach to writing. This book is breezy, conversational, loaded with brilliant insight and fun to read. Sighting loads of examples from classic and not so classic novels he brings to life essential topics of style, voice, time, point of view and other narrative tools that the masters of the novel have incorporated for hundreds of years. <br />Many of the novelists Vargas Llosa sites for his many examples are unknown to me and he has roused my interest in reading their books. Alas, many of them are not translated into English (at least not that I can find on Amazon). But that does not diminish the satisfaction derived from reading this diminutive book. His best advice to any writer is to be a great reader. An example he has clearly followed himself.	2002-07-28
US	52920787	R3F2VNAYTA1ZW0	0394555090	951161016	Theodore Rex	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Engrossing	There are few writers of history that can turn a droll topic into an exciting read. The late Barbara Tuchman and Garry Wills come to mind although the latter author is more interpretive than definitive; both are exciting authors to read. Edmund Morris belongs with this elite group. By recounting Roosevelt's presidency he breathes life and excitement into the American political process. This is why we have politicians and politics and not just army generals running the country.<br />Thre isn't as much of Teddy's personality in &quot;Theodore Rex&quot; as there was in Morris's &quot;Rise of Theodore Roosevelt&quot; but we faithful readers already know Teddy. The events and challenges of the presidency are what this book is about and how the stubbornly brilliant Roosevelt dealt with them. Morris frequently mentions Teddy's love of tennis. The metaphor is not lost as the determined Roosevelt swats away tennis balls as he does political rivals and world crises. <br />Morris's book rarely drags as so many biographies do. He does not try to impress us with his thorough research of his subject even though he has done that. In the hands of a lesser author &quot;Theodore Rex&quot; might well be a three thoudsand page book. And that is Morris's genius -- giving us the essence of Theodore Roosevelt without boring us with every detail of his life. I look forward to the next installment of the Rooseveltian saga.	2002-04-04

I thought it one of the most creative books I have read so I had high hopes for &quot;Diagnosis&quot;. <br />Medical science at the beginning of the thrid millenieum is still in it's infancy. Any one who has witnessed a loved one slowly die from a cancer that cannot be found until it is too late or someone who slowly deteriorates from &quot;uknown&quot; causes can identify with the inaccuracy and undependability of the modern day doctoring profession. <br />We watch too many miracle cures on television and hear too much hype from medical professionals. Our hopes are high that any malady can be cured. Doctors are very good at some things: setting broken bones, diagnosing common viruses, relieving pain from injuries. And doctors are well meaning and optomistic for the most part, perhaps too much so -- optimism that is galloping far ahead of the actual applied science. That is the theme of &quot;Diagnosis&quot;. <br />My problem with the book is not in it's theme, I wholeheartedly agree with that. It is the progression of the book, very detailed in the beginning, then skipping fowrard faster and faster. Unfortunately, as the pace quickens nothing else changes. There is no progress to the theme, no progress for the character in the book, no advancement of a new thought or idea. Both character and reader are caught in a web. Perhaps the author himself could not figure out how to save his character, he would not be the first to fall into that trap. There is no resolution, no enlightened moment, no epiphany here.<br />In the end I hoped Lightman would give us something: a fresh idea, a new approach, something to give us hope, something to grasp on to. Alas, he just sets us adrift with nothing.	2001-08-18

It is insightful but not definitive. It is not an in depth biography of Dora Maar. A better perception of the psyche of Dora Maar is contained in James Lord's personal memoir &quot;Picasso and Dora&quot;. And a better understanding of the cruelty of Picasso is presented in Arianna S. Huffington's &quot;Picasso: Creator and Destroyer&quot;. Both I think are necessary to truly appreciate this book as I do.<br /> Since Dora Maar's death in 1997, little has yet been published of her work. She is primarily known as one of the mistresses of Picasso but there was a world of complexity to this woman. She was deeply involved with the surrealists before she ever met Picasso. She knew them all, Breton, Tanguy, Man Ray, Hugnet, Crevel. She was a noted photographer, an exhibited painter, a poet and Picasso's muse and inspiration for seven stormy years culminating in a breakdown that left her a changed woman, a recluse and a religious devotee.<br /> Mary Ann Caws book presents a dazzling panorama of works by both Dora Maar and Picasso including some wonderful comparative paintings of both artists. Dora Maar assisted and photographically chronicled Picasso as he created his masterpiece Guernica. That chronicle is beautifully presented in Caws book.<br /> This book is an easy read with gorgeous reproductions of photographs, painting, sculpture, and poetry throughout not only from Dora Maar but also from Paul Eluard, Andr&eacute; du Bouchet and others. It is a great visual companion piece to books on Picasso's works, photography and surrealism. It will occupy that regrettably tiny portion of my bookshelf devoted to Dora Maar.

He has created memorable imagry with his  &quot;Passion and Line&quot; and &quot;Water Dance&quot; books. &quot;Body  Knots&quot; is an evolution of &quot;Pool Light&quot; which was a sequel to  &quot;Water Dance&quot;. But not all evolution is happy or successful. <br />  This book is far too gimmicky for my taste and I think Mr.Schatz is capable  of far more creative imagry than this. How many of these images will appear  in Madison Ave. advertising over the next year? Or is that the real goal  here? One wonders. Perhaps if Mr.Schatz would have remained in California  rather than moving to New York his artistic goals would not have been  seduced by the scent of advertising contracts. I don't begrudge an artist  trying to earn money but Mr.Schatz was a very successful surgeon before  taking up lenswork full time--he isn't a starving artist. <br /> What  strikes me about &quot;Body Knots&quot; is that it is more a graphic arts  presentation than it is fine art photography. Mr. Schatz, please go back  and look at &quot;Passion and Line&quot; and &quot;Water Dance&quot;. You  created something wonderful there.  Remember your motives?	2000-08-07

This well researched photo essay on Paul Outerbridge is a wonderful addition to the pictorial history of the art.  Elaine Dines-Cox does a marvelous job placing Outerbridge in an artistic context.  Outerbridge  draws from Cubism, New Objectiviity and Surrealism and translates them into  his own visual language.  She speaks not only of his art but the processes  he used.  An entire chapter is extracted from an Outerbridge publication  from 1940 describing the Carbo process.<br /> Dines-Cox book is  beautifully oversized to bring to full advantage the magnificent work of  this master.  Outerbridge mastered both black and white and color during  his lifetime. His life is briefly sketched but this book is not intended as  a biography but rather as a homage to a great master.<br /> Outbridge's  name is not as well known as Adams, Weston, Cunningham, Brassai or Kertesz  but as an artist he ranks with the best.  Recent auctions of his work have  fetched incredible sums.<br /> While other great artists have innumerable  books to their credit I have only come across two other publications on  Outerbridge and they were both small paperbacks with inferior  reproductions.  With but one photograph per page this is one of the  handsomest publications in years.	1999-12-09

Imprints  is a wonderful representation of the America of our fathers and grandfathers that will soon exist no more, for better or worse.  The photographic record in Imprints  speaks wonderfully of the articulate and  experienced eye of David Plowden.  His images depict the unglamorous parts  of life that most of us grow up with.  Yet, at the same time, his keen  vision shows us that there is beauty and art in everything.  I grew up in  the American Midwest in the 1950's and this book elicits nostalgia,  sentimentality and a sense of loss. I wish I had been more observant,  aware, appreciative at that time. Plowden has given me a second chance.	1999-12-09

At this juncture, from  what I have seen, she is better at securing PR for herself than she is a  quality artist.  The problem with the media is that when one of them  features something, anything or anybody, then all the others feel they have  missed something and run their own features of the same thing.  The reader  deserves better but rarely gets it.  I'm sure Von Unwerth will continue to  grow as an artist but right now she is a lightweight. The ground she covers  has been covered many times before.	1999-09-19

It inspires me. It motivates me.  It is the zenith of what the human body can be. I get chills each time I view this thrilling book.  The  hard work, the incredible discipline of the dancers is exquisitly captured  by Howard Schultz.  Bravo to the Artist Schultz and bravo to his subject  dancers.	1999-09-19

Often it is forbidden fruit and a love that is doomed from the onset.  Her characters are real and true and I could feel their agony and their  exhileration.  A good author will do that.  The sex scenes are steamy and  the internal thoughts of the characters during sex is very convincing and  understandable and exciting and sad. Not everyone will grasp the deep  emotion that this novel evokes.	1999-08-07

It  is wonderful piece of history that is still unfolding--how many ways are  there to tell time, who decides and what is being used as a measurement of  time are open ended questions that I came away with. Fascinating stuff and  Mr. Duncan succeded in gaining and holding my rapt attention all weekend.   I am almost ready to reread this book already.	1998-10-26
