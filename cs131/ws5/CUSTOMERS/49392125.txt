The one question that The Ultimate Competitive Advantage answers is \\"what one thing can most improve a company's growth and profitability?\\".<br />The authors, Don Mitchell and Carol Coles, answer by saying \\"having the best process in your industry for continuing business model innovation\\".  Their response indicates that to accomplish this innovation:<br />1. you must be knowledgeable about the building processes that allow you to innovate your business model over time are more important then maximizing the efficiency of your current business processes<br />2. you must understand of your customer's needs and how your customer's needs are changing over time<br />3. you must understand your industry and how your industry is changing over time<br />4. you must understand what products and services will be required to make profits in the future<br />The core message of The Ultimate Competitive Advantage is \\"to develop and implement a superior management process that continually improves an organizations business model - its way of serving customers and outperforming competitors\\".  Again this is interesting because the emphasis is on creating the processes that allow you to continually innovate the way you do business.<br />One of the key ideas that stuck with me after reading this book was that business model innovation is not one time event.  Nor is not something that happens two or three times over the lifetime of a business.  It is something that needs to be woven into the fabric of the company.  Business model innovation must be expected, looked for, sought out and processes must be set in place to insure that business model innovation occurs.  So how do you continually innovate your business model?  The authors list the following dimensions:<br />1. Understanding and following the current business model<br />2. Understanding and installing the next business model<br />3. Understanding and using a business model innovation vision<br />4. Ongoing design and testing of potential business model innovations<br />This was the most interesting part of the book to me.  Certainly how to accomplish an innovation is important, but installing the processes to allow business model innovation to occur on an on-going basis is the key ingredient to building and maintaining competitive advantage.ding and installing the next business model<BR>3.

The organization and typography are different then most books, but lend themselves quite well to looking at web sites, good web site design and selected web site audiences.  Designing Websites indicates that a good web site is one that meets the needs of its user not is designers. The first chapter is a general introduction to the importance of and the components that make up web site usability.<br />After chapter one the book continues to look at usability from the eyes of six different types (categories) of site users and what they are trying to accomplish when using a site.<br />The six categories of users that the book examines are as follows:<br />Learners - seek education on either a specific topic or general category<br />Shoppers - to acquire all the information needed for a purchase and make a purchase<br />Connection Seekers - to meet people with varied backgrounds and cultures<br />Transactors - to streamline daily tasks like banking by using online services<br />Business Browsers - to dispense or gather information relating to their business<br />Fun Seekers - to spend leisure time exploring quality entertainment<br />One interesting point is that these categories of users are not necessarily limited by demographics, but the role that person is playing at a point in time.  For example, maybe someone is a learner before work in the morning, after work they maybe a shopper looking for needed gift and after that a fun seeker.  What you learn is that the same person plays different roles and is likely using different sites for different activates during the course of a day.<br /><br />Designing Websites talks about the factors leading to good site design such as a user centric design process and personas.  The book mentions factors that go into good design like fonts, colors, structure, navigation and methods for achieving consistent look and feel like style sheets.  This book is not a technical reference (and that is part of what is so good about it).  Finally the book uses a case study (many case studies) approach to look at sites and why design and redesign decisions where made to meet the needs of the user.  The template approach used to analyze each case study makes comparing cases easy and shows you how to identify key factors in site design and redesign.<br />This is a great resource for business owners, managers and non-technical users to use to make sure their site really addresses the needs of their users and perhaps helps them figure out who their users really are and what they want to do.  I highly recommended this book.nical reference (and that is part of what is so good about it).

Be ready to do some deep thinking though.  This book will make you consider the metal modals that you use to measure success and failure.<br />In the light of the dot com meltdown this book seems very timely.  Companies with no operating history or sustainable operating model were called success and become the companies to emulate.  Most of the dot coms are gone now and WorldCom and Enron are known to be what they are it seems very timely to look at success and failure.<br />Reading this book also makes you look at your life in a different way when reviewing past events.  As you review your personal history you may find that what you thought to be a big failure was in fact the thing that led to recent success.<br />One of the key take a ways of this book for me was that was those I consider successful often view not trying as the opposite of success rather then failure.  For these folks the failures are the mile markers on the way to success.<br />This is a great book because it makes you look hard at success and failure and consider what they mean in you life.

As one might suspect there isn't a single factor that can be singled out, but rather a set of interrelated factors that help make Blue's Clues a success.<br />The author, Diane Tracy, does a great job in providing examples of Blue's clues team living out these success clues.  One intriguing thread to this book is the level of balance that the Blue's Clues team seems to have across all of these clues.<br />Here is the list of the eight blues clues for success:<br />1. Mobilize the energy in you organization by turning you mission into mantras<br />2. Know you customer<br />3. Stay connected to your customer through research<br />4. Be the master of, not the slave to, you technology<br />5. Create work processes that serve your customers and enable your people to do the best.<br />6. Brand your products or company<br />7. Provide leadership that meets the needs of people, so they can meet the needs of customers<br />8. Consciously manage your culture the way you manage every other aspect of your business<br />Blue's Clues for success includes exercises at a business level and personal level for each clue and how it can be applied.<br />At some level this book represents an interesting case study of how living out these clues can contribute to a vibrant business.  Equally interesting is that each business must search for the answers to these clues and they will be different for each business.  To be effective these clues must be answered with the specifics of your mission, business, customers, technology and processes.<br />I found the chapters on mission, research, technology and process to be extremely interesting.

It is a must read for anyone serious about business.  The authors define execution as follows \\"Execution is a systematic process of rigorously discussing the hows and whats, questioning, tenaciously following through and ensuring accountability.\\"<br />Execution provides a systematic framework for making sure strategy and execution go hand in hand to get results.  The authors describe the three core processes that make up execution as the people process, the strategy process, and the operations process.  Unless there is alignment in these processes there will not be effective execution.  The book goes into a great level of detail on each of these processes and Larry Bossidy provides some great examples of how these processes work at GE and Honeywell.<br />To prove their case the authors show a couple of very high profile execution success and failures.  In light of many high level business failures recently it seems clear that these companies did not have a culture of execution nor were their top executives involved in how the company actually ran.<br />The bottom line is that execution is a great book with great advice on getting things done and establishing accountability for results.

I was amazed that many of these innovations where thought of in a flash of inspiration, but took many, many years to be realized as products (Xerox, Polaroid and Barbie).  I was also reminded of the personal and financial hardship that many of the entrepreneurial innovators faced.  Many innovators had several (many) failures among the way to reaching their success.<br />The Big Idea also impresses the need to copyright, patent and trademark your creation so that you can reap the rewards from the creation.  There are also a couple of interesting examples of innovation within a corporate setting.<br />If you want to innovate you need the commitment and persistence to stay with it for the long term.  The Big Idea closes with the following lessons from innovators The Big Idea covers.<br />1. Think of things that never were and ask, \\"why Not\\" - innovations is doing what others don't see<br />2.

Books	5	10	13	N	N	Go Viral!	Unleashing the Ideavirus is an interesting read.  One of the main ideas about this book is that interruption based marketing (radio and TV spots that break the flow of music or a show) is getting less and less effective.  As an alternative viral marketing reaches your target audience based on the recommendation of others within your target audiences sphere of influence.  The author, Seth Godin, says market to people rather then at people.<br />One of the key take aways from this book is that target market selection (hive) and targeting the correct individuals (sneezers) within this group is of utmost importance.  This is because with viral marketing you are depending on people (sneezers) to spread your idea virus.  Another interesting concept is that hive selection should happen even before you consider what product or service you would offer the hive.  Most businesses consider what the can make or the service they can provide and then back into who might want such a product or service.<br />What are the elements that make up an ideavirus?  According to Seth Godin there are many variables that are essential to consider when constructing a virus.  Here is Seth's list of variables that make up a virus:<br />Sneezers - the people that you choose to spread your idea virus<br />Hive - the group you target with your idea virus<br />Velocity - how fast the idea spreads from one party to another<br />Vector - pattern of hive adoption (could be geographic or demographic)<br />Medium - the communication mechanism surrounding the idea virus (tv, web page...)<br />Smoothness - how easy it is for the user to spread this idea virus<br />Persistence - how long the idea sticks with a person before it stop influencing them<br />Amplifier - tool for getting ideavirus to a larger audience<br />Does all this ideavirus stuff work?  One of interesting things about this book is the author's choice of distribution.  He followed his own advice.  The original distribution of this book was as a free e-book to encourage the viral effect.<br />If you want to stop marketing at people and starting marketing to them this book is worth a read.

This book really covers all the non-technical aspects for building a low cost web site.  This book challenges you to do the basics such as focusing on the purpose of your site.  Next the book challenges you to look at audience selection information.  If you are willing to spend the time really doing these exercises they can yield excellent results.  As I walked through these exercises I realized that I had three completely separate audiences that I was attempting to serve with my site and found that I was not serving any group all that well.  From the insights I was able to gather from the book I was able to come up with a more effective mechanism for addressing the audiences of my web site.<br />The book does a nice job a cover the differences between B2C (Business to Consumer) and B2B (business to business).  Most of the section on B2C still applies to B2B sites because as the author points out the users of a B2B site are still individuals, but the B2B section addresses specific concerns of a business user.<br />The book really does cover all the bases when it comes to putting together a marketing plan to promote a site.  The author's approach is not based on gimmicks, but a solid and respectable (i.e., no SPAM) approach for building web site traffic.  The section on search engines is an extremely good primer for someone not familiar with the operation of search engines.<br />The bottom line is that promotion of a web site is a time consuming and recurring activity.  There needs to be an on going investment in time and effort to produce recurring promotional results.	2002-04-16

Built To Last studies some of the most successful (called the leading companies) and the following companies (non-leaders in an industry). The research for this book produced surprising results for the authors (and the reader). The authors found the there were at least twelve commonly held businesses beliefs that their research refuted. In essence these dearly held business beliefs were myths.<br />Here is a look at each of the twelve myths and a sound byte describing each:<br />1. It takes a great idea to start a company Few visionary companies started with a great idea. Many companies started without any specific ideas (HP and Sony) and others were outright failures (3M). In fact a great idea may lead to road of not being able to adapt.<br />2. Visionary companies require great and charismatic visionary leaders A charismatic leader in not required and, in fact, can be detrimental to a company's long-term prospects.<br />3. The most successful companies exist first and foremost to maximize profits Not true. Profit counts, but is usually not at the top of the list.<br />4. Visionary companies share a common subset of &quot;correct&quot; core values They all have core values, but each is unique to a company and it's culture.<br />5. The only constant is change The core values can and often do last more then 100 years.<br />6. Blue-chip companies play it safe They take significant bet the company risks.<br />7. Visionary companies are great places to work, for everyone These companies are only great places to work if you fit the vision and culture.<br />8. Highly successful companies make some of their best moves by brilliant and complex strategic planning. They actually try a bunch of stuff and keep what works.<br />9. Companies should hire outside CEOs to stimulate fundamental change Most have had their change agents come from within the system.<br />10. The most successful companies focus primarily on beating the competition. They focus on beating themselves.<br />11. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Decisions don't have to either or, but can be boths.<br />12. Companies become visionary primarily through &quot;vision statements&quot;. Vision is not a statement it is the way you do business.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone engaged in developing and running a business at any level.

Make Your Own Luck is really a feel good kind of book not based on heavily researched scientific fact.<br />The author reminds the reader of old platitudes and gives antidotal evidence support these platitudes.  Yet in the hustle and bustle of everyday life these reminders are welcome and help realign the compass guiding our lives.<br />The author reminds us the life is full of unexplained coincidences.  If we notice and engage (rather then ignore) these coincidences we can usually find opportunity knocking.  Make your own luck covers topics such as failure (required to succeed), rejection (required to succeed), finding a purpose in work and specialization (which can be a path to success).<br />The underlying tone is the golden rule.  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  The author adds the concept of the \\"web of life\\", which could be described as \\"what goes around comes around\\".<br />I would recommend Make Your Own Luck.  Although the concepts are tried and true they are still important to consider and pursue.  In a busy world we need to be reminded and make sure we are following our compass.	2002-03-13

The Columbia Encyclopedia defines Judo as in the following way: [Judo] depends for success upon the skills of using an opponent's own weight and strength against him, thus enabling a weak or light individual to overcome a physical superior opponent.<br />Judo Strategy does a good job of successfully applying judo techniques to a business setting. What are these techniques (I am glad you asked)? 8~)<br />Judo depends on a couple of main tenets that are listed below.<br />Movement<br />Balance<br />Leverage<br />Movement is broken down into a couple of techniques such as not inviting attack, define your competitive space and following through fast. Balance techniques include gripping opponents (co-opting competitors), avoid head on conflict and pushing when pulled (e.g., accepting a competitors coupons). Leverage techniques include using an opponents assets (installed base), partners and competitors.<br />The authors do a nice job of providing business examples of each of these judo disciplines. The examples include Real networks, Charles Schwab, Progressive, Cnet, eBay and others.<br />As an additional bonus the authors include a section for companies that are sumos in a category. Sumo techniques include unnerving the opponent, and locking up an opponent (e.g., outspending, cutting of channel options). There is a nice section on sumo and anti-trust (with Intel and Microsoft as examples).<br />This book is a fun read and extremely useful when consider how to deal with powerful competitors.	2002-02-25

What is a Value Net? According to the author a value net &quot;is a business design that uses digital supply chain concepts to achieve both superior customer satisfaction and company profitability&quot;. One of the main concepts of a value net is that it operates in parallel manner rather then a rigid sequential chain.<br />Value Nets have the following five main characteristics:<br />Customer-alignment<br />Collaborative and systemic<br />Agile and scalable<br />Fast flow<br />Digital<br />Value Nets builds on the work of The Profit Zone, which define five elements of a value-creating business design. These five elements are defined as follows:<br />Value proposition - a company's value proposition consists of products and services that add value to customers.<br />Scope - what activities are required to deliver the company's value proposition and who delivers them (internal or partner).<br />Profit capture - mechanisms that capture profit from the value proposition<br />Strategic control - elements that protect profits over time<br />Execution - operational excellence<br />Value Nets take the five characteristics of the value net and show case studies of how companies implemented value nets within the context of the five elements of business design listed above.<br />The models that this book lays out are quite useful for considering how a product or service is delivered. The case studies and example in this book are quite useful and cover several industries. Most of the examples relate to product companies, but the concepts can be applied to services companies as well.<br />This book is a interesting and useful read for business consider how to interact with partners, competitors, suppliers and customers in the digital age.

I would advise you that it is not a book for everyone though. Why do I say that? Beyond World Class challenges the reader to build a Beyond World Class organization and the path that Alan Ross suggests involves honesty, integrity and character (profit after that list). There are many useful concepts that can be gleaned from this book, but the cornerstone of this approach comes down to character.<br />One interesting aspect of this book is the author's personal perspective on decisions that he made to protect and strengthen his integrity. The decisions were incredibly difficult and the future of the company hung in the balance. Each time the author followed through with integrity he was rewarded and in retrospect making the easy decision (not exercising integrity) would have been disastrous.<br />Beyond World Class is about integrity in relationships with employees, suppliers (partners) distributors, and customers. This book goes further then many that talk about building relationships with customers. Beyond World Class shows that employees, suppliers, and distributors each have a significant hand in the ultimate satisfaction of customers. Beyond World Class highlights that beyond world class organization understand the value leading to the customer involves employees, suppliers, distributors and ultimately the customer themselves.<br />Beyond World Class emphasis that customer selection is an essential piece of building a beyond world-class organization. Customer selection goes beyond targeting a customer segment to selecting customers that align with your company's vision, offering, and margin guidelines. In essence you partner with your customers. Part of this partnering is seeking to find solutions to customer problems and continually increase your value to your customer. These concepts in this section alone make the book worth the price!<br />Beyond World Class challenges you to build the following character culture with the following characteristics:<br />Humility Sponsoring champions Integrity and modeling Fairness and caring<br />Are you up to the challenge of being Beyond World Class?ollowing character culture with the following characteristics:<br />Humility Sponsoring champions Integrity and modeling Fairness and caring <br />Are you up to the challenge of being Beyond World Class?	2002-02-25

I had always pictured Edison as the lone inventor. Nothing could be further from the truth. This book proved many of my ideas about Edison were simply myths. On the other had this book also expanded my view about the truly amazing accomplishments of Thomas Edison (he started over 100 companies include GE and had over 1,000 patents).<br />As the book quickly points out Edison was one of the first practitioners in the war for talent. Edison's lab was the first innovation factory and in many ways a precursor to Silicon Valley. The lab had no rules (pet bear, pipe organ, and pranks) and was a true meritocracy. Edison's lab had a basic apprenticeship program and Edition worked with many, many people on the innovation teams that worked on projects. The electric light bulb team was over 75 people.<br />The book also cast a complementary light on Edison as a businessman. The innovations of the labs lead to the founding of over 100 companies. The labs innovations lead to a virtuous cycle of products, systems, and industries. This led to more innovation and more businesses. Edison was not Rockefeller nor did he want to be he wanted his business to continue to provide funding for invention. Edison was adept at capturing and using venture capital.<br />Edison was also quite adept at marketing. At a time before self-promotion was recognized or well understood Edison was adept at it. Edison's ability to market himself and his ideas lead to better funding, recognition, and a reputation, which allowed him to invent even more.<br />This is a great book. Edison was one of the greatest Americans to have ever lived.	2002-02-25

The Agenda covers a wide range of topics, but has three main focuses:<br />Become customer focused and know your customer<br />Define, measure, and improve your processes<br />Processes must extend beyond corporate boundaries to encompass your complete value chain<br />These three main focuses are expanded and covered in the following nine points<br />1.

The Agenda offers a no nonsense view as to what businesses must do to thrive in this decade. The Agenda has a chapter that covers how to begin the extensive changes required to execute on Hammer's agenda and make it your own.

The author, Hassan M. Fattah, has a very readable writing style. In short the book is a great peer-to-peer primer for business executives and business technologist. I highly recommend this book.<br />This book is very up to date with the latest information about P2P (i.e., HailStorm and Jxta). The book is geared at a business reader, but it cover the salient technical aspects of how peep to peer works. P2P covers some of the biggest uses of P2P technology. P2P covers the biggest uses of P2P technology in the form of peer-to-peer collaboration, applications-interaction systems, resource utilization, and supercomputing applications.<br />P2P introduces Napster and does mention Napster occasionally, but refreshingly the book does not center on Napster. P2P provides many real world examples of P2P in action. The business reader will find that many of the examples are being deployed in businesses to solve business problems. For example, a large law firm, Intel, CareScience and several other businesses are covered as P2P success stories. P2P does a great job of separating hype from reality (application operating today) and addressing the shortcomings and concerns facing P2P.<br />P2P does not argue for P2P for the sake of the technology, but as a solution to a specific business problem. Before I read this book I really did not consider P2P a viable business technology. After I read this book I realized the P2P can be a good match to some business problems and should be considered when searching for a solution.	2002-02-25

This book is the precursor to Value Nets, but is still a great read. The book starts out by getting you focused on your customer, but quickly switches gears to ensuring that you are capturing profit for the value that you are providing. If your industry is changing quickly and margins are falling this book is well worth a read!<br />One of the most useful sections of this book is the one covering different profit models. The book covers 22 different profit models. For example, Product Pyramid Profit, which is basically having products tailored to customers desires that cover customer income and preferences. An example of this would be GM, which sells cars, but varies features and prices (Chevy to Cadillac) to cover a range of customer incomes.<br />One of the revelations of this book is that many of these profit models may have a five to seven year life (or shorter). Having a range of profit models allows the reader to see how to apply several profit models or understand transitions from profit model to another.<br />The Profit Zone is basically broken in three sections:<br />The first lays out the importance of the customer and the component that make up a business model. See Value Net review for more details, but basically value proposition, scope, profit capture and strategic control.<br />The second section is extremely useful in that is shows business that have due to changes in their industry or customers have had to recreate their profit model. Companies such as GE, Microsoft, Charles Schwab as well as others are used as case studies in business design reinvention.<br />The third section is a toolkit for apply &quot;profit zone&quot; thinking to your business.<br />The Profit Zone does a great job in highlighting that business is always changing and the areas where you can make money and sustain high profits are changing with it.

Felicia Zimmer explores ways to reinvent work.  There are five basic \\"patterns\\" for recreating work they are as follows:<br />Reinvigorate your job<br />Change Jobs within your company<br />Enhance your business' offerings or approach<br />Transition your business<br />Start a new business within your company<br />One of the neat concepts in Reinvent Your Work is there in fact multiple ways to accomplish a reinvention (the list above).  Another neat concept is that a reinvention can be at a corporate level rather then just a personal reinvention.<br />Some other books on reinvention \\"activities\\" make your take personality tests and other self diagnosing activities.  The end result is a self diagnosis without necessarily insight into how to reinvent or how to get to your reinvention.  Reinvent Your Work also profiles individuals and how they went through the reinvention process, which was quite insightful.<br />I think that Reinventing Your Work takes an extremely pragmatic approach to helping you unearth your reinvention, define how to get it done, keep it on track and monitor when it is time for the next reinvention.  Reinvent Your Work is not a one size fits all approach to reinvention.<br />If you pick this book up (and you should) be ready to do some serious thinking about who you are, what you really want and defining a path to get there.	2002-02-22

If you want to know more about Tony Robbins thoughts and techniques Notes From A Friend gives many of his popular ideas in a very compact format. If you are one of those people that likes a book that challenges you, asks you to exercises and change they way you think this is the book for you.<br />I found the book quite useful from a couple of different perspectives. Some of the changes that Notes From A Friend suggests are really small distinctions, but taken together they can have significant impact. One of the examples from Notes From A Friend are the questions that you ask yourself. Notes From A Friend suggest asking questions that lead to the solution of a problem rather then victim questions such as why did this happen to me. Another distinction is how we view failures. Failures will occur if we try anything useful. It is really our reaction to these failures and what we learn from them that matters.<br />Not content to Notes From A Friend just be an intriguing read Robbins challenges the reader with a ten day program that is a powerful application of the essence of the book.

Even after the time of the great ecommerce collapse of 2000 and the current economic conditions business will be conducted more and more over the Internet. In fact many companies are looking at the abilities of the Internet to improve their efficiency and control cost during these tough times.<br />Understanding B2B starts with an extremely useful primer on the roots on electronic commerce. This is useful because as Understanding B2B suggests there are huge investments in EDI (Electronic Document Interchange) standards. Large companies and financial instructions have been using EDI for years. EDI will continue to grow into the near future due to the large investment that corporations have made and the momentum that is creates. UnderStanding B2B also looks at the supply chain and logistics that have made ecommerce so important to businesses. The book aslo offers a practical look at some of the landscape surrounding ecommerce such as out sourcing, security, ecommerce and the law.<br />The book also looks into the future to see where ecommerce is heading. The future is heavily based on the standards that are developing around XML. The books points out that the web craze of the late 90's was really a user visiting a site and doing transactions on that site. This is person to application (P2A). XML is enabling application to application (A2A) that will allow automation of supply chains and logistics to middle market companies (rather then Global 1000 companies and their biggest suppliers).

It has practical advice from interviews with 30 company presidents and CEOs on how to become a better leader. What makes the book different is that these leaders were selected because of their commitment to people and profits (in that order). These leaders where drawn from the Fortune list of The 100 best companies to work for as well the authors personal contacts.  Another factor that I found appealing about the book was the broad group of executives that were drawn on with significant difference in lines of business, industries, and company size.<br />The book is written in a very approachable manner. Some leadership books are exciting and inspirational, but don't really provide any steps for becoming a leader. This book is exciting and inspirational because it provides practical steps for becoming a better leader. It addresses both personal and business culture related topics that are necessary to define a true leader.<br />The book defines a true leader as having the following traits:<br />Social - Lover of people and the desire to build others<br />Utilitarian - Value money and the return on investment<br />Individualistic - Desire to control one's destiny and influence the destiny of others.<br />Traditional - Strong belief system of doing the right thing.<br />The book is not a instant recipe for success, but rather a guide through a series of practical steps to improving leadership. I found it to be a useful exercise to take the chapters in the book and modify then slightly to form a rough leadership checklist. Here is that list:<br />o Passion is a Prerequisite<br />o See what is not yet visible<br />o Care enough to connect and convey<br />o Treating learning like dirty dishes<br />o Do what's right and tell the truth<br />o Trust is a must<br />o Recognize and build people<br />o Trust your intuition<br />o Risk to respond and grow<br />o Respect the importance of balance<br />Leadership styles and fads come and go.

He argues that for innovation to occur there must be some amount of inefficiency. He calls this efficiency slack. Slack would include time think of the big picture, consider the future, theorize, and explore.<br />This books one weakness for some readers might be the lack of empirical evidence to support these theories. I would argue if the book is approached with an open mind the contrarian viewpoints have considerable logical merit.  Even without empirical evidence the author's views are convincing.<br />The chapter on project risk management is an added bonus and it alone makes the book worth reading.

The authors (Bain consultants) argue that embracing non core businesses is probably trouble. Drawing on a huge multi-year study and Bain database the authors show that growing companies with unfocused acquisitions in non core businesses are typically under performers. The book shows several examples of how Bain purchased under performing companies (divisions) from conglomerates and by investing and focusing on their core business ignited explosive growth.<br />You might be asking how then does a business grow. The authors would say first by defining the core business. What business are we really in and good at. Once the core business has been defined and focused on growth opportunities come from opportunities adjacent to the core business. A few example adjacencies could be new customer segments, new channels, new geographies, new value chain steps (forward, backward...), new business, and new products.<br />If you are trying to define a sustainable growth strategy then this book is worth the read. If you have many non core business that are under performing then this book is worth the read.

From a business managers perspective it highlights a growing trend that the attention of employees in under attack. It raises the challenge for crisp clear and meaningful communication. It also challenges managers to not overload the communication channels with unrelated, unfocused and disconnected communication. Once again Jack Welch is used as an example of a simple message (i.e.,number one or number two) delivered over multiple channels with enough repetition to get on the workers attention channel.<br />The authors provide an extremely useful tool named AttentionScape that measures where attention is being directed. It could be used to find were management, employee, customer and supplier attention is being focused. The book provides several examples of companies using (or ignoring to their determent) the AttentionScape information. The ideas the AttentionScape tool bring to fore make it worth the price of the book!<br />As a knowledge worker the book highlights the importance of realizing attention is a key resource in completing any task and as such it should be protected and leveraged to get important task complete.
