While it may not be indispensable, it is a truly valuable resource for ministers and lay leaders in smaller congregations. <br />  <br /> David Ray clearly loves smaller churches. This is not one of those books that try to turn smaller churches into larger churches, or to use one of Ray's analogies, to &quot;try to turn a Volkswagen into a Winnebago.&quot; Instead, this book will help make smaller churches into better churches regardless of size. <br />  <br /> In the first three chapters, Ray lays a solid foundation for the rest of the book. First, he provides thumbnail sketches of 20 smaller congregations. These churches serve as examples throughout the rest of the book. Second, Ray outlines his theological perspective. In general, Ray is a moderate-to-liberal Christian. As it applies to smaller churches, he emphasizes concepts of Christian community and the immanence of God. Third, Ray surveys and critiques several theoretical perspectives that inform the study of smaller churches. Ray's own theoretical contribution is a list of 30 characteristics common to smaller churches. <br />  <br /> The middle four chapters focus on what Ray sees as the four key tasks of a church: worship, education, caring, and mission. Ray provides both general principles and concrete suggestions for small churches to improve in each of these areas. He also references his own experience and the experiences of smaller congregations described earlier. <br />  <br /> The final four chapters focus on some special concerns of smaller churches: morale, growth, finances, and leadership. Ray considers morale to be the most important factor influencing the success of smaller churches. Growth is seen as an outgrowth of a healthy church, rather than an end in itself, and Ray provides some suggestions for healthy church growth. In tackling the difficult issue of affording to be a small church, Ray provides solid advice and a multitude of alternatives. Finally, Ray considers several alternatives for leadership: full time ministers, part time ministers, bivocational ministers, lay pastors, and lay teams. <br />  <br /> Overall, I found the writing style to be lively, even inspirational. Ray writes with the conviction of someone who has been successful as a small church pastor and who has loved nearly every minute of it. Yet, for all its inspirational character, this is still a highly practical book. It is filled with processes, resources, and concrete suggestions just waiting to be discussed and implemented by smaller congregations. If you help lead a small congregation, as clergy or layperson, I highly recommend The Indispensable Guide for Smaller Churches. <br />  <br /> Ray is currently the pastor of First Congregational Church in San Rafael, CA and has over thirty years of experience with smaller churches. He has written several books on the subject: Small Churches Are the Right Size (1982), The Big Small Church Book (1992), and Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches (2000). Some material from the previous books is repeated or expanded upon here.	2004-07-23

His previous works on the subject include The Small Church is Different! (1982) and The Small Membership Church: Scenarios for Tomorrow (1994).  Schaller bills himself as &quot;the country's leading interpreter of congregational systems and their vitality,&quot; and I see no grounds to quibble with that claim.  He also pastored three small churches in the 1950s.<br />Schaller acknowledges, &quot;Small Protestant church averaging two to three dozen people at worship should be affirmed as a legitimate order of God's creation.&quot;  Still, he offers many suggestions for radically restructuring these small churches.  Most of these suggestions are accommodations to the &quot;new consumer-driven American culture.&quot;  <br />My main critique of Schaller is that he abandons the idea of a countercultural church.  Instead of placing the countercultural teachings of Jesus at the center of his faith, Schaller embraces the faith of consumerism.  He just assumes that the faith of Jesus and American consumer culture are compatible.<br />Schaller likes technological solutions.  He is particularly enthusiastic about small congregations buying/renting videotaped sermons instead of calling resident preachers.  Schaller sees this as a way for cash-strapped congregations to get great preaching.  He does not think it necessary for a minister to know the congregation in order to produce a high-quality sermon.<br />Schaller is also enthusiastic about McChurches (my term, not his).  He envisions a large central congregation with many satellite sites of small congregations.  These would operate under a single brand name with a single staff and governing board.  Schaller sees this as a parallel to the modern central bank with numerous branches in area supermarkets.<br />Schaller has many other ideas, but he seems most excited about these two.  These ideas and Schaller's experience maymake Small Congregation, Big Potential a book worth considering.  If you agree with Schaller, that lessons from America's consumer culture show the future path for the small church, then you should probably buy his book.  However, if you are like me and don't buy Schaller's assumption, I would hesitate before buying his book.	2004-07-08

He strives to integrate neuroscience, ritual studies, and pastoral theology in a 200-page text.<br />The first half of the text outlines the roles of imagination, memory, and story in the human brain and human living.  The second half of the text then expands upon these concepts and applies them to ritual leadership, pastoral counseling, and spiritual disciplines.<br />I found Hogue to be moderately successful in his goal.  In particular, the scientific material on the brain was not always well integrated into the text as a whole.  It was as if Hogue had two starting points, ministry and neuroscience.  While he tried to make the two meet in the middle, Hogue didn't quite make it.<br />The connections between ritual and pastoral care were much stronger (Hogue's own area of expertise is pastoral theology).  This work, alone, makes the book worth reading.<br />Overall, I did find many sections of the book to be enlightening.  Hogue helped spark some new directions for my own thinking.  It just wasn't the well-integrated whole I had hoped for.  If you are interested in narrative theology, liturgy, or pastoral care, this is a book worth reading.	2004-06-16

Unlike some other self-care books, Linn doesn't propose a bunch of specific practices to care for yourself.  Instead, he encourages some basic attitudes and leadership styles that support both good self-care and effective ministry.<br />The 22 keys are not Earth-shakingly new.  In fact, I've heard or read all of them before.  Instead, Linn takes some deceptively simple points (e.g. &quot;don't pretend to know more than you do&quot; and &quot;know the difference between pointing and pushing&quot;) and brings them to life.  Nearly all of the chapters include personal stories from Linn's own ministry, both successes and failures.<br />Linn's presentation has helped engrain his basic points deep into my very being so that my practice of ministry is naturally enriched.  If you could use an occasional reminder about what is truly important in ministry, then 22 Keys belongs on your shelf.<br />Jan G. Linn is co-pastor of Spirit of Joy Christian Church in Apple Valley, Minnesota.	2004-06-16

The other two are Treasury of Religous Quotations (Tomlinson) and The Routledge Dictionary of Religious and Spiritual Quotations (Parrinder).<br />Lorie is a writer/publisher with a special interest in New Age topics.  He spent two years in a Tibetan monestary.  Mascetti was educated in Switzerland, is fluent in five languages, and spends a month each year at an Indian ashram.  As you might expect, their collection has a greater emphasis on Asian religious traditions and New Age topics than my other two quote books.  European religious traditions are not ignored, but they are not the overpowering influence found in the other books.<br />The 2000+ quotations in this collection are arranged under 43 topics.  Within each topic, the quotations are arranged chronologically.  The length of each quote varies greatly (more than my other collections).  At the extremes, Geoffrey Chaucer's quote under &quot;Love&quot; is only three words while Pierre Tielhard de Chardin gets a whole page on &quot;World.&quot;  Sources popular with the New Age movement (or just the editors' favorites--it's hard to tell) tend to have longer quotes.<br />An appendix provides brief biographies for all 500+ people cited.  These range from a phrase to a paragraph in length, again apparently determined by the editors' interest in the person.  I found the key-phrase index to be nearly useless, as each phrase is listed by the first word rather than a significant word, e.g. &quot;As lightning on a Landscape&quot; (Dickinson) is alphabetized under &quot;A.&quot;  The name index is more helpful.<br />The sources most frequently cited (other than scriptures or founders of world religions) are: St. Augustine, Francis Bacon, Albert Camus, Carlos Castaneda, Da Free John (Adido), Ralph Waldo Emerson, Kahlil Gibran, Hakim Abu' L-Majd Majdud Sanai of Ghazna, Jalal al-Din Rumi, Nikos Kazantzakis, Hazrat Inayat Khan, Juddhu Krishnamurti, Uppalura Gopala Krisnamurti, D. H. Lawrence, Michel Eyquem Montaigne, Mr. Tut-Tut, Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh), William Shakespeare, The Shivapuri Baba, Virgil (Publius Virgilius Maro), Alan Watts, and Yogaswami.<br />Several editions of this book have been issued by different publishers, so do a quick search to find the best price and/or condition.	2004-05-14

The other two are The Quotable Spirit (Lorie &amp; Mascetti) and The Routledge Dictionary of Religious and Spiritual Quotations (Parrinder).<br />Tomlinson is a writer and editor who has produced books of quotations on several other subjects.  This book was especially attractive to me because Tomlinson is a Unitarian Universalist (also my denomination).<br />The 2000+ quotes are grouped into 149 topics listed alphabetically.  Within each topic, quotations are further separated by religious or philosophical tradition.  So if I want a Buddhist or Moslem perspective about something, it is easy to find.  Conversely, if you want only Christian quotes, you can easily ignore the other subjects.  Tomlinson uses 30 different religious/philosophical classifications, and each topic has quotes from Christianity and 1 to 8 other traditions.  Some of the classifications are quite rare; for example, only quotes from Albert Einstein are given the label &quot;Cosmic.&quot;<br />Christian quotations make up a significant portion of the book.  Also, the King James translations of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) are used instead of Jewish translations.  Tomlinson categorizes these as &quot;Christianity/Judaism&quot; and places them next to the Christian quotations instead of using &quot;Judaism/Christianity&quot; and placing them next to the Jewish quotations.  Native American traditions are virtually ignored, with only one Leni-Lenapi and two Navajo quotes.  Other major and minor traditions fall between these extremes.<br />Several appendices provide additional information.  There are &quot;thumbnail&quot; biographies (2-4 lines) of the 170 people who are cited more than twice and a paragraph on each of the 30 religious/philosophical classifications.  Full bibliographic information is provided for the 250 sources used to compile the collection.  An author/title index is also included.<br />The sources most frequently cited (other than scriptures or founders of world religions) are: Henry Ward Beecher, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Buber, George Buttrick, G. K. Chesterton, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Harry Emerson Fosdick, Abraham Johsua Heschel, William Ralph Inge, Rufus M. Jones, Hans Kung, Maimonides, Thomas Merton, Reinhold Niebuhr, Blaise Pascal, Franz Rosenzweig, Jean Jacques Rousseau, William Shakespeare, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Thomas a Kempis, and Paul Tillich.	2004-05-14

The other two are The Quotable Spirit (Lorie &amp; Mascetti) and Treasury of Religious Quotations (Tomlinson).<br />Parrinder is Emeritus Professor of the Comparative Study of Religions at the University of London.  His book is the most scholarly and philosophical of the three.  Many of the quotations seem to be chosen to illustrate theological positions rather than for any power to inspire.  The book also has a greater emphasis on British sources than the other two.<br />The 3000 quotes are grouped under 177 topics.  Unlike other sources which order topics alphabetically, Parrinder divides the 177 topics into 18 thematic chapters.  A subject index is included for the more alphabetically inclined.  However, variants of the same term (e.g. agnostic, agnosticism, and agnostics) are indexed separately.  An author index is also included.<br />Parrinder's Christian orientation shows both in the selection of topics and in the selection of quotations.  Nearly every topic starts with a quote from the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and a quote from the New Testament (usually using the King James translation for both).  Some of these selections seem forced, as if Parrinder feels he must include two Bible quotes for each topic.  All other quotations are placed after the Bible quotes.<br />The sources most frequently cited (other than scriptures or founders of world religions) are: Aristotle, Augustine of Hippo, Francis Bacon, William Blake, Book of Common Prayer, Albert Camus, John Donne, Meister Eckhart, Mircea Eliade, R. W. Emerson, E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Samuel Johnson, C. G. Jung, John Milton, Blaise Pascal, Plato, John Ruskin, William Shakespeare, Alfred Tennyson, Charlotte Vaudeville (on Kabir), and William Wordsworth.<br />An earlier edition of the book was published as A Dictionary of Religious &amp; Spiritual Quotations.	2004-05-14

It is divided into 12 monthly chapters each with 31 single-page readings, so it could easily be used as a daily devotional.<br />Each chapter is devoted to a different religious tradition: Hinduism, Buddhism, Zen, Taoism, Native American Religion, Traditional African Religion, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Early Christianity, Christian Mysticism, Islam, and Sufism &amp; Sikhism.  The chapters each begin with three pages summarizing the origins, teachings, and distinctive features of the faith and a fourth page suggesting how to apply its insights to your daily life.<br />This collection is set apart from other world religions anthologies by the beauty of its design.  The book is printed on glossy, full-color stock.  Each monthly chapter has a distinct border design.  The only flaw is that the print is rather small and would be difficult for someone with poor eyesight to read.  Still, the book would make a handsome gift for anyone interested in world religions.<br />While the book is beautiful and contains a nice variety of readings, it is not a very useful tool for scholars.  Most of the pieces are abridged and occasionally paraphrased from the original, but these adaptations are not specifically noted.  Sources are indicated by author and book, but more specific information like chapter and verse are omitted.<br />However, if inspiration is your goal, A World Religions Bible is a fine collection of inspiring words attractively presented.	2004-02-17

The book is light on theology and heavy on practical advice.  So, if you are looking for a serious theology of money, look elsewhere.  However, this short book does explain all the other financial topics that serious stewardship books leave out.<br />Some topics covered include the basics of church accounting, internal control, procedures for receiving and spending money, ways of raising money, and tax issues.  The information contained in this book could help prevent church conflicts, embezzlement scandals, and an unpleasant visit from the IRS.<br />The book is very well organized as each chapter is divided into many sections with informative headings.  Finding what you need to know is easy.<br />You may want a more extensive resource for the church office, but this book is short and cheap enough to get copies for all the key leaders (e.g. minister, office administrator, board president, treasurer, and finance committee chair).	2004-02-13

Retired Unitarian Universalist minister L. Annie Foerster gathers that wisdom in For Praying Out Loud.<br />About 20% of the book is devoted to several chapters that offer guidance for composing prayers for interfaith settings.  The remainder of the book is a collection of prayers divided into five themes: unity &amp; diversity, peace &amp; justice, healing &amp; remembrance, gratitude &amp; praise, and dedications &amp; ordinations.  Most, but not all, of these prayers were written by Unitarian Universalist ministers.<br />The first part of the book is designed to help people write well-constructed, meaningful, even poetic prayer that are accessible to people of a variety of religious traditions.  Even though inclusiveness is the goal, Foerster reminds us not to just &quot;reduce our individual traditions and writings to bland pap in order to make them more inclusive.&quot;  Frequent references are made to examples from the second part of the book.<br />The sample prayers come from a variety of settings: an interfaith Thanksgiving service, racial justice gatherings, interfaith organization meetings, invocations for governmental bodies, veteran's memorials, peace gatherings, Coming Out Day programs, hospital services, and civic organization invocations.<br />Some of my favorites include &quot;A Litany of Faith and Hope,&quot; co-authored by Muslims and Unitarian Universalists; &quot;Prayer After a Riot,&quot; during the riots after the police accused of beating Rodney King were acquitted; &quot;For Those Who Are Wounded or Fearful,&quot; for patients on a locked mental health unit; and &quot;May Love Hallow Every Home,&quot; a benediction for an affordable housing site.<br />For Praying Out Loud is a valuable source of guidance and inspiration for any minister or laypeople called upon to lead prayer in an interfaith setting.  Even people who don't regularly lead public prayer may find their religious vocabulary expanded by reading For Praying Out Loud.	2004-02-11

That all the authors are Southern Baptist does not limit the utility of this book.  As a ministry student in a far more liberal denomination, I have found the material equally applicable to my own situation.<br />Topics covered include selecting a site and supervisor, designing a learning covenant, working with lay committees, getting the most out of your supervisory conferences, and more.  The material is well organized and well written.  You can easily skim to find the information you need, but you'll eventually want to read the entire book.<br />There are two limitations, however.  The book focuses on field education in church settings, so students pursuing field education in community ministry settings will find little directed specifically to them.  The book also focuses only on reasonably good internship experiences.  While it will help you avoid some typical pitfalls, major problems are beyond its scope.<br />If you are looking for a book that tells you nearly everything you ever wanted to know about field education (but were afraid to ask), look no further.  You've found it.	2004-02-05

Although I often avoid festschrifts, this project evolved into a worthwhile volume.  The book examines the topics of mutuality in marriage and family life and ways mutuality can be fostered through congregational life and ministry.  Four of the sixteen chapters are revisions or adaptations of earlier works.<br />Mutuality Matters brings together a wide range of perspectives on the subjects.  Experts in pastoral care, biblical studies, ethics, liturgy, religious education, theology, philosophy, and cultural anthropology all contribute chapters.  The breadth of these contributors insures that any reader will find some new perspectives and ideas from reading the book.  While each contributor writes from the depth of her or his own field of expertise, each piece is still widely accessible.<br />The chapter authors are Paul Wadell, Pauline Kleingeld, Don Browning, Carolyn Osiek, Herbert Anderson, Christine Neuger, Joel Anderson, K. Samuel Lee, Bonnie Miller-McLemore, Pamela Couture, Dianne Bergant, Anthony Gittens, Homer Ashby, Gilbert Ostdiek, Thomas Groome, and James Poling.<br />Any religious leader or scholar interested in marriages and families founded on mutuality will find Mutuality Matters a highly relevant resource.  Whether you are interested in theory or practice, this book has it all.  However, only heterosexual relationships are explicitly considered, although the editors explain, \\"Many claims...about just love pertain to all families, regardless of sexual orientation.\\"  Several chapter authors do consider ethnic and cultural differences.<br />My only complaint about this otherwise outstanding volume is the poor copyediting.  Typographical errors begin in the table of contents and continue throughout the book.  Another glaring example of poor editing is that the introduction contains two very similar paragraph-length disclaimers aboutthe omission of homosexual relationships.  It seems like the book was rushed into production too quickly.	2004-01-13

While there are a fair number of Methodist-specific references (e.g. quotes from the Book of Discipline), as a non-Methodist, I still found this to be a valuable resource.<br />The book explores basic issues such as the needs of older adults and reasons ways congregations fail to understand and meet these needs.  It also provides a sample process for developing an older adult ministry and examples of effective ministries.  A useful list of resources and an extensive set of assessments and sample forms are also included.<br />While Gentzler does not explore subjects in great depth, the short, easy-to-read sections both enlighten and challenge.  Portions of the book could be used as discussion pieces with groups of congregants or among a large staff.<br />Whether you are seeking to develop an older adult ministry in your congregation or to improve an existing ministry, you will certainly find something useful in Designing and Older Adult Ministry.	2004-01-07

This book isn't just about &quot;how to get along with your church,&quot; which might seem to assume that ministers and congregations are naturally antagonistic.  The subtitle is much more informative.  This is a book that uses insights from cultural anthropology to help ministers be better leaders.<br />The central thesis is that ministers must develop &quot;cultural capital.&quot;  In order to lead, a minister must deeply understand her or his congregation--its traditions, values, informal structures, etc.  A minister must also be attentive to the slow process through which a community (i.e. the church) adopts a newcomer (i.e. the minister) into its fold.  Only through such cultural processes can a minister earn the capacity to lead.<br />Thompson describes leadership as a form of cultural change and provides advice for the conflicts such change can evoke.  He also helps a minister consider when it may be time to move on to a new church.<br />The text is rich combination of cultural analysis, insights from church leadership literature, and examples from both Biblical and contemporary sources.  The book is well-written and well-organized.<br />I would highly recommend this book to any minister or other religious professional.  Similar works include Lovett Weems' Church Leadership, Tex Sample's Ministry in an Oral Culture, and Richard Lischer's Open Secrets.  If you've enjoyed any of these books than you will certainly find How to Get Along With Your Church helpful, if not essential to your ministry.

Don't expect any deep theological reflections.<br />Collected here, you will find the prevailing wisdom about virtually every aspect of ministry.  While no subject is covered in any great depth, the breadth of the material in this short book is impressive.<br />Topics include: setting intial priorities, organizing your office, visiting, preaching, counseling, rites of passage, balancing your own family life, maintaining your spiritual life, church conflict, and getting support from colleagues.<br />Don't expect any &quot;Aha!&quot; moments.  I've read or heard elsewhere just about everything found in Surviving Your First Year as Pastor.  However, collecting all that advice in one place serves as a useful set of reminders.<br />While I doubt that this will be of enduring value throughout a ministry career, I am glad that I purchased the book.

Many other critiques of patriarchy don't go far enough for Everett because they don't go far enough in critiquing the monarchist power structure that underlies patriarchy.<br />After tracing the political, philosophical, theological, and liturgical reforms of the modern era, Everett applies his analysis to contemporary forms of Christian worship.  In the end, he imagines a radically restructured, egalitarian form of worship more consistent with the republic (rather than kingdom) of God.<br />Everett acknowledges in his discussion guide that the book &quot;raises many difficult and emotion-laden questions.&quot;  I think that whether or not you fully agree with his analysis and suggestions for reform, these questions are well worth considering.<br />Table of Contents:<BR>1.

Glenn Ludwig wants to help you build just such a strong youth ministry.  Ludwig is clearly no fan of prefab programs.  Instead, he calls for a careful, reflective approach.<br />From a strong theological grounding to major practical issues to an assortment of special topics, a lot is packed into this short (109 page) book.  Ludwig raises numerous issues to consider as you work out what is best for your situation.  Reading Ludwig is like having a chat with a trusted mentor.<br />While the book is getting a bit old (published in 1988), the information is still highly relevant.  I couldn't say that about other fadish treatments of youth ministry.  The book recently went out of print, so I would advise getting a used copy soon before others snatch them up.<br />As someone who worked as both a youth advisor and as a director of religious education, and who is currently preparing for ordained ministry, I can say that this has been the absolute best resource in my library for my own work with youth.<br />A summary of the contents:<br />Introduction<BR>1.

He describes and applies five theological models: correlational, contextual, narrative, performance, and regulative.  The way Scalise maps out the field of practical theology is similar to Mary Boys' Educating in Faith in the field of religious education and Richard Eslinger's A New Hearing and The Web of Preaching in the field of homiletics.  Despite its practical focus, the tone is quite scholarly (37 pages of notes for 165 pages of text).<br />Each model is examined on its own terms and then applied to a master case study of &quot;nontraditional families&quot; in the fictional Valleywood Presbyterian Church. The case study includes challenges the married co-ministers find in three families: a lesbian couple with two children, an unmarried cohabitating couple, and a woman with a non-Christian husband.  <br />Scalise is a professor of church history at Fuller Theological Seminary Northwest and describes himself as a &quot;card-carrying evangelical.&quot;  However, Scalise tries to maintain a neutral stance regarding the subjects of the case study.  &quot;Given the controversial nature&quot; of the subjects of his study, he writes, &quot;I want to emphasize my intention to avoid any appearance of advocacy.&quot;  Anyone searching for a single-minded defense of a conservative or liberal position will be disappointed.<br />The real strength of this book is Scalise's ability to summarize complex theological ideas.  If you want a quick comparison of Tillich, Lindbeck, and liberation theology, for example, Bridging the Gap is the book for you.  Also helpful were the applications of each theological model to real-world ministry issues of the case study.<br />However, I also found Bridging the Gap to be flawed in several respects.  In his attempts to avoid advocacy, Scalise seemed to favor a smoked-but-didn't-inhale sort of fence-sitting.  He clearlyadmires Stanley Grenz's &quot;welcoming but not affirming&quot; approach to homosexuality.  I would have greatly preferred that Scalise clearly explain how he would apply each theological model to the case study and then describe how others might apply the model differently.  Instead, I wonder how Scalise's analysis of the theological models might have been colored by his own (hidden) opinions.<br />There are other, less-serious problems.  Rather than the discussion of several authors found in other chapters, the chapter on narrative theology is dominated by the description of Teresa of Avila's appeal for evangelical women (a subject Scalise covered previously in a journal article).  The final chapter comparing models and describing a method for blending models is far too short, almost perfunctory.  Finally, the documentation is somewhat sloppy for such a scholarly work.  Without looking for them, I noticed at least one reference omitted from the bibliography and the reversal of one book's title and subtitle.<br />Overall, I would like to rate Bridging the Gap with 3.5 stars, but the rating system does not allow such fine distinctions.  I have a somewhat positive opinion of the book, but it is not as good as other works I have rated with 4 stars.  Bridging the Gap takes on an expansive subject and accomplishes its task reasonably well.<br />I expect some readers will have mixed reaction to the book as I did, and they would find the book helpful but not essential.  Readers who do not mind the flaws I identified might easily rate this book with 4 or 5 stars, and they should certainly read it.  Readers who are highly concerned by the flaws I have mentioned would probably rate this book with 1 or 2 stars, and they should probably skip it.	2003-10-03

The experiences of two pastors provide examples that run through the entire book.<br />Taylor begins by explaining his understanding of the goals of religious marriage preparation as well as the resources and skills pastors bring to the process.  On the subject of method, Taylor favors group courses with a multiple topic, skills-training approach.  Structured interviews, workbooks, premarital inventories, and combined approaches are also discussed.<br />Taylor explains common couple tasks, ways to teaching scripture pastorally, and preparing for the wedding itself in some depth.  However, the book is still an overview rather than a detailed program to follow.<br />One aspect of the book I found especially helpful was a discussion of written policies, both why churches and ministers should have them and suggested topics to include.  Another very useful part of the book was the appendix that reviews frequently-used workbooks (Grenz & Glover's The Marriage Journey and Hunt & Hunt's Preparing for Christian Marriage), inventories (FOCCUS, PAI, and PREPARE), and courses (Dyer & Dyer's Growing Together and Midgley & Midgley's Decision to Love).<br />Some sections of the book apply the metanoia model of pastoral care Taylor first described in The Skilled Pastor.  Reading this previous book can be helpful, but isn't necessary to understand Premarital Guidance.<br />As a ministry student who realized that my seminary training would leave me unprepared for doing premarital counseling, I am grateful to have Charles Taylor's Premarital Guidance.  I recommend it along with Stahmann & Hiebert's Premarital and Remarital Counseling and Anderson & Fite's Becoming Married to anyone in a similar situation.	2003-09-05

Stahmann and Hiebert have penned an incredibly comprehensive, yet accessible guide for both clergy and secular audiences.<br />The book begins with foundational issues such as reasons why people marry and beliefs couples tend to hold.  The goals of premarital and remarital counseling are also discussed.  Their brief introduction to the history of premarital counseling was interesting, though not especially helpful.  Throughout the book, the authors summarize relevant findings from a large number of researchers.<br />This handbook covers all of the practical issues as well, from fees and number of sessions to the actual content of each session.  Special emphasis is given to the couple's history together, exploring each family of origin and previous marriages (if any), and the use of premarital inventories.  Among inventories, Stahmann and Hiebert review PREPARE, FOCCUS, and the Taylor-Johnson Temperament Analysis.  PREPARE is used as the example for most of the book.<br />Several subjects are covered under \\"special topics.\\"  These include remarriage and stepparenting, specific marital skills, intimacy and sexuality, age-related factors, and problematic situations.  The authors also consider the use of group counseling, although most of the book is written for someone counseling one couple at a time.<br />As a ministry student who realized that my formal seminary training would leave me unprepared for doing premarital counseling, I am grateful to have Stahmann & Hiebert's Premarital and Remarital Counseling.  I recommend it along with Charles Taylor's Premarital Guidance and Anderson & Fite's Becoming Married to anyone in a similar situation.	2003-09-04

That much is obvious when Robert Dykstra spends half of the first chapter drawing on the work of child psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott.  You're probably wondering \\"child psychology and preaching?!?!\\"  I was surprised too.<br />The central theme of the book is, in Dykstra's words, \\"Interest in sermons is generated...less from any exaggerated rhetorical attempt on the part of the preacher to be amusing, provocative, or for that matter, even interesting, than from a much more private and preverbal or even infantile encounter with a biblical text in an environment that minimizes pressures for social and doctrinaire compliance.\\"  Thus, Dykstra believes that preachers should approach a text with the same freedom that a child approaches a newly found object.<br />Though his expository prose is sometimes cumbersome, the example sermons Dykstra includes are filled with life.  It did take me a few tries to get into the book rather than leaving it languishing on the shelf.  In the end, it was well worth the effort.  This book has given me some new angles from which to approach preaching.<br />Topical sermons are the norm in my religious tradition rather than sermons based on lectionary texts.  Dykstra has prompted me to consider how I might recover the freshness that can be found by confronting an assigned rather than selected text.  That a book can make me reconsider my own preaching style is high praise indeed.<br />I don't think this would be a good first book on preaching.  However, if you are looking to reexamine and revitalize your preaching, Discovering a Sermon is a good book to read.	2003-08-29

Newton Malony seeks to take religious leaders from &quot;the tyranny of the OR to the genius of the AND.&quot;  He explores eight paradoxes of religious organizations and religious leadership.  The table of contents gives a sense of the book's scope:<br />1. Religious leadership and paradox<BR>Part One: Paradoxes in the Religious Leader's Role<BR>2. Person and position: being true to oneself and to congregational expectations<BR>3. Prophet, priest, and king: playing three roles that become confounded<BR>Part Two: Paradoxes of Perspective<BR>4. Inclusivity and exclusivity: appreciating both uniqueness and universality in faith convictions<BR>5. Timely and timeless: applying the Bible's eternal truths to present circumstances<BR>Part Three: Paradoxes Built into the Structure of Religious Congregations<BR>6. For-profit and not-for-profit: balancing the books while serving a larger purpose<BR>7. Person and organization: running an efficient organization in which people feel deeply recognized<BR>Part Four: Paradoxes of Congregational Mission<BR>8. Product and process: valuing ends and means equally<BR>9. Mission and maintenance: moving the congregation toward achieving its goals while fostering goodwill and group cohesion<BR>10 Conclusion: Leading others to double vision<br />True to its paradoxical theme, this book defies easy categorization.  Part one focuses on the nature of ministry and ministers.  The chapter on &quot;timely and timeless&quot; takes up the subject of preaching, while the next chapter, &quot;for-profit and not-for-profit,&quot; moves on to financial issues.  Many of the book's subjects tend to be issues for church conflict, and chapter seven is partly about the process of church conflict.  You will not find a comprehensive treatment of any single subject in Living with Paradox, but I'm certain the book will spark some new ideas for reflection.<br />As someone who is preparing for ministry, I found the book veryhelpful.  I would easily recommend it to any minister or ministry student.  I also think Living with Paradox would be of interest to board members, committee chairs, or other lay leaders in a church.	2003-08-12

I especially liked two things in this part of the book: first, that Jones labeled chronic speed as a form of idolatry, and that he showed examples of what people are missing in their rush.  Although Jones takes a strong stance against so much hurrying, he does display a good deal of understanding (rather than condemnation) for people who are caught up in the rush.<br />The second half of the book describes a &quot;savoring pace alternative&quot; and offers numerous suggestions to help people slow down.  While many self-help books fall into shallow platitudes and slogans, Jones resists this tendancy.  Instead, he provides spritual food for the journey to a slower, saner life.<br />Kirk Byron Jones is a professor of social ethics and pastoral ministry at Andover Newton Theological School, and also has twenty years of experience as a pastor.  He offers a significant number of Biblical examples, so confirmed atheists may not like this book.  Anyone with a healthy respect for Christianity (whether they are Christian or not) should find it helpful.<br />The idea for this book grew out of Jones's writing of Rest in the Storm: Self-Care Strategies for Clergy.  I ordered Addicted to Hurry because I loved Rest in the Storm.  I thought Rest in the Storm was a bit better, and I would recommend clergy start there.  However, Addicted to Hurry is still a very good book for both clergy and general audiences.	2003-08-10

I found all of this material helpful in my own reflections about confirmation.<br />The one other chapter in part one was the real highlight of the book for me.  It is a 16-page transcript of a series of conversations between the books contributors (Gary Halstead, Brenda Kinder, Richard Kirchherr, William Myers, Timothy Nelson, and Richard Wolf).  The chance to be a fly on the wall as these experts discuss the insights and problems from their own experiences as confirmation leaders was priceless.<br />The second part of the book is a confirmation program based on the four core conditions the authors identified in part one: covenant, tradition, pilgrimage, and ministry.  This part did have some interesting ideas and helped flesh out what the authors meant by the four core conditions.  However, I found it rather lifeless.  The most important aspects of confirmation cannot be captured by descriptions of activities.<br />Whether you are looking for an understanding of the confirmation process or a sample confirmation program, you are sure to find something helpful in Becoming &amp; Belonging.  You may just find that the book also comes with some chapters you won't find especially helpful.	2003-07-17

The Pastor's Family is the story of how I was compelled to face this neglect and do something about it.\\"<br />It is immediately clear that this is not a dispassionate examination of the family life of ministers; it is the story and reflections of one minister told with deep-searching honesty.  Langford does not claim to be perfect or know everything, but he has learned from many of his mistakes.<br />In addition, Langford's wife and two children tell the stories of their experience in their own words.  Insights from psychology and scripture are also incorporated into the The Pastor's Family.<br />The following chapter headings give a sense of the book's scope:<br />1. \\"Where Is Dad?\\" \\"Where Is My Husband?\\"<br />2. The Experiences of Being a Pastor's Wife<br />3. Who is Going to Make the Coffee?<br />4. My PK's: Their Stories<br />5.

The result is sometimes depressing, sometimes uplifting, but always enlightening.<br />Langford has been a nursing home social worker, public school teacher, and pastor/church planter (Southern Baptist and later American Baptist).  Though his theological perspective is fairly different from my own, I am still giving the book five stars because it is simply outstanding.<br />One final note...the author does not attempt to generalize from his experience to families other than a male minister with a female spouse.  However, I suspect that female ministers, same-sex partners, and co-minister partners would find much useful in the book as well.rspective is fairly different from my own, I am still giving the book five stars because it is simply outstanding.<br />One final note...the author does not attempt to generalize from his experience to families other than a male minister with a female spouse.

The emphases in all four books are on embracing diversity, encouraging respectful dialogue, and facilitating deep-rooted transformation.<br />This book is divided into two sections.  The first section explores issues of diversity, organizational culture, and transformation processes.  The second section describes in detail Law's &quot;Process for Planned Change.&quot;  The book is filled with vivid examples and stories, deep theological reflection, and practical insight.<br />Although Law's primary concerns surround multicultural issues, the process can also be applied to any type of congregational transformation: declining membership, reaching a growth plateau, a congregation-wide long-range planning and renewal process, or any situation where the congregation seem &quot;stuck.&quot;<br />The process references material from Law's earlier three books, so it is helpful if you have them as well.  You should probably read at least one of Law's earlier books before moving on to Sacred Acts, Holy Change.  Wolf/Lamb focuses on multiculturalism and a process for Bible study.  Bush focuses on dialogue and incorporating liturgy into the dialogue process.  Inclusion introduces the concept of a &quot;grace margin&quot; between unchallenging safety and fearful conflict.<br />Law is an Episcopal priest and highly-regarded consultant on issues of multicultural leadership and organizational development.  His ideas have developed through his work with over 75 congregations.	2003-07-11

The authors explore many ethical dimensions of ministry as spiritual leadership.<br />The book begins by examining two fundamental questions: What is authentic spirituality?  And, is the \\"professional model\\" adequate for examining ministry?<br />They then move on to pastoral care, pastoral counseling, and spiritual direction--the differences between them and the ethical issues involved with providing spiritual guidance.<br />Although the entire book is very good, I think it really shines in chapter four.  Here they explore several ethical quandaries: when to tell people \\"this is not the right church for you,\\" dealing with noncongregants who come for assistance, dealing with spiritual practices from other religions and traditions, and dealing with the fine line between spiritual gifts and mental illness.<br />Chapter four also introduces the concept of \\"spiritual neglect\\" and examine several issues where pastors too often neglect to lead: family violence, spiritual growth, feminist spirituality, stewardship, and social justice.<br />The next chapter focuses on specialized and workplace ministries (for example, campus ministers, and hospital & military chaplains).  These ministers' ability to structurally impact their institutions (if they do not merely become agents of the institutions leadership) is highlighted. The authors also point out that these ministers are not always given the recognition they deserve as \\"real\\" ministers.<br />The connection between spirituality and workplace is also explored.  Ministers may be so wrapped-up in the culture of overwork and so accepting of their own long hours that they preach the virtue of \\"hard work\\" to people who are already overworked.  On the subject of workplace spirituality, the authors caution, \\"If spiritual practices are used to help people endure situations that should be transformed, the spritual practice is simply a coping technique in the service of harmony or productivity.\\"<br />The final subject of the book is spiritual abuse.  Other authors' discussions about the spiritual abuse of parishioners are examined.  Lebacqz and Driskill then provide their own \\"composite picture\\" and analysis.  The spiritual abuse of clergy is also examined.<br />Ethics and Spiritual Care does not provide hard-and-fast rules of \\"do this\\" and \\"don't do that,\\" though it does provide some guidelines.  Its real strength is the depth with which it explores a wide-range of ethical issues in ministry.<br />The book is well-written and easy to follow.  It is not some dense theological treatise where you have to wonder what the authors are trying to say.<br />In summary, I agree with the opinion of Richard Gula printed on the back cover--this book \\"should be required reading in ministry training and continuing education programs.\\"  I doubt any religious leader will be sorry they got this book.	2003-07-11

Pastors need to reach the children in the \\"real\\" sermon.<br />This book not only provided inspiration to preach to the kids, it also provided techniques, examples, and prompts to help me do it.  From basic ideas like kneeling down to their eye level when you greet them at the back of the church, to things you probably would overlook like scripture stories children often find offensive, this book has it all.  Even the most experienced pastor is likely to learn something new.<br />Some other features include:<BR>- Important events in a child's year to preach on<BR>- Organization and delivery techniques to catch children's attention<BR>- Childhood experiences well-suited to be sermon illustrations<BR>- Suggestions for using themes from popular children's stories<BR>- How to use props well<BR>- Designing effective children's bulletins<BR>- Ways parents can help children be more involved<br />The book is well-written, well-organized, and easy to read.  I skimmed it in a couple of hours and have refered back to it many, many times.	2003-05-30

There are some factual inaccuracies (the Universalist P.T. Barnum was not a founder of Tufts), and also a bit of a bias toward the humanist wing of modern UUism.<br />Try the Unitarian Universalist Pocket Guide or another introduction to Unitarian Universalism instead of or at least in addition to this book.	2003-05-13
