I picked up this book because I needed something to read on the Beach and the story was interesting because I am from the same place as Chris Paciello was from.  I never expected to enjoy the book as much as I did.  Michele McPhee left no stone unturned and kept me wanting more.  I remembered most of the stories that she relates and it was fun reading about the New York haunts that I myself, have been to.  I really recommend this book and hope Ms. McPhee writes another one.  It really is a shame though, that the &quot;rats&quot; who are involved in the same crimes that others own up to, are let off the hook so easily.	2002-07-16

But lately, she's been just throwing them out and they just aren't that good.  I couldn't bear reading this book for more then fifteen minutes at a time.  It was so repetitious and monotonous that I would fall asleep.  Why did we have to read about Sheila and Alan's grandparents and what did it have to do with her murder?  The victim herself, while she certainly did not deserve her fate, was not really that likable.  She seemed alittle self absorbed and turned her face to alot of bad things that Alan did. The book just went on and on with needless information.  It didn't leave you wanting more, this was the first book I actually couldn't wait to finish.  If you want to read a truly good true crime book, I recommend \\"Salt of the Earth\\" by Jack Olsen.	2002-06-17

What did that have to do with the story?  While I felt very bad that Sheila was brutally murdered, I think Ann Rule tried to make Sheila this poor helpless creature when infact, Sheila had lots of avenues to take if she really wanted to get away from Alan.

The question that everyone wants to know, but it's not likely to be answered is, \\"why?\\".  I think the book was interesting enough, but would have made for a better read if we knew more about the Golub family.  All we really find out is that they had a nice looking house on the outside and a pigsty on the inside.<br />I definately believe Robert Golub acted alone and didn't take the fall for his brother or his brother's friend(s).  I don't think anyone would be that self sacrificing.  I think Detective Wells' theory was the only one closet to the truth.  Robert Golub probably watched the beautiful teenager in her daily routine and then his sick mind took over.  I believe he made the phone to Kelly and pretended to be John Jay.  He might have led the young girl down the basement by telling her his brother was down there.<br />Another part of this horrible story that has me wondering, is why would the Golub's remain in that house?  The fact that a brutal murder took place in that house, would be enough to have me running out of the house with just the clothes on my back.  They claim they couldn't afford to move however, I can remember neighbors and Tinyes family members saying they would chip in and buy the house, tear it down and put a small park there.  I could be wrong, but I don't think I am.<br />I think there was so much more to the Golub family then a dirty home, I just wish it had been explored.	2002-04-16

There were times I couldn't keep my eyes open. Sheila Bellush was by all accounts, smart...so why did she stay with the bird faced Allen?(which Ann Rule continuously calls \\"handsome\\")... If that's not enough, she deals with him bringing home prostitutes both male and female(not to mention a few lovers in between). She finally has enough and leaves the man she fears, only to move on the same block with him? Then we are bored with the family tree....we have to go back to the childhoods of Allen and Sheila's parents. While the only interest lies with Allen's family, because his life with them, would mold him into the person he would become. Maybe it's because the victim herself wanted Ann Rule to write her story, but I feel Ms. Rule just threw in too much needless information. The real interest lies in the killer himself.  That would have been an interesting story...	2002-02-07

So why do they kill other women?  Brudos also likes to wear ladies undies and high heels which makes me wonder why his wife never thought there was more to her husband then just his headaches.  I'm not saying that all men who wear women's underwear are serial murderers but I don't understand how Darcie Brudos never followed up on her husbands weird habits.  For instance: locking his workshop door and refusing to let her in, telling her to call him from wherever before she could come home, disappearing at all hours, and finding a paperweight that in the shape of a woman's breast.  Is it me, or are some people really that naieve? Ann Rule is great at true crime writing and this story holds your interest, I think Jerry got off easy considering that those four women no longer have their lives and their families no longer have them.

Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo had (what appeared on the surface) it all. But underneath were two sick individuals who preyed on young women, sexually tortured them, and then killed them. When the police finally close in on them, suddenly Karla hides behind the \\"battered woman\\" syndrome and tells the police all she knows. How, without one bit of counseling did Karla miraculously change? She went from being petrified of Paul to going out and dating another man. It seems to me someone who was so afraid of a man that she watched him kill her sister and two other teens would hardly be able to go out dancing. Wasn't she afraid Paul would catch her and beat her up? If you ask me, Karla stayed with Paul because she was just as sick as he was. She loved him and would do anything for him, even if it meant kidnap and murder. The pity of it all is, Karla will eventually get out of jail and start a new life while three women are forever lost to their families.  They should both rot in hell.	2001-11-24

I didn't care the first time. While I definately think Karla was stripped of her identity, I don't believe for a minute that she couldn't stop the madness. She claimed in the very begining of her relationship that Paul hit her, so why didn't she leave? Are we supposed to believe that the minute she met Paul she was under his spell? I doubt it. And from the story it seems that she had plenty of avenues to go down if she really wanted to leave. The Fords seemed like a caring couple, why didn't she go to them? Even her co-worker was helpful so how could she claim she \\"couldn't\\" leave? I feel sorry for the Homolka family for the loss of their daughter, but if you ask me, a net should have been thrown over the Homolka and the Bernardo families, years ago.

The story is a sad one and my heart goes out to Bonnie Faye Todd who lost her beloved daughter to the man she considered her daughter's friend and protector.  Read the book, you won't be sorry.	2001-03-25

But it now seems that she has recanted her theory about Darlie being the murderer? I guess the dog, (who barked at strangers) not barking that night to wake her husband up, is not true. And no blood leading out of the house was not true, Darlie's strange behavior was not true either? How could someone write a book like that, and then go on to say she was misinformed by the police? Why would the police go after Darlie and not her husband? I guess people don't want to believe a mother could kill her child. As for the self inflicted wounds -- Jeffrey McDonald inflicted his own wounds. And why would a man break into a home and kill two small children and leave two adults alive? How did the killer leave? With all that blood why wasn't any found outside? I believe Darlie did it and her husband is not too far behind her in the lunacy department. Darlie is right where she belongs - ok - not yet -- she belongs in hell and it's waiting for her.<br />As for reading that the author's child was murdered over this book -- I find that hard to believe - Is it true?	2000-12-02

The book was not bad however, there is more to Jason Massey's dirty home and lazy mother, then I think was addressed. Yes, the author did mention sexual abuse.. but I think there was alot more to creating this monster...there are alot of people who were abused but don't kill people or have sex with dead animals. There are people that grew up in horrible conditions that never decapitated a young girl. The book could have been a better character study but all in all it wasn't bad.	2000-11-29

However, getting to the killer's confession took forever. It wasn't the writer's fault, the pathetic little killer was so annoying in his taunting of the police, that I just wanted to reach in the book and strangle Dunkle with my bare hands. <br />While I am not a police basher and I feel that the Belmont police did try to get Dunkle off the streets, I can't help but wonder why they didn't take the Davies family more serious, and why didn't they question Dunkle immediately when the Davies asked them to? It might have saved two other little boys and their families alot of pain. I also wonder if Dunkle would have been charged for those killings if it wasn't for the courage of C. Louis?  There are some killers who are truly sick, that have suffered great abuse at the hands of a family member(s). And while I don't condone what they have done, I can see what could have twisted their minds. With Dunkle, he was just pure evil and he knew what he was doing and he liked it.	2000-10-09

When played over and over, it just naturally seeps into the mind. So I decided to really listen and find out some facts. I watched a two hour MSNBC special and when it was over, I was more confused than when I started. Then I watched the 20/20, sappy interview Barbara Walters did with the Ramseys. It was ridiculous to say the least. Patsy Ramsey kept refering to her child as &quot;JonBenet Ramsey&quot; as if she were trying to distance herself further from the murder. <br /> Then last May, quite by accident, I came upon &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. The handsome Steve Thomas was sitting across from the robotic John Ramsey and the sedated Patsy. Mr. Thomas did not even blink while looking Patsy in the eye and telling her he thinks she killed her daughter. I know if it was me sitting across from someone accusing me of murdering my child, I would have jumped over the desk to get at him. Yet, the two of them just sat there defending their bizarre actions. By the time the interview was over you knew that Steve Thomas got to them. <br />I bought the book (the only book that I ever, or will ever read involving the case) and to say the book is riveting is an understatement! The corrupt City of Boulder is something out of a Stephen King novel and Steve Thomas is lucky to have gotten out. I doubt the Ramseys will ever confess but this is as close to the truth as we will ever get. Personally, I think the Ramseys should be on a deserted Island, with sharks circaling, and have OJ as their neighbor.	2000-08-14

One of the best true crime books ever written.  Helter Skelter tells the horrific story of the Tate/LaBianca murders.  In grim detail Bugliosi takes the reader on a journey to find and bring to justice lowlife maniacs who killed innocent people for no reason. &quot;The story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you&quot;, that's an understatement. I have seen Leslie Van Houten on &quot;Court TV&quot; looking like a librarian who stamps children's books and tells them to bring it back in two weeks.  Yet she is nothing more then an evil woman who viciously murdered two people.  You will get to know each one of the killers and be thankful you never get to meet them.  And of course, you will read about Sharon Tate and how she called for her mother before she fell to her death (truly heartbreaking).  Then there is the part that tells the twist of fate that had each &quot;Tate&quot; victim somewhere else if only.....	2000-07-27

So when I heard about this book I decided to read it.  I have seen in the past, Sharon Tate's mother and sister help  keep the animals that killed the lovely actress, her friends, and the  LaBianca's behind bars. The book makes you even sadder for these victims  because it shows the really human side of Ms. Tate not just the glamourous  side you've read about.  The creepiest part of the book, that will send  chills up your spine was - four months before the murders, a strange  looking character walked up to the house looking for someone, Ms. Tate and  her friend asked the creepy little fellow what he wanted.  That creepy  little man was Charles Manson.	2000-06-29

Charles Manson and his crew will always be the ultimate in evil.  The only time you will put  this book down is to sleep, that is, if you can.	2000-06-03

It is a shame that this woman left on a job assignment with a man who was supposed to be a professional and yet he was a nut.  It makes you  wonder about how you too could be a victim if you let a cable, tv  repairman, telephone repairman, etc. (simply because they are also doing a  job and should be trusted)come into your home.  Rathbun should have gotten  death.  To be able to live his life even though it is behind bars is too  good for such a piece of garbage, and shame on his brother for trying to  hide the truth just to protect his brother (who I think he knew all along  was capable of killing Linda).	2000-04-18

I read his book about the abduction of his son Adam and besides crying from start to finish, I could not put it down.  In &quot;No Mercy&quot; he comes out fighting and for all  of our sakes he continues to do so.  This book will haunt you especially  the first story.  I was so shaken by it that I could not get it out of my  mind for days.  One cannot believe the kind of sick people that are walking  around but lucky for us, John Walsh is right there behind them putting them  where they belong -Jail!	2000-04-13

Here she tells the story of a young woman who lost her mother while she was just alittle girl, who lived with an alcoholic father and had little money growing up. Anne Marie Fahey turned her sorrow into a productive and happy life filled with family and friends. She made one mistake though, she got involved with Thomas Capano. While the book gets a bit tedious at times, it is still interesting. One wonders how Deborah McIntyre could have been so dumb that she didn't realize Capano had other mistresses. Was she as innocent as she claims?	2000-03-23

What I mean by that is, she didn't just write about the killer and his pathetic life. She crisscrossed between the victims and the killer to show just how promising their lives were, and what they were doing before this sick and vicious killer ended it for them. I was in Florida when this was happening and I can remember being scared and wanting to go home. The Author doesn't sympathize with the killer but she does allow us to see how his upbringing could have contributed to his diseased mind. I don't like true crime for its blood and gore, I like true crime for showing people that the world has alot of evil in it, and we should not always take people at face value. I think true crime books (especially those against women) should be mandatory reading in high schools and colleges. It really changes the way you think about situations that you might not ever have given thought to.	2000-03-13

The chilling account of neighbors blocks away, who heard her screams will send chills up and down your spine.  It will also teach you to be wary of  everyone!  You will look at people (even your neighbors) with a different  eye.  I am not saying you will become a paranoid zombie but you will look  at things differently.  A well written book that will scare and enlighten  you at the same time.	2000-03-13

I often wonder what became of the killers, Chuck and Marlene.  One can only  imagine.  These two teenagers were definately evil and I can't imagine how  they could live with themselves.  The author should definately write  another book on how these two wound up.	1999-12-13
