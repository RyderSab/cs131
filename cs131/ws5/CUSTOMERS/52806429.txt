While balanced perspectives are available to those proficient enough to wade through the stormy seas of coverage, much of the reporting obsesses on the drawbacks and any failed efforts of the US military and its allies.  <br /> It is a very good thing that such myriad media did not exist in 1776.  In David McCullough's engaging rendering of America's birth, he exposes the many setbacks, missteps, defeats, desertions, and poorly planned or executed campaigns that plagued the nascent nation's ragged army. Had CNN existed in those days, a colonial version of Judy Woodruff could regularly regale viewers with leading statements such as \\"more and more of General Washington's supporters are growing disillusioned with his poor management and indeciveness.\\"   An 18th century Al Franken could have gone on Air America (a.k.a. Err America) and maligned the American military for declaring war on a sovereign country that posed it no threat.  And an equally vacuous, previous incarnation of Arianna Huffington would have had reason to have elite loyalists malign Washington and company on a reality-blurring blog had such technology been around during the Revolution. <br /> McCullough does document the miscalculations America's inexperienced military committed as well as list the many triumphs of the established and potent British forces.  He expounds upon the doubts many of Washington's contemporaries privately and sometimes publicly expressed.  Before the sober judgment of history could objectively evaluate the transfiguring legacy of Washington's accomplishments, the uncertainty of the present did give jusifiable cause to those who questioned his wisdom and strategy.   The eventual success of the ragtag colonial army-despite massive desertions-and the enduring American experiment prove the mastery of Washington's prowess and show why his name has become synonymous with greatness. The Father of his Country would not have earned his rightful place in history had he failed to remain steadfast when the going got tough or adroitly recovered from the inevitable mistakes that befall all battlefield planning. <br /> \\"1776\\" fleshes out a timeless story and shows that there were many difficulties and heartaches that preceded the ultimate victory.  It also serves as a good inspiration for the ongoing liberation of Iraq.  Had the clichs of \\"quagmire\\" and \\"another Vietnam\\" existed in the 1700's no doubt the ancestors of today's antiwar ilk would have routinely invoked them.  As this readable work clearly spells out, war is a messy proposition where the best laid plans can and do go astray, but setbacks can never excuse retreat.  A far stronger case could have been made for abandoning the mission in 1776 than modern day Iraq.  Years from now both will stand as American military victories, and the bumps along the road to success will be reduced to historic footnotes.  <br />	2005-10-13

The World War II detaining of many Japanese citizens and aliens is ubiquitously viewed as a national disgrace in America's primarily proud history.  To even hint that it was somehow acceptable seems like the rantings of a David Duke or a Louis Farrakhan.  <br /> Well along comes Michelle Malkin-an undeniably reasoned and erudite commentator-making such an allegation.  As the daughter of Filipino immigrants--who is proud of her lineage-charges of racism shrivel when hurled against her.  The conservative pundit is a passionate foe of multiculturalist separatism so diversity drivel is not her driving force. Instead she offers a copiously researched work that meticulously explores the situation, and her objective conclusion is that the internment was necessary.  <br />  <br />While open-minded readers will appreciate many of her points and admire the nonconfrontational way she makes her case, most will likely not share her conclusion.  One excellent facet of the book is that is exposes many myths about the internment.  Few people fully comprehend what actually happened. Many citizens of German and Italian descent were likewise interned during the war.  Initially the internment of the Japanese was strictly voluntary, and many willingly acquiesced for their own safety. Just as today more than a smattering of Muslims in America have been tepid in condemning Islamic terrorism, during World War II a substantial proportion of the Japanese in America openly backed Japan.  Sadly public schools rarely inform students today that the West Coast was repeatedly strafed by Japanese submarine fire prior to the detention, and quite a few American with Japanese ancestry were indeed convicted of espionage.  <br /> Additionally, while the internment centers are occasionally tarred as \\"concentration camps\\" today-and that term's definition is semantically correct-the phrase's common meaning is wholly inappropriate to the holding facilities within the United States.  Many residents were allowed to leave regularly for work or other purposes.  The camps provided restaurants, beauty parlors, club, and sports facilities, and treatment was uniformly equitable and amenable.  Reported abuses were investigated and legitimate breeches earned swift punishment.  Many patriotic residents informed authorities of seditious elements amongst the population and the traitors were removed-as much for the innocent people's safety as for national security. <br /> These abstruse facts are important to know but fail to convince that the internment was essential or proper.  The author alleges that J. Edgar Hoover, who remained resolutely opposed to the round-up throughout its duration, was never informed of some secret damnable intercepts that prompted FDR and his other advisors to take the steps they did. That claim is difficult to believe.  Would the president of the United States have really kept from the FBI Director information so pertinent to national security? It would be the same as George W. Bush withholding intelligence about Al-Queda's planed activities on US soil from Robert Mueller. Within a few days of Pearl Harbor, Hoover had rounded up dozens of suspected quislings, and he believed that the internment was not only unnecessary but a grave violation to American citizens.  <br />Michele Malkin is to be commended for shedding light on a very cloudy chapter of American history.  Her comprehensive research forces reasonable people to reevaluate this painful chapter from our past.  The internments were far from the mere product of racist hysteria that conventional wisdom now decries them as, and sober minds could argue their merits.  In Defensive of Internment is a respectful and intellectual thesis on a very controversial topic. Yet, ultimately it does not persuade.  History's collective judgment affirms Hoover's evaluation.  It's toobad that more powers did not share his wisdom at the time.  <br /> <br />	2005-03-27

The first female president, Hayley Rondell Criton--whose similarities to you-know-who extend beyond her name--is a Democrat who gets Congress including many wimpy Republicans to repeal the Second Amendment. The commander in chief is portrayed as a shrewish, vituperative egotist obsessed with her poll numbers and barely able to conceal her utter contempt for the general public.  <br /> <br />Several other analogous names are amusingly employed throughout the 76-page spoof. Mary O'Donnell is described \\"an actress, comedian, gay marriage advocate...now talk show host, (and) anti-gun ownership advocate.\\" Omega Walbry, a black woman, hosts a popular prime time television show in the year 2012, and Carlton Preston is the head of the NRA. <br /> <br />The story line moves quickly and never divagates from its central premise.  Once guns are outlawed, violent crime escalates and the National Guard is deployed to confiscate the firearms of those who refuse to surrender them.  Some of the elements in this intentionally farcical work appear rather farfetched. Cases of America's military personnel actually being ordered to break into the homes of citizens and even killing Americans merely on the suspicion that they possess an illegal substance (guns) are not something we envision here in the Land of the Free.  Still, before dismissing these plot twists as ridiculous fabrications used to humorously convey the author's point, readers should recall recent history.  Not too many years ago few could have imagined that the American military would be used outside of Waco to eviscerate 80+ members of a religious sect with inarguably strange beliefs, nor could we fathom that 150 machine gun-wielding thugs would be sent into a loving family's home to kidnap a frightened child and return him to a life of oppression in Cuba. Both of those \\"unbelievable\\" incidents actually transpired under the tutelage of the last administration that Hayley Rondell Criton's alter ego helped manage. The satirical elements lose some funniness when their potential reality is weighed.  <br /> <br /> <br />The booklet sardonically sounds a needed alarm and make's its persuasive case succinctly.   Hopefully, it will leave readers with an appreciation of the freedoms that we enjoy and a renewed diligence never to take them for granted.	2004-11-27
US	52806429	RHJX6NUXXPT82	047146502X	312680518	The Case for Israel	Books	5	40	63	N	N	Straightforward Commonsense	Alan Dershowitz is truly an enigma. While most celebrated political intellectuals are firmly entrenched on either the left or right, the distinguished Harvard Law Professor is not so easy to pigeonhole. Most times he reliably takes the \\"Liberal\\" position, but as his recently published work The Case For Israel proves, he can sometimes find himself persuasively articulating the \\"Conservative\\" line.  On whichever side he lands, his credentials as attorney, author, academic, and cable TV commentator promise that he`ll present a strong case, and this sapient tome is no exception. <br />Discussing the often-lamented plight of the Palestinian people the author charges that although their case is \\"far less compelling from a moral perspective than the complaints of other occupied and stateless people such as the Tibetans, the Kurds, and Basques, the PLO's resort to Global terrorism has leapfrogged Palestinian claims over the more compelling claims of others.\\" He laments that \\"the more vicious, unlawful, and lethal the Palestinian attacks against civilians became, the more diplomatic recognition they have been accorded by the United Nations, which singled out the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) from among all other representatives of stateless groups for special observer status.\\"  In a trenchant juxtaposition he speculates, \\"after the defeat of Germany and Japan in World War II, just imagine how the world would have reacted if some Germans and Japanese had employed terrorism against the victorious powers then demanded equal status as bargaining partners in postwar negotiations.\\" <br />To the accusation that Israel routinely brutalizes the defenseless Palestinians, he offers copious examples of near herculean measures employed by the Jewish state to minimize civilian casualties--usually at an increased danger to its own people.   For a frank comparison, he offers \\"in distinct contrast to the modus operandi of Palestinian terrorists--to kill as many innocent Jews as possible by any means available--the innocent Palestinian civilians who have been killed by Israelis were not the intended targets...Israel tries to use rubber bullets and other weapons designed to reduce fatalities, and aims at the legs whenever possible.\\"  Yet there are no cases of homicide bombers taking any steps to spare even babies who just happen to be in the way. <br />Israel's humane warfare is not a new development; Dershowitz tells that during the famous 6-day war \\"the tiny number of Arab civilian casualties was lower than any comparable war in modern history.\\" Not only does Israel meet the highest standards of ensuring minimal civilian injuries, its activist Supreme Court--the world's sole judicial body empowered with regulating military actions--mandates egregious precautions that admittedly put Israeli citizens and soldiers in harm's way.  For over two decades, Israel had a successful policy of flushing out terrorists from their residential hiding places.   If the killers failed to respond to surrender demands, an Arab neighbor would be sent to the hideout with a message.  After one Palestinian was killed by a suspect who assumed he was an Israeli soldier, Israeli citizens filed suit and the Supreme Court outlawed the practice that had saved many soldiers' lives.  The court unequivocally ruled \\"it is difficult to fight against persons who are prepared to turn themselves into living bombs`...(but) not every effective measure is also a lawful measure.\\" <br />As Dershowitz concludes \\"no country in the modern history of warfare has been more protective of the rights of innocent noncombatant enemies than Israel.\\"  Tragically the efforts are not reciprocated. The author explains \\"since the end of the 1967 war, the entire focus of Palestinian aggression has been on civilians...global terrorism began in 1968 not as a last resort against a long occupation but as a first resort.\\"<br />He also discusses the indoctrination campaigns that preach hatred of Israel and cites Palestinian textbooks that include test problems like \\"explain the reasons that made the Europeans persecute the Jews.\\" <br />Palestinian supporters often decry that the creation of Israel displaced local dwellers by importing Jews from all over the world.  Dershowitz shows that the vast majority of modern day Israel's residents have been Jews for centuries, but facts rarely get in the way of anti-Israeli cant.  Powerfully, he sites Winston Churchill whose early trepidation of Adolph Hitler showed shrewd prescience.  The English statesman demonstrated similar foresight regarding the creation of a Jewish state. In 1908 he declared it \\"manifestly right that the scattered Jews should have a national center and a national home and be reunited and where else but in Palestine...it will be good for the world, good for the Jews, good for the British Empire, but also good for the Arabs...they shall share in the benefits of Zionism.\\" In 1937, the British sponsored Pell Commission looked into the feasibility of the recently resurrected two-state solution and recommended such a division. The proposal failed as badly then as it is destined to today.  Sadly, the author notes \\"had the Arabs accepted the two-state solution...hundreds of thousands--perhaps even a million or more--European Jews could have been saved.\\"<br />Now that the two state solution is regaining popularity Dershowitz points out how curious it is that the Palestinians never sought independence while their territories were under Egypt or Jordan's tutelage--both of which he argues treated them much worse than the Israelis do. <br />There are many other putative falsehoods that Dershowitz dispels with weighty facts.  His effort is truly valuable and his overall ideological ambiguity lends further credence to his objectivity.  His forceful reasoning should help change the minds of some who have heard little beyond widespread anti-Israeli and/or anti-Semitic propaganda.	2004-05-30

George Weigel undertook this comprehensive biography as a labor of love and researched it  meticulously.  Reading the finished product is a laborious task but worth the effort.  <br />Mr. Weigel was afforded unprecedented access to the pontiff and scoured the world interviewing his peers, subordinates, admirers, detractors, colleagues, childhood friends, former supervisors (wherever possible), and just about anyone with cogent insights into the inner workings of John Paul II.  Even when the details appear superfluous (reports of Mrs. Wojtyla's pushing baby Karol in his carriage, et al), they assist us in comprehending the historic churchman.  Karol lost his mother as a young boy, and his father and only brother both died before he was fully mature. The author explicates how the loss of his entire close family imbued the future pontiff with an unshakable devotion to the sacredness of family life. His youthful pain positively manifested itself in copious papal support for the traditional family structure.<br />The Pope's unwavering commitment to the sanctity of human life in the face of often vitriolic criticism is likewise shown to have grown from personal hardships.  Nazism devastated Poland, and Karol Wojtyla lost many lifelong Jewish friends to the scourge.  Active in the underground--especially a clandestine theater--he struggled to stay a step ahead of the nazis.  Seeing many of his loved ones and exterminated, and his own mistreatment by the nazis shaped him in ways the world would observe decades later.  <br />Ironically, those who often fault the pope for unambiguously opposing abortion often praise him for his equally stern disapproval of capital punishment, and vice-versa.  His ineluctable reverence for the sanctity of all life was chiseled in his heart by Nazi brutality and undergirded further by communist atrocities--all witnessed firsthand.<br />The Vatican's love-hate relationship with the United Nations provides some of the book's most telling sections, explaining how some of the strangest bedfellows ever came together, and also provides an examination of how strained Vatican--U.S., ties grew due to the radical agenda of the Clinton Administration.  The center of world Catholicism worked harmoniously with Libya, Iran, and several other radical Islamic countries regarding issues of abortion, homosexuality, and the family structure while vigorously opposing the United States (during the Clinton years) on these very same issues. <br />The Clinton administration's drive to have deviant definitions of the family as well as support nefarious population control measures (including involuntary sterilization) given U.N. sanction seemed destined to succeed despite Vatican efforts to insert common sense into the argument<br />While Clinton's representatives had assiduously prepared for the Vatican's stance and adroitly maneuvered to deflate the Holy See's influence, they did not anticipate one insurmountable obstacle--nearly worldwide disgust at their extremist plans.  At that same conference, a scheduled welcoming speech--expected to be neutral in tone--by then-Pakistani Prime Minister Benazair Bhutto condemned abortion as a crime against humanity and established a theme that was reiterated by the majority of participants from Africa, Asia, and South America.  What Clinton's out-of-touch appointees dismissed an Catholic rigidity turned out to be almost catholic sentiment and squashed efforts to declare new norms of family structure.<br />Since the pope has interacted with virtually every mover and shaker of the past three decades, Mr. Weigel includes a plethora of notable vignettes regarding a veritable who's who of world figures. Describing Mikhail Gorbachev`s unprecedented visit to the Vatican during the Soviet Union`s twilight, Weigel ponders \\"he must have had some intuition of what this moment meanthistorically.  By the mere fact of his presence at the Vatican, the system he represented was acknowledging that it had been wrong about the relationship between Christianity and genuine humanism, about Christianity and human liberation.\\"<br />He wisely includes comments from Vaclav Havel's greeting to the Pope in Czechoslovakia, \\"I dare say that at this moment I am participating in a miracle: the man who six months ago was arrested as an enemy of the State stands here today as the president of the State and bids welcome to the first pontiff of the Catholic Church in history to set foot in this land.\\" <br />Other interesting tidbits include crossed paths with the like of Ronald Reagan, Mother Theresa, Fidel Castro, Ed Koch, Billy Graham, and Morocco's King Hassan who arranged for John Paul to address what may have been the largest assemblage of Muslim youth ever.<br />In an unfortunate case of timing, Witness to Hope was released a few years prior to the two incidents that could become the most salient demerits on John Paul's broad and noble legacy.  Laying any blame for the American clergy's sex scandal in the Vatican is somewhat of a stretch, but fallout from the headline-making disgrace is landing at John Paul's feet. More directly linked was the pope's bewildering disagreement with the American-lead liberation of Iraq.  Not since the allied assault on nazism has the case for a just war seemed so clear.  Why John Paul did not at least maintain a silent neutrality is a subject that historians will debate for decades.  Some have speculated that accusations--often devoid of facts--that Pope Pius XII was silent during the Holocaust--will be echoed about John Paul regarding the Iraqi situation. <br />Witness to Hope's appeal is truly catholic (with a small \\"c\\") because John Paul's influence has extended far beyond the Roman Catholic Church, and any treatment of major world events is incomplete without his views.	2004-05-22
US	52806429	R368MG3DWMGDCA	0895267896	485385986	Witness	Books	5	180	194	N	N	An Important Piece Of American History	It is sad but true that a large portion of young Americans--even many with college degrees--probably have no idea who Whitaker Chambers was.  Indeed, numerous conservatives likely know the name only as belonging to someone who was anti-communist but would be unable to provide more than vague generalities on his life and accomplishments. <br />Ann Coulter helped rectify this unfortunate development last year with the publication of her mega-bestseller \\"Slander\\".  Her trenchant exploration of twentieth century communism and the unbridled invective hurled against those who dared to oppose the murderous ideology introduced Chambers to a whole new generation.   In interviews she has often stated that his autobiography Witness is one of the absolute-must reads for conservatives and an important title for all students of American history.<br />As someone whose knowledge of Alger Hiss' nemesis was lacking, I decide to follow the sapient blonde's advice and picked up a copy of the 800-page memoir.  I now second Miss Coulter's call; Witness is a moving and educational read.  The extent to which communists infiltrated the United States Government in pre-World War days is frightening both in its scope and in the fact that today few Americans appreciate just how serious actual security breaches were.  Chambers was well-qualified to address the magnitude of the red threat because for more than a decade he was a part of the menace.  As a committed fellow traveler, he hobnobbed in all the right (left?) circles.  So powerful was the communist structure within our nation that when he eventually grew disillusioned and abandoned the atheistic dead end, he firmly believed that he was \\"leaving the wining world for the losing world.\\"  <br />Among the most striking features of the communist organization he exposed was its massive bureaucratic nature.  Within the clandestine cabal there was an \\"underground\\" so completely sequestered from the regular communists that few committed adherents knew who was who in the parallel penumbras.  Additionally, the labyrinthine steps taken to maintain secrecy are almost laughable.  Chambers' talks about never learning addresses to places he regularly visited for years; rather he knew to get there by landmarks and neighborhoods.  This was a precaution in case of capture--unknown information could not be provided to the authorities. Furthermore, Chambers relates cumbersome machinations for all his assignments; yet his endeavors to deliver \\"plans\\" or meet ever-changing, ephemeral \\"contacts\\" seem like little more than wheel-spinning busy work.  It is no wonder that conspiracy theories abound among modern day leftists--the direct descendants of the very group that perfected the art. <br />Many of Chambers' observations are as suitable to the early 21st century as they were in the 1940s.  A cavalier attitude toward abortion permeated communists.   As soon as his first child was conceived Chambers and his wife readily conceded that abortion was their only option, but when faced with the reality of their circumstance, the innate bond of parenthood trumped the dictates of good communists.  Mrs. Chambers informed her husband, \\"we couldn't do that awful thing to a little baby,\\" a demand that he whole-heartedly accepted.  <br />Considering that Chambers' communist days predated the formation of Israel, his asides on that issue truly show how much things have remained the same. He writes \\"Arab outrages were occurring in Palestine; the Communist International chose that moment to call for the formation of a \\"Soviet Arabism\\" to attack the Zionists.\\"  He also talks about how pure communism demanded its followers' ideologies remain and in an earlier incarnation of Hillary's Clinton's dreaded \\"right wing conspiracy,\\" he sites numerous expulsions due to \\"rightwing deviationism.\\" Even the problem of illegal immigration is shown to not be an entirely new phenomenon. At least one German communist contact is described as \\"probably in theUnited States illegally.\\"<br />One situation that has changed radically concerns Chambers successful post-Communist career at Time. It is not newsmagazine today. <br />Beyond the important political tale Chambers tells, his personal story proves inspirational too.  Born into a badly dysfunctional home (his only brother committed suicide, his parents lived in the same house without communicating for years), the lost soul was easy prey to the false promises of communist utopia.  Marrying a left-leaner and starting a family as an avowed red forced him to confront reality, and his transformation to conservative Christian was painful and controversial but ultimately redemptive.<br />His celebrated accusations against Alger Hiss stripped away his family's privacy and provoked piles of scorn upon his name (think Linda Tripp, Ken Starr, Miquel Estrada, Clarence Thomas, etc.)  With the release of KGB files a few years ago Alger Hiss' guilt was proven anew, yet some influential voices still argue the traitor's innocence. As quoted in Robert Novak's newly added introduction, upon Hiss' 1996 death liberals from President Clinton's National Security Adviser Anthony Lake to Peter Jennings spoke of the charges against Hiss as either false or unsubstantiated.  The incontrovertible record tells a different story, and Witness lays out the facts in perhaps a more engrossing and chilling way than any other source.  Ann Coulter's Slander makes for an engaging and stimulating read, but Whittaker Chambers eloquently gives the full story in his own words.	2004-05-22

Sean Hannity comes from a different school of thought--one founded more firmly in reality where Good and Evil really exist and are locked in an eternal battle.   <br />In his second book, he analyzes a few episodes of pure evil over the past 100 years.  Despite the book's provocative subtitle, he does not truly lump liberalism in with despotism and terrorism; rather he sees leftist appeasement as fertile ground for these evils to take root and an absence of righteousness as nurturing their growth.  He is relentless in his excoriation of liberalism's failure to understand and even admit that evil exists.  An entire chapter devoted to the Clintons (along with others exploring communism, nazism, and Iraq) is guaranteed to raise the hackles of modern day Democrats.  And although he doesn't warrant his own chapter Former President Jimmy Carter insouciance, naiveté, and grandstanding make him a repeated target of Hannity's well-supported wrath. <br />Ironically it is the chapters devoted to historical periods that standout.  Hannity's admirers either see and/or hear him daily so they are used to completely up-to-date discussions of current events--obviously impossible in book form.  His chapter devoted to the 2004's Democratic presidential candidates is already dated.  However, he displayed some shrewd prescience in compiling it because John Kerry was virtually written off just two or three months prior to securing the nomination, but the senate's most liberal member is afforded a generous helping of assiduous and damaging scrutiny.<br />While the book provides little in the way of fresh details, it successsfully links evil's grip on various totalitarian empires over the Twentieth Century.  And even open-minded progressives will admit that his perspicuous dialectics provide much food for thought.<br />In a poignant assertion regarding nazi Germany and how often the millions of lives lost become one big, impersonal statistic, Hannity remembers \\"the numbers hide millions of individual stories each of them as heartrending as the worst of today's headlines.\\"   He also points out a too often denied reality--Hitler hated Christianity as much as Judaism, proffering that \\"the leaders of the Third Reich saw that without God, the state and its leaders were free to shape morality.\\"<br />Discussing the Cold War, he examines how leftist illuminati provided untold moral support to Soviet powers.  Much of Europe never quite accepted Ronald Reagan and Hannity points out how the 40th president's unflinching vision forced the continent's leaders to make a choice between \\"do we (Europeans) believe the nation that saved us from nazi totalitarianism...or do we put our faith in Soviet Communism?\\" Shockingly, many leftists in America as well as Europe selected communism's never-fulfilled promise of utopia.  He credits the Soviet leadership for having enough smarts to fear not only President Reagan but also the promise of America; \\"if the Soviets had one thing in common with Reagan, it was that they both had more faith in America's ability than the American left did.\\"<br />The United Nations' credibility has long been in question. With Iraq's liberation further diminishing its standing, Hannity aptly summarizes that the international bureaucracy \\"has become a kind of organized forum for appeasement anxious to obstruct the actions of law-abiding nations while rewarding rogue nations for their illegal behavior.\\"  Regarding Iraq, he discusses one of the anti-warriors' most insipid and most repeated shibboleths: that the U.S. lead multinational liberation was a unilateral act.  Despite the banality of that allegation, Hannity acknowledges \\"unilateralism is no crime, if it means acting in our own national interest regardless of the stance of other nations.\\"   He also talks about the hysteria over a failure to locate WMD in Iraq yet.  Pondering the agreement of worldwide intelligence agencies that such weapons existed and the inconvenient fact that Saddam had indeed used them previously, Hannity sounds a reasonable alarm \\"the fact that no weapons (of mass destruction) have yet been found in Iraq, gives me greater cause for concern,\\" because the chance that they were moved to another unfriendly and still functioning dictatorship cannot be dismissed.  <br />Most of the leftist support for evil regimes spotlighted is merely antics of useless idiots, but he especially condemns a concrete case of terrorist coddling. Noting \\"in his eight years in office Clinton played host to (Yassar) Arafat more often than anyone else (considered a `world leader`),\\" he realizes what a horrid message that conveyed.<br />\\"Deliver Us from Evil\\" covers no new ground, but it does make a cogent connection between some of evil's manifestations over the past 100 years.  While it is unable to maintain the timeliness of Sean Hannity's radio and TV programs, its format allows him to address pertinent issues more thoroughly than his fast-paced daily outlets ever permit.  <br />Since the author often rightly boasts of intellectual honesty, one mistake in the book must be noted.  He references \\"Rudolph Hess, not long before he was hanged for his crimes.\\"  In truth the nazi thug died in 1987 after a lengthy prison sentence.	2004-03-11

Fortunately, Dolly Parton's 30+year career is suitable for book-length, and she avoids the standard celebrity tell-all fare in favor of interesting vignettes.<br />Her life is a Cinderella-story that would put any fairy-godmother to shame.  Her interesting existence commenced with a delivery paid via a pig since her farming parents were short on cash.  From such humble beginnings she went to become one of the richest women in the world.  Tantalizing tidbits about her fellow country singers and some Hollywood hotshots pepper the pages, as do tales that illumine life amidst a large Appalachian family.  She has often described her brood as \\"only financially poor\\" and that positive attitude not only permeates the book, she portrays such a blessed childhood that the allegation rings completely true. <br />Thankfully avoiding the gory details of typical star bios (think Cybil Shepherd Whoopi Goldberg, etc.), Dolly realizes there are some facts that fans need not know.  Her boasted Christianity is practiced with a few question marks, and some facets of her life do appear curious.  Still she succeeds in presenting just enough (but never too much) of the private side of her ultra-public persona. <br />Readers see how she has lived out many of the lyrics of her enumerable self-penned country songs.

While \\"Treason's\\" most important segment is unquestionably it's accurate reporting of Joseph McCarthy's life and accomplishments, the most enjoyable aspect is Ann's abundantly displayed wicked satire. <br />Those who have never taken the time and energy (most of the population) to explore the truth of McCarthyism will likely be shocked by the book's revelations.  The senator did accuse many citizens of being enemy communist agents; all were indeed enemy communist agents. The inveterate myth of Hollywood blacklisting is a genuine as Barbra Streisand's hair color.  The section of the book devoted to McCarthyism should be required reading in every high school and college.  Hopefully it would stir many students to investigate the situation more thoroughly, which is why it will never be assigned in any class.  Despite the current leftist myopia toward Communism's honorable foe, the author shows how some honest liberals strongly backed the senator.  She quotes President Kennedy indignantly responding to quip that equated McCarthy and Alger Hiss, \\"how dare you couple the name of a great American (McCarthy) with that of a traitor.\\"  The book also includes interesting anecdotes about Joseph McCarthy's early support for civil rights and his heavy campaigning in black neighborhoods, and mentions that \\"long before it was fashionable, he employed a strikingly diverse staff.\\"  While his name is now anathema to elites and academia, Miss Coulter documents how tremendously popular he was during his lifetime. <br />The book's overall theme that the American Left has abandoned loyal opposition in favor of outright aiding and abetting the enemy is polemically daring, but the author offers ample data to support her allegations.  Much of evidence is presented with the caustic derision the readers of Ann Coulter's syndicated column have come to love so much. <br />Among her precious gems: <br />On liberal opposition to the SDI missile shield: \\"Democrats suddenly became hardheaded fiscal conservatives; for the first time in recorded history, liberals were concerned about the cost and usefulness of a government program.  These people believe federally funded art therapy for the homeless will pay for itself...but a shield to repel incoming nuclear missiles from American soil, they said was too expensive.\\" <br />Strobe Talbot is described as \\"Time Magazine's Washington Bureau Chief, arms control expert, U.S. deputy secretary of state under Clinton, and pompous octogenarian blowhard all before he was nineteen years old.\\"   Dennis Kucinich is identified as \\"democratic presidential candidate and strange-looking little man.\\"  Walter Cronkite is very appropriately termed \\"'legendary newsman,' `national treasure,' and pompous liberal gasbag.\\"  She quotes Jeanne Garofalo (had anyone heard of her before the war anyway?) as saying \\"now that I'm sober I watch a lot of news,\\" and after offering a few more samples of the actress's behemoth stupidity, the author sarcastically speculates, \\"you had to wonder if her newfound sobriety had hit a rough patch.\\"  Saddam Hussein-loving has-been Sean Penn is called the \\"head of `Chain-Smoking Drunks Against War,'' and in adumbrating Norman mailer's obtuse pronouncements, she just can't help mentioning that his \\"last successful novel was written 54 years ago.\\"<br />Like Miss Coulter's previous bestseller \\"Slander,\\" this work is painstakingly documented.  However, while the plethora of annotations at times marred the earlier work, footnotes as generously used as they are here, never become a distraction in this book. <br />Of course this tome will primarily preach to the choir.  One cannot imagine many Clintonistas perusing its pages (for one thing the vocabulary is far too advanced for their brains.)  Even though Ann Coulter's unapologetic stance on the Right is proudly evident, any open-minded person will learn plenty from this risible yet historically essential book.	2003-09-03
US	52806429	R1SU0L864MWW03	044020352X	200782155	Anguished English: An Anthology of Accidental Assaults upon Our Language	Books	4	6	12	N	N	Loads of Linguistic Levity	Too often those of us who love the English Language put its lexicon up on a pedestal isolated from the world of irreverence or revelry.  We view even the most good-natured mocking of it as a sacrilege.  Richard Lederer has produced the perfect antidote to such sacrosanct pomposity with his laugh-out-loud collection of confused usage examples.  <br />The wise underlining message of this risible read is that the richness of out mother tongue is greatly enhanced by its propensity for malapropisms, mispronunciations, misspeaks, and the melange of other maladies that can and regularly do befall it.<br />His chapter on rewritten history--a compilation of actual student papers' errors--reads like a much more amusing version of the revisionist rants that get taught in too many public schools these days.  Lines such as \\"The Pilgrims crossed the ocean, and this was called Pilgrim's Progress...Many people died and many babies were born; Captain John Smith were responsible for all this\\" should rightly make us shutter when found in a post-modern textbook, but merely cause guffaws when taken from student essays.<br />While much can be lost in translation, priceless gems can sometimes be found in inter-linguistic exchanges as this gallimaufry of goofs from other languages amply proves.   Cited nuggets include a Roman laundry that blatantly announced, \\"ladies, leave your clothes here and spend the afternoon having a good time,\\" or the French hotel--presumably a hangout for swingers--that requests all guests, \\"please leave your values at the front desk.\\"  None seem to top the Japanese motel tailor-made for former President Clinton advising all visitors that \\"you are invited to take advantage of the chambermaid.\\"<br />Perhaps no aspect of our revered English is as hallowed as the rules of grammar.  Violating certain principles (What do yous guys want?) earn automatic and well-deserved odium.  Yet even among these dogmatic deficiencies, Mr. Lederer found fodder for merriment.  Sometimes the ambiguity of a pronoun can have an unintended, but uproarious impact on the perceived meaning of a sentence.  Authentic selections include, \\"according to the report, a vehicle struck the mailbox as it attempted to get back on the roadway.\\"  Pity that the mailbox was so slow moving. Regarding ravenous politicians, we read \\"after Governor Baldwin watched the lion perform he was taken to Main Street and fed 25 pound of raw meat.\\"  Spelling errors and wrong words often go undetected, but in certain instances they can truly change a sentence's intended message.  The book quotes an article that read, \\"during peek season the beach is covered with hundreds of bikini-clad beauties;\\" people are probably \\"peeking' during all seasons. Bug spray would be a minor concern to a garden where \\"the pistol of a flower is the only protection against insects,\\" and it's best to have a holiday dinner out when one hears that \\"on Thanksgiving morning we could smell the foul cooking.\\"<br />The referenced items above are random choices representative of the many inadvertently funny linguistic mistakes that comprise this rousing work. After finishing \\"Anguished English\\" readers should have a duplicitous glow--one part for the mirth that always stimulates a tired soul and the other a renewed respect for our glorious English--a majestic language that is not afraid to laugh at itself.	2003-08-10
US	52806429	RKVUNIMZDLQ3N	0847825043	620431349	The Rage and the Pride	Books	4	31	34	N	N	Proudly Raging	Long before Christine Amanpour did her best to earn the New York Post-designated appellation of \\"CNN's war's slut\\"...back in the days when Barbara Walters demonstrated vestiges of true journalism rather that gossipy glitz.... back when many doors had not yet opened to competent female muckrakers.... there was Oriana Fallaci.  As the sensitivity police  (whom she disparages as \\"cicadas\\") seized more and more control of public discourse, her outspoken independence found fewer and fewer venues brave enough to give her a platform, and rather than compromise she opted for exile.<br />The Italian born free spirit settled (primarily) in New York City.  On September 11, 2001 she, like the rest of the civilized world, was shaken from her tranquility.  A lengthy essay--her first in years--soon found worldwide, abridged distribution (and earned widespread wrath from the multicultural gestapoes.)  \\"The Rage and the Pride\\" is the unedited, uncensored, and unflinching treatise, and it may well be the literary maestro's masterpiece.  With illuminating prose, she gives a clarion call that asseverates the never-before-discussed-in-polite-company [danger] posed by radical Islamic extremism--a subject the author has long studied.  Over two decades ago she earned the cicadas' scorn for an editorial she wrote that she now terms \\"the scream of a westerner full of indignation toward the idiots who did not smell the bad smell of a holy war to come.\\"<br />So adverse to political correctness is Ms Fallaci that unlike Daniel Pipes, Steven Emerson, and numerous other erudite experts in the field, she never burdensomely states that her quarrel is not with law-abiding, peace-loving Muslims.  She rightly surmises that there is no need to make such a clarification because nowhere in her work does such an allegation exist. It is precisely this honesty without reservation that has earned her the opprobrium of so many chattering class cicadas.<br />Those who contemptuously avoid this work are doing themselves a huge disservice for astute observations overflow its pages, but the PC coterie would find plenty to be offended by in her persuasive dialectics.  Regarding the influx of Muslims throughout Europe, she states \\"in Europe the mosques which blossom not under an inflexible respect for every religion, but under the shadow of a resurrected bigotry...literally swarm with terrorists.\\"  Despite professing to be an atheist (who curiously sprinkles her discourse with phrases like \\"Thank God\\"), she unequivocally denounces anti-Christianity and lists vile examples of the bigotry committed by Syrian invaders of Christian Lebanon twenty-plus years ago.  She relates, \\"I did see them destroy the Catholic Churches, burn the Crucifixes, soil the Madonnas, (and) urinate on the altars.\\"<br />Nearly every page provides an example that Ms Fallaci is not one to mince words.  The author whose accomplishments probably surpass the entire membership of NOW has in the past experienced a feminist-lead auto-de-fa for writing a book entitled \\"Letter to a Child Never Born.\\"  Regarding feminist silence to the plight of women in radical Islamic nations, she asks her feminist critics, \\"can you tell me why when it comes to your Moslem sisters, to the women who are tortured and humiliated and assassinated by the real male chauvinist-pigs, you imitate the silence of your little men?...Have you fallen in love with the enemy, with Mr. Bin Laden? Do you dream of being raped by him, or do you simply not give a damn for your Moslem sisters because you consider them inferior?\\"<br />Considering these thoughts were put on paper in the days after 9/11/01, she demonstrates an amazing prescience in some of her comments.  It's hard to believe that certain sections were written prior to any serious discussion of the Iraqi conflict.  Analyzing various leaders' responses to September 11, she explains that Tony Blair understood the consequences; Jacque Chirac did not.  She admits to desperately wanting to shout at the Frenchman \\"Monsieur le President, don't you remember the landing in Normandy? Don't you how many Americans died in Normandy to chase the nazis from France?\\"<br />Addressing Pope John Paul II's seeming reticence in criticizing even the extremist fringes of Islam, she cogently implores, \\"my generation which has lived its entire existence in the fear of the third World War must thank you (the Pope) especially for the miracle in which none of us believed; a Europe free from the nightmare of communism...(but now) you wink at individuals who are worse than Stalin, you flirt with the same ones who still would like to build mosques in the Vatican.\\"<br />She aptly dismisses anti-war protestors who oppose even just conflicts and accuses the irresponsible movement as a clueless force that \\"preaches pacifism at any cost and repudiates even the war we fought against nazism.\\"<br />Ms. Fallaci embodies a valor not only rare among journalists (calling her the anti-peter Arnett or even anti-Peter Jennings seems insufficient) she oozes a courage lacking among too many heads of state.  She tells it like it is, not like conventional wisdom says its should be.  She sees her journalistic duty as reporting facts uncompromised by ideology. \\"The Rage and the Pride\\" is eristic from cover to cover, but the legions who viciously condemn it are unable to refute the data she relates.<br />One caveat about this release concerns its tedious proem. While the body's intelligently conveyed ideas serve to expand the minds of all who absorb it, readers should be advised that it is marred by a discursive, desultory 57-page introduction that may be a turn-off to some.

Despite his coherent arguments--amply documented with bountiful evidence--\\"Coloring the News\\" is never quite able to recover from its asinine beginning anecdote. <br />In his proem he engagingly relates several vignettes where genuine reporting was scarified to identity politics. All--save the very first one--bolster his case and show that aggrieved advocates have usurped the respectability of objective reporting in the name of that demagogue \\"diversity.\\" Incomprehensibly, his first tidbit concerns the Miami Herald's coverage of the Elian Gonzalez tragedy. In remarks that could suggest racism, he says \\"Cuban journalists and newsroom staff fell prey to ethnic partisanship that diluted the newsroom's professional detachment on the story.\\" He then writes disparagingly of a columnist being \\"photographed outside the house of the Gonzalez family in a prayer circle\\"--horror of horrors. Would Mr. McGowan expect Jewish reporters to have employed professional objectivity in covering the Holocaust? Would he have expected any decent human being to disinterestedly narrate history's darkest hour? In reality it was not the Cubans who along with the frighteningly small parcel of other journalist who heroically strove to provide the truth, but the majority of mainstream sources who avoided plentiful facts on this incident that shamed America.<br />What makes this subconscious bias or debilitating naiveté all the more outre is that much of Mr. McGowan's other findings contradict such a unfathomable viewpoint. Beyond that anomalous passage, he shows no indication of favoring totalitarian tactics nor racial discrimination. Much of his persuasion starkly defies such concepts. In a touching chapter on race relations, he discusses the disproportionate percentage of crack addicts who are Black and Latino and quotes photojournalist Eugene Richards who aptly states, \\"the last thing I noticed about the pregnant woman smoking crack, the addicts dying after shooting up, the young girls prostituting themselves, the drug boys with the automatic weapons, or the mothers grieving for their dead children was the skin color.\\"<br />On AIDS, he bravely points out how inaccurate much of the subject's media coverage is. Discussing the power of the gay lobby, he laments that \\"this taboo against candor made it difficult to write about what was really driving the disease.\\" He again quotes a Miami Herald reporter (this time non-dismissively) who admitted that \\"dozens of stories didn't make it into the paper or on the air because they might have offended the sensibilities of the pc police. \\" <br />He explicates how capitulating to feminist orthodoxy has had some very dire consequences as the tragic case of the Navy's first combat pilot revealed. Lieutenant Kara Hultgreen died in a training accident. Reports of her death skimmed over the fact that she had been given extensive leeway in the rigorous training because Naval brass was trying to placate PC bureaucrats. By glossing over this part of the story the innocent victim is sacrificed at the altar of feminism and journalistic integrity loses to popular fads. The author also discusses Kelly Flynn who became an icon for the alleged unfair treatment she sustained merely for ... on the job. As he points out everyone from Trent Lott to Maureen Dowd came to the defense of this \\"wronged woman\\" but most neglected to get any facts strait. <br />These are just a tiny portion of the sapient points he makes throughout a well-researched and clearly organized treatise. However, leading with such an off-base assertion seriously damages the work. The fatuous claim calls Mr. McGowan's judgment into question and even the behemoth of erudite reasoning that follows cannot quite alleviate lingering distaste.	2003-06-21
US	52806429	R2M39RUW66KZM	014025448X	813188609	At Home in Mitford	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Welcome to Mitford	Jan Karon vividly brings the citizens of Milford, North Carolina to life in the first installment of her amicable series that understandably achieved massive popularity.  While the subplots concerning an international jewel theft and a dognapping vignette both seem extraneous and a tad farfetched, the uplifting novel more than succeeds in paying homage to the proudly quotidian. <br />The three-dimensional characters are all similar to everyday folks whom readers will know.  Interestingly, the protagonist is a sixtyish never-married minister--not the typical lead character in current novels.  Further deviating from the stipulations of modern day literature, he does not live a double life, engage in a tawdry affair, betray his duties to the church, or spout new age babble under the obnoxious guise of religious inclusion.  He is a dedicated Episcopalian and all Christians and non-Christians will admire his commitment to his vocation. <br />What makes the desultory anecdotes referenced above all the more distracting is their complete lack of necessity to the plot.  The book's tribute to the mundane is captivating enough without contrived plot twists to build drama.  <br />The prose maintains eloquence throughout with its wholesome simplicity and on a few occasions the author's wording reaches rhapsodic heights.  Certain sentences are so powerful that they not only conjure up palpable scenes, they nearly pop out of the book and act out the setting for the reader.  At one point she describes an unwelcome rain with the hopeful undertone \\"every drop that fell contained the promise of another leaf, another blossom, another blade of grass.\\"  For transitional purposes she writes \\"early the following morning the leaden skies cleared, the sun came out and the village stirred briskly.\\"  The local newspaper is quoted in describing the nascent spring with a poetic paragraph that includes, \\"she (spring) is shod with ivy and dandelion... unfortunately she is easily distracted and often stops to tarry on a bed of moss.\\"  Listening to a parishioner's confidential tale, the minister is described: \\"he laughed happily; if there was anything more amazing and wonderful than almost anyone's life story, he couldn't think what it was.\\"  <br />Many wonderful and amazing life stories populate the pages of this pioneering work. A visit to Lord's Chapel and all its parishioners and neighbors relaxes the weary traveler and leaves one feeling renewed and wanting to come back in one of many sequels.	2003-06-08

Both aspects make for a fascinating read, because beyond his own story he provides a insightful glimpse into Cuba's abject totalitarianism and also digresses at times to expound interestingly upon some secondary topics and simultaneously offer a few caveats.<br />The historic summary will prove useful to those unfamiliar with Cuba's impressive past and its sad decline.  Keeping track of the many players he discusses may be taxing at times, but wherever applicable he tells how these characters' paths overlapped his own family's.  Despite the plentiful cast, he does give an adequate overview of 20th century Cuba.<br />Far more engaging is the narration of his own family. Their journey to freedom cries out to be made into a movie.  The story of bravery, intrigue, and adventure set against an exotic backdrop would certainly be popular with a vast audience.  Sadly, as he ostensibly acknowledges such a film will never be made because Hollywood's hotshots have long been enamored with Fidel Castro.  Doctor Faria suitably excoriates Tinsel Town's current loudest mouth Michael Moore and a few other plastic celebrities as well as the media elites who have toadied for Castro for decades; \\"they are well aware of the direful straits the Cuban situation is mired in.  Yet the problem is that deep inside they admire Fidel.\\" So blinded are many of these voices by their regard for communism's last remaining relic, that they willingly occlude the obvious realities of Castro's horrors. As Dr. Faria laments, \\"only occasionally will news and information about the [extreme] violation of civil rights in Cuba and the persecution of dissidents break the wall of the American media's self-imposed censorship and expose the abuses and the utter brutality of Castro's communist regime.\\" Cuba's location a mere 90 miles from U.S. soil makes the situation all the more [horrible].<br />Occasionally the text diverges, but the tangential anecdotes often are directly related to the American situation today.  Proponents of gun control will be angered by an inconvenient detail he relates from Cuba's past.  Under Batista's leadership, firearm licensing began, and when Castro's agents initiated gun confiscation, Dr Faria observes, \\"they had a well-drawn blueprint to follow, the local firearm registration lists Batista had established.\\"<br />He also divagates to explain communism's largely successful efforts to devastate family structure--divorce and abortion are common in Cuba.  Still he rightly brags that \\"the traditionally close Cuban family unit which then (pre-Castro days) extended beyond the nuclear family remains alive today ironically outside of Cuba in the Miami Cuban community.\\" He does not make the intimation, but such a feature may be one reason while many left-wingers hold the Cuban community in disdain.<br />No section of this book is as necessary or as heartbreaking as his exploration of the Elian Gonzalez saga.  Castro's sycophants in the media, academia, et. al. have hurled every scurrilous accusation imaginable at the heroic Gonzales family in Miami to protect their communist god, Dr. Faria's only agenda is the truth.  He mentions the abundant (but conveniently ignored) documentation that Elian's s father knew of and supported the child's planned escape. He talks of the infamous abuse Elian received from one of his grandmothers and explains that it may have been a a satanic rite common in Cuba.  He mentions how the INS and the Justice Department initially vowed to help Elian stay with his loving relatives but curiously reversed themselves when reportedly Castro [taunted] Clinton with another dump of Cuban prisons on American shores.  Clinton has long blamed his one gubernatorial loss on his agreement to house some Cubans in thelate seventies and has held Cubans in contempt ever since his one electoral [loss].<br />Dr. Faria strengthens his nearly airtight case with quotes from the doctors who were treating Elian. His Miami pediatrician futilely wrote to Janet Reno testifying to the loving treatment the Gonzalezes were providing, adding \\"it would be detrimental to take Elian away from the physically and emotionally stable environment that he has been part of for the past four and a half months.\\" An independently hired psychologist who evaluated the child told ABC news that \\"taking Elian away from his Miami family only months after losing his mother would put him through a second ... trauma.\\"  The only doctors who advocated the child's return to a life of slavery for government appointed mouthpieces who never met with him--likely they were parroting the script [government] officials had written. How sad that such an occurrence happened in America--not Cuba<br />He also talks about the leash Castro kept on Elian's father the entire time he was in the United States. He had to leave one of his other children and his mother behind. Controversially, Dr. Faria asks how fit a parent Elian's father was if he allowed the machine-gun wielding thugs to kidnap his child from their loving home when he wouldn't even venture there himself to try and talk with the family. Sadly the mountain of evidence he puts forth will likely be ignored by those who chose to distort the tragic situation while it was in progress.  A frighteningly large number of movers and shakers overlooked the travesty, even the raid that prostituted America into lawlessness and totalitarianism however briefly.<br />When Elian was sent back, the usual suspects talked about how much better off he would be, but as Dr, Faria acknowledges of the island prison \\"the government elite have access to the best food, housing, health care, and education, ordinary Cubans spend their lives standing in line for government rations.\\"  Such conditions do not matter to those who eschew reality.<br />While any exploration of this heartbreaking case is very, very sad, \\"Cuba in Revolution\\" is in many other ways an uplifting read.  Dr. Faria's appreciation of the opportunities in America (pre- and post- Clinton years) is heightened by his exposure to Cuba's horrors.<br />As I write this review, the news media is obsessed with Iraq's liberation.  Similarities between Saddam Hussein's and Fidel Castro's reigns are disturbingly plentiful.  Additionally, Castro has taken advantage of this mono-coverage to [get tough] on dissidents in his country.

This combination of favorable happenstances makes this book an insightful read even though it plows familiar ground.  The events since September 11 2002 have been extensively documented, but Mr. Sammon who was with the president on that fateful day and has enjoyed close proximity ever since provides some information available only to with such privileged facility. <br />At times the details are trivial and almost tedious.  Do we really need to know what the president ate on the night of September 10 or the back and forth banter on his morning jog the day of the incursion?  Often though, Mr. Sammon's revelations offer a glimpse inside the president's psyche and give a helpful view of what makes the man tick.  <br />In a rare unguarded moment the president complained about Hillary Clinton's irresponsible accusations where she flagrantly flailed a misleading headline on the senate floor.  His public contempt for the terrorist perpetrators is not an act, and it is reassuring to see that his rapport with his able cabinet and sagacious advisors is genuine.<br />Mr. Sammon also ventures into some related topics, none as hilariously on target as Donald Rumsfeld's longsuffering relationship with the media.  In an amusing section, he repeats many asinine queries lobbed at the Defense Secretary and contrasts them with a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit.  Frighteningly many of the intentionally absurd questions asked on the late night comedy are not too far beyond the banality of the real reporters legitimate inquiries. <br />He also discussed the president's enduring high popularity to the umbrage of many media muckamucks.  Peter Jennings' befuddlement at the President's maintained respect while disdain for media elites increases is humorously presented.  <br />Anyone who read \\"Absolute Power\\" Mr. Sammon's first book or is familiar with his reporting will not be surprised by his engaging prose.  The book contains no bombshells nor unearths any inside controversies, but it further fleshes out the president's character and gives an appreciation of day to day plotting and strategizing within the inner sanctum of the White House regarding the War on terrorism.	2003-03-13

Even many of us who have long been strongly anti-communist are either unaware or defensively forgot the extent of the ideologys horrors.  The section devoted to Cambodia is liable to give even the hardiest among us nightmares.  Nor does she flinch in her dispatches on Nicaragua, Laos, Vietnam, or the Soviet Union itself in this enlightening discussion of communist ruins.<br />While its atrocities are necessary as a backdrop to her narrative it is the title characters, the useful idiots among the American elite, who comprise the essence of this work.  She discusses how either through naiveté, stupidity, or genuine affirmation, numerous liberals gave aid and comfort to ruthless regimes that inflicted untold suffering upon millions and millions of innocent people.  <br />Although Communisms bankruptcy has been proven wherever it was tried, Mrs. Charen argues that some liberals still fail to accept the facts. Her strongest chapter is called Post-communist Blues and discusses how in spite of overwhelming evidence leftists still wont fully acknowledge that communism was a devastating force, and Americas resoluteness was the counterforce that saved countless lives and rescued others from abject misery as she fulsomely documents.  She posits that two post-Soviet union occurrences have exposed the radical lefts true colors, which are several shades of red.  The Elian Gonzales debacle and the September 11 gave liberal glitterati the chance to demonstrate what they learned from communisms collapse, and their actions vociferously answered not much.<br />She uses the Elian Gonzales case to highlight one of the Lefts great contradictions.  While liberals--to their credit--typically decry any hint of racial or ethnic bigotry, one group is exempt from this egalitarianism.  Cubans are suitable fodderfor leftwing discrimination.  She states that not only did the Elian Gonzalez affair (provide) ample evidence that American liberals had learned nothing about the nature of communism from history, but liberals in the press and government betrayed a crude contempt toward Cuban-Americans regarding the tragic situation.  Referencing many hateful comments published in liberal-leaning mainstream newspapers, she regrets that Cubans make up the only minority community in America who receive brickbats from the press.  As with Nicaragua, El Salvador and every other fallen communist bastion she predicts that after Castros demise, the attitudes of American liberals toward that regime will be revealed for what they are--a disgrace.  Those blessed with even a modicum of commonsense could argue that they have already been exposed as such.<br />In a different section, she notices that the anti-Cuban bias of liberals was further displayed by the handling of diplomat Otto Reich.  She quotes a few progressives who were troubled by his Cuban refugee status which allegedly could make him partial on certain matters.  Mrs. Charen snidely asks, has there ever been a suggestion, ever, that someone who fled nazism or apartheid was morally suspect on that account? <br />Regarding the September 11th attacks, Mrs. Charen serves up a smorgasbord of moral relevance spewed by liberal thinkers implying or outright asseverating that America brought the depraved assault upon itself. She aptly surmises this is the sort of vapid blather that often travels under the name Liberalism.  In fairness, she mentions that certain leading lights of the left were blown to their senses by the unprovoked acts of war. She sites Professor Sean Wilenz, a committed Clinton apologist who refuted the pallid assertion that terrorism is rooted in penury.  He averred, to say that poverty explains terror is to slander those caught in poverty who choose to lead worthy lives.<br />Perhaps the great irony of Communism is that although it heyday has long passed, and its many failures have been comprehensively exhibited for the entire world to see, leftists cannot let go of their reverence for its mystique.  Several million innocent victims, countless ruined lives, and unimaginable suffering aside, liberals seems to be convinced that the system has a few kinks, but give it time and it will right itself.  Reality, Mrs. Charen argues, tells a vastly different story and a very sad one at that.	2003-03-08

Ranging from tips in picking the right gun to shooting pointers to a brief discussion of gun control issues, the work summarizes several topics without delving to deeply into any. The book even includes a glossary of gun terms which novice and moderate users should find beneficial.<br />The book's usefulness will depend greatly upon various readers' needs. Those new to gun ownership will find it easy-to-read and readily understandable. Those with some, but not much experience will likely pick up a couple of bits of helpful information, but may find a more detailed treatise on a specialized subject more advantageous. Little will be gleaned by the experienced shooter for whom this book is obviously not intended. <br />A curious appendix features several liberty-themed quotes. Many are extracted from antiquity. If you're a quote collector (like me) you'll find this section a delightful bonus. Otherwise it may be seen as extraneous and desultory. <br />An unanticipated lagniappe is a series of drawings the appear throughout the pages--all were done by Mr. Pierre himself.  <br />At less than 150 pages Mr. Pierre's works accomplishes what he seems to have set out to achieve. He's created a readable synopsis of an salient handgun-related topics. While no aspect of handguns is painstakingly appraised here, this volume provides a very good first step for anyone wishing to explore the intriguing and at times controversial subject of handguns and their correlation to personal freedom	2003-03-05

In the interest of fairness, he sequesters genuine liberalism from militant leftism--unchecked extremism where facts are inconvenient, trivial, and should be ignored.   As he astutely points out, \\"it is the thinking American who loves his country; anti-Americanism, on the other hand is reactionary and reflexive.  It is the automatic response of one who has been conditioned what to think.\\"  He further states that such a worldview provides \\"a preprogrammed stock answer to all the questions.  It forgoes critical thinking in favor of the mental straitjacket of ideology.\\"  <br />Despite the self-righteous blather leftists regularly spew, Mr. Flynn reveals how hypocritical they are; \\"where the left is truly unique is that while believers of other domestic political programs aggressively shun their ideological relatives who commit violence for their cause, leftists enthusiastically embrace murderers and terrorists who partake in crimes under the guise of `social justice.'\\"  He supports this charge up with examples including radical animal rights activists and celebrated cop killers who are never denounced and often celebrated by leftist intelligentsia. <br />Mr. Flynn discusses how the left vapidly assigns its motives to America's enemies and offers puissant refutation; \\"none of the September 11th hijackers cared about the Kyoto environmental treaty, the Durbin conference on racism, or hate crimes legislation in congress.\\"<br />While many readers have probably dismissed the fad of multiculturalism as merely irritating, Mr. Flynn explains why this divisive movement is potentially far more nefarious.  He nobly articulates \\"at the core of multiculturalism...is not an appreciation or understanding of other cultures, but a deep animus toward America and the west.\\"  Proving again that he is not one to mince words, Mr. Flynn adds, \\"in practice multiculturalism is rarely about promoting other cultures.  It is more often about debasing our own.\\"<br />Since the terrorist attack, much has been made about the alleged abridgement of civil rights for Muslim citizens.  Once again, Mr. Flynn mentions an unpopular truth; \\"in none of these (predominantly Islamic) countries are Muslims as free to practice their faith as they are in the United States.\\"  This lack of liberty is not confined to Islamic regimes.  As Mr. Flynn remarks, \\"democracy is not just rare outside the West; it's almost a novelty.\\" <br />Perhaps the most touchingly patriotic section concerns his discussion of immigration.  Despite leftist poppycock about rampant racism, sexism, etc. he accurately states, \\"no country as opened its arms to the immigrant the way America has.\\"  Uttering a fact that the left refuses to accept, he mentions \\"so appealing is the idea of America that people continue to risk their lives on makeshift rafts to come across dangerous sees just to live here.  They don't go to Saudi Arabia or Madagascar or Denmark or Brazil.\\"<br />Whiles he's slaying leftist dragon, he fires an arrow at the mythological Blacklist and incorporates one more very unpleasant fact; \\"long before the major studios announced a boycott of communists working the film industry, Hollywood's Left introduced its own blacklist.\\"<br />Leftist babble may stipulate that patriotism equals bigotry and closed-mindedness.  However, Mr. Flynn has a more enlightened view; \\"We find something noble in patriotism even when practiced by our enemies; there is the sense that something is not altogether right with someone who despises his country.\\"	2003-02-23

Lewis published The Screwtape Letters in 1942, its theme is every bit as appropriate today.  A collection of correspondence from a veteran devil to an apprentice demon, the learned counsel for debasing virtue is all too commonplace in practice today.  <br />The corruption of language has been articulated by many social critics over the past decade to so, but Mr. Lewis referenced this nascent technique sixty years ago. The experienced devil, Screwtape, seems to be embracing modern day parlance when he brags about the word Puritanism taking on its pejorative status. The value we have given to that word is one of the really solid triumphs of the last hundred years; by it we rescue annually thousands of humans from temperance, chastity and sobriety. <br />Today we often hear the cant that one religion is as good as another, and saying a certain religion is true will elicit terms like discrimatory or judgmental. While most churches advocate truth and righteousness, a lack of loyalty to one is not a positive development and Screwtape was knew this to be true. He waxed, if a man cant be cured of church, the next best thing is to send him all over the neighborhood looking for a church that suits him until he becomes a taster or connoisseur of churches.  He was especially fond of churches that change to meet current demand and praised a church where the vicar is a man who has so long engaged in watering down the faith to make it easier for a supposedly incredulous and hard-headed congregation that it is now he who shocks his parishioners with his unbelief. <br />Often Mr. Lewis's healthy sense of humor is artfully displayed.  An exasperated Screwtape writes desparigingly that one mortal is not only a Christian such a Christian--a vile, sneaking, simpering, demure, monosyllabic, mouselike, watery, insignificant, virginal, bread-and-butter miss.  The little brute, she makes me vomit. <br />Throughout the fantasy, a bounty ofreal advice is present. Simple tidbits such as Screwtapes simple statement that the safest road to hell is the gradual one should serve as a tocsin for many readers.  With wit, ingenuity, reverence, and jocularity, C.S. Lewis created a timeless classic to exhort the ages.	2003-02-16

Its ruthless regime has rightly earned a distinction as part of the \\"Axis of Evil;\\" yet its population has grown weary of the oppressive theocracy and is starting to revolt.  Unlike most dictatorships where resistance movements gain little traction, Iran's bold citizenry has its corrupt ruling mullahs running scared.  As I write this review, an implosion may be imminent.  Within the past few weeks nationwide protests scored unprecedented success when several police departments rejected despotic dictates to crush the demonstrations.  Thugs are being imported from other Islamic nations to try and squelch the calls for democracy and reform, but the genie may already be out of the bottle.  Currently Iran is a dichotomy of contrasts.  It is among the world's leading sponsor of terrorism, but its totalitarian government is running out of steam; as calls for renewal are spreading all across the land, its leadership appears impotent to cease the progression.<br />It is against this promising backdrop that Reza Pahlavi writes his prescription for his homeland's rejuvenation.  Son of the last Shah, the U. S. resident has a view of the beleaguered nation that holds so much potential.  He points out that Iran's population, where 70% of the people are under 30, is among the world's youngest.   As in all totalitarian states, the life expectancy is probably tragically young, but an additional mitigating factor is the huge amount of expatriate Iranians.  Mr. Pahlavi foresees a day-in the not-too-distant future when many of them will return home.  He explains that Iran's nonrepresentative government cannot last and says that the only two viable replacement options are a constitutional monarchy or a democracy.   Although his lineage entitles him to be the monarch, he does not seek power and says that if he is ever restored to the throne, he will serve only as a figurehead, while a freely elected president will lead. <br />Ironically one of the reforming class's hindrances is external.  Mr. Pahlavi explains that \\"unlike the outside world that still believes moderation with the Islamic regime is possible, Iranians have come to the conclusion that the ruling theocracy is inherently incapable of liberalization.\\"  His solution to replace the ruling mullahs with a secular government could be just what is needed throughout the Islamic world, and Iran's successful embrace of nonsectarian rule could serve as an impetus to other countries in the region.<br />Mr. Pahlavi is keenly aware who his audience is and much of his discussion of Iran's struggle references similar situations here in the cradle of liberty.  Referring to the widespread peaceful protests he mentions that  \\"American revolutionaries staged tax and tea boycotts against the British; two centuries later the U.S. Civil Rights movement called for nonviolent resistance.\\"  In another passage he talks of his countrymen's most endearing gesture to the United States, \\"in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, Iranians gathered in large numbers and held candlelight vigils while chanting slogans in support of and sympathy for America.\\"  That brave gesture angered the cruel regime but stands in stark contrast to the many celebratory scenes throughout the Muslim world, and Iranians deserve America's gratitude for their courageous fellowship.   For his worldwide audience he cites numerous international battles including Gandhi's legendary struggles, the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos, Vaclav Havel's successful efforts in the Czech Republic, and the courageous martyrs of Tiananman Square whose magnificent exhibition was so brutally extinguished but who, themselves, never resorted to violence.<br />While world attention is rightly focused on Iraq, impressive forward motion is occurring in its neighbor andfellow \\"Axis of Evil\\" nation.   The United States has an all-important ally in its battle against Tehran's vicious regime--the noble Iranian populace.  Do not be surprised to see its oppressive theocracy implode before U.S. lead military action is needed there.  When that happens Reza Pahlavi has articulated a thorough plan to ensure that the winds of change blow through with hurricane force and leave a vastly improved Iran behind.	2002-12-29

While the lead character is an Indian (or Native American or whatever p.c. term is in vogue these days) which they generally view positively, he is also a Christian which they generally view negatively.  The plot twist that has Squanto embracing the Christian faith should truly ruffle some feathers (so to speak) because faddish dictates say that all religions save Christianity and Judaism are beneficial. Obviously by finding his new faith, he leaves the old one behind.<br />Well, it's too bad that the censorious elites may go on the warpath over this uplifting true story, because they will miss out on a great read.  While Squanto's name is relatively familiar, his biography is penumbral to even many well-educated Americans.  His story should be better known because he personified the American Spirit before there was a United States.   <br />Kidnapped as a boy of twelve and taken across the ocean as promising chattel in the slave trade, he was blessed to have been \\"purchased\\" by some monks who took pity on him.  (In a truly irritating development to the p.c. crowd it is his liberators who are portrayed as religious while his evil captors are not.)  The Italian monks strive to return Squanto to his family but the homecoming takes ten years.  Sadly that is too late as a plague has wiped out his entire village before his return.  The remainder of the story summarizes the famous part of Squanto's life--his mutually salvific interactions with the Pilgrims.  Charmingly illustrated this American tale may not be the best for very young children because it deals honestly with depravity of the slave trade although that is a tertiary focus of the story. And though the target audience is much younger, adults will enjoy this salutary narrative of a remarkable life that knew devastating heartbreak and ultimately redemptive joy.	2002-11-24

There's always a risk in learning the details of an icon's life.  How many celebrity autobiographies have left readers thinking \\"what an amoral jerk!\\"?  In the case of Todd Beamer, his countless admirers will not be disappointed.  Indeed he was truly the kind and selfless Christian husband and father whose unflinching answer to his unanticipated call to duty catapulted him into posthumous fame.  That celebrated act was just the final and most ballyhooed of a too-short, inspiring life.  <br />Throughout the book, Lisa's prose capitalizes upon a prescient poignancy.  Nearly every chapter ends with a line that seems to augur Todd's eventual martyrdom.  After a chapter discussing Todd's career path, his widow mentions that although he didn't feel called to ministry he was determined to fulfill his Christian obligations.  As she narrates, \\"he could serve God in business as well and maybe even make more of an impact on the world...His close friends and family members didn't understand all that Todd meant at the time; one day they would.\\"  Ending a chapter that describes his years before they met, she justifiably boasted that \\"Todd Beamer always came through in a clutch.\\"  Relating his university years at Wheaton Christian College, she analyzes that \\"Wheaton was a great place for Todd Beamer to be for there he learned many lessons that would impact the rest of his life and an entire nation.\\"<br />Learning of their separate growing up family lives, it's fitting that a man who has come to embody patriotism for the 21st century and his wife both came from families were national pride had never gone out of style.   Lisa proudly declares of her formative years, \\"independence, patriotism, freedom, and the American way of life were not trite cliches tossed around lightly in our family.  They were highly treasured values.\\"  In a demonstration of fate's cruelty Todd's father was at an unrelated business meeting in San Francisco on September 11.  Due to the indefinite grounding of all flights he and a friend rented a car and drove all the way across America to get back home.  After his return, he remarked with spontaneous eloquence, \\"as we crossed the country, I had a chance to see again just how vast and beautiful our nation is and how much our freedom and way of life are worth fighting for.\\"<br />Perhaps the ultimate irony of the story is the stark contrast between Todd Beamer (along with Jeremy Glick and many of the other Flight 93 heroes) and their murderous thugs.  One side represented a dedication to family, country, and fidelity.  The other side saw debauchery--even in the next life where a purported orgy was their lusted reward--as the ultimate goal.  As politically incorrect as it may be to say, the fact that one viewpoint was held by the Christians and the other by the Muslims is likely not coincidental.<br />Some may experience tinges of guilt at the genuine satisfaction felt, but all readers will derive some sense of justice in learning that the brave rebels poured boiling water over the hijackers as they attempted to reclaim the plane.  The scalding liquid must have caused the murderers unbearable pain in their final moments and provided a minor preview of the heat where they were going. <br />Lisa Beamer is right to share her husband's noble sacrifice with the other brave insurrectionists on board the doomed flight.  She accurately declaims \\"the valiant heroes aboard Flight 93 fought the first battle in what President Bush declared as a war against terrorism...and won.\\"	2002-11-10

In addition to documenting the vitriol and spurious assaults inflicted by liberal muck-a-mucks (including most of the mass media), the conservative movement's diva returns fire with both barrels. Throughout the cumbersomely annotated work, she displays the acerbic humor that readers of her syndicated column appreciate so well. Along the way she engages in some of the opponents' very same tactics--but provides corroboration for every accusation she propels.<br />No liberal mantra is left standing. On feminism which she says \\"hasn't made much of a dent in America (but) has taken the worlds of news and entertainment by storm,\\" she compares yesteryear's Hollywood stars like Grace Kelly and Sophia Loren who personified class with today's flash in the pan crowd (Brittanies, Madonnas, Sarah Jessicas etc.) who personify crass. She sarcastically summarizes \\"whatever feminism is alleged to have accomplished, it did not create a world in which women are admired for something other than playing or being sluts.\\"<br />She addresses the tedious refrain of calling successful Republicans dumb; Ronald Reagan who won the cold war was regularly dismissed as a dunce despite making the world a much safer and more prosperous place to live. Of the current scene, she points out that \\"George Bush (43) with degrees from Yale and Harvard is ridiculed for his stupidity by Hollywood starlets whose course of study is limited to what they've learned from bald sweaty men on casting couches.\\" To elucidate how disingenuous the left's concept of smarts is, she explains that \\"liberals idea of intellectual engagement is Bill Clinton 's adolescent cramming in all-night slumber parties leaving the place littered with pizza rinds and women's panties.\\" Regarding the few Republicans who avoid the \\"D\\" brand, she discusses the curious exception of Christy Whitman who inaccurately earned the smart label due to her lack of true Republican principles. Skimming over several of the former New Jersey governor's accomplishments (aka goof-ups), the author provides an apt summation: \\"the woman is a dimwit.\\"<br />She also talks about the unfair distortions in news coverage of liberals vs. conservatives; Bush-speak \\"subliminable' for example is a lot closer to 'subliminal' than \\"was the inspiration for 'Love Story' is to 'knew the guy who wrote 'Love Story.'\\" A Clinton-era shibboleth dictates that exposing personal corruption should be forsaken because it will deter good people from going into politics. Ann Coulter counters that \\"another possible response to adultery scandals involving politicians is not good people avoiding politics, but politicians avoiding adultery.\\"<br />In a mordant, tables-turning passage she unloads, \\"the good part about being a Democrat is that you can commit crimes, sell out your base, bomb foreigners, and rape women, and the Democratic faithful will still think you're the greatest. The bad part is that you must effortlessly follow the party orthodoxy, which is completely impenetrable to human logic.\\" No longer can it be said that conservatives can't dish it out as well as liberals!<br />No section is as right on the money or as wickedly risible as the chapter appraising media coverage of that elusive phoenix, \\"the Religious Right.\\" By meticulously documenting a plethora of chronological articles from liberal-leaning media (primarily \\"the New York Times\\" and \\"the Washington Post\\") she cites repeated inconsistent references to the mythical \\"Religious Right\\" as interchangeably wielding great influence or waning in persuasive heft. No events seem to cause the steep fluctuations in its power, and no supporting criteria are offered to explain the divagations. As to who or what comprises the \\"Religious Right\\" none of the sources (nor the author) seem to be able to say. It's a chimerical force that liberals fear but fail to pinpoint exactly why. <br />It's ironic that one of the book's strong attributes actually becomes a minor drawback. To obliterate any critics, who question the veracity of her arguments, Miss Coulter has painstakingly notated the work. Certain pages are literally laden down with superscript in, alas, what will probably prove a futile undertaking. This phenomenally successful book likely preaches to the choir. It is doubtful that many of the liberal traducers will read a work that so efficaciously deconstructs their strategy.	2002-10-27

So many Hollywood hot shots seem compelled to gleefully describe their amoral lasciviousness and mock the virtues millions of Americans hold dear.  <br />Fans of that sort of salacious shock should avoid Brenda Lee's memoirs at all costs.  Her salubrious life is just what would be expected from the effervescent chanteuse who's now enjoying her fifth decade of stardom.    Although she tells many interesting show biz stories from her days of prepubescent renown to her current status as music industry veteran, readers clearly see that her proudest accomplishments have been her successful roles as wife (nearing 40 years married), mother, and grandmother.  Unlike the sleazy conquests that fill other celebrity tell-alls, Little Miss Dynamite boasts, \\"I never wore my `Brenda Lee' hat at home; I was `Mrs. Shacklett;' I was Julie and Jolie's mother; I was the obnoxious cheerleader with the cowbell at the basketball games; I became a master at helping with school projects.\\" Fame and fortune were welcome bonuses accentuating her fulfilled life.   <br />While glitz and glamour have been the undoing of several immature stars, Brenda had her priorities straight from the beginning. As a teenage bride of seven months she learned that she was to become a mother.  Those in charge of her career were dismayed by how this development could negate her star.  Brenda herself had a different reaction; \\"I never had one thought of the career, of the consequences, or what it might mean to my future.\\" She was too thrilled establishing a family to worry about her job.<br />Her life was far from a bed of roses, but from early childhood she received solid grounding. Born into penury, her father died before her early-blooming career budded.  Describing the rare luxuries of her childhood she sites oranges which they usually only had at Christmas and concedes, \\"looking back now, I can't believe that I didn't know we were poor...at that time I was happy; I had people around me who cared about me and loved me.\\"<br />Another contrast from the Hollywood status quo was seen during the Vietnam War. Unlike the perpetually protesting celebrities, Brenda--who had serious reservations about the conflict--wanted to perform for the troops in Vietnam, but it was ruled too dangerous. She did manage to entertain many wounded soldiers including once on a tour of a military hospital in the Philippines with General Westmoreland.  Describing her visit to many soldiers who had lost limbs she states \\"a lot of people wouldn't want to see that, but I felt it was the least I could do for these men who were giving their lives and limbs for America.\\" Many soldiers asker her to contact loved ones back home, and she reveals \\"there were dozens of families, and I called every single one.\\"<br />Unquestionably the most poignant vignette that additionally shows the power of wholesome music to touch the soul concerns the tale of a little girl whose stepmother balefully banished her to a mental institution where she was unjustly confined for years.  Upon her release she contacted Brenda to say access to her music had sustained her through those nightmare years.  Brenda felt blessed by meeting this incredible woman and said that by her travails, \\"she taught me never to feel sorry for myself or for whatever bad situation I was in.\\"<br />Distancing herself even further from the Hollywood notables, Brenda is not shy in admitting her reverent faith.  Once her daughter's cancer diagnosis was found to be in error--after the girl was prepped for surgery--Brenda attributed it to a miracle brought about by the prayers of so many. <br />Those looking for show biz tidbits won't be disappointed.  Since Brenda Lee's career has encompassed so many styles, her path crossed with a cornucopia of performers.   She shares her encounters with the diverse likes of Judy Garland, Elvis Presley, Barbara Mandrell, Jimmy Durante, Tanya Tucker, Burt Reynolds, Art Garfunkle and scores of others.<br />At one point, Brenda admits, \\"I wasn't the new Judy Garland. I wanted something else out of life.  I wanted roots stability and normalcy.\\"  It's easy to see that she achieved her goal, and has a very interesting and lucrative career providing icing to her cake.	2002-10-13

As many others prove, he likewise has a teeming cadre of admirers.  Yet after absorbing his trenchant and well-researched book, honest readers on both sides of the spectrum will agree that he is an intelligent and brave individual.  <br />The tired mantras of \\"sell-out\\" and \\"Uncle Tom\\" have been generously applied to the Berkley Linguistics Professor, but most of his critics do not even attempt to refute his meaty arguments, resorting to defamatory attacks instead.  One of the most scurrilous (if disturbingly common) charges is that his ideas are somehow demeaning to black people.  <br />In fact the author's politics are not easy to pigeonhole. John McWhorter is certainly anathema to the likes of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, but despite his detractors' denunciations, he is not quite a clone of Thomas Sowell or Joseph Perkins either.  He see traces of racism as persisting in many American police departments and advocates gossamer sensitivity training as a way to alleviate this alleged conundrum.  He feels that at its origin affirmative action was an imperfect but necessary means to serve a banausic purpose.  He also believes that leftist-loved cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal is likely innocent---curiously disregarding mountains of dooming evidence--and identifies as a hero communist-leaning, philandering Adam Clayton Powell.  <br />Mr. McWhorter is obviously living a very fulfilling life--a blessing denied to many of his fellow black Americans who are trapped in--what he aptly terms--the cult of Victimology.  Sounding the tocsin to let all black Americans join in his quest for the full American Dream is hardly a racist move.  While he does grant that black culture is held down today largely by its own doing, his message is one of realistic hope; \\"there are millions and millions of people on earth who would kill for the lives of all but a few black Americans today and therehave been untold billions of people who have triumphed amidst conditions unspeakably worse.\\" <br />With generous supplies of imperative research, poll data, and personal anecdotes, the author lays out a broad assessment illuminating three major impediments to the advancement of the black race today.  None of them involve racism.  While he acknowledges that it still exists, he documents how the scourge has deteriorated to such an insignificant degree that it no longer impedes black progress.  He sites a near obsession with victim status, self-imposed separatism that blocks access to many avenues of advancement, and an anti-intellectualism or the devastating fallacy that studious blacks students who obtain high marks are traitorously \\"acting white.\\"  While his comprehensive argumentation is certainly open to debate, a better-presented line of reasoning would be difficult to find.  Were John McWhorter a lawyer, the opposing attorney would cringe at the prospect of countering such an eloquent and erudite dissertation.<br />Perhaps the strongest refutation of the specious charge of racism concerns his many references to African and Caribbean immigrants.  These newcomers--unshackled by victimology's shibboleths--are much better able to reap the bounties America offers.  He writes with dismay about the many black students in his college courses who fail to meet his standards, and his consternation is enhanced by the blatant truth that their lack of success is generally not due to diminished capabilities.  Rather he sites the tragic anti-intellectual strains that detrimentally permeate much of the modern day American black community.  This restrictive weight does not hold down those from Africa.  Conceding that reductive teaching methods are often needed in his predominantly black classes, he adds \\"students of African immigrant parents, ... rarely have required these 'special'' methods.\\"  Additionally, he states, \\"in my classes that Caribbean and African students usually perform at the same level as whites, something also supported by studies.\\"  Regarding the substandard performance of back schoolchildren, he insightfully queries \\"what are we saying about black children to assume with such confidence that they are incapable of doing what poor Asians and even poor Haitians and Jamaicans and Ethiopians are doing right alongside them everyday?\\" <br />Unquestionably the book's most poignant section features Mr. McWhorter's struggle with the acceptance that affirmative action--which he feels has long outlived its usefulness--played a small role is his success.  Witnessing his impressive mind as readers do, it is safe to say that he would have achieved great prosperity with or without favors, but as he veraciously admits, on a few occasions he was slotted into a minority set-aside ahead of somebody more qualified.  The fact that a middle-class, brighter-han-average, individual could derive benefits from a program initiated to help the disadvantaged is an unsubtle testimony to the bankruptcy of this worn-out policy.  So burdened is he by this unpleasant fact, that he has decided to pursue operatic training (theatric pursuits have long been an avocation) to prove to himself that he can master a field based solely upon his qualifications. <br />From the book, I learned that John McWhorter's tenure as a Rutgers undergrad overlapped mine.  How I wish I had met him.  Although we would have disagreed on numerous issues, from the reasoning employed in this treatise, it's easy to see that any conversation with him would prove very stimulating.  While affirmative action may have given him an unnecessary and perhaps unfair break here and there, it is safe to assume that had he lived before the Civil Rights Movement, he would have accomplished just as much.  In the not-too-distant future, crowds should enjoy watching him perform at the Met.	2002-09-29

Instances of parents rejecting wayward offspring were hardly epidemic, and those willing to abjure a child would most likely not be swayed to rethink their sinful move because of the trite suggestion of some Christian clergymen.   Furthermore the directive contained many questionable claims about homosexuality and straddled the line of rejecting Church teaching on the subject.  While several bishops denounced this ill-thought out epistle, which was somehow issued without the full body's consent and the Vatican demanded quickly instituted redactions, the entire incident should have set off some alarm bells about problems within the Catholic Church in America.  Tragically, nobody dug deep enough to get beyond the tip of what was a gigantic iceberg.  In 2002 the vessel crashed and Titanic-caliber damage was inflicted.  <br />Less than one percent of Catholic priests have even been accused of sexual abuse, but well over 90 percent of those have violated adolescent or older males.  The reason for that gay-friendly recommendation has become all too clear.  <br />Michael Rose deserves widespread acclaim for non-heretically exposing a cancer eating away at the Catholic Church in America.   Throughout this work, he displays a dogmatic loyalty to Church teaching that makes his findings all the more disturbing and important.  <br />By now everyone knows that the small percentage of priest whose sinister crimes brought deserved repudiation upon the Church as a whole were often enabled by hapless bishops.  Seeing what is tolerated in the seminaries helps isolate where the problem lies.  Episcopal oversight is either deficient in numerous American dioceses or in certain cases diabolical reprobates are serving as shepherds of the Church.  Now discredited ex-Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland proved in which category he fits with the happy realization that several seminarians \\"have had multiple sex partners...This is great.\\"   Not longer after the book's publication he resigned in disgrace after admitting to using church funds to pay off a long time male lover.  Ironically Boston's clueless Cardinal Law--who has become the poster child for Catholic humiliation is not covered in the body of this work.<br />From what Mr. Rose documents, certain American seminaries of have deteriorated into homosexual hot spots where dedicated men with a sincere calling are often turned off to their vocations by the toleration of the openly egregious rejection of celibacy.  Beyond the gay-affirming shenanigans, he exposes seminaries where feminist propaganda has replaced Catholic beliefs, adherence to liberal platitudes determines suitability for ordination, and courses in human sexuality celebrate pornography.  The stories he tells will break true Catholics' hearts, but baring these problems is necessary to resolving them.<br />Obviously a polemic of this nature--regardless of how meticulously annotated it is would almost beg for scorn from those with an axe to grind.  Surprisingly, some of the loudest caveats have been raised by those who are most fundamentally in agreement with Mr. Rose and in fact have been propounding the very same arguments--in some cases--for years.  Proudly orthodox Catholic publications (The Register, Crisis, etc.) have all raised issue with some of Mr. Rose's intimations.  None question the overall veracity of his thesis, but isolated instances of anecdotal evidence have been brought into question.  If the accusations are true, Mr. Rose is not guilty of false reporting, plagiarism, or slander.  If what his critics charge is accurate then he is guilty of the venal sin of sloppy fact verifying in a tiny percentage of instances.   Not to dismiss this flaw, but it pales compared to the mortal sins he illuminates--and everyone agrees they are authentic.<br />As unsettling a read as \\"Goodbye Good Men\\" is, every Catholic who is concerned about his religion should get a copy of this somber and disquieting revelation.	2002-09-15

In a solidly American tale, he vivifies his characters in palpable surroundings.  His narrative makes readers feel as though they are witnesses to the action as it takes place.<br />Against a backdrop of union politics in a factory town, the book takes a strong swipe at Communism while simultaneously decrying corporate greed.   Ironically, this work-published in the 1920s-while strongly opposed to Karl Marx's ruinous philosophy never uses the word, \\"communism.\\"   The repeated references are subtle but unmistakable as when a \\"foreign\\" labor-organizing rabble-rouser says that his greatest allegiance is to the \\"Big Union.\\"<br />On the other side of the coin, the criticisms of big business are limited to corruption and extreme selfishness.  These vices are seen as invidious precisely because they abuse capitalism.  The concept of getting rich via hard work is esteemed, as are the virtues of honesty, generosity, and devotion to one's fellow man.<br />One of the likable characters is murdered near the end of the book which is likely a device to show the horror of communism. In a disquieting move, a plea for the killer's clemency seems divagating at best and certainly unjustified given the story.  Despite that flaw, the book is a worthwhile read as much for its linguistic potency as for the emotionally inspiring plot.  \\"Helen of the Old House\\" is one more example of why the author of \\"Shepherd of the Hills\\" became known as the \\"Storyteller to America.\\"	2002-09-13

That oft-bellowed screed gave proof to the old adage that a lie told emphatically enough becomes truth. Obviously, excrement has no place in any valid work of art. Defaming religious symbols that have inspired for centuries debases aesthetic values. It is merely the controversy on which these modern day insurrectionists feed. Their concern for art takes a distant back seat to their lust for fame and money.<br />Lynn Munson efficiently documents the rampant hypocrisy within the so-called artistic society today. While the loudmouthed rebels who now control most of the arts establishment perpetually invoke the shibboleth of artistic freedom, the author paints a picture of greedy complainers whose goal is glory far more than artistic merit. The National Endowment for the Arts' obsequious funding programs may have played some role in fostering this change in artisans goals because the drive for acclaim was not always the primary artistic motivator. In the late 1960's when Lyndon Johnson--unquestionably with good intentions--created the National Endowment for the Arts--most of those creative folks truly valued the beauty of their trade. As Ms. Munson says, \\"the kinds of artists who received early NEA grants didn't choose artmaking as a professional path...and even the best of them expected to work their lives without public acknowledgement.\\" In an ironic aside, she explains how the NEA under Johnson advocated true art, but under the administration of the far more conservative Richard Nixon, avant-garde experimentalism became sacred and standard criteria acquired the status of passe.<br />Regarding those self-righteous voices who declaim against censorship whenever some crackpot with a perverted mind is not readily granted a government grant, Ms. Munson notes \\"successive NEA chairmen recited the mantras of censorship and artistic freedom even while maintaining a panel system that discriminated against artists outside the postmodern establishment.\\" Mentioning how real artists are now hardly given tertiary consideration by the ideologically-charged NEA, she says \\"how thoroughly the National Endowment for the Arts had become by 1995 at excluding precisely the caliber of artist it had rewarded in 1967, and how dimly the agency had come to be viewed by everyone but its dependents.\\"<br />In a further rejection of exquisite and graceful presentation, the author discusses how the modern museum has in many ways sought to eschew visual grandeur and make itself as prosaic as possible. She sites many examples of grandiose longstanding structures taking steps to shun their stimulating elegance and highlight mundane features.<br />As insulting as it is to know the NEA is wantonly flushing taxpayer money, its weird actions are not without humor. Ms. Munson introduces Bonnie Sherk who received an NEA grant in 1975 for a project that \\"involved shutting herself into a cement-floored studio with a few friends and numerous animals (a sow name Pigme, two ring-necked doves, a woolly monkey, etc.); together they would engage in 'building and maintaining nests.'\\" Readers will be left conjuring up an image of Pigme thinking \\"get me out here!\\"<br />A very hopeful sign concerns the change in Lynn Munson's status since the publication of eye-opening expose in 2002. She currently serves as the deputy director of National Endowment for the Humanities. So while the entire concept of federal subsidies to artsy enterprises remains dubious, if the bad policy must stay in place, it is far better to see taxpayer dollars doled out to support majestic sculptures and splendid grisailles than ordure originals.	2002-09-09
US	52806429	R2J3TRYQXXXOFE	0761534040	897968670	The New Thought Police: Inside the Left's Assault on Free Speech and Free Minds	Books	4	34	38	N	N	A Bona Fide Liberal Takes on the Leftist Establishment	The Word \\"liberal\\" is bandied about freely today--generally used to describe people and/or activities that are anything but truly liberal.  Tammy Bruce is one of the dying breed of genuine progressives for whom the label remains condign.  She is a supporter of gay rights, abortion advocate, and believer that women's studies and black studies programs have the potential for good.  Still her most unabashedly liberal principle is unquestionably her fervent conviction that someone may vehemently disagree with her and remain an intelligent, respectable member of civil society.  <br />While many critics have suggested that the feminist establishment sacrificed its principles toadying for Bill Clinton, Ms. Bruce argues that its credibility was floundering before it knelt at his concupiscent altar; although she acknowledges that the Clinton administration arranged for the first-ever federal funds to flow into NOW's coffers only after the president's sex-scandals became known.  Ms. Bruce proudly served in an executive position at the National Organization for Women, but her disillusionment with the NOW's practices started quickly as she unhappily discovered the group to be little more than a rudderless, sycophantic wing of the Democratic Party.  Her dismay is not limited to feminist illuminati; she excoriates the NAACP and other race hustlers while perhaps reserving her strongest denouncements for the intolerant gay rights establishment.   Discussing the campaign against Dr. Laura Schlessinger's controversial TV show, Ms. Bruce bravely assails the vitriol of GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) and other agenda-driven pressure groups to whom rationally presented opposing viewpoints are seen as dangerous.  Quoting the radio talk show host directly, rather than the distorted rhetoric so frantically oft-repeated, Ms. Bruce--an open lesbian--admits her disagreement, but does not perceive any threats from an intelligent person whose opinion contradicts her own.  However when she quotes directly from GLAAD's website, she does express some cause for concern at intimated threats toward companies that sponsored the targeted program.   She further relates purported suggestions of vandalism against retailers who advertised as well as intimidation and implied physical harm to all involved in the production or sponsorship of the program.  She juxtaposes this hysterical overreaction with the gay lobbys tepid protestations of hate-lyric rapper Eminem whose songs (for lack of a more appropriate word) glorify violence against homosexuals.  Referencing GLAADs pallid denunciation of a duet between gay avatar Elton John and Eminem as misguided, Ms. Bruce humorously remarks, that must have put the fear of God in both of them.<br />It is hard to imagine a more compelling or articulate case against hate crime legislation than Ms. Bruce offers.  Although she does not possess a legal background her comprehensive evaluation on the potential dangers of criminalizing thoughts should be read, analyzed, and debated in every American law school.  Sadly, that will not occur, because as she accurately laments analysis and debate are no longer celebrated, encouraged, and frighteningly not even allowed at many universities. <br />Her further discussion of politically correct race relations will be welcome to sensible New Jersey residents who should smugly grin reading over the author's dissection of the state's decade-long manufactured controversy, racial profiling.  Reviewing former attorney general and PC-activist appeaser Peter Veniero's dossier on the fabricated issue, she begins, \\"here's how Veniero's fable...er, report-put it\\" and expounds upon how his alleged investigation was in reality a vapid effort to placate all sides in the state's escalating issue.  She insightfully demonstrates how race baiters--with few sincere concerns for interracial harmony--have hijacked the debate.  Certain concepts such as widespread racially motivated injustice must be acknowledged as givens even if they do not really exist outside the elitist perspective.<br />Discussing the disgracefully exploited Matthew Shepherd killing, she tells of another brutal Wyoming murder that occurred around the same time.  Daphne Sulk, a 15-year-old, was murdered by the much older man who had impregnated her because she refused to have an abortion.  As. Ms. Bruce states, Daphnes brave stance was not a leftist cause celebre, but her life was just as valid as the young gay mans.  While it is reassuring that no pro-lifers abused her memory like the cottage industry that feeds off Mr. Shepherds tragic death, its interesting that it took a lesbian abortion-rights advocate to even introduce the martyred heroine to a national audience.<br />No section is as touching as the narration of events that occurred in the aftermath of the O.J. Simpson debacle.  A side effect of the travesty was Ms. Bruce's eventual departure from NOW.  She made no apologies for condemning a man found civilly liable for the death of his ex-wife, but the nation's number one feminist organization disapproved of what they--for convenience sake--labeled racism. While feminist movers and shakers may have been appalled by her post--O.J. activities, many ordinary citizens applauded her efforts to ostracize the despicable former gridiron star.  NOWs LA chapter office was flooded with calls and donations from those who knew of her leadership on the issue.  Many of those supporters opposed much of NOW's politics.  Poignantly, Ms. Bruce assured all pro-lifers, religious conservatives, Republicans, and other common adversaries that any money they gave would go exclusively to programs arising from the Simpson case and assiduously made certain than not even one penny was misapplied.<br />Tammy Bruce eloquently lays out her case and supports it with bushels of documentation.  Ironically though, her legion of so-called liberal critics has far surpassed her in proving the viewpoint that she is attempting to convey.  Only a handful of publications--most with a decidedly conservative tendency-- have even reviewed this thoughtful book, a far cry from the days when seeing her work published was as simple as making a phone call. The author believes that crazy ideas should be countered with strong contradictory arguments.  Obviously, those who dismiss her positions could not adequately refute them or they would not be afraid to confront them head on.	2002-08-10

As an immigrant, Mr. D'Souza appreciates the bounties of his adopted homeland far more that scores of native-born citizens who fail to fully comprehend the blessings of America.<br />It would take volumes to even list the basics of his subject, so at 218 pages he wisely limits his focus.   Within that narrowed purview, two basic tenets are worth citing for the persuasive way that they are presented.  Mr. D'Souza methodically undermines the florid sounding arguments in favor of multiculturalism, and he--perhaps more satisfactorily than multitudes before him--addresses the issue of slavery in America's founding.<br />What truly makes the exploration take wing is that it cannot be dismissed as gossamer by even the most adamant relativist proponent.  It is a deeply researched, intellectual articulation that America is the greatest nation on earth--far surpassing whoever could claim second place.<br />While the multicultural movement may shroud itself in egalitarian trappings, the author clearly sees the pernicious threats to this separatist mindset that has built a strong emplacement on most elite American college campuses.  Going hand-in-hand with anti-Americanism, Mr. D'Souza recounts many of the vituperative screeds eructed at these alleged institutes of higher learning and wisely remarks \\"could bin Laden have put it better?  If what these people say is true then America should be destroyed.\\"<br />Delving into the controversial discussion of slavery D'Souza acknowledges that America was founded predominantly by slave owners, but then enunciates a (in some circles) controversial point, \\"slavery has existed in all known civilizations\\" and lists several places around the world where the depraved industry flourished for centuries.  To further antagonize anti-American objicients, he also accurately states that unlike the universality of slavery, \\"abolition is an exclusively western institution.  Never in the history of the world, outside of the west, has a group of people eligible to be slave owners mobilized against the institution of slavery.\\"   Adding fuel to his raging fire, he notices goals of slave traders backfired and inadvertently, ultimately abetted the very people they were willing to exploit; \\"despite the corrupt and self-serving motives of their practitioners, the institutions of colonialism and slavery proved to be the mechanism that brought millions of nonwhite people into the orbit of Western freedom.\\"  To the many critics who condemn the founding fathers now over the tragedy of slavery, his commonsensical refutation will likely fall upon unlistening ears.  Although our 2002 morals justifiably often color our thinking, D'Souza is correct in stating \\"to outlaw slavery without the consent of the majority of whites would (have been) to destroy democracy, indeed to destroy the very basis for outlawing slavery itself.\\"<br />Regarding America's sole superpower status, D'Souza further instigates the multicultural elites with \\"previous empires have dominated their subjects through force.  Once again America is different in that its influence is not primarily sustained by force.\\" His completely authentic piece de résistance is \\"the ideologues who proclaim the equality of all cultures simply cannot account for why so many people around the world would seem perfectly willing to dump their ancient cultures and adopt new ways that they associate with America.\\"In the third world, beyond the rampant poverty, even the water treading middle class has little opportunity.  He lists several reason for this entropy; \\"the roads are not properly paved, the water is not safe to drink, pollution in the cities has reached hazardous levels, public transportation is overcrowded and unreliable, and there is a two year waiting period to get a phone.\\"   Like the late Cardinal Beradin  (in many wayshis political opposite) Mr. D'Souza bravely slays one of the multiculturalists' sacred cows, tolerance.  \\"If I tolerate you that implies I believe you are wrong.  I object to your views, but I'll put up with you.\\"  He will further aggrieve certain factions by stating how this now enshrined shibboleth was in stark contrast to the founding fathers views of mutual respect for different religions.<br />The author, who has debated Jesse Jackson and several other race hustlers on many occasions, shows little regard for those who use racial rhetoric to fuel divisive fires.  Some will be repelled by his honest assessment of America's lack of bigotry, \\"as an immigrant I am constantly surprised by how much I hear racism talked about and how little I actually see it.\\"<br />Beyond its commendable plug for the enumerable benefits of the Great Melting Pot, \\"What's So Great About America\\" has many other assets.  It is a book to be savored, but don't be surprised to find yourself singing \\"America the Beautiful\\" after finishing it.	2002-07-29

The Broken Hearth shines a spotlight on the deteriorating state of the nuclear family.  In a straightforward manner, he advocates common sense and traditional virtues.  He intellectually articulates obvious facts which are far too often simplistically dismissed as antediluvian or discriminatory by powerful forces throughout society.  One of Mr. Bennett's strong points is his dedication to veraciously stating the facts--even when they prove to be very inconvenient.<br />Discussing the spiraling rate of single parent households, he ignores the feel-good cliches and boldy says, \\"in attempting to raise children without two parents, we are seeing on a massive scale, the voluntary breakup of the minimal family unit.  This is historically unprecedented, an authentic cultural revolution and I believe socially calamitous.\\" Then Rather than citing specious studies showing the veritable irrelevance of parents, he acknowledges some of these much-ballyhooed findings and astutely refutes them.<br />The subject of gay marriage has become very controversial and even many who know how deleterious and debased the concept is,  shy from enunciating the problems with such a notion.  Here Mr. Bennett truly deserves commendation for his head-on approach in arguing the sensible, but politically untenable position against imploding the sanctity of marriage.   He writes the truth in all its unpopular, activist-enraging glory, \\"tolerance means treating people with respect and without malice; it does not require us to dissolve social norms or to weaken our commitment to ancient and honorable beliefs.\\"   While legions of movers and hordes of shakers will cringe at the mention of it, Mr. Bennett hits a home run with \\"if same-sex marriage were to prevail, society would have to accept certain basic assumptions; it would have to accept that Jewish and Christian understanding of marriage and family life is simply wrong.\\"   While his couragous statement is potent as is, to further enforce his argument and co-opt a politically correct shibboleth to boot, he could have added that Islam, Buddhism, and several other religions view the concept of homosexuality marriage as decadent and are far more condemning of it that Judaism and Christianity.  Equally polemic is the painfully true statement that \\"for homosexuals themselves gay liberation has wrought much agony, instability, promiscuity, and early death.\\"  Still his blunt acknowledgement shows compassion that activists often lack; not everyone is happy in the sexually uninhibited gay lifestyle.<br />In perhaps the book's most appropriate passage, he countervails the charge that conservatives overlook the transgressions of like-minded players.  Mr. Bennett validly denounces Newt Gingrich for the extra-marital affair, and he gets to the heart of the former Speaker's peccadillo.  Too many conservatives concentrated on the authentic difference that Bill Clinton's adultery lead to felonious crimes, while Newt was merely morally guilty.  Mr. Bennett wisely ignores that diversionary fact in chastising Gingrich for his serious wrongdoing.  He comments that \\"to the degree that Newt Gingrich was criticized, and he was, it was for his hypocrisy...Gingrich's hypocrisy was disturbing, but so too were his actions.\\" <br />\\"The Broken Hearth\\" offers no banal quick-fix to a crisis that has been decades in the making, but it comprehensively summarizes the precariousness of where we now find ourselves.  Hopefully it will serve as an impetus for a few readers to reevaluate their lives.  A problem that didn't develop overnight will not be solved quickly either.	2002-07-13
US	52806429	R303O4LNBFBVUG	0785272372	824556097	Won by Love: Norma McCorvey, Jane Roe of Roe V. Wade, Speaks Out for the Unborn As She Shares Her New Conviction for Life	Books	5	32	42	N	N	From Emptiness to Fulfillment	While rabid abortion-rights activists will be reluctant to look beyond the surface of Norma McCorvey's transformation, open-minded readers of all ideological leanings will be moved by this story of a human being's redemption. Political considerations do not diminish the literary strength behind this moving tale of a badly lost soul who finally found her way home. One would have to be blindly biased not to celebrate her emotional repristination. Life as Jane Roe was empty and painful; life as Norma McCorvey is now full and joyous.<br />Norma came from the wrong side of the tracks, and while she was not a completely unwilling pawn in the judicial maneuverings that lead to the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade, she was never embraced by the powers-that-be behind the cause she unwittingly came to embody. Throughout the book she demonstrates that the Ivy League feminists had little use for a blue-collar, drinking, drug-abusing, poorly-spoken, foul-mouthed, high school dropout carnival barker.  She even learned of the Supreme Court's decision by catching it in a newspaper write-up. So encompassing was feminist illuminati's eschewing of her, that she was not invited to most major pro-abortion marches, or even to the 20th anniversary White House commemoration with Feminist-in-Chief Hillary Clinton. On the rare occasions when her paths did cross with the ilk of Gloria Steinhem/Kate Michelman/Molly Yard et al., the meetings were usually openly confrontational. One exception was the iconoclastic feminist Gloria Allred. Ms. Allred's brave call for President Clinton to resign on account of his criminal actions--even though she staunchly supported his agenda--brought her scorn from the left (CNN all but barred for life) and praise from scores of her normal nemeses on the right, and she should earn considerably more anomalous approbation/opprobrium by revelations contained here.  Norma describes Ms. Allred as the one feminist who always treated her respectfully and unhesitantly acknowledges that today her regard for this political opponent remains high. Among Ms. Allred's credits were her efforts to prevent Norma from drinking before she would appear on television and her discouragement of the insecure woman's narcotic indulgences.<br />Unquestionably the plot's most fantastic twist occurs after Operation Rescue--the civil disobedience prolife group--moved in next door to the abortion clinic where Norma was working. Despite opposite goals, Norma amazingly formed friendships with several Rescue staff members and one in particular who grew so trusting of the infamous foe that she actually let her eight year old daughter play under Jane Rose's tutelage inside the clinic.  Were this book a work of fiction, most readers would slam it down in disgust at the farfetched contrivance in that chapter, but as the cliche goes, \\"truth is stranger...\\"<br />Obviously Norma's story would be inchoate without a portion devoted to the horrors of the abortion trade, and from her days as an insider she possesses an armamentarium that far surpasses most right-to-life advocates.  She makes little effort to conceal her disdain for her clinic's smarmy, avaricious abortionist--whom she never identifies beyond \\"Arnie,\\" and reveals an industry secret \\"that a disproportionate number of abortion doctors are actually from other countries--foreigners who perceive that our lax abortion laws create a tremendous moneymaking opportunity.\\" Her contempt for this physician who was always barefoot in the office seems appropriate when she discusses how as his wife battled breast cancer, he moved a mistress into their home. While he is the only abortionist profiled in the book, Norma's implications are clear. Referring to the reality of the work in an abortion clinic, Norma admits that on-the-job cocaine usage was commonplace among most workers (and honestly admits to frequent abuse of the drug herself) \\"drugs became a major tool to keep the peace; drugs got us through theday.\\" Even abortion proponents should be outraged when she explains political pressure has resulted in a situation where \\"veterinary clinics have stricter regulations than abortion clinics.\\"<br />One of the book's most poignant moments has to be Norma's revelation of her change of heart to her loving--if dysfunctional--father on his deathbed. The man who had begged her not to abort any of her children (and as she relates he had implored his wife to allow Norma to live decades earlier), was too weak to talk but smiled brightly and gestured affirmatively when she held up a Christian, pro-life shirt.<br />One powerful vignette concerns a post-conversion encounter with a stranger. The young mother allowed Norma to hold her baby. After returning the child Norma remarked how beautiful the child was eliciting a smile and thanks from the mother. Contrasting this subtly joyous experience with her previous vocation, she keenly states, \\"it dawned on me that I've never had a woman get up to leave an abortion clinic and say 'thank you' before she walked out the door.\\"<br />In a mordant aside at media bias, Norma mentions that after her tergiversation many interviewers asked about her long time lesbian relationship. (She has long since renounced that lifestyle as did her former partner.) Tellingly, she says that the subject of lesbianism never came up during her decades of interviews as an abortion-rights supporter.<br />While the subject of abortion has become a polemic that many run from rather than discuss, it is always beneficial to have a reasonable ratiocination of both perspectives to any divisive topic.

Occasionally, bordering on the esoteric due to its advanced discussion of ancient Sparta and more-than-passing mentions of some other abstruse historical topics, certain sections of the treatise may overwhelm some readers.  Still those who must plod through the first few chapters will be handsomely rewarded with the book's later essays.  The testimonials to Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglas alone make it a beneficial read.  In these two sections, Bern's ideas illuminate and his prose soars.  Of our 16th president he rhapsodically ponders, \\"what Lincoln did at Gettysburg was to create new mystic chords, stretching from a new battlefield to new graves, to our hearts and hearthstones, all over this broad land, South as well as North, reminding us of the cause written in our book, the Declaration of Independence.\\"<br />Analyzing Frederick Douglas' life and the impact he left behind, Mr. Berns offers some notions that defy longstanding, putative preconceptions.  Mr. Douglas, himself rattles the established elite thinking when he is quoted as saying, \\"the federal Government was never in its essence anything but anti-slavery...If in its origin, slavery had any relation to the government, it was only as the scaffolding to the magnificent structure, to be removed as soon as the building was completed.\\"  Mr. Berns may not employ such majestic imagery but is nearly as profound when he deftly delves into present day race relations.  Contrasting today`s military with modern college life, he challengingly notes that \\"enlisted men--blacks and whites--live in the same barracks, eat in the same mess halls, and although not required, frequently at the same table--something rarely encountered in universities.\\"  Interestingly, interracial harmony is found in the one environment where everyone is treated as an individual, while the debatably well intentioned \\"diversity\\" dictates of the other often lead to an unspoken, rigid separatism. <br />The final chapter, \\"The Patriot's Flag\\" presents genuinely stimulating insights on the First Amendment--so skillfully abused over the past fifty years.  The very term \\"speech\\" has somehow been contorted into meaning a hodgepodge of nonverbal activities.  Mr. Berns thoroughly appraises the Supreme Court's outrageous decision legalizing flag burning and successfully shows the sophistry of its ruling.  Supporters of this spurious ruling may bristle when he writes \\"the First Amendment protects freedom of speech not expression, and whereas all speech may be expression, not all expression is speech\\" because his reasoning is as sublime as it is succinct.  He suggests that spray painting graffiti on the Lincoln Memorial is not likely to be allowed under a torturous stretch of freedom of speech and wisely concludes, \\"there is something about the memorial that forbids its desecration, and because it, too causes us to remember, the same ought to be true of the flag.\\"<br />At times his arguments become a trifle too abstract and the book's pace may hesitate occasionally, but several nuggets of wisdom can be gleaned from these pages.  It sets forth many concepts that every Americans should contemplate, and it summons us all to evaluate whether or not we are taking our American birthright for granted.	2002-07-10
US	52806429	R32PY5E90VPQAA	0743211359	679898926	Saddam's Bombmaker: The Daring Escape of the Man Who Built Iraq's Secret Weapon	Books	5	11	13	N	N	From Iraq to America	Khidir Hamza presents a truly unique view of two antipodal societies--neither fully appreciated by most Americans.  His insider's view of Iraq shows the desperation and danger than entraps the innocent populace under Saddam Hussain's megalomaniac reign.  Likewise, his eventually fulfilled lifetime longing for the bounties of America shows a patriotic appreciation for the freedoms most native born citizens spend theirs lives taking for granted.<br />His authentic story would stretch the boundaries of the most creative novelists.  Visual imagery rivaling Dickens' \\"Bleak House\\" makes the hopelessness of daily life in Iraq vividly real, and his ultimate escape from Saddam's clutches challenges Tom Clancy's most intricate yarn.  Making the adventure even more chilling is his longtime easy access to the highest levels of Saddam's government.  As a player and eventual head of Iraqi's nuclear program, Dr. Hamza was privy to the palace's inner machinations.  From the unrestrained use of torture for any perceived slight to Saddam's clintonian-caliber sexual conquests, Dr. Hamza shares it all from his close-up vantage point. <br />Among the book's most interesting features are several almost desultory anecdotes.  Curiously, Iraq allows considerably more religious freedom than most predominantly Islamic countries; Christianity is largely ignored.  After the Gulf War, Saddam's probably- not-irrational fear of revolt reassigned much of the nation's depleted resources to maintaining order--a catchall phrase often used to justify unprovoked massacres.  Penury and entropy flooded the country as many industries folded, while Saddam also built himself three new palaces (to add to the dozens he already owned.) Dr. Hamza remarks that several Muslim charities misappropriated donations intended to help the poor--much of it was rerouted into corrupt imams' pockets.  Conversely, Christian charities diligently distributed their sparse resources to those in the greatest need.  He even sites one Christian minister who denied his own brother because his meager income was greater than the average pauper.<br />Discussing Saddam's lack of interest in world travel, Dr. Hamza mentions that his only two official visits to non-Arab states brought him to Moscow and Paris where a hero's welcome greeted him in both capitols.  Major changes in Russia as well as clearly revealed picture of Saddam's evil nature would likely negate a repeat embrace in Moscow.  Conversely, with recent developments betraying France's present descent from civilization's standards, it is easy to see loving throngs welcoming a return visit there in 2002.<br />Those who perceive a decline in intelligence activities starting under the Clinton administration will not be surprised to hear of the CIA's reluctance to cooperate when Dr. Hamza first contacted them with a request to defect.  Over a year passed while the CIA dilly-dallied with the possibility of acquiring information that could save millions of lives in the free world, but fortunately even the dilatory interstice did not deter Dr. Hanna's quest for the American Dream and he was eventually accepted.  The inspiring story of getting his family out is another beguiling facet that employed enough ingenuity to put James Bond to shame.<br />Among the autobiography's many uplifting messages is Dr, Hamza's devotion to his marriage.  At the age of thirty he entered into an arranged marriage with a 15 year-old, but his unflinching commitment to her stands as testament to how seriously he viewed his husbandly obligations.  In a telling revelation about Iraq, he describes once flying back from a international government mission to accompany his wife while she went into labor because Iraqi hospitals do not extend major efforts in caring for women--even the wife of a high-ranking government official--unless a man is around to hector the staff.<br />Both the tenacity and temerity of the Israeli military are displayed by two incidents in the book.  First was the completely unanticipated bombing of Iraq's nascent nuclear reactor in the early 1980's.  A move that despite snarling in the West must have been greatly appreciated by the allied forced during the Gulf War.  The second ingenious maneuver occurred when Israeli troops landed in convincingly disguised Iraqi helicopters and planted an underground spy satellite.  Many witnesses overheard the imposters speaking authentic Iraqi slang.<br />To eliminate any doubt about Saddam's evil nature, Dr. Hamza discussed the sustained, multi-faceted biological and chemical weapon experimentation on Iraqi solders and civilians which he rightly names \\"one of the most grisly episodes of these awful weapons in history.\\"  Atrocities ranging from transferring political prisoners to a \\"pesticide factory\\" to poisoning the water supply of unsuspecting rural dwellers bare bold witness to the Iraqi despot's insensate turpitude.   <br />Underlining the whole narrative is a version of the typical American immigrant's story. The circumstances may deviate greatly, but as for so many others, the beacon of liberty beckoned.  For decades, it looked like Dr. Hamza and his family--financially sound in Iraq--would never be among those blessed tempest-tossed souls who would make it.  Fortunately like so many other first generation Americans, perseverance and kismet intersected and he successful reached the Shining City on the Hill.	2002-07-10

He attended red elementary and high schools (whose curriculum could match any modern-day college campus) and even spent his childhood summers at socialist camp. His life story reads like the perfect description to yield a grown-up replication of Hillary Clinton or Bella Abzug.  But something went right along the way.<br />From a very young age, he embodied a devotion to the truth (or at least, like his parents, what he honestly believed was valid), and this veracity eventually lead him astray (or home depending upon one's point of view.)  Ironically, the term \\"fellow travelers\\" has become cliche in communist circles, and Mr. Radosh uses it generously throughout this work, but he, the ex-communist, is the one who \\"traveled\\" away from a dead-end philosophy, while the so-called \\"travelers\\" continued to ram into brick walls, getting nowhere at all.<br />The drive to satisfy his inquisitive nature lead to many disappointments with communist ideals, but three incidents seemed to cement his conversion from the failed mindset.  Along with a select ruck of fellow travelers he was invited to spend a month in Cuba--an offer he joyously accepted.  However, touring the island prison, he painfully learned that the Cuban reality was a far cry from communist lure.  Despite communism's promise of complete equality, he encountered a nation where the ruling class lived like kings while the working class lived in hopeless squalor and dissenters and eccentrics were subject to arbitrary institutionalization, torture, and execution.  Touring a mental hospital where innocent dissidents routinely underwent lobotomies tore Mr. Radosh's heart.  However, his reaction was not shared by Castro's other American toadies; one of whom dismissed the author's concerns with the seriously spoken statement, \\"We have to understand that there are differences between capitalist lobotomies and socialist lobotomies.\\"<br />A second transmogrifying occurrence,that pays loud testimony to Mr. Radosh's integrity, was his undertaking the writing of what would become the definitive biography of the Rosenbergs.  As a teenager, he had protested the spy couple's execution, fully convinced that they were innocent scapegoats murdered by a tyrannical government who had framed them for a false crime.  He knew the Rosenberg sons, and in his circle Julius and Ethel were icons of unsurpassed stature.  Upon the government's release of all documentation regarding the espionage case, Mr. Radosh determined to provide the martyred Rosenbergs posthumous exoneration.  He was cataclysmically dismayed when the evidence conclusively proved that they were indeed guilty as charged.  Many people with such strongly held convictions would have abandoned the project rather than publish a book that thoroughly refuted them.  It speaks volumes about his character that he concluded his work despite having to change the thesis 180 degrees.  Yet this inspiring honesty was not seen admirably by much of the left.  \\"The Rosenberg Files\\" author earned widespread ostracization by his leftist peers, even many of those who agreed with its verisimilitude.  Too many felt that the myth of the Rosenberg image should maintain its luster to sustain the cause--regardless of what the facts proved.<br />The third and final disillusioning upheaval he experienced happened during Nicaragua's Civil War.  Like all good leftists, he supported the Sandinista regime, and all like all good truth-seekers, he wanted to comprehensively investigate the issues involved.  Embarking on a hegira to the Sandinista camps during the war, he was shocked by abundant human rights abuses in stark contrast to all the agitprop about the regime's liberation.  Mingling with a veritable who's who of leftism, he humorously relates his meetings with Bianca Jagger.  The internationally renowned airhead seemed especially defensive of one particularly brutal Sandinista general.  The origin of her supportsoon became obvious, as he regularly arrived at the motel late at night and disappeared into her suite until the wee hours of the morning.  Appalling many of his fellow traveling ideologues, by agreeing to venture someplace they would never go--The Contras' Camps, he was again rattled to see humanitarianism and a thrust for democracy and fairness.  Publicly siding with the freedom-fighting contras once again earned him the wrath of his fellow travelers, but this time he moved on leaving them all behind.<br />Ironically, it was the aimless fellow travelers who have repeatedly sacrificed their ideals to maintain allegiance to a cause whose bankruptcy constantly reveals itself.  Ronald Radosh was the one who remained true to his principles--human rights, equality, fairness, and openness.   He may have the liked platitudinous rhythms of socialism, but like anyone secure in his beliefs felt that further investigation is always beneficial.  Although he bravely confesses that his misguided actions were extremely negative, he is correct in acknowledging that now \\"the capacity for harm is diminished because so many stood solidly behind America while we tried to bring it down. The country is stronger for having encountered and withstood us.\\"  Interestingly, while Mr. Radosh eventually found a rich sense of inner peace and self-respect, his adherence to ideals--rather than ideology--stands as a bold example that all of us, fellow travelers as well as those who never boarded, should emulate.	2002-07-10

Extensive womanizing back when he truly was lonesome, ornery, and mean left many good-hearted women heartbroken.  Waylon didn't have to reveal so much dirty linen from his past, but at least now we can be certain he had always been crazy but it kept him from going insane.  He could and probably should have shown more regrets for some erstwhile indiscretions, but most likely his legacy will not forfeit the love of the common people because country's fans are loyal to a fault.  <br />Even if he thought he was too dumb for New York City and too ugly for L.A., he and many of his contemporary honky tonk heroes have considerably more talent than most of those warmed over rockers played on country radio today.   The autobiography conclusively proves that we may have lost the wolf, but the wolf's music will survive.	2002-04-05

Bernard Goldberg is not delivering any earth-shattering news with the publication of this best-selling expose.  Anyone imbued with even a shred of common sense knows that the major news media are prone to a liberal bias.  Think only of much-married Peter Jennings disdainful description of the American voters after 1994's elections returned both houses of Congress to Republican control, \\"The Washington Post\\" objectively reporting that Christians are \\"largely poor, uneducated, and easy to command,\\" Time Magazine's cover photo asking \\"How Mean Will Newt be,\\" and countless other incidents that have shown a liberal bias to be irrefragably instituted in the world of high-caliber journalism.<br />What makes this work so potent is that it represents perhaps the first significant fissure in the media`s code of silence.  Bernard Goldberg spent nearly three decades as a well-respected, 6-time Emmy-winning insider at CBS News.  Furthermore, he is an unabashed liberal in the truest sense of the word.  Within these pages he confesses to having never voted for a Republican president, supporting gay rights, and believes \\"welfare is absolutely essential\\"--not the typical ravings of your average vast right wing conspirator.  Despite his political leanings, he never abandoned a sense of fairness and a devotion to balance--a benchmark of genuine liberalism.<br />As a media player, he was privy to the unadulterated bias firsthand and shares much of the shocking evidence he accumulated over the years. Authentic examples include taking a  nationwide network conference call where one producer stoically termed Gary Bauer \\"that little nut from the Christian Group\\" to the constant labeling of \\"conservative\\" while never branding \\"liberal.\\"  He also describes how alleged \\"factual\\" reporting of certain issues like AIDS and homelessness regularly borders more on mythology than reality.<br />Mr. Goldberg understands the value of using sarcasm appropriately, and at times while accentuating his point, his narration becomes uproariously funny.   Reviewing impeachment coverage, he recalls how Peter Jennings talking over a group of senator referred to every Republican as very conservative, rather conservative etc. but did make similar remarks about the Democrats (liberal or very liberal.)  He honestly and humorous suggests that \\"there's a better chance that Peter Jennings, the cool sophisticated Canadian would identify Mother Teresa as `the old broad who used to work in India'\\"  then suggest a liberal may be ideology-inclined.   In another instance he writes \\"Meredith Vieira of `the View' went to Shea Stadium to make a jackass out of herself.\\"  Considering the sleazy, irrelavent questions she asked Mets' players, his description could be somewhat of an understatement.  The liberal elites'odium toward those who dare not toe the line was made crystal clear to the author when Rush Limbaugh started singing his praises.  As he half-jokingly reveals \\"I would have been better off if Saddam Hussein, O.J. Simpson, and Charles Manson had held a joint news conference to tell the world what a great guy I was.\\"<br />Unfortunately this important work is gravely diminished by one incredibly imbecilic aside.  In an intelligent chapter devoted to important issues that generate scant media coverage, Mr. Goldberg begins by reviewing certain stories that metastasized into media circuses.   He rightly scoffs at non-issues like Joey Buttafucco, Lorena Bobbitt, and Tonya Harding, and justifiably--if callously-- includes Jon Benet Ramsey, Chandra Levy, and Nicole Brown-Simpson.  While these stories were tragic, media coverage exploited them and made mountains out what--on a newsworthy level-- were little more than molehills.  However, seemingly desperate to emulate Meredith Vieira, he incorporated the Elian Gonzalez travesty in this category of stories.  How an obviously intelligent news professional can view a story where the U.S. Government's highest-ranking officials stole a page from the nazis' playbook and obliterated all Constitutional rubrics as trivial is almost beyond comprehension.  The fact that he presented such a ridiculous point in a chapter on underreported serious stories further stretches credulity.  Had he mentioned that salient aspects of the story were ignored in very superficial coverage, he could have enhanced his argument, but such a preposterous proposition inflicts severe damage on the articulate case he laid out throughout this otherwise clearheaded book.  Dan Rather who now seethes at the mere mention of Mr. Goldberg's name and the other media movers and shakers furious that their secret is out would do well to quote this reference in attacking the author's credibility. <br />\\"Bias\\" is definitely worth a read, but that one idiotic off-the-cuff statement greatly reduces the luster from what otherwise would have been a journalistic classic.	2002-03-10

Although he sedulously guard their privacy, enough references exist to reveal the power he derived from his family's love.<br />The timelessness of ideals can be witnessed again and again in Roosevelt's detailed autobiography, and the parallels to modern day America as are striking as they are plentiful. <br />In one instance of foresight Roosevelt lambastes so-called \\"party bosses\\"--those who manipulate a community, \\"a man who does not gain his power by open means but by secret means and usually by corrupt means.\\" He points out that \\"in communities where there is poverty and ignorance, the conditions are ripe for the growth of a boss,\\" and this type of reprobate will be \\"especially common in big cities (because the boss) fulfills toward the people of his district in rough and rowdy fashion the position of friend and protector.\\"  From these snippets of his dissertation, it's easy to wonder if somehow President Roosevelt boarded a time machine and met Al Sharpton.  A more thorough description of the unordained reverend (and his many counterparts throughout history)  cannot be found than this astute indictment.<br />He expounds at some length on the president's scared privilege of dispensing clemency and stresses the there \\"nothing more necessary from the standpoint of good citizenship than the ability to steel one's heart in this matter of granting pardons.\\"  (How he must have spun in his grave at Clinton's going-out-of-business pardon sale.) Talking about the anguished imploring of family members(which caused him great anxiety) and the bumptious attempted influence by friends of celebrated criminals (which caused him great anger), Mr. Roosevelt  realized that this presidential prerogative should only be used to advance the cause of justice. The remote possibility that pardoning could be abused (a reality that did not develop at the presidential level until 100 years after his term) made him think that life imprisonment was a poor substitute for the death penalty.  In a related vain, he saw the insanity plea as a scurrilous cop out; \\"I have scant sympathy with the plea of insanity advanced to save a man from the consequences of crime, when unless that crime had been committed, it would have been impossible to commit him to an asylum for the insane.\\" <br />Spotlight-adoring Senator John McCain routinely invokes the memory of President Roosevelt, presumptiously implying that he is somehow the heir apparent to the early 1900's maverick.  Examining Teddy Roosevelt's life shows that those similarities exist almost solely in the Arizona senator's mind.  While Roosevelt's unwavering integrity made him unpopular, at times, with many in his own party, McCain fluctuating political postures seem to occur primarily to generate headlines.  The former president justifiably felt tremendous self-respect--a byproduct of adhering to probity's rubrics.  The Arizona senator self-serving pandering for popularity would be comical were it not so insulting that the philodox so willingly slanders a bona fide American icon to further his own career.<br />Ironically, this reviewer read Roosevelt's disdainful view of abortion on January 22--the anniversary of the Supreme Court's infamous Roe vs. Wade decision.  Discussing the crimes where even receiving a request to consider  a pardon assaulted his sense of decency, he listed, \\"rape, or the circulation of indecent literature, ...\\"white slave\\" traffic (prostitution), or wife murder, or gross cruelty to women and children, or seductionand abandonment, or the action of some man in getting a girl whom he had seduced to commit an abortion.\\"  To President Roosevelt there was no other plausible reason why a woman would kill her unborn child.  Some would call him sexist today, but the venom he felt (and the punishment he unhesitantly administered) to the men who committed these crimes should show the fallacy of such a ridiculous accusation.<br />Topical comparisons can be found in his discussion on the importance of both corporations to maintain ethical practices and for the government to refrain from needless meddling in business matters. Futhermore he offers a reasoned dialectic on immigration, strongly supporting it but trenchantly articulating that establishing tight limits can be sensible rather than xenophobic.<br />It is also refreshing to know that the irresponsible peaceniks vociferously denouncing America's full-scale war on terrorism have had their equally harebrained doppelgangers throughout history. To all of these possibly well intentioned pacifists, Teddy Roosevelt admonishes \\"the true preachers of peace...never hesitate to choose righteous war when it is the only alternative to unrighteous peace.\\"<br />Similarly regarding the current threat America faces, Mr. Roosevelt puts forth some comfort and assurance with an unforeseeable but apt reference to President Bush; \\"no man can lead a public career really worth leading, no man can act with rugged independence in serious crises, nor strike at great abuses, nor afford to make powerful and unscrupulous foes, if he is himself vulnerable in his private character.\\"  Every American should be thankful that the terrorists did not strike during the previous administration and also grateful the example of heroes like Theodore Roosevelt stands as everlasting inspiration to our nation's current and future leaders.	2002-02-04

Such valor is on bold display throughout C. Mason Weaver's short treatise.<br />Mr. Weaver's story is not all that uncommon: young liberal comes face-to-face with reality as he matures and suddenly realizes he is a conservative after all.  However, such tergiversations are not permitted within the Black community--or at least not among self-appointed Black spokesmen nor the entrenched bureaucracies that survive on keeping racial hostility simmering.  It is precisely this perpetual anger that Mr. Weaver defines as one of the most damaging detriments affecting the liberal Black \\"leaders.\\" He unabashedly proclaims that \\"we should celebrate the victory instead of nagging about the need for the war.\\"<br />There seems to be no taboo fact that he is unwilling to state.  A proud and thoughtful Republican, he does not see the appellation \\"Party of the Rich\\" as a pejorative.  He bluntly offers, \\"the Democrats were always taking from those mean `rich' people to help the poor...(while) the Republicans wanted as many of us wealthy as possible.\\"  He dismisses the fabricated Kwanzaa as \\"a make believe story full of errors and falsehoods,' but strongly advocates celebrating legitimate historical days of importance to the Black Community like Martin Luther King's Day.  Such valid occasions are important to ALL Americans.  He is unafraid about bringing up the true racism of certain liberal icons.  Like the equally brilliant Reverend Jesse Lee Petersen, he openly discusses the prejudice of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger whose opinions earned her accolades in Nazi Germany.  Demonstrating both in-your face honesty and enviable wit, he titles one of his sub-chapters, \\"The War on Poverty is Over--and Poverty Won.\\"  His denunciation of misguided welfare programs further exhibits his striking intellect.<br />As the title intimates, Mr. Weaver skillfully employs the semantics of slavery throughout his work.  He sees the monolithic Black viewpoint demanded from the modern day so-called civil rights establishment as a present-day version of the plantation.  Those who dare to think outside the accepted box are the heirs of those courageous souls who bolted their \\"masters'\\" cotton farms for freedom. Both sets of rebels were courageous and tenacious, and each group persevered through diligence and hard work which the author rightly argues is the only option that yields success.<br />Mr. Weaver's intelligent work was published five years ago. It is time to hear more erudite assessments from his patriotic and empowering voice.	2002-01-02

At one level she has written a work that will afford future generations a better understanding of our 40th president.  Simultaneously she contrasts Reagan with one of his successors.   As a much sought after pundit, Ms. Noonan spent a great deal of the nineties expostulating on the misbehavior of William Jefferson Clinton, and while his name is rarely regurgitated in this work, astute readers will often feel a sly smile as esoteric allusions to Clinton are made.   Given the author's informed opinion on each man, the temptation to openly contrast these two polar opposites must have been strenuously beckoning.  Showing herculean restraint, she merely makes sporadic, shrewd inferences leaving the obvious correlations to the reader's conjecture which makes the cunning contrasts all the more powerful.<br />Beyond mere biography, the tome assays the inner workings of Reagan and the author repeatedly discovers character as his nexus.  While Ms. Noonan unabashedly holds Reagan in high-esteem, this discussion is not a devotional hagiography; it never shies away from his weaknesses or mistakes.  She explores Reagan's troubled relationship with his children, and an entire chapter details the Iran-Contra affair.  After itemizing the plot of the infamous debacle, she reaches the reasoned conclusion that Reagan's well-intentioned appointees employed thoughtless and nefarious means to achieve their noble goals or as she succinctly summed it up: \\"good reasons for bad actions, but bad actions nonetheless.\\"  This determination would not apply to any of the myriad Clinton scandals.   Selling the Lincoln bedroom, priapic conquests, burning down the Waco compound, kidnapping Elian Gonzales and betraying his mother's heroic sacrifice, perjury and obstruction of justice--are merely \\"bad actions\\" with no \\"good reasons\\" behind them.<br />Discussing the consistency of President Reagan, Noonan teases with, \\"he was not given to conceit...didn't show up places late because he's the most important and interesting man invited, so the fun will have to start when he gets there\\" which provides an indirect mnemonic of Bill Clinton's legendary procrastination as he stood up heads of state all over the world.<br />In discussing Ronald Reagan's veracity, she declares, \\"Ronald Reagan loved the truth; we all do or say we do but for Reagan it was like fresh water, something he needed and wanted.\\"  No memory jogging remark is necessary to conjure up the image of former first perjurer making \\"legally accurate\\" statements about not having sexual relations with that women--his regular trysting partner.<br />When President Reagan was rushed to the hospital after the assassination attempt, the confusion of what was causing his difficulty--before it was determined he had been shot-- forced the desperate hospital staff to rip off all his clothes before he even made it into the operating room.  Pondering this heretofore unreleased fact prompts obvious consideration of how often Bill Clinton must have been similarly unattired in unfamiliar locales.  Making any such implication overtly would have demeaned President Reagan, but Peggy Noonan doubtlessly knew what seed she was planting in readers' minds.<br />One of the few direct comparisons ironically concerns their acting abilities. She writes that \\"all of our great modern presidents have been actors...the key always is to be an actor without being a phony, without being insincere, inauthentic, not true to yourself.\\"  Pointing out how Reagan, along with JFK and FDR mastered this art, she bluntly adds that \\"(Clinton) was by the end seen even by his friends as a more gifted phony than a gifted actor.\\"<br />One of the subtlest stabs can be picked up from the heartwarming tale of Ronald Reagan's meeting with Frances Green.  Mrs. Green was an 83-year old California widow who received a standard invitation to the White House from the RNC but misinterpreted in as a personal invitation.  She bravely traversed across the nation, and after a series of setbacks actually got to meet the president inside the Oval Office where he treated her like a visiting dignitary.  Reagan's chivalrous treatment of this out-of-her-element guest stands in stark contradiction to Clinton's exploitation of his slatterns within the same confines.<br />In certain passages Peggy Noonan is slyly winking to those familiar with her work.  At one point she discusses Reagan and the Secret Service's mutual admiration: \\"Reagan liked his Secret Service agents a lot, respected their professionalism, and they loved him.  This isn't always the case with presidents.\\"  In her previous effort, \\"The Case Against Hillary Clinton\\" she detailed the Clintons disdain for those entrusted to sacrifice their lives for their safety.  Regularly treating them as bellhops, Hillary especially was not diffident in subjecting her bodyguards to her vituperative invective.  Bill, of course, expected them to play dumb while he indulged his adolescent sexual fantasies. <br />Generations from now, when Clinton has been relegated to an insignificant demerit, \\"When Character Was King's\\" delicate hints to his dissimilarities with Reagan will be lost to all but history buffs.  However, like modern readers, our descendants will be left saying \\"Thank you President Reagan for restoring America's greatness.\\"	2002-01-01

No vignette is particularly earth-shattering, but perhaps it is the mundane and wholesome nature of his experiences that makes them all the more engrossing.<br />While few observers would term Jimmy Carter a great president, only the most blindly partisan Republicans fail to see him as a noble patriot overflowing with integrity.  These identifying attributes are quietly displayed throughout the episodes he narrates.  Even when he steps on a few toes, they are feet that deserve it.  Those with a phobia about vestiges of Christianity in public schools will shutter when he writes of his childhood, \\"it would have been ridiculous in those days for anyone in our community, or the state of Georgia, to think that the dedicated religious services that were held every day in the public school might violate in any way the First Amendment.\\" The former president sees great value in the school's religious presentations \\"because they reached every child, not just the churchgoers.\\"  Such virtuous suasion may earn him membership in the vast right wing conspiracy in some circles, but unabashed honesty forms the basis of Jimmy Carter.<br />Perusing his others Yuletide tales spent in the Navy, as a young father and husband, serving as Georgia's governor, on to the White, House, and back home again, readers may be disappointed by the skeletal nature of certain chapters.  However, Carter's post-presidency has produced a substantial oeuvre, and other works can undoubtedly flesh out the missing tidbits. <br />Maybe the book's greatest strength is near complete avoidance of the political realm.  Carter seems to be saying that Christmas is for all Americans, and while politics has its place, it takes a back seat--or at least it should-- to our nation's sacred holidays.	2001-12-30
US	52806429	R10BGUI0D8PXI	0684843161	123160711	A RETURN TO MODESTY: Discovering the Lost Virtue	Books	4	18	24	N	N	A Return to Passion and Romance	Years ago I read an article in &quot;Reader's Digest&quot; entitled &quot;Our Politically Correct Bathroom.&quot; It was about the complete abandonment of common sense that had taken place in some college (which one escaped me) where dormitories had introduced coed lavatories--apparently a fad currently in place at many left-leaning, normalcy-rejecting, so-called institutions of higher learning. While I did not remember the college in question or the author, the piece stayed in my mind attesting to its literary strength as much as its sapient thesis.<br />Buried deep in &quot;Return to Modesty&quot; Wendy Shalit mentions that while enrolled at Williams College, she authored that trenchant exploration of the abdication of standards. Although I failed to make the connection, it is easy to see that the &quot;Reader Digest&quot; article's scribe was blessed with the same insight, articulation, and talent that the author of this bold work demonstrates.<br />While countless books have been written intelligently arguing on behalf of chastity and traditional sexual mores, most hark back to the antediluvian days when explicit sex was not found in every segment of society. Wendy Shalit may be the first to advocate that these allegedly archaic ideals are not only innovative but truly radical and empowering, and it is that the slatternly standard that has somehow become the norm that truly demeans women. Throughout the book she persuasively declares that modest attire and behavior is far more alluring, exciting, and even downright provocative than the slutty exhibitionism that has slinked its way into the mainstream. <br />Although her topic is extremely serious, Ms. Shalit skillfully utilizes a great deal of humor to fortify her position. Nowhere is this more intelligently done than in her overview of pornographic sex education that starts in early grammar school. Even though her progressive mother had her dismissed from the salacious indoctrination seminars, she once peaked at a friend's text that contained the inconceivable crack &quot;(an)orgasm is like when you have to sneeze, and then you sneeze.&quot; Her fourth grade mind justifiably wondered, &quot;why would I want to sneeze more than I have to sneeze; I hate sneezing.&quot; By highlighting the absurdity rather than the depravity of this sick sex ed material, her reasoned suasion is all the more powerful.<br />Ms. Shalit was 23 when she wrote this cogent book--showing maturity beyond her years. In addition to making an eloquent and difficult to refute argument for the desirability of modesty, it also serves as a harbinger for the distinguished literary career that assuredly lies ahead for her. &quot;Return to Modesty&quot; is definitely worth a perusal, but it must be read with an opened mind to achieve maximum impact. Many sacred tenets of the left are shattered and those unwilling to reexamine their opinions should not waste their time on such a challenging deliberation.	2001-11-17

Words designated as \\"active\\" are those used regularly while the passive entries may not be completely foreign but too often get stored away in a back compartment of the brain and are rarely-- if ever--withdrawn to be spoken or written.  His clearly expressed goal is \\"that this book will activate the passive.\\" and his collection of included words seems nearly perfect for that stated purpose.<br />Few adults will be stumped when they encounter a word such \\"dogmatic,\\" \\"churlish,\\" \\"lascivious,\\" \\"venerate,\\" \\"rectitude,\\" \\"gregarious,\\" \\"cabal,\\" \\"pastiche,\\" `indigenous,\\" \\"sacrosanct,\\" \\"desultory\\", or \\"equivocal\\" (all selections incorporated in this volume), but not many of us employee these in our everyday conversations either.  Have you ever heard of anyone attending a PTA meeting saying \\"I am off to the consortium\\" or during campaign season have you ever denounced \\"the chicanery of a candidate's commercials\\"?<br />Most of these are merely dormant members of our vocabularies. Perusing the out-of the ordinary, but less than extraordinary words that compose the bulk of this work may elicit a few of them from the desuetude of the mind`s dormer.<br />Those who seek the urbaneness of truly offbeat words will find occasional examples, but as the title intimates, that is not the thrust of this work.  Still \\"deracinate,\\" \\"ennui,\\" \\"otiose,\\" \\"sang-froid,\\" \\"manqué,\\" and \\"hegira\\" are among the features of this congeries that would send quite a few erudite folk to the nearest dictionary.  Using them in conversation is guaranteed to leave the ruck bumfuzzled.  <br /> Of these isolated abnormalities, hermaphrodite stands out as truly enigmatic.  The only definition Schur provides is \\"a living organism with both male and female organs of sex.\\" Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary expands the definition with \\"a person or thing in which two opposite qualitiesare combined' and \\"combining two opposite qualities.\\"  Both of these meanings seem likely to find more use than Schur's limited delineation which could only apply in very few instances beyond a description of Janet Reno.  Oversights like this confirm that all vocabulary building sources (...) should be verified in a reputed dictionary before the words are summoned perfidiously.	2001-11-15
US	52806429	R2QUBIM52AX8OR	0895261677	314528012	The Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House	Books	5	87	117	N	N	A Classy Patriot Examines Two Crass Scoundrels	Barbara Olson lived a life of such unflinching integrity and veracity that even in death she continues to defy terrorists.  Sadly ironic in its title, \\"Final Days\\" is a clarion articulation of the former first grifters in their ultimate Clintonian moment.  Beyond Monica, Paula, Jaunita, Kathleen and legions of Jane Does, more so than Travelgate, Filegate, Pay-per-slumber parties in the Lincoln Bedroom, campaign finance chicanery, quid pro quo contributions from Communist China, and the who' who of other ethical transgressions, even outdoing Waco, the Elian Gonzalez raid and kidnapping, missiles fired at questionable targets merely to create diversions etc.: perhaps no disreputable shenanigan was as quintessentially Clinton as the unfathomably dissolute shamelessness that marked his/their last days in office.  <br />The much talked about Marc Rich pardon has become an appropriate symbol of the entire eight years, but Mrs. Olson does a commendable service by clearly detailing the effrontery of his (Rich's) misdeeds, and an even more skillful demonstration of the President's specious and insulting attempt to justify this shocking act.  To add fuel to her raging fire, she quotes former President Jimmy Carter who openly stated \\"I don't think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts.  In my opinion that was disgraceful.\\"<br />However it is her dissection of the many other pardons that really makes this work a vital read.  The hodgepodge of unrepentant drug dealers, swindlers, and--with tragic irony--terrorists who received Clinton's boundless 11th hour clemency should elevate the 42nd president to a unique plateau in American history; one currently occupied by Benedict Arnold.<br />As in Mrs. Olson' previous handling, \\"Hell to Pay,\\" she authentically treats the Clintons as an entity of one.  Few would deny that their loveless marriage is anything more than another one of their poorly concealed shams, but the conjugal co-conspirators are forever intertwined.  Both know where countless bodies are buried, and if their self-perpetuating union ever comes asunder, each would gleefully destroy the other. Both are experts at dishonestly denying any knowledge of their sins, and while the trust that graces most marriages is visibly absent, either Clinton will artfully lie to save the other one.<br />\\"Final Days\\" is not only a fitting obituary to the Clinton Presidency; it is also a tribute to its author.  Throughout the heavily annotated work she meticulously skewers the Clintons' for their devotion to nothing more than their own advancement, and by truthfully uncovering their tracks, she reveals what kind of person she was.   Of the Clintons, she writes, \\"it all came down to one thing: Character.  Here the gage rests firmly on empty.\\"  In Barbara Olson's tank the gage constantly registered \\"full to overflowing.\\"  As in her frequent TV appearances, Mrs. Olson never shies away from telling it like it is.  On occasion her frank quotes from the depths of the Clintons' well-known, foul vocabularies will make readers cringe, but  these are among the unpleasant details essential to truly grasp the multifarious quiddity of two power-lusting libertines.  <br />No doubt the Clintons depravity was particularly revolting to the author because it stood in stark contrast to the way she lived and died--calmly warning her husband of the terrorist attack as it was in progress.  As tragic as her death was, some comfort can be taken from the fact that she died knowing America had ridden itself of the scourge of Clintonism. Modesty may have compelled her to ignore the fact, but even before this posthumous publication, Barbara Olson was an American hero for the tireless way she elucidated the true nature of the couple from Arkansas who went to New York and stomped on the Constitution on their way.<br />No line from the book better delineates the antipodal essences of Mrs. Olson and the Clintons than a commentshe made in relation to the former first couple's lackadaisical attitude toward terrorism, \\"Since the end of the Cold War, Soviet Aggression has been replaced by a number of particularly venomous threats from Timothy MacVeigh to Osama Bin Laden.\\"   Her murder makes the accuracy of that insight almost unbearably pungent.<br />Rest in peace Barbara!  There is a place in Heaven for you among America's other heroes; many of whom arrived there on the same day you did.	2001-10-21

For once again, the world is bearing witness as catastrophic turpitude brings forth the very best of humanity.<br />Other similarities exist between the narrative of a Christian family who hid many Jews during the holocaust and the terroristic murder of thousands of Americans by the modern forces of hell.<br />\\"The Hiding Place\\" refutes a current canard that will not please revisionists. As the invaders demanded the whereabouts of the Jews be revealed, one of the nazi goons was slugging then 50ish Corrie.  When the pain of his fist pounding her face became unbearable, she cried out to Jesus for help.  The tormentor warned her that if she used that name again he would kill her.  To those who have rewritten history to say that Nazism was somehow a debased outgrowth of Christianity, here is another case where the facts prove otherwise.  Hitler and his retinue despised Christianity as fervently as they hated Judaism. Such sentiments are alive and well among the Islamic extremists; however, true Islam with its message of peace is also a target of the terrorists' ire. <br />In yet another prescient instance Corrie speaks of a monograph her minister-brother wrote while still in divinity school, \\"way back in 1927, Willem had written in his doctoral thesis, done in Germany, that a terrible evil was taking root in that land.  Right at the university, he said, seeds were being planted of contempt for human life such as the world had never seen.\\"  Thankfully nazism has been condemned to the ash heap of history, but the disregard for humanity is obviously alive and well.<br />Those whose hearts are still broken over the attack on our nation will find comfort in \\"the Hiding Place.\\"  It provides inspiring proof that evil will score a few victories, but, in the end, rectitude and integrity always triumph over hate.

Wisely, she limits her scope within this vast arena to Black--White affiliations and geographically, she confines the effort to a comparison of New York City, Detroit, and Atlanta. Most of the trouble she discusses can be traced back to giving unmitigated credence to blatantly stupid ideas.<BR>Each citys section devotes ample time to one of the metropolis long serving mayors. In New York City, John Lindsey is portrayed as an impeccably intentioned, dedicated public servant encumbered with an overwhelming streak of naiveté. Based on mountains of evidence, nobody can question his sincere commitment to racial reconciliation or to improving the quality of life for black citizens too long held back by endemic discrimination, but the vagaries he chose to rectify the situation severely compounded the situation. By listening to the loudest black radicals, rather than the intelligent but more tempered individuals, (tragically initiating a trend that has accelerated until today) genuine progress was sacrificed to attempt unobtainable placation. Ms. Jacoby does not lay all the blame at NYCs charismatic mayors feet; indeed there was plenty to go around. The White House, the all-powerful Ford Foundation, the psittacine major media, and a host of other allegedly liberal players either shared Lindseys unreasonable hopes or postulated that appeasement would be far easier to deliver than improvement.<BR>Detroit is shown as a failure in every regard and much of the blame goes directly to the citys entrenched Mayor Coleman Young. He is limned as a racist/separatist who advanced the most radical elements of the Black Power movement. While spuriously claiming to have the best interests of their fellow black citizens at heart, Mayor Young and these thugs he countenanced made life a living hell for honest lower class back citizens. His open hostility to whites drove many business out of town leaving scores of unemployed poor black people behind with no way to reach the jobs in the suburbs. By declaring war on his own police department, he empowered criminals, and while a majority of perpetrators may have been black, so was a substantial majority of the victims. Sadly, even though Coleman Youngs near-eternal reign finally came to a close, Detroit still has not been able to put all its pieces back together, and long smoldering racial tensions remain strained.<BR>Atlanta is clearly shown to be the most successful of the three profiled cities; yet it comes across as far from a model of harmonious interracial coexistence. Mayor Andrew Young lacked the hateful separatism of Detroits Young and displayed a firmer grasp of reality than New Yorks Lindsey; still he strayed from Martin Luther Kings dream and implemented dubious racial counting. After a decade of affirmative action, Ms. Jacoby documents how little concrete progress was made. She also adequately evaluates the damage done by this well-meaning problem. She writes of the resentment toward those who achieved status or jobs based soley on skin color. She discusses the defeatism that afflicted many blacks who knew that their qualifications were not the source of their success or some case not even of interest to their employers. Most interestingly, she recounts fraudulent cases of alleged black companies that served as fronts for dishonest white businessmen and provides evidence that a handful of black companies reaped the vast majority of affirmative action's spoils.<BR>If the tome has a drawback it plods on occasion. The 600+ page work would probably have been enhanced by a 100 page edit--at least half of which should have come from the Atlanta section. Considerable information about the citys leap forward since the mid-1980s was interesting but not directly relevant.<BR>While maintaining impressive objectivity throughout the historical reporting, Ms. Jacoby obviously has a firmly help point of view on race relations, and at no time does she attempt to obfuscate her convictions. She closes with a series of common sense recommendations and truthfully advocates acculturation, mentoring, and a valuing of individuality over group labeling. While most proponents of these proven techniques are conservatives who generally defensively suggest them while fighting to prove they are not racists, Ms. Jacobys overall political leanings are not on display here. She is to be commended for unapologetically putting forth such ideas. There is nothing racist about calling upon everyone to do his her or best, and giving one his or her own identity is more respectful than herding people together into some artificial category. While these opinions may appear revolutionary and controversial today, Tamar Jacoby is not the first person to call for judging people by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin.	2001-08-30

Discussing humanism, he postulates the controversial truth, \\"without God, morality is impossible; right and wrong become matters of personal preferences.&quot;  Similarly, on relativism and the widely spoken falsehood that one person's values are as valid as another's, Feder asks, \\"what makes the Judeo-Christian ethic superior to modern paganism? What makes the volunteer at a drug rehab center better than a schoolyard pusher?...What makes the morality of those who hid Jews during the Holocaust superior to those who killed them?\\"  And to show his astute use of sarcasm regarding obscene rap performers 2 Live Crew, he puts forth \\"the rap group is to music what toilet-stall graffiti is to literature.\\"  These selections are indicative of the wit and wisdom that permeates Don Feder's oeuvre, and this work is typical of his canny reasoning and literary prowess.<br />Although it was initially published in 1993, the anthology has not become dated.  Most of the topics he discusses are timeless; the articles' urgency is as relevant today or in certain cases far more so.	2001-08-12

Buckley is an epicurean extraordinaire and \\"The Lexicon\\" is a must for any committed logophile. Still a few caveats must be undulated <br />Some of the words included are as quizzical as some of those that are omitted. Alphabetically, the reference runs from &quot;abattoir&quot; to &quot;xenophobia&quot;--which seems a strange place to stop.  Why there is no inclusion of &quot;yokefellow&quot; or &quot;yaw&quot; nor &quot;zaftig&quot; or &quot;zeitgeist&quot; is enigmatic at best. A second anomaly is that certain definitions differ from what is found my copy of \\"Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary.\\"  Mr. Buckley identifies \\"promulgate\\" as \\"to issue a new law or regulation;\\" Webster's definition says \\"to make known by open declaration...(or) to set forth or teach publicly.\\"  For \\"synecdoche\\" Mr. Buckley offers \\"the single example in place of the whole; the one for the many.\\"  Webster is more encompassing with \\"a figure of speech in which the part is used for the whole or the whole for a part.\\"  Webster's says that \\"kedge\\" means \\"to wrap or pull...(or) a small anchor,\\" while Buckley's related but contrasting explanation reads \\"to anchor securely.\\" As with ALL vocabulary sources, check the definition in a dictionary before using the word!<br />While not terribly detrimental Mr. Buckley pleonastically includes more than one form of several words.   The use of both \\"intrinsic\\" and \\"intrinsically,\\"  \\"mollify\\" and mollifying,\\" \\"invidious\\" and \\"invidiously,\\" \\"stultification and stultifying\\" among many other double versions comes across as a rebarbative padding device--completely unnecessary in a collection this tumescent.<br />While the incorporation of words such as \\"salient,\\" \\"levity,\\" \\"obtrude,\\" \\"junket\\" and a handful of other less than exotic choices is debatable, the assumption that some readers will be unacquainted with them is not quixotic.  However, selecting \\"plainspoken\\" for placement within such a gallimaufry is truly outlandish.  It seems highly doubtful that anyone unfamiliar with such a quotidian word would have the need for such an abstruse vocabulary primer.<br /> Despite these minor to moderate drawbacks, this book is unreservedly recommended for those interested in elevating their speaking prowess.  For three years I have been operating a \\"Word of the Day\\" email service/webpage (sent me a message if you wish to join) and \\"The Lexicon\\" boasted a plethora of specimens that I had never before encountered.  So while all my above comments are valid, they are nugatory distractions compared to the numinous lagniappes that can be acquired from a perusal or two.	2001-07-30
US	52806429	R3C7ZW6MQ10V4R	1557787883	323279141	From Rage to Responsibility: Black Conservative Jesse Lee Peterson and America Today	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Delicious Food for Thought	The Reverend Jesse Lee Peterson is NOT someone who is afraid to speak his mind.  He lays it on the line and stresses fact not tact.  <br />As a proud Black conservative, he is a lightening rod for the liberal establishment to besmirch, which is ironic because the successful station he has achieved in life stands as a consummate refutation of racism.  He bravely articulates how the specious slur \\"racist\\" gets bandied about today, but he knows what bona fide bigotry is, and he fearlessly condemns it.  In a meticulously research passage he describes the racist goals of Planned Parenthood boldly spelled out by its found Margaret Sangar and still surreptitiously  practiced by the organization today with the active support of many so-called Black leaders.  Highlighting Sanger`s hatred, he quotes her own venomous writing, \\"Blacks are \\"mentally inferior to native-born Americans.\\"  Her popularity in the Third Reich was no doubt due to her consideration of Jews as \\"human weeds.\\"  His expresses justifiable outage and bewilderment that abortion is still heavily pushed in minority communities with the vociferous approval of alleged liberals.<br /> Planned Parenthood and self-appointed \\"black leaders\\" who sell out their community for political advantage are just two of the sacred cows Reverend Petersen sacrifices on the altar of truth.  Other oblations offered include feminists, welfare proponents, and a culture of victimization.  Nor is he afraid to name names; in addition to Sangar, the likes of Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson, Maxine Walters, and Sharon Stone are all knocked off the pedestals on which liberalism has placed them.  <br />One drawback to this work is its brevity.  A mind as sapient as Reverend Peterson's should not limit his insightful observations to a scant 107 pages  (A Few thoughtful appendices enhance the book`s length.). Still in one instance, this abbreviation works brilliantly. In an autobiographical chapter, under a heading of \\"Lost Years,\\" he artfully spends less than three pages delineating two decades of his life spent on drug-laden welfare.  It does not seem possible to paint a more authentic picture of the emptiness that envelops a life devoid of personal responsibility.<br />Some may dismiss Reverend Peterson as part of Hilary's Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, but that is their loss.  He has much to say. He surmounted obstacles including poverty, illegitimacy, prejudice, and addiction to achieve personal success and peace of mind.  Anyone with an open mind should read his work, and carefully consider the intelligent arguments he makes.	2001-07-29

Al Gore and his smarmy retinue tried to misappropriate the 2000 presidential election.  Their would-be theft was overt, planned out in advance, and despite some clintonian semantics, basically undenied.<br />Still Bill Sammon writes like the finest mystery novelist with a healthy dose of comic relief, and the book is enjoyable from cover to cover.  He even manages to elucidate a few of the details Gore and fraudulent cronies managed to keep hidden.  We see just how obsessed Gore was with wresting the election results, and how his lust lead to his order to smear Katherine Harris for maintaining a steadfast devotion to the rule of law as well as his willingness to disenfranchise the votes of military men and women who risk their lives defending America while his votaries parroted the claim of \\"let every vote count.\\"<br />Despite the utter unsavoriness of Gore's brazen plot, the book leaves the reader uplifted.  First it shows how even under the reign of Slick Willie and his corrupt justice department, his handpicked successor's would-be-peculation couldn't fly.  After eight years of peccant Clinton shenanigans, in America the rule of law and the will of the people still triumph!  Second, it provides a further introduction to some of the American heroes who were thrust on to the national stage during Al Gore's choreographed crises. Judges N. Sander Sauls and Terry Lewis--both registered Democrats--are shown to be brave Americans who put their duty far above any political leaning they may have had.  Even the chief justice of Florida's disgraced supreme court, after backing the initial law-shredding ruling extending the election until Gore could somehow manufacture enough votes, listened when the U.S. Supreme Court rebuffed this unfathomable breach.  In disagreeing with the kangaroo court's second foray into audacious partisanship, he admitted that, \\"there is a real and present likelihood that this constitutional crisis will do substantial damage to our country, our state, and to this court as an institution.\\"<br />A more enlightening story will one day be written of the massive fraud that happened outside of Florida during the 2000 election.  In Missouri, alone, a dead man filed suit to keep the polls open later, and at least one dog voted.  In Wisconsin, some Gore supporters admitting casting as many as four votes and in Philadelphia certain precincts impressively reported 100% voter turnout with 99% of the ballots being cast for Gore.   When this expose is undertaken, hopefully, the author will possess as engaging a style as Bill Sammon who dotted a few i's and crossed a few t's while confirming that Gore may have been better than Clinton, but he was not fit to be president	2001-07-08

The same can be said about Michael Barone's immigration chronicle, \\"The New Americans.\\"<br />For some reason, a number of conservatives have chosen to highlight the problems of illegal immigration as an excuse to advocate curtailing legal arrivals.  Many liberals have sententiously denounced attempts to penalize illegal immigrants while surepttiiously erecting roadblocks wherever possible.  Michael Barone writes from the right, and he properly sees that immigration has always been and will always be a major plus for America.  Throughout the work, he happily acknowledges that the United States is multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious land.  It has never been a multi-cultural region, and pestiferous forces that are presently striving to make it such must be fought at all levels. This is not to say that every American citizen needs to become a carbon copy of each other; rather we all, despite our differences, need to blend together--giving a little, taking a little to enrich the one American culture.  <br />America has succeeded so admirably for 200+ years largely because we rejected the vagaries now championed by multiculturalists.  The melting pot brought all immigrants together, unlike the situations in Lebanon, the Balkans, Yugoslavia, Rwanda and other places synonymous with the horrors of group vs. group ideology.  As politically incorrect as the concept has become, assimilation is the only way for burgeoning immigration to succeed.   Fortunately many immigrants know this.  Barone quotes California Professor Gregory Rodriguez who says of Latin American arrivals, \\"we are assimilating ourselves.\\"  Rodriguez also scoffs at the bizarre notion of a Latino minority as if all immigrants from Guatemala, Cuba, Brazil, Mexico and the rest of South and Central America form a heterogeneous group.  Barone, himself points out how the fixation on racial classifications has trivialized the distinctions between the many disparate European nationalities.<br />White supremacists and diversity advocates constantly remind us that the minority population is expanding, and the question of how the growth of different races will impact us weighs heavily upon both groups of alarmists.  Barone documents how the Irish, the Italians and the Jews were each once viewed as a separate and in many cases inferior race as well.   He sites locations in the south were \\"No Blacks or Italians\\" signs were posted. Luckily through natural assimilation practices, these canards eventually disintegrated.<br />The work is a triumvirate of comparisons--Blacks to Irish---Italians to Latinos--and Jews to Asians.  In each section he compares such issues as family, religion, crime, work, the journey that brought them there, the impetus for them to leave, politics, and uniqueness.  Striking similarities exist for each grouping of the trio.  The success of each of first arrived pair of each group makes an airtight case for the melting pot and an intelligent argument against multicultural fads.  As America passes its 225th birthday, the Statue of Liberty still holds a torch welcoming tempest tossed souls.  Dire predictions may abound, but she knows how to stir the melting pot.	2001-07-04

Considering the Father of Our Country's intellect--generously displayed in this slim volume, it's no wondered that America has endured the hard times and prospered so majestically.   A few of his rules of civility may seem archaic; \\"spit not in the fire\\" discusses an issue that most would agree is not a teeming controversy in the 21st century.  Most, though, are as timely as they are sapient. From friendliness, \\"let your countenance be pleasant,\\" to respectfulness, \\"turn not your back to others,\\" to the profound, \\"when a man does all he can though it succeeds not well, blame not him that did it,\\" what George Washington termed rules of civility are truly words of wisdom to live by. <br />It is staggering to contemplate that a fourteen-year-old boy composed these perspicuous aphorisms.  Yet, as the extraordinary man George Washington became later suggested, he was no ordinary fourteen-year-old either.	2001-07-04

As tragic as the nightmare he endured is, the situation in modern China has in many ways has deteriorated even further.   Harry Wu is one of many children; such a family would never be allowed under the current one-child policy.  Actually, it is easy to see why a depraved and violent population controlling policy has been instituted.  As the Wus demonstrate, the family is the hardest institution to destroy, and with large and strong families the norm, China's insensate government would be hampered in its drive for domination over all aspects of life.  <br />More than a few of the horrors he documents have a frightening familiarity.  Anyone familiar with the opinion-controlling practices currently at place Ivy League colleges will see an eerie counterpart to China's universities in the late 1950.  Harry Wu writes of \\"the official encouragement of divergent opinions\\" as the nation transformed over to socialism.  Like the modern diversity fad, the semantics did not match the policy.  \\"Divergent opinions\\" yielded blind devotion to the Communist state, just as diversity training demands the surrender of individuality in favor of group labels and a collective mentality.  Hostility to religion has become chic among the U.S. hoi polloi which also corresponds to China's ferociously enforced atheism.  As a boy Harry Wu attended a Catholic School, but with little warning the nuns and priests were forcefully expelled from China.  In another scary correlations, certain segments of American illuminati similarly disdain large families as impractical or burdensome upon women. <br />America's most admirable heroes are now under heavy fire from much of the elite establishment.  Who hasn't heard George Washington denigrated as a slave owner or Abraham Lincoln as a racist who reluctantly freed the slaves?  China also mastered the art of rewriting history.  Wu discusses how Confucius was condemned as a reprobate because his teachings brilliantly controverted Communists doctrine.<br />The labor camp conditions he graphically describes are inhuman and heartbreaking.  The fact that he even survived such brutality is astounding; his willingness to return to China and document the still thriving barbarism is nothing short of miraculous.  Wu deserves much credit for that act of doughty selflessness.<br />As the Unites States Congress prepares to debate extending China's undeserved Trade Status, \\"Bitter Winds\\" should be read by every concerned American, and those issues should be raised with his or her congressman.	2001-06-25

His autobiography does not hold back on either portion.  From his impoverished Arkansas childhood through his many tumultuous marriages and country music superstardom to his regret-free faded status and ultimate peace, Glen lays it all on the (Wichita) line.<br />While he does not gloss over his own flaws, the dirty linen of some other players-most notably Tanya Tucker is likewise held up for all to see.  Arguably, he should have been less open in revealing maligning details about her, but their relationship kept tabloid readers engrossed for years and it legitimately was a salient chapter in his life.   Furthermore, he does not condemn Tanya despite attributing less than wholesome motivations to her interest in him.   He seems very sincere when he writes of his one-time paramour \\"I'm inclined to pray for the woman with whom I shared a poisoned relationship.  I have since found another love that offers not the threat of death but the promise of eternal life.   I pray that Tanya might find that too.\\"<br />As Glen experienced his twilight maturation, he achieved the rank of solid citizen.  Becoming a Branson regular appropriately accentuates his embrace of Christianity and advocacy of traditional values.  By spelling out his staunch opposition to abortion and opposing special rights for homosexuals, he takes some daring positions for a celebrity tell-all, but it is refreshing to see a performer courageously step out of rigid show biz boundaries.<br />One unintended drawback concerns some details of his childhood. Glen is to be commended for the tremendous respect he displays toward his parents and also for admitting his failures as a father to his older children-even accepting significant blame for his middle-aged son's drug problems.   However, he relates some paternal behavior that shows his father possessed a cruel streak.  From his laudatory portrayal it is easy to see that was not the imagehe wanted to present, and he would probably disagree with such an assessment.  A more prudent tactic would have been to remain mum on some of these mean actions.<br />Overall, \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\" is a well-orchestrated rendition of a child born into poor Southern Nights but who eventually went \\"riding out on a horse in a star-spangles rodeo.\\"	2001-05-26

This unbelievable \\"mistake\\" lends tremendous credence to \\"Absolute Power's\\" thesis that the Clinton administration used its Justice Department solely to serve its own interests while legal functions normally performed by DOJ took a back seat to propagating political goals.<br />Some will loudly complain that David Limbaugh is an unabashed conservative who has composed a thick dossier of opinion pieces skewering Clintoninan hi-jinks, but would those some scoffers advocate dismissing Bob Woodward's investigative reporting based on his firmly held convictions? <br />Mr. Limbaugh's primary accomplishment in this work is filling in the blanks.  He does not discuss any new scandals but provides key heretofore unknown details regarding some of the myriad of criminal activities proffered by the Clinton justice department.  We learn just how intriguingly the dots are connected concerning China's campaign contributions.  Several of the slanderous lies told about Elian Gonzales's heroic Miami relatives are shown to be false propaganda, and the widely suggested hypothesis of Clinton's suspected fear that Castro would unload another huge wave of refugees is confirmed by administration sources as the impetus for the federal flip-flop that sent a child back to slavery debauching his mother's noble sacrifice.<br />Another highlight is the chapter exposing the federal racketeeing that now controls the tobacco industry.  He points out how through usurious taxation, the federal government now makes more money from the sale of cigareetes than the companies who ply this legal but politically unpopular trade.  <br />As strong as this work is, two missing elements could have enhanced it.  Mr. Limbaugh does not delve into some of the lesser know scandals.  There is no talk of the INS scheme to grantcitizenship to countless Democratic leaning illegal aliens in 1996.  This illegal practice was uncovered by David Schippers in the impeachment investigation, but he was forced to abandon the avenue of exploration by the diffident Republican congressional leadership.  The INS--as evinced by the Elian Gonzales debacle--has become America's KGB so a legion of scandals could most likely by found by searching through its penumbral practices. <br />The second omission is any mention of the irony that Clinton maintained massive popularity in minority communities despite a scurrilous streak of racism that ran through his law-bending shenanigans.  Maria Shah took the fall for the fundraising scam, while her white beneficiaries (Clinton and Gore) got off scot-free.   Ron Brown--not broached in this book--was reported to have been shot before his plane crashed, but a thorough investigation was never sought.  Wen Ho Lee's name was dragged through the mud, but he may have been just an administration scapegoat.  And of course, would Elian Gonzales have been violently snatched from his loving family had they not been of Cuban dissent?<br />As sad as it is to contemplate the extent of such high-level corruption, readers should feel a genuine sense of appreciation for the American experiment.  Germany was once governed by a potentate who showed similar contempt for the rule of law and basic decency, and it has never been the same again.  It took more than 50 years for it even to reunite as one country.  However, within moments of Clinton selling his last pardon and ostentatiously departing the presidency, our government was already taking steps to repair itself.   While Clinton and Reno's miscreant legacy still cries out for just punishment, the mere fact that America is still intact after such prodigious and sustained violations will serve as one more everlasting testament to the wisdom of out Founding Fathers.	2001-05-25
US	52806429	REP1Q6L2ZUM0W	031226934X	295295625	From the Place of the Dead: The Epic Struggles of Bishop Belo of East Timor	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Nation Under Siege	Many Americans have probably never heard of East Timor, and most of us--including those who are active followers of world affairs--would probably have some difficulty pinpointing it on a map.  Arnold Kohen does a remarkable job of introducing this unfamiliar land.  It's very hard not to feel sympathy and a healthy dose of admiration for the inhabitants of this long embattled nation.   The book simultaneously serves as a hagiography of East Timor's heroic favorite son, and Bishop Belo's extraordinary life greatly enhances the work's inspirational level.<br />Among East Timor's striking characteristics is the fact that it may be the strongest seat of Catholicism on Earth today.  Over 85% Catholic (less than half was in the 1960's) its rate of practicing members puts most other countries to shame.  The cathedral's 6 a.m. weekday Mass regularly has an overflow crowd of 1000+.  John Cardinal O'Connor once told Bishop Belo how envious he was at East Timor's teeming seminarians.  Even its Indonesian occupiers concede the Church's massive influence.  Although they disdain Bishop Belo for his tireless devotion to human rights, they often unhappily allow him to mediate disputes with Timorese resistance fighters.<br />The East Timorese greatly need this faith because the world has turned a blind eye toward the genocide inflicted upon them.  Those of us in America who seethed under the reign of Bill Clinton probably never realized how culpable he was for tacitly approving these crimes against humanity.  The author on numerous occasions sites examples where the United States after decades of inexplicable silence at Indonesia predation became a veritable proponent when Clinton--abandoning his campaign rhetoric about the suffering East Timorese--wanted expanded trade with the highly populated interloper.   Bishop Belo is probably the only person in history to be awarded a Nobel peace Prize without a word of praise or congratulations from the Unites States Government because it wasbestowed at a very inconvenient time for pending trade deals.<br />The island nation faces an uncertain future, and all Catholics and others concerned with human rights should monitor the situation closely.  Despite the unending brutal assaults bravely endured by the East Timorese citizens, their bold faith is a good omen that eventually their struggle will be victorious.	2001-05-12

She did not usually make what are typically called \\"jokes\\"-just offbeat observations.  Her columns more often initiated a satisfying smile than a hearty belly laugh.  But even on the occasions that she was painfully funny she showed respect for her subjects and her audience.  It was the proud acknowledgement that she was one of us that allowed us to chuckle at family life, grocery shopping, housework, and all the other quotidian errands that compose the bulk of our lives.   Regardless of the subject she found some aspect that was good for a \\"laugh with\\" not a \\"laugh at.\\"<br />How about the subject of children battling cancer?  The thought of jocularly treating such a topic sounds comparable to the depraved entertainment regurgitated by the likes of Howard Stern.  Surely, Erma Bombeck-the avatar of wholesomeness-would never approach such a subject.  No, but it approached her.  She was asked to write this book, and at first the thought of it repulsed her.  Momentarily dropping her guard, she allowed herself to be talked in to attempting this work.  We should all be thankful that she caved. The result is a reverent; inspiring read that has had a propitiatory impact on many, many children and adults battling cancer---not to mention legions of us who are blessed with good health.<br />Treading with great veneration for her subject, she produced a book overflowing with warmth, encouragement, and-as unbelievable as it may seem-tasteful mirth.

Wesley J. Smith wisely limits his focus to an exploration of the innocuously titled bioethics movement, and what he finds is very scary!  <br />Bioethics has many deleterious similarities with another increasingly popular craze--multiculturalism.  Both fads seek to diminish the value of the individual for the good of the \\"group,\\" both seek to revolutionize basic aspects of society and castigate all those who advocate a different perspective, and both have snowballed in acceptance without any genuine proof of their beneficence.  One pernicious difference can be seen in the end result of their adoptions.  While multiculturalism presents great potential harm by devaluing persons and encouraging stereotypical group identities, Bioethics dictates that some lives are more valuable than others and some are not worth saving or even palliating. <br />Bioethics has already made a host of insidious advances from the enforced withdrawal of feeding tubes-sometimes against patient's wishes-to the feasibility of \\"assisted suicide\\" to experimentation on severely disabled babies  (an activity straight out of Dachau) to everyday occurrences like stem cell research and far-flung abortion.  One of the areas were bioethics has scored impressive success is the animal rights movement which openly promulgates the notion that some animals are more important than some people.  Obviously those of us who are proud animal-lovers would never tolerate any form of mistreatment of our furry friends, and when medical animal experimentation is absolutely necessary, we are right to demand that the creatures be treated humanely.  Still the thought that a severely disabled newborn baby deserves less care than any animal or any other human being for that matter (a prospect vehemently purported by Princeton University's resident madman Peter Singer and a gaggle of other animal rights extremists) would be farcically amusing were it not gaining such horrifying acceptance.<br />Adding to the disquieting nature of bioethics is a recurrent racist streak.  One cited opponent to the organ-for-sale mentality states that \\"proponents of fiscal rewards argue that since minorities are more likely to be poor, financial incentives are likely to be more attractive to them.\\"  Animal rights fanatics have concocted the bizarre word &quot;speciesism&quot; to scurrilously equivocate their cause with racism.  Some members of this lunatic fringe go as far as \\"comparing the Holocaust and slavery with banal activities like animal husbandry and eating meat.\\" The author further intimates how in 1933 the government of Germany advocated legalizing euthanasia and employed many of the same euphemisms bandied about today.  A tiny familiarity with 20th century history is all that is necessary to know what followed that gross dehumanization. <br />Despite the infuriating and unnerving nature of this work, it does contain some genuinely inspirational stories. Mr. Smith documents some cases of heroic family members or hospital workers who defied conventional wisdom and doughtily fought to save the lives of loved ones or patients who had been written off by bioethicists devoted to improving society while destroying individuals.	2001-04-10

The fable takes place in 2046 when political correctness has developed a chokehold on all American institutions.  The Constitution-determined to be hopelessly outdated--has been banished to a museum.  Fulfilling quotas of racial, gender, sexual-preference, and assorted other categories is the primordial function of every aspect of public policy.  Religion is virtually outlawed. The Democrat and Republican parties have converged into one self-perpetuating organization--the Demopubs, and all that made America great is abased, ridiculed, or obliterated.  So removed from rectitude has the nation become that God appears to the President with a warning to get back on the right track.<br />Those who seek out symbolism will find many characters named after Biblical players.  The President's name is Moses Jones, the first lady is Sheba, and the vice-president who faces a few figurative giants is given the first name of David.  No allegorical appellation is as humorously utilized as Judith Ischcarot who serves as a de facto atheism czar in the cabinet.<br />Much of this short work is risibly sapient, but late in chapter eight, it takes a major detour into stirring eloquence.  When President Moses Jones addresses his cabinet and admits that he experienced a Theophany, his remarks are profound.  Were this peroration a genuine speech delivered by a real president, it would take its place not too far beneath George Washington's farewell or the Gettysburg Address. The penetrating sinew is constant throughout the nearly two page soliloquy and is represented by lines like \\"we decided sinand guilt are burdens we don't have to carry.  In effect, the rules governing our behavior can be whatever we want them to be...In an environment permissive of uninhibited expression, we did not find the inherent wisdom within our souls; we found the inherent barbarism.\\"<br />Although the parable takes place 40+ years in the future, most of it is applicable today.  When President Jones declaims, \\" we used to fight our demons...now we embrace them, \\" his words ring as true in 2001 as the do in the era of Demopubs.   Perhaps \\"The Remnant\\" can serve as a much needed wake-up call.  It is far less drastic that a visit from above conveying divine displeasure.	2001-03-26

While Sandra Stotsky adequately peruses the many obvious harms of this divisive fad, she is the first whom I have encountered to also zero in on a too-often overlooked impairment caused by this divisive fad-its degradation of the English language.  By analyzing the basal readers offered by five publishing houses and used almost exclusively in public grammar schools, Ms. Stotsky shows how adhering to rigid multicultural dictates has yielded a body of literature that neither stimulates young vocabularies nor stresses a command of standard English. Obsessing on the sacred cow of diversity, school-age children are regularly force-fed a bland non-chronological compilation of stories designed to emphasize the victim status of various groups.   The book repeatedly demonstrates that this misplaced harping on cultural identity usually assumes that \\"culture\\" equals \\"victim status,\\" a weird equation that very few parents proud of their heritage would want their children to adopt.<br />Among the tragic side effects of multicultural agitprop is the omission of genuine heroes whose lives could truly inspire children but who satisfy nobody's agenda. In addition to the putative aversion to white males, Ms. Stotsky shows how Helen Keller fails to pass politically correct muster.  On the rare occasions when she is included, her story is subjected to perverse distortions; one author described her as \\"proud\\" to be deaf.  Ms. Stotsky wisely laments, \\"Is Helen Keller's story disappearing because it cannot be used to indict the world in which she grew up?\\"  Shouldn't such a charge be all the more reason to include her uplifting narrative?<br />Ms. Stotsky wisely stresses the complete lack of any research to support the truculent claims of multicultural proponents.  No studies suggest that race-based philosophies help children learn better.   Forcing non-English speaking children to sit through classes in their first language has not attested to an enhanced ability to learn English.  No evidences supports the vagary that class warfare and group identity tendencies increase the much ballyhooed self-esteem of minority children (or anyone else or that matter), and nothing has ever shown salutary outcomes from stressing to various children that they are victims and to others that they are oppressors.  In a brave display of realism she writes, \\"those who stand the most to lose the most intellectually from their (diversity proponents) subconscious racism will be the children in whose names the changes in reading instruction are taking place.\\"<br />Several other thoughtful dissertations have accented these separatist aspects of multiculturalists, but \\"Losing our Language\\" goes a step further and shows how the diversity craze is hostile to the English language.  Much of the juvenilia offered in modern day public schools substitutes politically correct gibberish for works that could stimulate a child's vocabulary.  Linguistically hybrid stories are frighteningly commonplace based on the many flaccid passages Ms. Stotsky cites.  Included are stories for 4th through 6th graders that feature alarmingly high volumes of Spanish, Japanese, or Swahili words.  A familiarity with even the most basic Swahili is not a terribly high requirement for most productive United States citizens, nor is this exceedingly rare dialect the first language of many children in America (or anywhere else in the world) in the twenty first century.  Even when the stories avoid bilingualism, a push to use foreign proper names is utilized in these readers.  She sites characters or place names like Maizon, Eliscue, Emeke, and Quito Sueno as hard to pronounce examples that children will probably never encounter outside of an agenda-heavy classroom.<br />This volume is a caveat that we should not let the intricate English language be supplanted by the sectoring cantof multiculturalism.	2001-03-22

That the ranks of black soldiers were more than an insignificant smattering turns conventional wisdom on its head.<br />According to the thoroughly documented essays in this volume, black support for the confederacy was broad and intense.  Some of the black supporters were free blacks--many of whom owned slaves themselves. No doubt some were uneducated slaves duped by unscrupulous Southern partisans to back a cause they did not understand.  Some must have been forced to aid the confederacy against their wills, but the majority of individuals discussed in these pages wholeheartedly agreed with the objectives of the rebellion.<br />To those who may dismiss the findings of this work, their legitimacy seems proven by the extensive documentation.  At times the superscript weighs down the pages as assertion after assertion is annotated.  Six different authors contributed to the collection and at times the facts are illogically tautological.  Two essays by Richard Rollins-allegedly about different subjects--rehash much of the same data.  Especially disturbing is the second offering titled \\"Black Confederates At Gettysburg,\\" which barely touches on that subject.  While this disorganized presentation is a sizable detraction, the work is a genuine eye-opener.<br />Those of us living in the twenty-first century will probably find the choices made by these slaves as impossible to comprehend as the fact that human beings could ever be bought and sold as property.  One of Mr. Rollins vignettes makes an essential point concerning \\"the need to be sensitive to the historical figures we deal with in the context of the time they lived, rather than allow the ideological and intellectual assumptions of our own day to dictate what we have to say about the people of the civil war era-both black and white.\\"  Centuries from now common folk may very well look back at our \\"enlightened era\\" aghast that we condoned partial-birth abortion and euthanasia.<br />Our rightful revulsion to the slave trade should not allow us to forget that many confederate soldiers-both black and white--were noble men.  Nothing in this conglomeration makes any attempt to diminish the horror that all decent people know slavery was.  Perhaps it is the institutionalized unfairness of their lives that makes the profiled black patriots' sacrifices all the more doughty.  The book's most challenging postulation may be Ervin L. Jordan's lament that the slaves and free black citizens served the confederacy \\"not as a consequence of white pressure but due to their own preferences.  They are the Civil War's forgotten people, yet their own existence was more widespread than American history has recorded.  Their bones rest in unhonored glory in Southern soil, shrouded by falsehoods, indifference, and historians' censorship.\\"Centuries from now common folk may very well look back at our \\"enlightened era\\" aghast that we condoned partial-birth abortion and euthanasia.<br />Our rightful revulsion to the slave trade should not allow us to forget that many confederate soldiers-both black and white--were noble men.

Despite the recurring media myth and the noisy claims of some self-appointed spokespeople, Hispanics overall are not an underachieving victim group.    As Ms. Chavez articulates before the affirmative action mentality took hold, there was no Hispanics minority.  Rather there were Mexicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Guatemalans etc.  Cleverly she proclaims, \\"it is only in the United States `Hispanics' exist; a Cakchiquel Indian in Guatemala would find it remarkable that anyone could consider his culture to be the same as a Spanish Argentinean's.\\" One ironic angle to the multicultural mumbo-jumbo is the stripping away not only of individuality but also the uniqueness of various nationalities.  Today Poles, Italian, Irish, Russians, Germans, and a host of other Caucasians are regularly lumped as \\"whites\\" as though they are all one and the same. <br />Within the sub-Hispanic groups, a great variance exists in terms of overall level of success.   Immigrants from Cuba in many ways have achieved equality with any white ethic group in the United States.  Perhaps this unprecedented success rate can be seen as at least one factor in the left's justification for anti-Cuban bigotry.  (Can anyone imagine Elian Gonzalez being ripped away from his family and sent back to a slave state had he been black or white or Puerto Rican?)  Among Cubans a very low divorce rate exists as do lower numbers of unwed births and female headed households which certainly bodes well for them. As Ms. Chavez writes, \\"no institution is more important to the success of Hispanics (or any group) than the family.\\"<br />In Linda Chavez' broad evaluation, one of the most threatening detriments facing America's Latino population is it out-of-touch self-appointed spokesmen. In her words,  \\"Hispanic organizations that insist on special benefits, not just for Hispanic citizens but for immigrants as well-legal and illegal-severely strain the comity of the American public.  Moreover there is no reason to believe that the Latin immigrants who are purported beneficiaries of such policies seek their implementation.\\"   She shrewdly contradicts those who place racism toward Hispanics on a par with what black citizens were once forced to endure.  The slave trade never treated Latinos as chattel.<br />In stead of the separatist mentality now strenuously promulgated by multicultural martinets, Linda Chavez lays out a brilliant argument for assimilation-dirty as that word may have become in some liberal circles.  She sites increasing intermarriage rates and other quotidian interactions between Latinos and non-Latinos as doing far more good for all communities than the current race-obsessed regulations putatively enforced. \\"From 1820 to 1924 the United States successfully incorporated a population more ethnically diverse and varied than any other in the world.  We could not have done so if today's politics of ethnicity had been the prevailing ethos.\\"  The Statute of Liberty welcomes all to a land where no one should ever be a hyphenated-American.	2001-03-08

But when realizing it's from the pen of master scribe Harold Bell Wright-once described as \\"the apostle of the wholesome\\" a more realistic plot comes to mind.  This enjoyable adventure does take place on a ranch and pays apt tribute to the cowboy way but it is as unadulterated as the prairie sky over the Arizona mesa where its action commences.<br />The tale of an overly cultured gentleman who escapes to the untamed Southwest in an effort to become a true man lacks the trappings of modern tales of machismo.  Rather it details the meatamorphasis of a citified plebian who follows his heart and embraces true responsibility, probity, and duty.  Along the way he osculates the exciting episodes found in HBW's books and is influenced by the genuine characters who populate his oeuvre.<br />It seems every move that Mr. Wright ever made yielded a vibrant novel and fortunately his pereginrations took him far and wide.  Few litterateurs have possessed a gift as keen as his in terms of creating a written diorama.  When the book's action takes place at the rodeo, readers feel an impulse to get out of the way of charging steers.  When Honorable Patches (a character's spur-of-the-moment pseudonym that sticks) gets into a fight, we duck his punches as a tropism. And in a later chapter as a careening car heads toward a trapped child, many readers will need to pause and catch an escaped breath.<br />A hagiography was published about Mr. Wright that bore the natural title \\"Storyteller to America.\\"  He conveyed the rudimentary as magical and invited readers to take part in daring quests from the safety of our easy chairs. \\"When a Man's A Man\\" is another one of his books that prove a grown-up allegory filled with suspense, romance, and excitement can be as pure as the desert air.	2001-02-16

His well-known but rarely spoken thesis is that a shrill cry of victimization has obliterated personal responsibility and this degrading mantra has developed into a fast growing and far-reaching industry.<br />Unlike other books that limit their scope, Sykes issues a broadside against the entire victimization cult.  Harebrained lawsuits, expansive therapeutic whims, diversity nonsense, and sensitivity fads are all targets of his animadversion, and he repeatedly hits bull's eyes. <br />Of the diversity divisiveness, Sykes shows how a silly trend has grown into a suffocating mania.  He points out how the craze has stripped Americans of their uniqueness and put them into classifications pitted against each other.  Each division must fight to prove how it has been hurt worse than the others have.  Women wounded by sexism: blacks blocked by racism: homosexuals hampered by homophophia.  And of course a gay black woman would have three strikes in her favor-four if she can claim some real or imagined handicap!  While many corporations are actively engaged in the separatist dross, diversity rituals have reached epidemic levels on college campuses.  Sykes sites The University of Arizona where \\"individual style\\" constitutes minority status and all the special accommodations it affords.  The school assures this measure is necessary to prevent discrimination against \\"nerds and people who dress differently.\\"   <br />Many of his examples would be hilarious were it not for the tragedy of their reality.  As an avatar of this absurdity, the author describes a woman in Miami whose \\"illness\\"--bigotry made it impossible for her to work with black people.  Worker's Compensation paid her $ 40,000 to compensate her disability.  Let's hope that the Ku Klux Klan is not using this mockery as impetus to plan a class action lawsuit comparable to the smokers' frivolity against tobacco companies.<br />One of the saddest reminders of reality is the book's reference to a suggestion made in 1944 \\"that traditional American values were the greatest foes of racism because they emphasized equality and liberty---values inherently in contradiction to policies of segregation and exclusion.\\"  Wouldn't it be wonderful to hear someone bravely articulate such truthfulness today?  Unfortunately the mere implication of such veracity would earn the speaker widespread scorn.  <br />Sykes cleverly uses a great deal of humor in presenting this fabricated crisis.  At times, it is essential to laugh at such institutionalized foolishness, but as the book thoroughly substantiates the damage of a rampant victimization mindset is massive.  Unless an attitude of self-control and personal responsibility comes back in style, America will become a \\"true victim\\" of an arguably well-intentioned but deadly dissent into political correctness	2001-02-12

According to Steven Mosher's capaciously researched \\"Hegemon\\" that bill of sale is currently being negotiated.  While U.S. politicians in both parties battle to outdo each other in praise for China's \\"new\\" government, the communist cabal must be laughing out loud at American naivete. <br />As Mosher readily admits, China has made many concessions toward free markets, trade, and financial opportunities for its more privileged citizens, and this western-endorsed move has received much vociferous acclaim throughout the free world.  Yet, the world's most populous nation has simultaneously escalated its velleity for human rights atrocities to a degree that rivals the Third Reich's heydays.  The author plainly states \\" The notion that China's economic reformers harbor a secret admiration for the open society is a Western conceit; U.S.-style democracy has no advocates within the senior ranks of (China's) government.\\"<br />While the work unflinchingly makes mentions of China's litany of execrable abuses, surprisingly this topic does not comprise the bulk of its suasion; more time is dedicated to China's eons-long desperate desideratum for world domination and its not too subtle machinations to achieve that goal.   Since the author is head of Population Research Institute, and a renowned China scholar/human rights activist, he is obviously well evidenced with the enforced abortions, sterilization, infanticide, brutal religious crackdowns, and widespread slavery-all quotidian practices in modern day China.  Tragically, Mosher explains why many western voices are silent on these crimes against humanity for fear of angering the government and risking the pelf of China's markets.  Similar feelings were behind the shamefully timid response to the Tinnaman Square massacre and how China has systematically desecrated the memories of those slaughtered heroes ever since.<br />Documenting 4,000+ years of historical references, Mosher paints a chilling picture of China's government as perpetually lusting for world control.  Disturbingly, the current communist regime while still strenuously clutching that goal, has adopted many of the most enticing aspects of clintonian-style spin to make their minatory wishes seem beneficent.<br />Perhaps there is still time for fact-laden books such as this to serve as a wake-up call before Stalin's prognostication becomes a posthumous reality.	2001-02-06

Such inveterate loyalty did not extend to his politics.  Once an avowed liberal, \\"Commentary's\\" long time editor maturated into as the subtitle declares \\"a cheerful conservative.\\"  Still, his devotion to his homeland remained steadfast regardless of where he was on the political scale.  One of the salient disillusionments he found with liberalism was the ignominious tendency to badmouth America.  Acts of such betrayal outraged Mr. Podhoretz and no doubt gave increased impetus to his propitiation toward conservatism.  <br />This love letter warns of a similar concern more recently seen from the right, but this is one area where the supporting evidence is weak.  Except for the discussion of a controversial seminar and a handful of other morsels, this charge remains rather unsubstantiated.  Certainly, nothing is given that equates to the sixties radicals offering vainglorious aid and comfort to the Vietcong.  <br />It should also be noted that Mr. Podheretz wisely does not see justified, severe criticism of the government as a lack of faithfulness to the nation.   He was one of the many eclectic movers and shakers (ranging from Clinton/Gore cheerleaders Alan Dershowitz and Lawrence Tribe to conservative icons William Bennett and incoming Secretary of Labor Linda Chavez) who gracefully signed the brilliant syndicated ad urging the supine congress to take some action against Clinton, Reno, and company  for the savage incursion and kidnapping perpetrated on the noble Gonzales family that infamous Easter weekend.  Despite the natural umbrage he felt by this execrable breach committed by her opprobrious government, his allegiance to hisbeloved America was not diminished.<br />In this zeitgeist where patriotism and fidelity are routinely belittled, this tale of mutual honor and approbation stands as an example to be emulated.	2001-01-08

And while this short collection includes some moving panegyrics, it falls short of what it could have been.  <br />A handful of movers and shakers offer their salutes, but with such a small assortment of power players featured, the curious choices of Hilary Clinton, Edward Kennedy, and Andrew Greeley seem unbefitting.  In many ways these eulogizers are the antithesis of everything Mother Teresa embodied.  While their respectful words may have blended in among a book devoted solely to the memories of the rich and famous, here they comprise a significant portion of the represented bigwigs, and their selection fails to furnish the approbation Mother Teresa so richly deserves.<br />The placement of those three misfits might have suggested that Susan Crimp had some axe to grind but many of the other vignettes strongly indicate that is not the case.  Cardinals Basil Hume and John O'Connor and Bishop Patrick Ahern celebrate the Saint of the Gutters for accentuating their own vocations.  Many ordinary citizens tell how her indomitable example impacted their lives.  While the sympathetic treatment bestowed upon a death row inmate who was profoundly moved by his visit from Mother Teresa could imply a politically correct attitude, the vignette by Joseph Morales implies the opposite.  Morales was an AIDS patient and fallen away Catholic who was given a medal once owned by Mother Teresa.  In his encomium of India's most beloved adopted daughter he encompasses the daring comment, \\"for the past thirty years I was a homosexual, but since I got my medal, my faith has been restored, and I have taken a vow of chastity in honor of Saint Joseph.\\"  He too is presented in a positive light.<br />The chosen comments from royalty are another strange aspect.  Princess Caroline of Monaco's testimonial is one sentence long.  England's Prince Philip laudatory remarks while suitable are far from timely. The passage is taken from a speech he delivered in 1973-nearly three decades before the book's publication.<br />Despite the volume's frequent shortcomings, the section submitted by businessman Kevin McMahon is an absolute gem.  He describes his meeting with Mother Teresa, her words of encouragement, and the many coincidences that lead to the adoption of his daughter shortly after her death.  Obviously well intended and marginally satisfying, the book ultimately fails to reach the magnitude of tribute Mother Teresa earned.	2000-12-29

Yet, this short work recounting the final months of Morrie Schwartz is an exhilarating tribute to the sanctity of life.  The euphemism \\"dying with dignity\\" has become a modern day substitute for \\"let's pull Grandma's plug before she uses up all our inheritance.\\"  Morrie, in his losing battle to the ravishing illness named for Lou Gehrig, received the loving care, warmth, and encouragement of family, friends, and colleagues right up to the natural end.  This respectful treatment may have violated every tenant of the specious bromide, but it afforded him a true death with dignity.  Furthermore, Mr. Schwartz' homebound last chapter allowed him to \\"live with dignity.\\"  While being the recipient of tender support and dedication, he was able to impart courage and wisdom and be a beacon of inspiration to all who interacted with him.<br />It's hard for a book that's achieved such a stellar reputation to live up to its expectations, but Mitch Albom's posthumous love letter to his favorite professor does not disappoint.  Hopefully, it may even provide readers the impetus to contact that person who is long overdue for a call or a letter.	2000-12-26

It expostulates an obvious message that too often in postmodernism, politically correct indoctrination-or whatever catch phrase you like--is not merely overlooked but falsely denied.  <br />During the recent Florida vote recount farce, roly-poly, leftwing Congressman Jerry Nadler said that the \\"whiff of fascism\\" was in the air.   He is just one of many modern day so-called liberals who regularly employ such terminology to derogate those on the right.  Yet as Gene Edward Veith extensively displays, it is precisely those who are so willing to condemn their \\"fascist\\" opponents who are embracing true fascism.  Fascist movements have always flourished among the illuminati. Universities, mass communication industries, and the artistic community have repeatedly been the breeding ground for oppressive movements. These elitist factions are once again in the foreground of efforts to disparage Judeo-Christian morals and replace them with a personal ethic that lacks uniformity or a devotion to the common good.  One of the book's chapters opens with a chilling quote from Hitler, \\"Nothing makes me more certain of the victory of our ideas than our success in the universities.\\"<br />This scholarly tome shines the spotlight on the disturbing irony of fascism.  Today many left-wing radicals regularly summon the designation &quot;nazi&quot; to condemn those with whom they disagree. Either those who espouse this slander are unaware or maybe they're just unwilling to admit that they have far more in common with the nazis than those they so vehemently disdain.  Organized religion so despised by totalitarian regimes is again under fire from much of intelligentsia.  Veith suggests that \\"the ultimate goal of the nazis was to eliminate not only the Jews but the Judeo-Christian tradition.\\"  Today Hollywood treats blasphemy as a noble art form.  Much of the education establishment from kindergarten through college belittles traditional religion at every possible opportunity, and Eugene Oregon's ridiculous ukase outlawing public Christmas trees is a good example of the religious hostility demonstrated by government's at all levels. <br />While the goals may arguably be different, the widespread diversity fads that devalue individuality and pit groups against each other are unsettlingly reminiscent of fascist racial superiority notions.  Such emphasis on cultural groups also diminishes the importance of human lives and as Veith says \\"fascist ideology is today being echoed by apologists for abortion who argue, for example that a child does not have a right to live until it is wanted by its mother and accepted by the human community.\\" Veith warns, \\"multiculturalism encourages the view that identity is a matter of ethnicity and culture rather than individual personality.\\"  <br />Fascist regimes generally employ a devotion to nature not unlike what is now call environmentalism.  A belief that society is corrupt and debauched leads to a reverential victim status for nature, and Veith discusses some of Hitler's programs supporting conservation and wilderness protection to emphasis the analogy. <br />While Veith intelligently lays out his case certain chapters could probably have been strengthened by the inclusion of a few more anecdotal parallels.  The work soars when his probing theoretic arguments are enforced with real world incidents. One amazing passage discusses the mutually admirable correspondence between Hitler and Margaret Sanger until he became convinced that she was too extreme!!  <br />The enticing and debatably well-intentioned tenets of what too often spirals into fascist fanaticism are potently propounded by his caveat that \\"Hitler did not come to power by promoting terror, world war, and holocaust; these were the effects of his ideas...His promotion of cultural identity, environmentalism, and economic justice were very persuasive.\\"	2000-12-21

Most of these smart denunciations have been written by articulate and intelligent ladies like Christina Hoff Sommers, Katie Roiphe, Danielle Crittenden, and Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, but Daphne Patai seems to have zeroed in on a more specialized topic.  Her contribution is devoted to exposing fanatical feminism's unhealthy war on heterosexual behavior.  Some would dismiss the philippics of a few feminist extremists, but Ms. Patai is wisely consistent advising, \\"cultivating hatred for another human group ought to be no more acceptable when it issues from the mouths of women than when it comes from men, no more tolerable from feminists than from the Ku Klux Klan.\\"<br />Heterosexuality generally comes under fire as a result of unchained misandry and a ridiculous sense that all \\"offensive\\" behaviors are equal.  This equivocation leads to disturbed precepts.  Many of the heterophobes she quotes regularly put the use of a sexist word like \\"manhole\\" on a par with rape.  The juxtaposition of these vastly disparate transgressions has lead to many bizarre sexual harassment laws.  Despite the good intentions behind these rubrics, the book presents many cases where they have done far more harm than good.  Ms. Patai presents what she terms the Sexual Harassment Industry (SHI) as a big business that has gained tremendous power over a short period of time.  From the universities who indoctrinate students to scholars who establish restrictive speech allowances, and the lawyers who prosecute the most nonsensical case, the SHI is shown to be a growth industry on the fast track.<br />Professor Patai includes some anecdotes which would sound like jocose fantasies were they not such absurdly sad realities.  She tells of one college lecturer who repeatedly discussed her \\"partner\\"-never letting on that it is her husband and the father of her children.  She also describes a self-loathing man who believing heterosexuality was invidiously patriarchal, converted to homosexuality, but still felt guilty and became celibate.  Among the most wearying of feminist rants is the often expressed claim that all women see heterosexuality as their oppressor or else they are just fooling themselves.  From evidence Ms. Patai puts forth, \\"fooling oneself\\" seems to be a cornerstone of much of modern feminist reasoning.<br />Although she is generous in quoting avatars of heterophobia like Andrea Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon, readers possessing at least a passing familiarity with these radicals will most likely derive enhanced value from this thoughtful book.exuality was invidiously patriarchal, converted to homosexuality, but still felt guilty and became celibate.

Yet somehow, he never reaches the obvious conclusion that such compulsive regulations,even if arguably well intentioned,ultimately lead to a large scale sacrifice of basic freedoms.  <br />He explains how the nazis greatly restricted tobacco advertising, banned smoking in most public buildings, increasingly restricted and regulated tobacco farmers growing abilities, and engaged in a sophisticated anti-smoking public relations campaign.  (Suing tobacco companies for announced consequences was a stunt that mysteriously eluded Hitler's thugs.)  Despite the frightening parallels to the current war on tobacco, Mr. Proctor never even hints at the analogy.  Curiously, he seems to take an approach that such alleged concern for public health shows nazism to be a more complex dogma than commonly presumed.  While nothing present in the book betokens even a trace of sympathy for the Third Reich, this viewpoint seems incredibly naive.  It's easy to wonder if Hitler and company were truly concerned with promoting public health.  The unquenchable lust for absolute control is a far more believable motive.<br />Incongruously some of the book's desultory details lend further certitude to its unpromulgated thesis.  Hitler not only abstained from tobacco; he also never drank and was,for the most part--a vegetarian.  Frighteningly he also was an animal rights activist. The book reruns a nazi-era cartoon depicting many liberated lab animals giving the nazi salute to Hermann Goring after he outlawed animal experimentation and promised to send violators to a concentration camp. Also included is a fitting quote -now too widely suppressed from Joseph Goebbles,  `the fuhrer is deeply religious, though completely anti-Christian; he views Christianity as a symptom of decay.&quot; Controversial as it may be in some circles, such a quote proves that nazism viewedChristianity as hatefully as it did Judaism.  Passing coverage is given to the Third Reich's forays into euthanasia and eugenics. Another striking morsel is the reporting of a widespread nazi-era whispered joke `What is the ideal German?  Blond like Hitler. Slim like Goring.  Masculine like Goebbles...' implying that Gautlier Goebble's homosexuality was common knowledge.  Nazi linguistic restrictions seem to be the counterpart of modern day `hate speech.'   Words such as `catastrophe,' sabotage,' and `assassination' were to be avoided, and in a portentous move, `cripple' was replaced by `handicapped.  Proctor also suggests `the word `enlightenment' (was) probably used more in the nazi period than at any other time.'<br />Perhaps the ultimate overlooked point of this work is the suggestion that Adolph Hitler with his anti-tobacco, anti-religion, pro-animal rights, pro-government intrusion would find success as a modern day liberal.	2000-12-01

She's sort of like the good friend whom we visit whenever possible or that distant relative who seems to have achieved just about everything but never flaunted it in our faces.<br />Her autobiography does a good job of filling in whatever blanks were left for a woman who has spent most of her life in the public eye.  However, unlike many celebrity tell-alls that rely on multiple marriages, rampant illicit sexuality, and boastful solipsism, Barbara's story revolves around her long-lasting marriage, devotion to family, and reverent Christianity.<br />Country music aficionados will enjoy her tales of Nashville and the many intriguing anecdotes of Music City's other movers and shakers.  These too lack the shock value or backstabbing glee that often oozes from celebrity biographies.<br />A great deal of time is understandably dedicated to the Dudney family `s (Barbara and her two oldest children) involvement in a fatal accident.  Tragically an innocent young man lost his life, and under a draconian Tennessee state law, they were forced to sue his family or forego every penny of the millions of dollars in insurance money they could otherwise receive.  As of the book's publication, the painful litigation had not been resolved.  Hopefully, the dire situation has since been rectified.<br />Other highlights include tales of her early years on the road, the foray into television-- which forced a traditional family to live among the anything-goes Hollywood mentality, and numerous adventures that only world travelers get to enjoy. Yet it is the stories of family that make this work soar.  Long before Barbara became a dutiful wife, she was and still is an admiring daughter.  She plainly writes of her parents' shock upon finding an engagement ring in their 16-year-old daughter's room and how they forbid any contact between her now husband and their daughter for six months.  Despite her pain, Barbara writes of her and then-fianc&eacute; Ken's unquestioning honor of her parents directive.  Humorously she mentions how unfair she found their action but concedes that now as a mother, her response would be much more severe.<br />Too many times reading a celebrity's autobiography can elicit a feeling like \\"what a jerk,\\" but Barbara Mandrell proves herself to genuinely be the person her fans always hoped she was.	2000-11-21

His prosperous life proves in America that any dream is achievable. But his Cinderella-caliber transformation was not merely professional.  Dismayed that her baby was blind, Ronnie's disturbed mother abandoned him. He was raised primarily by his loving paternal grandparents although his well-intentioned yet somewhat hapless father was a constant presence in his life.   Today he has been happily married for well over 30 years and is a doting grandfather when not out on tour entertaining his legions of fans.<br />Attending a state-run high school for the blind, the talented youngster gained independence but was subjected to the unchecked discipline of certain thuggish teachers.  In college he considered a career as an attorney, but wisely determined music was more his speed. <br />In addition to the typical biographical data, Ronnie expounds on numerous subjects.  Politically speaking, he expresses outrage over the Supreme Court decision (recent when this work was first published) legalizing flag burning. The conservative patriotic principles he advocates are a welcome change from the usual show biz liberal diatribes.  That's just one of many stereotypes Ronnie Milsap's life has shattered.	2000-11-03

Relying heavily on primary sources  (close to 50% of the book's body is primary materiel and of that quotes from the founders' own writings constitute a good portion), Barton explains how the bromide \\"separation of church and state\\" in its current misinterpretation was the antithesis of what the founders believed.  They strongly advocated promoting religion especially Christianity.  <br />At Valley Forge, George Washington invigorated his troops \\"to the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian.\\"  The Father of our Country later stated that if \\"the Constitution framed in the Convention where I had the honor to preside might possibly endanger the religious rights of any ecclesiastical society, I would never have placed my signature on it.\\"<br /> Thomas Jefferson advocated similar views by signing a treaty with the Kaskaskia Indian Tribe which read, \\"the greater part of the tribe have been baptized and received into the Catholic Church...(and) the United States Government will give annually for seven years one hundred dollar toward the support of a priest...and three hundred dollars to assist the said tribe in the erection of a church.\\" <br /> Judicial Activism was something the founders feared may one day creep into America's courts. George Washington warned \\"if, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or the modification of the Constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment...but let there be no change by usurpation.\\"  Although he was not a founding father, Abraham Lincoln shared this concern; \\"if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have...resigned their government into the hands of the eminent tribunal.\\"<br /> Sadly two small, extraneous passages-each less than a paragraph-undermine the sinew this work would have otherwise carried.  In a chapter devoted to debunking relativism, one relativistic precept is found!  While rightfully mentioning instances where individuals abused Christianity by using at as a justification for very unchristian behavior, Barton incomprehensibly adds, \\"even the World War II Holocaust which many Jews attribute to Christians.\\"  A book devoted to truth should not include such a divisive vagary regardless of how widely the myth has been promulgated.  If he wanted to tangentially mention this often purported sophistry, he should have quoted some of the countless Jewish scholars who have condemned this lie.  He could have mentioned the fact that nazis murdered over 2,000,000 Christians, and Hitler's visceral hatred of Christianity.  A brief summation of the many Christians who shielded Jews was also warranted.<br /> Equally as harmful to the book's virtue is the discussion of isolated founding fathers' prejudice toward Catholics which incorporates the absurd allegation, \\"understandably, the founders did not want individuals leading (the) American government who maintained a sworn oath of allegiance to a `foreign power' (the Pope.)&quot;<br /> \\"Original Intent\\" contains a wealth of vital information and adequately shows why judges should be strict construtionists .  Unfortunately these two unnecessary specious interpolations severely erode the good this work could have done.	2000-11-03

There is something so American about Mr. Wright's works and this upright, exciting tale is no exception.  Fleshed out characters populate a fast-paced allegory where true Christianity is venerated while those who are Christian in name only are seen to be lacking.  <br />This release was one of Mr. Wright's first -if not his actual debut novel, and it made a promise that his prolific career kept.	2000-10-31

A journalistic revolutionary?  King of the Internet?  The bane of the Clinton Cabal?   A pain in the...wherever?  Drudge has been thought of as all these titles and has proudly accepted each appellation for the accuracy it conveys.  Many people despise him; many more admire him, and substantial majorities in both camps rapaciously read him!<br />It is the straightforward wit, up-to-the millisecond news, and abundance of pertinent information typical of the Drudge Report that makes this work somewhat disappointing.  This stream-of-consciousness monograph does not reach the standards set by Drudge's daily worldwide summary.  Dripping with sarcasm, the renegade reporter skewers the media's egotistic hoi polloi and pompous politicians who loudly disparage him while as quietly as possible attempting to copy his style and facts.  Many of his poison arrows hit bull's eyes, but a few miss the target.  (As a poet, Drudge is no Anne Bradstreet!) <br />Despite being one of the most famous names on the planet, Drudge has been rather successful in guarding his privacy, and little of a personal nature is revealed here.  We learn that he is an only child of divorced parents who spent some time in a yeshiva who has a pet cat, but those seeking a biographical background will be disappointed.  On a professional level, Drudge replays  history in the making by detailing his first conversation with Lucianne Goldberg-a fellow virtuous troublemaker not afraid to step on well-deserving toes.<br />At times his e-manner may make the book an annoying read, but it is never boring! The manifesto would be worth more than its purchase price for the epilogue alone.  This final vignette is a reprint of perhaps my favorite issue of the Drudge Report ever.  It is the tale of &quot;Drudge meets Clinton.&quot;   The brief (but oh so memorable) face-off occurred at a black tie White House affair (a formal dinner-not the kind of White House affair normally associated with BillClinton), shortly after Reno's Raiders had invaded the innocent Gonzalez family's home and kidnapped Elian for a return to a life of slavery in Cuba. The oleaginous commander-in-chief's most unyielding pest showed up adorned in a T-shirt emblazoned with a federal gestapo pointing his machine gun at the terrified child.  When Drudge tells Clinton how much he will be missed, it evokes the sight of Jesse Owens being awarded his Olympic Gold Medals under the hateful visage of Adolph Hitler.  Another American original heroically defends an American ideal.	2000-10-23

Lynn Cheney's intelligent book greatly enhances the body of literature dealing with America's cultural decline over the past 30-40 years.  Her positions are astutely made, and the work is rich in specifics.  Unfortunately, it was Mrs. Cheney's brave refusal to hold back that serves as book's sole drawback.  Her graphic descriptions while generally appropriate can be nauseating at times.  In her discussion of the assault on the arts, she references many the shock displays regurgitated into public view by too many so-call museums.  There is just no tasteful way to relate \\"exhibits\\" that feature animal carcasses, human waste products, or pornographic debris that would make Bob Guccioni jealous.  The one instance where the frank minutia seems gratuitous is the recounting of a heinous family murder that begins chapter 3.  Readers may wish to skip this anecdote rather than forego a few nights sleep.<br />Beyond this tendency to lay it all on the line, Mrs. Cheney can hardly be faulted for the brilliant dialectic.  A good portion is devoted to the revisionist theories currently being force fed to college students-especially in humanities-related studies.  She rightly comments on the execrable danger presented by the one-sided indoctrination that has replaced factual learning and the presentation of multiple perspectives in America institutions of higher learning.  The author, herself, demonstrates an exceedingly open mind; she speaks of the good aspects she sees in philosophies such as feminism, multi-culturalism, and Afrocentrism, even though she finds militant versions of these perspectives harmful.<br />The title of the book concerns the overall dismissal of the concept of truth that Mrs. Cheney explains is threatening so many segments of our culture.  She does not truckle in the face of her imperious adversaries, boldly stating, \\"when we find ourselves faced with situations that violate good sense-whether it is how our children are being taught or how our legal systemis abandoning the principles that have long undergirded it-we should, each of us speak out about what we see.  We should not let ourselves be intimidated by seemingly sophisticated statements about how there is no reality and thus no truth.\\"   <br />This book was published in 1995 when her husband's political career seemed to be in permanent hibernation, but it does contain some forward-looking criticism of Al Gore.  Reviewing the vice-president's controversial environmental tome, she castigates his animus toward western civilization and the infallibility of truth.  She opines \\"as Gore describes it, the worldview that led to the scientific revolution has been responsible for everything bad (including `the atrocities of Hitler and Stalin') and nothing good, which does cause one to wonder what worldview the vice president imagines gave rise to anesthesia, (the) polio vaccine, and--his pet project-the information superhighway.<br />Any credible book that advocates veracity naturally criticizes Bill Clinton for his inimical views on truth and his widespread effort to disgrace the concept.  Let's hope that this work serves as a fortuitous augur of an era that celebrates and strives to emulate all that is honest and noble in our American heritage.	2000-10-20

She lays out exactly what the Clinton Administration's most salient accomplishment has been; it severely damaged the United States military.   With an arsenal of ammunition, she fires away showing how what was once the finest fighting force in world history has met its fiercest enemy-bureaucratic overseers who feel the armed forces must be transformed into hot beds of political correctness.  In the \\"new\\" military sensitivity training is more important than combat preparation, a respect for militant feminism is a higher priority than adherence to tried and true military practices, and ensuring that pregnant recruits are accommodated in boot camp has become as urgent as providing day care for soldiers, sailors, airmen(women?), and marines while they are off fighting Sadam Hussain. <br />Ms. Gutmann scores many direct hits on the invaders, but I question why she criticizes what seems to be perhaps the new age military's only change for the better.  Pornography is now banned on ships and in most bases.  While I disagree with the author that this is a detrimental development, I chuckle at the blatant irony. \\"Playboy\\" and \\"Hustler\\" have been outlawed under the watch of a commander-in-chief who cavorts with Hugh Hefner and Larry Flynn and has engaged in scabrous antics in the Oval Office that would make those smutmeisters blush.<br />Clinton is not the sole politician who would weaken the military for his own career advancement to earn the scorn of the author, and she is not timid about naming names. Obvious suspects like Patricia Schroeder are targeted, but a surprising enemy is the much-ballyhooed military hero John McCain.  His self-serving dragoons on the institution's treatment of women were shameful excuses in political posturing.  He even accepted the endorsement of Talihook's less than innocent victims in a direct violation of military policy.<br />Ms. Gutmann efficaciously employs many tools to reinforce her intelligent arguments.   She quotes countless military personnel-a good majority of brave souls even spoke on the record.  Her interview choices wisely boast a heavy dose of women in the service.  These female enlistees are true patriots who in almost every case favor a limited role for their sex in matters of war.  They are not the feminist/prima donnas who are determined to have women infiltrate the sexist services and make them fodder for a \\"Ms Magazine\\" feature.  Throughout the work, Ms. Guttman displays the appropriate amount of sarcasm and humor to batten down her all-too-serious points.	2000-10-10

Not only does she provide an insider's view of life in the prison nation of Cuba, she offers a first hand account of growing up illegitimate with a biological father who had little time or interest in his inconvenient offspring.<br />The Cuban existence she portrays is bleak and empty.  Under Castro's domination, a zeitgeist of amorality has entrapped Cuba and its innocent citizens in a web where dreams don't come true.  Divorce and abortion are rampant and illicit sex begins at a very young age. Alina shows how Castro's officially imposed atheism enslaved the populace and stands as a constant de facto assault on the family structure. Parental rights are nonexistent, because children are only allowed to see their mothers and fathers once a month. To illustrate the country's miasma, she tells of having to wait five years to acquire a used toilet.<br />While she thoroughly documents Fidel's many faults from his murderous rampages to his unsatable sex drive, this autobiography never stoops to the level of a \\"Daddy Dearest\\" style hatchet job.  Alina is equally up front about her own deficiencies that include a string of failed marriages-although that has tragically become the norm in much of Cuban society.  The end shows her transformation with not only her escape to freedom but the conversion to Christianity of her teenage daughter.  The original version ended with an open letter to the despot asking him to legalize Christmas again-a rare concession that has actually been granted.  <br />While she is now a resident of Spain, Alina spent considerable time in the United States this year unsuccessfully fighting to have a common sense approach applied toward the case of poor Elian Gonzalez whose mother valiantly lost her life getting him to freedom only to have her sacrifice obliterated by the gestapo tactics of Bill Clinton and Janet Reno. This book provides an extensive look into life of entropy the lawless raid returned him to. If more Americans could comprehend Alina's story, Elian would not have been evicted and Clinton and Reno would be subjected to appropriate criminal penalties.	2000-10-03

His matter-of-fact analysis was rich in specifics and never stooped to over-the top sensationalism. &quot;The Tyranny of Good Intentions,&quot; delves further into the same theme-in recent years judicial activists and unelected bureaucrats have steadily chipped away at many of the Constitutions Rights that our founding fathers cherished.  Many judicial bedrocks like the necessity of harmful intent have taken a terrible beating during this new era of legalistic chicanery. This multi-tiered usurpation has occurred with the eager approval-or at least the irresponsible indifference--of elected officials at all levels in both political parties. <br />The work is truly a bipartisan broadside.  One of his most cited examples of an over-zealous prosecutor is Rudolph Gulliani. The work cites examples of Supreme Court decisions from the early 1900's that started us down the slippery slope of liberty-infringing policies, and suggests that the push to crack down on crime under Ronald Reagan and George Bush enhanced intrusive tendencies.  <br />With the road paved under the best-laid plans of Reagan and Bush, Roberts and Stratton illustrate how the corrupt Justice Department of Bill Clinton shredded Constitutional protections at a rate unseen in any free country.   Waco, Ruby Ridge, and the Elian Gonzalez cases grabbed the headlines, but they reveal those infamous tragedies as the tip of a dangerous ice burg. They detail many fascist actions that generated little media coverage including the murder of millionaire Donald Scott (by California authorities) on specious grounds and the highly suspicious besting death of Kenneth Trentadue in an Oklahoma prison cell.   The book also discusses multiple cases were justice was abrogated in less violent ways from Leona Helmsley to Michael Milken to the still pending Microsoft case, unprovoked government intrusion is shown as a rapidly escalating threat.  <br />However, any exploration of this topic seems incomplete without a healthy perusal of the unhealthy war against tobacco companies and gun manufacturers currently being waged by governments at all levels.  The authors barely touch on this pernicious trend but do include one terrifying tidbit---&quot;Ralph Nader who is closely tied to these lawsuits, has said that the next ones are alcoholic beverage makers, sugar, fat, and cholesterol-laden food producers, beef producers, makers of fiber-deficient food, X-ray equipment manufacturers, (and) bicycle makers.&quot;  <br />With an exigent presidential election looming, this thoughtful disquisition is an essential book for an open-minded voters to read.	2000-09-26

It is short enough to have been  reprinted as a thought provoking magazine article or would have been a  powerful chapter in a collection of similar orations published in book  form.<br />As an isolated speech it leaves the reader wanting much more.

The only argument against her thesis is that truth is  fungible depending upon ones point of view, and unfortunately ideas  grounded in fantasy cannot be refuted by verity.  As she astutely points  out, it is disingenuous to project current unhealthy race-based obsessions  on to those who lived in ancient Greece and Egypt.  She states, &quot;we  can learn from the ancients; to them culture was a far more important  factor in human behavior than skin color or other 'racial  characteristics.'&quot;<br />While she may be preaching to the choir, her  sermon is thoroughly supported.  It is the wealth of details that I found  to be the book's sole drawback; the extensive minutia make it a somewhat  dry and slightly confusing read to the layman not well versed in Classical  Greece, but she offers a wide array of sources to back all her  arguments.<br />Ms. Lefkowitz is very brave to have undertaken such a work  knowing she would be widely traduced with calumnious charges of racism.   Her belief that factual evidence should support all teaching at the  university level is only polemical to those fanatical diversity proponents  who demand that race issues trump all other considerations--even truth  itself.  She wisely warns &quot;where history-without-facts can lead us  which is right back to fictive history of the kind developed to serve the  Third Reich.  It is not coincidental that ours is the era not just of  Holocaust denial but of denial that the ancient Greeks were ancient Greeks  and creators of their own intellectual heritage.&quot;  Despite the slurs  of her accusers, it is Mary Lefkowitz who is fighting true racism by  advocating that people be credited with their own accomplishments--in short  judged by the content of their character.  Hopefully, this liberal attitude  will once again take precedenceat America's institutions of higher  learning.	2000-09-14

In his gossipy tome, Oppenheimer alleged that Hillary Clinton  used obscene language and made an ethnic slur over twenty years ago.  Both  Clintons rushed to vehemently deny the charge of bigotry (although the  president willingly conceded that the foul language is typical of his  wife.) Disregarding the old adage about people who live in glass houses,  they denounced Oppenheimer due to his former employer's lacking credibility  and hurled invectives at all parties who vouched for the authenticity of  Hillary's statement.<br />&quot;Sell Out,&quot; was written by lifelong  Democrat David Schippers, whose integrity is beyond even the reproach of  the Clintons' mudslinging courtiers who thought nothing of trashing Thomas  Jefferson.  In this examination of the impeachment farce, Schippers  reiterates Juanitia Broderick's corroborated claim that then-Arkansas  Attorney General Clinton raped her a few years after Hillary's now  legendary anti-Semitic malediction. Furthermore, he relates a mid-eighties  incident where the future president tacitly admitted committing the crime.   Still neither Clinton nor their retinue of devotees has whispered the  slightest refutation.  The curious silence that has surrounded this  accusation disturbingly continues.  <br />However, much of this book's umbrage  is not aimed at Clinton, and hardly any mention is made of his ruttish  violations.  There is new evidence regarding the justice obstructing  tactics utilized against Kathleen Willey and Dolly Kyle Browning, but it is  the &quot;new&quot; scandals that are the most insidious.  Before hitting  the congressionally constructed brick wall, Schippers' team unearthed an  illegal naturalization scheme carried out by the INS-an organization that  many are now seeing as America's answer to the KGB.  Despite this  overabundance of Clinton corruption, the most tragic abnegation identified  may have been committed by the Congressional Republican leadership.  Both  in the House and especially the Senate, Schippers paints a picture of  poll-driven politicians terrified of an unpopular issue who chose to  forsake their Constitutional duties in favor of butt-covering acquiescence.   While the Democrat's blind partisanship may have preordained the outcome,  Schippers rightly skewers the craven Republican leaders for staging a sham  trial in a kangaroo court that forbade the presentation of mammoth amounts  of incriminating evidence.   Many readers will not be surprised at this  disgraceful dereliction because this is the same crew that has somehow  failed to conduct significant investigations into the Waco concentration  camp, the nazi-style assault and kidnapping of Elian Gonzalez, or the  statements of 200+ independent  witnesses who claim they saw a missile  bring down TWA Flight 800.  Schippers no-holds-barred expose should leave  us all thankful that the current Republican leadership was not entrusted  with administering justice at Nuremberg.	2000-09-06

The novel has no named central characters; the two protagonists  are defined only as &quot;the man&quot; and the woman.&quot;  The action is  not chronological.  The entire book is a series of flashbacks with each  chapter devoted to a broad, theoretical topic like temptation, religion,  success, failure, etc.  There is very little dialogue and the exact  whereabouts of the plot is never revealed.   Still under the mastery of  Harold Bell Wright, it works!  The author of &quot;Shepherd of the  Hills&quot; is able somehow to make the abstract diagram a satisfying,  rewarding novel that rivals his other works.   Why he ever attempted such a  non-conventional approach is hard to imagine, but lovers of great  literature are awfully glad that he did.	2000-08-29

Although I am convinced that a missile brought down TWA Flight 800 and James Sanders supplies considerable corroborating evidence, I feel he could  have made his case even stronger.   He speaks of the 34 witnesses who saw  the missile, but only identifies about half of them.  He avoids any  discussion of a motive (it is my understanding that he explores that topic  in his later book) and attributes the strike either to friendly fire or an  intentional malice.   The theory of negligence seems to stretch the  boundaries of reality.  If a naval ship had mistakenly launched the  missile, it could not possibly have been kept secret.  Literally hundred of  sailors would have known about it, and somebody would have blabbed.  The  prospect that such a large quantity of people could have kept a secret  would shame the most gullible conspiratorial devotees.  If a missile did,  indeed, cause the death of all the innocent passengers and crew members, it  had to have been a deliberate assault perpetuated by the highest echelons  of a very corrupt government.  Sanders' data (including a photo of the  missile in flight) lends credence to this suggestion that until recently  would have seem to unfathomable to even warrant discussion, but I believe  that his argument could have been more persuasively expounded.	2000-08-28

When  the action takes place in the Bee Master's garden I was tempted to actually  pick some of the blue flowers.  There were times when I was certain that I  was smelling the salt air as I heard the Pacific's Ocean's waves crash on  the sandy beach.  And when the scene shifted to the apiary, it took a  concerted effort not to recoil as the swarms worked their magic, and of  course I craved the delicious honey fresh out of the hive.<br />The wholesome  adventure involves a slowly recovering World War I veteran who runs away  from the hospital to die in the tranquility of the California's coastal  countenance, but instead finds redemption by coming to the aid of an  assortment of fleshed-out characters.  <br />While the book is a beneficial  read, I had a few structural complaints.  At times Mrs. Stratten-Porter's  style seemed haphazard and in isolated incidents, I was delayed by choppy  sentence structure.  The departure of the Brunsons--minor characters  relevant only to the early chapters--seemed disturbingly abrupt, and the  presence of the androgynous Little Scout will no doubt be deliberately  misinterpreted today in ways that the author never intended 75 years ago.   Winnowing 50-100 of its 500+ pages seemed like a feasible option that could  have dulcified the work.<br />Tragically, Mrs. Stratten-Porter did not live to  see this book's publication.  (Perhaps her untimely death prevented the  final proofread which may have assuaged the mechanical drawbacks I  referenced.) It was a posthumous swan song that capped her palmy career.   Based on this beneficent tale, I am very interested in exploring some of  her earlier efforts.	2000-08-25

In addition to knowing Mother Teresa for over twenty years, she  asked her sisters, associates, and volunteers to cooperate with him in  compiling her life story.  As a result, readers are privy to Mother  Teresa's private one on one meeting with Queen Elizabeth, her phone call  from Sadam Hussain, and a hodgepodge of other historical tidbits that  provide nearly unfathomable contrasts.<br />Like any accurate biography of  Mother Teresa, the book discusses her tremendous respect for non-Christian  religions.  One of her lifelong goals was to make people better at their  religion-better Buddhists, better Muslims, better Jews, or better  Christians. The author subtly portrays that as just one of the many ironies  to Mother Teresa.  With the possible exception of the Pope, nobody stood as  a more widely know avatar of the Catholic Church; yet, millions of the  people she aided were not Christians.  An unflinching defender of Catholic  dogma, she unquestionably reached out to those whose problems were the  direct result of what she considered sinful behavior.  From the many  hospices she established to care for AIDS victims to the Missionaries of  Charity's loving worldwide support for unwed mothers, Mother Teresa's  devotion knew no bounds.<br />With its publication about five years before her  death, Navin has produced a felicitous tribute to a woman whose  eleemosynary life will serve as an inspiring example for the remainder of  humanity's existence.	2000-08-04

Host Ralph Emery seemed like a friendly, easy going member of the extended family.  In this collection of  \\"Memories\\" (most of which are the memories of what other people did) he  comes across as arrogant, self-serving, and somewhat bitter.  <br />He makes  insidious allegations against ex-wife Skeeter Davis, and while there are  two sides to every story, her tale is not needed for this version to sound  dubious on its own merits.  Among the anecdotes he includes are juicy  vignettes about many country singers.  Some such as Merle Haggard's  lamentation seems like they were obviously intended to have been kept off  the record.<br />Perhaps the book's biggest drawback is that it lends credence  to the long whispered rumor that Ralph Emery was never a true country fan.   In it he refers to the late Keith Whitley as having won the CMA Horizon  award the year before he died.  In reality, he was nominated but lost.  The  supposed epitome of country radio also states that Nashville's annual thank  you party Fan Fair is held every year in early July, but it is actually  held in early June.  These embarrassing misstatements suggest that the  editors were also not well versed in country music info.	2000-07-31

This olio of essays explores a variety of factions where true liberalism has been hijacked by groups with an agenda that is anything but liberal.  In issues as diverse as tobacco to gun control to federal funding of the  arts, the modern so-called liberals are virtually identical in their  beliefs to Adolph Hitler-someone who never wore the title of liberal.<br />The  nine authors are a mixed lot, but all have obviously done their homework,  and even the less-than-stellar efforts will stimulate any open mind. Some  of the pieces prove very readable, while getting through others is a tad of  a struggle.  Among the strongest are Robert Conquest's \\"Liberals and  Totalitarianism\\" which examines the growing unnatural alliance between  these strangest of political bedfellows. His reasoned suasion piqued my  interest to read his current \\"Reflections of a Ravaged Century.\\"  Australian thinker Keith Windscuttle (an unusual last name must have been a  prerequisite for contributing to this tome) covers \\"Liberalism and  Imperialism\\" in another standout exploration.<br />Hilton Kramer and Roger  Kimball who co-edited the volume contributed a joint exordium that clearly  sets the parameters of this disquisition.  Kimball also contributes an  essay on the philosophy of freedom that contains this courageous common  sense gem, \\"notwithstanding the slogans of our cultural commissars,  `diversity' itself is neither good nor bad.\\"  Despite the somewhat sluggish  pace of a few entries, this concoction warrants a perusal especially by  those pure liberals who resent the piracy of their nomenclature.	2000-07-31

Hamblin is no  fan of whiners constantly looking for a target to blame so they can dwell  in their perpetual victim status.  As a child of a welfare family, he  brings strong credence to his condemnation of government handouts that  enslave generations.   He is not craven about attacking misguided  multi-cultural mendacity that creates class warfare and demeans patriotism.   Among his other beta noirs--loosened morality, anti-American sentiments,  feel good education policies that shortchange students, the worship of  self-esteem, and liberal politicians whose dumb policies do widespread harm  to those they profess to be trying to help.<br />Besides his wise social  commentary, Ken Hamblin is a captivating raconteur.  Reading about his  first visit to the isolated village of Atlantic City, Wyoming (NOT New  Jersey) I saw the innumerable stars twinkling in the endless sky, and when  he relates his solo scuba diving adventure in the eerie murkiness of Lake  Powell, I felt myself actually wanting to come up for air.<br />Ken Hamblin is  justified in boasting that he is living the American Dream.  To achieve his  goals he needed to surmount two kinds of racism.   As a young man, many  \\"whites-only\\" doors slammed in his face, and once he achieved his success  he found many rigid liberals unwilling to accept a challenging black voice  that did not hew to stereotypical standards.<br />My only complaint is that  the book's subtitle \\"An Unassuming Colored Guy Speaks His Mind About  America\\" contains a completely inappropriate word.  Ken Hamblin is about as  \\"unassuming\\" as a tsunami/earthquake combination.	2000-07-28

He is an admirer of John McCain and expresses doubts about Trent Lott and Tom DeLay (both of whose conservative  credentials have also been somewhat debatable of late.) Despite mountains  of evidence proving the contrary, he still holds to the myth of the  Hollywood Blacklist, and although he is greatly troubled by rabid gay  activists he rejects the notion that gays can change and conveniently never  mentions the thousands of former homosexuals who would no doubt disagree  with him.<br />Why he considers himself part of the vast right wing conspiracy  (and why no doubt the Clintons and their goose-stepping cheerleaders would  agree) is that he believes strongly in integrity, personal responsibility,  fidelity, honor, patriotism, and a host of other virtues guaranteed to earn  the disdain of Clintonites.  He also dares to criticize the leftist idols  of day care, revisionism, feminism (which pretty much lost all hints of  credibility under Clinton), and the miasma of lapsed standards felicitously  symbolized by the current commander in chief.  While Clintonism is a  recurring theme, this is a far more encompassing autobiography detailing  Stein's transformation from Communist sympathizer to a moderate American  who leans conservative many times and liberal at others.<br />Both his career  in journalism and his previous involvement in radicalism give him a unique  insider's view into much of the elitists' mindset.  While any open-minded  person sees &quot;The New York Times&quot; descent from liberal objectivity  into a self-righteous, ideologically driven publication, the charge carries  considerably more weight coming from Stein.  Much of the supporting data he  mentions cleverly showcases the extremism that the NYT now subtly (and  sometimes brazenly) vaunts on its pages.<br />Perhaps most striking--in a  rather bemusing way--is Stein's evolution on the abortion debate.  While  bravely admitting that he and his wife have been party to 4 abortions  (separately and together), his half-hearted changed mind seems strange.  He  speaks of &quot;great respect&quot; for the pro-life movement and many of  those in it yet can never see himself fully embracing that position.  He  then goes on to speculate on the children he did not allow to live and  wonder what kind of citizens they would have grown up to be.  Somehow this  section reads like the torment of a man who is understandably unable to  face a painful reality.  Stein devotes another stimulating portion to the  ubiquitous anti-Americanism and divisive multiculturalism found in much of  modern American education.  In a chilling passage, he describes how the  Communist organizations to which he once belonged had greater respect for  the United States and its founding fathers than do the rebel rousing  educrats who unctuously spew this diversity dribble.<br />Throughout the book,  this right wing conspirator employees smart wittiness, sardonic insights,  and a healthy ability not to take himself too seriously.	2000-07-21

A more eloquent case could not be made proving how vitally we need the 2nd Amendment than this pastiche of straightforward vignettes about ordinary American citizens who owe their lives to the fact that they own guns.  Far  from the thrill-seeking vigilantes often portrayed by gun control  advocates, these gun owners are a diverse assortment of law-abiding men and  women who, through no fault of their own, came face to face with murderous  criminals.  <br />Often it was with extreme reluctance that they used their  weapons.  In one very moving case a woman who sustained a severe beating  before  fatally wounding her assailant speaks of being haunted by the fact  that she had to kill someone's son just before Mother's Day.  Another story  profiles gentleman car-jacked and forced into his trunk, where he kept two  guns.  When confronting his kidnapper, he fired three warning shots in the  unsuccessful hope of not having to take the teenager's life.<br />Perhaps the  book's most unsettling fact is the evildoers knowledge that they should  stringently avoid Mom and Pop shops where the owners untethered by  politically correct corporate policies are likely to be armed and readily  able to defend themselves.  Too many chain stores will willingly sacrifice  a few replaceable employees in order to gain some valuable public  relations.<br />Certainly this book has its sad elements; it's not pleasant to  read about the lives snuffed out-even though it was the direct result of  their inhuman actions.  Still, overall it is a truly inspiring read.  It  made me think of some celebrated victims-like Nicole Brown, Ron Goldman,  and Juanita Broderick--whose tragic fate may very well have been altered by  the presence of a firearm.<br />While &quot;The Best Defense&quot; make no  political points in favor of gun ownership, these living, breathing  individuals stand as constant refutations to the tyrannical voices of gun  control.  This is Robert A. Waters' first book, and he has written a very  hard act to follow.	2000-07-17

Its vast extent and  its variety of climate and productions are of advantage, in this age, for  one people, whatever they might have been in former ages.  Steam,  telegraphs, and intelligence have brought these to be an advantageous  combination for one united people.\\"  December 1, 1862<br />President  Lincoln's selfless advocacy for the equality and individuality of all  Americans stands in virtuous contrast to the current push for group rights  which is Balkanizing the nation he fought and died to keep in tact.  His  commendation of the melting pot far surpasses today's wacky thrust toward  multi-cultural mush. <br />\\"Our popular government has often been called an  experiment.  Two points in it our people have already settled-the  successful establishing and successful administering of it.  One still  remains-its successful maintenance against a formidable internal attempt to  overthrow it.\\"  July 4, 1861<br />Honest Abe overcame the seemly  insurmountable task of reuniting an America at war with herself, and in the  process expunged the disgrace of slavery from the land.  What would he  think of a President who 130+ years later would continually flout the rule  of law, cavort egregiously within the confines of the White House's most  hallowed locales, and elevate politics and success far above principle?   Would the divided country be as vicious a foe as a culture that sought to  debase America's lofty past with revisionist public school curriculums and  Hollywood offerings celebrating deviancy while condemning decency?<br />\\"There  is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country  which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious.\\"  December  1, 1862<br />In 1862, not many people wanted to hear the president utter such  a statement.Lincoln, was NOT a politician whose ultimate goal was being  reelected or maintaining high poll numbers.  He was a leader who said what  was right whether it won him approbation or rancorous scorn.  Wouldn't it  be inspiring to hear such untested politically incorrect veracity today?   <br />\\"If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and  finisher.  As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time or die by  suicide.\\"   January 27, 1838<br />With activist judges regularly decimating  the Constitution, music and movies praising perversion, a ruling cabal lead  by an mendacious adulterer who too often seems to follow the teachings of  Adolph Hitler more than Abraham Lincoln (Elian Gonzales, Waco,  partial-birth abortion etc.), if our sixteenth president could see us now,  he would probably ponder if America was precariously on the brink of  suicide.	2000-07-14

She's a lying, enabling, trashing, condescending, egotistical reprobate--a virtual clone of her spouse.  A book devoted to her plethora of negatives could easily get  bogged down into pleonastic screed, but this work soars.  Anyone who read  Peggy Noonan's recent widely distributed op ed piece &quot;Why Did They Do  It?&quot; about the government's nazi-style kidnapping of Elian Gonzalez  knows that she is nothing short of a maestro with the written word.  She  does with a paper and pen what Michaelangelo did with a slab of  concrete.<br />Even though Hillary is the title character, Ms. Noonan realizes  that the Clintons--unconventional as their marriage may be-- are  inextricably intertwined. They may not be the typical man and wife, but  they are full-fledged partners in slime whose misery and misdeeds will keep  them together unhappily ever after.   <br />Unlikely many political  conservatives, the author reveals an initial respect for and hope that the  Clintons would prove successful and good for America.  Like many liberals  (as well as conservatives and moderates) she became disgusted by the  profligate shenanigans to which they subjected the country that he was  entrusted to guide. The book subtly captures the irony of a militant  feminist who demurred disinterestedly while the world learned the perverse  details of her husband's sexcapades with an intern barely older than their  daughter.  Hillary, whose disdain for the uxorial role is well-known, must  have boiled over privately that her greatest public support came when she  was forced to play the part of a wronged wife.<br />Especially delectable is  the description of a fantasy palaver between Hillary and  Hollywood's most  powerful magnates at Michael Eisner's house. Although the scene is too  bizarre for belief, Peggy perfectly captures the cadence of Hillary and her  show biz cheerleaders that readers are completely pulled into the  surrealism of it. <br />Suffice it to say that this is a must read.  In Peggy  Noonan's magical manner, she masterfully outlines the enigma of the  Clintons.  Their depravity is their strength.  They do not have a  willingness to lie; they have a need to.  They are experts at believably  telling the most brazen stories without any hint of verisimilitude and are  equally skilled at condemning anyone who dares to scoff at their nonsense.   While Hillary may not share in her husband's unrestrained concupiscence,  her lust for power is every bit as potent.<br /> Ms. Noonan has written many  great speeches and mind-expanding columns, but this could be her most  important effort yet.   If it convinces any open-minded, wavering New  Yorkers not to select Hillary as their next senator and retire both  Clintons to New York, Arkansas, or whatever state draws the short straw,  then we will all owe her a huge debt of gratitude.	2000-06-27

A few days ago I was ready to give the collection five stars but the egregiously macabre &quot;Ethan  Brand&quot; and &quot;The Old White Maid&quot; caused it a few points.   These two tales are out of place among Hawthorne's other gems; they seem  more suitable to Edgar Allen Poe on a night when he was feeling exceedingly  gruesome.<br />Among the highlights is &quot;Feathertop&quot; an eccentric  piece about a witch whose magic pipe gives life to her scarecrow.   &quot;The Prophetic Pictures,&quot; allegedly based on a true incident, is  an intriguing yarn of a painter whose portrait accurately predicted his  subject's forthcoming madness.  &quot;The Gray Champion,&quot; a patriotic  tale, must have been a hit with Hawthorne's good friends President and Mrs.  Franklin Pierce.   A recurring theme through Hawthorne's works is the  individual's perpetual battle with character flaws-a motif that makes them  suitable to our modern age and indeed timeless.  Many of the allegorical  elements including the notorious &quot;A,&quot; Hawthorne immortalized in  &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; are scattered throughout these works.<br />The  proem by Newton Arvin offers an interesting biographical summary of the  author's life.  Much has been written about Nathaniel  Hawthorne-unquestionably one of America's finest and most beloved authors,  and there is little I can add to voluminous evaluations.  However, to  anyone interested in building his or her vocabulary, Hawthorne's writing  offers a cyclopean lagniappe to dulcify sesquipedalian pursuits.  For me  that aspect was as beneficial as the enjoyable vignettes.	2000-06-22

Technically a sequel to his most famous work, &quot;Shepherd of the Hills,&quot; this latter story can easily stand on its own. Except for a  few references to &quot;Shepherd&quot; characters and the brief appearance  of Dan Matthews's parents who figured prominently in the prequel, &quot;A  Higher Call&quot; is an independent tale.<br />While never critical of  organized religion, the novel does point out how hypocrisy can too often be  found in churches' inner organizations.  Unlike Hollywood's commonplace  Christian-bashing which always fingers the clergy, this novel celebrates an  idealistic young minister up against some self-important lay people who  wield too much power and militate too many church policies.  It is the  embrace of true Christianity that Wright's works often subtly embrace, done  here in a more overt fashion.<br />Readers should beware that &quot;A Higher  Call&quot; is the exact same book as &quot;The Calling of Dan  Matthews.&quot;  A new title is the sole difference.  To paraphrase the  Bard, a book this uplifting by any name is still a good read.	2000-06-21

He is a man of integrity, convictions, patriotism, Christianity, and honesty-quite a departure from his two most recent predecessors. <br />The  bulk of this disquisition concerns the attempted hijacking of his first  inauguration. The convicted Governor Jim Guy Tucker changed his mind about  resigning less than ten minutes before Lieutenant Governor Huckabee was to  be sworn in.  The State Constitutional Crisis was quickly thwarted by the  united outrage of Arkansas' heavily Democratic controlled legislature.<br />In  relating this tale of public servants putting their honor above their  party, Huckabee does not descant on the obvious irony.   In this scenario  it was the Democratic Party and Arkansas politicians who saw their duty and  boldly threatened an expeditious impeachment proceeding to restrain a law  breaking chief executive. Not too many years later the National Democratic  Party abnegated its duty when an Arkansas-bred Chief Executive  contemptuously subjected the country to a Constitutional Crises. <br />The  governor devotes less time to several other segments of his public life and  includes a few biographical sketches.  Whatever the subject, he displays a  trenchant mind and a true dedication to serving mankind.  It is not  difficult to see why he was previously very successful as a minister.  In  addition to the clergy and politics, he may also have a calling as an  author.  Like his second book &quot;Kids Who Kill,&quot; I read this one  all the way through in less than 24 hours.	2000-06-20

Clinton loyalists have no interest in plenary dialectics, nor  are they concerned with basic facts.  Spin trumps all when it comes to  Slick Willie.  <br />This revised version includes an afterward written  following the noble impeachment and the rushed mock trial staged in the  U.S. Senate.  Rather than provide Monday Morning Quarterback reflection,  this postmortem revisiting allows for additional analysis of what was a  widely known preordained conclusion.  Bennett rightly argues that the  Democratic Party has some repair work to do to its image and integrity.  He  cites NJ Senator Frank Lautenberg's brazen gratitude to smutmeister Larry  Flynn for his defense of the Adulterer-in-Chief and profligate praise from  many other Democrats whose unconditional support of their leader disgraced  their party's long history of rectitude and character.<br />Perhaps most  telling is the synopsis of Democratic replies to Juanita Broderick's  undisputed charge that Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton raped her two  decades ago.  The noisy defenders suddenly become eerily quiet, and even  Clinton's most drooling sycophants-who so willingly smear the name of  anyone opposing their leader-fail to speak out against Mrs. Broderick.   Bennett quotes Dee Dee Myers and David Gergen-both of whom seem to  tacitly-and very unhappily-acknowledge their belief in the authenticity of  Mrs. Broderick's claim.<br />I do have one criticism of Mr. Bennet concerning  a lack of disclosure.  At one point he mentions that Clinton's lawyer (who  remains unnamed) was forced to admit to a judge that he had unknowingly  assisted his client in promulgating specious information.  The author  should have identified the attorney as his brother, Robert Bennett.	2000-06-20

Her response is certainly  understandable because the referenced source materials certainly surpass  the innuendo and outright sophistry of her books, and the charges against  her are severe.  From shoplifting to rampant dishonesty (that allegation  should cause little surprise among those familiar with her work), to  uninhibited sexual hi-jinks, Carpozi throws it all at Kelley, and it  certainly is enjoyable watching him score so many bull's eyes.  His most  striking charge is the strong possibility that Kelley gave birth to an  illegitimate child in her much younger days.  While that may never be  proven, there is no denying that she has given birth to a huge body of  illegitimate literature that has disgraced her far more than it could ever  hurt her intended targets.	2000-06-20

Unfortunately, most of the essays in this collection move at a snail's pace and failed to fully engage me. I would have found it more  beneficial if he had employed more anecdotal vignettes rather than utilize  a broad, abstract approach in addressing social problems.<br />Most of this  collection was previously released in other publications or delivered as  speeches, and from what I have read of his work in the past, this selection  is far from the cream of his crop.  <br />Still the crepuscular presentation  does not fully obliterate the smart insights conveyed among the included  passages.

In fact, a few of the brave souls cited by  Bernstein for their unpopularly heroic stands against multi-cultural  mumbo-jumbo have impeccably liberal resumes.<br />Bernstein himself is not  someone who falls into the ultra right wing category.  A former journalist  for publications not known as sympathetic to conservatives,&quot; he  occasionally mentions that he favors multi-culturalism but obviously  worries about what happens when it is taken to the extreme levels he  documents as being the norm in many educational institutions from grammar  schools up through colleges.<br />Bernstein offers a broad summary on the  diversity craze that has engulfed much of academia, government, and  corporate America.  Through the examples he cites, he astutely reveals one  of the fads' practitioners' most punitive pursuits--their unabashed  willingness to smear anyone who merely questions any segment of this shaky  doctrine.  Proponents of this brainwashing technique never catch the irony  that they are squashing all diverse opinions in favor of one tolerable  mindset.  That this is all done in the name of tolerance and diversity  would be amusing were the stakes not so high.<br />The book's highlight and  one of the most significant assaults on the diversity warfare is the  detailed effort against New York City's planned rainbow curriculum close to  a decade ago.  An uncoordinated effort of multi-racial voices valiantly  fought and successfully defeated the city's wacky plan to teach alternate  sexual practices beginning with books like &quot;Heather has two  Mommies&quot; in kindergarten.	2000-05-25

To justify its egregious use of force, the  government leveled many outlandish charges at David Koresh and his  followers.  Thibodeau convincingly refutes most of them.  However, the  sect's leader did subject his followers to some truly eldritch practices,  and credible allegations suggest he was guilty of engaging in sexual  relations with underage girls.  He should have been arrested for this  illegal act, and the local authorities should also have prosecuted any  adults who were aware of  such a heinous action and remained silent.   Neither the FBI, the ATF nor the federal government in any capacity  typically get involved in statutory rape cases.  Unfortunately for all the  victims of this pogrom, the incident happened right after the appointment  of attorney general Janet Reno who seemed desperate to show off her macho  power.<br />  One of the government's tiresome claims was that the attack  was necessary to prevent child abuse.  The actions taken belie this  fallacious defense.  To force the final confrontation, Reno's raiders  sprayed the complex with a potent form of tear gas recently rejected by the  U.S. Army as inhumane. This was accompanied by sniper fire, a tank assault  and the suspiciously started conflagration.  Willingly murdering several  little children in an unprovoked dragoon does seem to reduce Clinton and  Reno's repeated vocal concerns for the children to shameless hypocrisy.       The Constitution does not allow for this type of  treatment of those  who fall out of favor with our leaders, even  when the victims are  suspected-or convicted felons.   Unfortunately that document has largely  been ignored by our current president and his epicene attorney general.  If  they followed it, they could not justify confining, nearly starving, and  then obliterating a group of American citizens.  Six decades ago in Europe  another elected leader provided similar treatment to those he deemed  unworthy.  He imprisoned them in places like Dachau and Auschwitz.	2000-05-19

He expounds upon colleges that dictate with one multi-racial voice the diversity views to which all students must rigidly adhere, and highlights corporations who put popular fads inspired  by ex-sixties radicals ahead of profits.  Through this chronology of mass  destruction a sad situation is carefully unfolded. These vehement group  thought campaigns seem suitable to glory days of Communist regimes.   Tragically, this unhappy state of affairs is not an apercu of those Iron  Curtain failures but a living nightmare taking place in the very nation  whose shining example laid them low.<br />Especially disconcerting are the  documented impacts seen on America's military.  Congressional efforts to  dulcify feminists and other militant shouters has left the world's finest  fighting force battling the its most dangerous foe-political  correctness.<br />One complaint is Gross's unwelcome use of the term \\"human  kind.\\"  In a book that so brilliantly attacks postmodern sensitivity, the  use of such a phrase is at best distracting if not downright derogatory.	2000-05-03

Conrad LaGrange, the celebrated author, begrudgingly iterates that  his wealth and esteem have been acquired by accentuating the profane and  sacrificing the nobility of his profession.

America is currently on the wrong track and many indications suggest that we are careening out of control headed for a crash.  Some will dismiss this scholarly book as &quot;right-wing fanaticism,&quot; but common sense demands that we look a  little deeper.   Why have so many great empires collapsed throughout  history?  Is it just a coincidence that several traits existed in every  mighty nation that took a fall?<br /> When Pope John Paul speaks of our  current &quot;Culture of Death,&quot; he could just as easily reference the  latter stages of the Roman Empire or the heydays of Carthage.  When many  complain of the excesses of big government with its rapacious taxation  policies, they could apply that charge to most of the other chronicled  nation states.  In ancient civilizations the evil practice of sacrificing  newborns to the gods was commonplace, and today in America inconvenient  babies are killed in their mother's wombs with the government's  imprimatur.<br />Even less obvious example abound. The popular diversity and  multiculturalism fads annoy most of us, but too often we dismiss them as  silly diversions rather than look to the perils they truly pose.  In every  once great nation laid low, there were forces working to create class wars  and split people apart based on artificial considerations similar to our  current &quot;group rights&quot; campaigns. The breakdown of the family,  which goes hand-in hand with sexual licentiousness, is equally indicative  of past imploded civilizations.  Nero's impudent concupiscence could  compete with Bill Clinton's any day. <br />While all decent people in our era  are appalled at Oliver Stone's &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; and much of  the other gory garbage ejaculated by Hollywood's poison factories, ancient  Rome regularly fed Christians to the lions in front of hordes of howling  spectators.  (Fortunately, Tinsel Town's tiny brain cells haven't figured  out how to get away with that yet.)  We currently have prime-time sitcoms  populated by sex-crazed sybarites; they had public orgies like the one  depicted and vociferously defended by Hollywood's legion of janissaries in  &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot;<br /> I do have two minor criticism of this  work.  At times I felt it could have been better organized; in a few cases  topics seem to weave in and out.  Secondly, I think this version's appendix  is incomplete because its abrupt end leaves the reader hanging.<br />  Still, it a badly needed wake-up call.  Jim Nelson Black agrees that there  is still time for America to turn back from its dangerous course, but as  Americans we must all decide if that is what we truly want. <br /> I read  this book a few months ago and wrote the above review which for some reason  never accepted when I tried downloading it.  Since that time we have seen  the government of a so-call liberal president have federal forces execute a  nazi-caliber raid and kidnap a small child from innocent U.S. citizens.   Sadly it may be time to add America's name to the list of nations that have  died.	2000-04-27

While there are strong  indications (namely ear-witnesses) that this now famous exchange took  place, whatever happened in the final seconds of her life are not nearly as  important as what occurred over the previous 17+ years.<br />The tragic irony  that her mother bravely relates is how close Cassie came to being sucked  into the same grip of hopeless turpitude that destroyed Eric and Dylan and  lead to the slaughter of 13 innocent people.  It is moving to read how much  empathy Misty could employee toward the Kleibolds. Despite losing her  daughter at their son's hands, she could see how their suffering is far  worse.  There is a world of difference between losing a martyr and losing a  murderer.  Just a few years ago Cassie was careening down the wrong track,  but the love of her attentive parents and their strong faith lead them out  of the abyss.  Cassie's genuine change of heart is evidence of the ultimate  twist of fate.  How fortunate she died with a renewed heart ready to meet  God; yet in her previous miasma, she probably would have answered  &quot;no&quot; and may have been spared.  Still, by maintaining her life  under those circumstances, she would have lost far more.<br />Anyone wishing  to see Cassie Bernall as some sugar-coated goody-goody will be disappointed  in this honest portrait, but those willing to learn the whole story of  someone who made horrid mistakes in her life before seeing the light will  come away saddened but inspired.  Her mother's rhetorical question of what  her own answer would have been is one we should all contemplate.	2000-04-17

While not denying that isolated incidents of police brutality exist nor in  any way reducing the scourge of true racism, this book investigates false  claims whose only intents are to destroy hard-earned reputations and bring  celebrity status to trouble-making accusers. <br />When a police officer kills  a member of a minority community in the line of duty-sometimes even if the  officer is himself a member of a different minority-he will face a  phantasmagoria of controversy.  This onslaught is usually started by  individuals who have no direct connection to the case-nor any first hand  knowledge of it.  Neither of these deficiencies prevents the vociferous  activists from becoming instantaneous self-proclaimed experts who somehow  command extensive media attention and whose hypothetical charges rarely  receive substantial evaluation. <br />This well-researched work documents  several accounts of heroic policemen who had their lives turned upside down  by such roisterous fame-seekers.  As bad as the wild charges by outside  interlopers are, many of these courageous men saw opportunistic politicians  condemn them too.  One cited example happened in Newark, New Jersey where  Mayor Sharpe James called a policeman a &quot;murderer&quot; because the  officer fatally shot a person attempting to run him down!  <br />These  conscienceless activists in reality care very little about true racism;  secretly they are probably glad they have these minority victims to help  enhance their pelf. Obviously, they care nothing for the dedicated officers  who must feel tremendous angst after taken a person's life, regardless of  how justified the action was.<br />Hopefully this timely collection will be  the first in a long line of works to help expose this fraudulent anddangerous conglomerate because the ranks of these activists have been  escalating.  Currently, Hilary Clinton is attempting to traduce some New  York City policemen in effort to become her target state's next senator.   Across the Hudson River and party lines, political correctness queen and  New Jersey Governor Christie Whitman cared little when some  dedicated  state troopers were slenderized.  The wild charges that she at least  partially endorsed have ruined the morale throughout the force.   Fortunately her efforts to receive a blind coronation over the remains of  heroic cops backfired and she had to abandon her bid for the United States  Senate. &quot;Cops Under Fire&quot; is a necessary weapon to help restrain  all self-serving ax-grinders who would ride racism and tragedy to ignoble  fame and glory.  Those of us who detest real racism should beware of  individuals who shout fictitious accusations that bolster their own  interests.	2000-04-13

Although trained as a vet, James Herriot  had a true gift with the written word.  These tales about pets and their  two-legged counterparts shine a light deep into the mechanisms of human  nature.  <br />  While he succeeded admirably as an honorable animal  doctor and found worldwide fame as a late-in-life author, perhaps he missed  his true calling as a psychologist.  The humor, heartbreak, and humanity  that he so eloquently captures in these stories shows a sagacious mind.  It's no wonder that his time on earth brought many smiles and caused many a  tail to wag.	2000-04-13

While much hoopla has been made over the past ten years regarding the Walt Disney Company's departure from everything its founder embodied, few exposes have probed as deeply or turned up a fraction as much dirt as this  work offers.   In fact, the Schweizers explore some new territory in their  frontal assault on what may be America's most dishonest company.  Many  works of this nature rely heavily on anonymous sources, second-hand  guessing, or other questionable inferences.  Whatever one think of  this  thorough expose, it should be commended for corroborating nearly every  charge with a named first-hand source.  From the slaves who toil in Asian  sweat shops making Disney merchandise to the Disney employees who identify  their pedophilia-practicing or voyeuristic co-workers to the law  enforcement authorities citing company cover-ups of homicides and fatal  accidents occurring on Disney property, every specific allegation is  supported by a one or more credible identified accuser.<br />The  conglomerate's lust for profits regularly puts patron in harm's ways at its  theme parks.  Rides that once closed during electrical storms, now  routinely stay open, and named Disney employees are quoted as saying they  are told to lie to inquiring customers asking if it is safe to board.   Whenever anyone is injured-even seriously--at a Disney park, face-saving  policy dictates that Guest Relations is called before 911.  This allows  park ambassadors to schmooze victims before they can receive  treatment.<br />Compared to these physical dangers, the debauched  entertainment of the new Disney seems tertiary. Despite the widespread  sleaze that it puts out under its various pseudonyms, The Walt Disney  Company still claims to be family-friendly.  With subsidies offering  pay-per-view porn, satanic--drug-glorifying--pro-suicide heavy metal music,  and movies among Hollywood's most depraved, that boast is seen to be  nothing more than public relations prevarication.  Even its allegedly  family fare has undergone a massive transmogrification. From the  politically correct fascism of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; which slandered the  reputation of many real people of integrity, to the plagiarism behind  &quot;The Lion King,&quot; Disney animated features are not quite up to the  standards of old.  In Disney's Hall of Presidents diorama, the revisionist  approach is also seen.  A patriotic speech delivered by Abraham Lincoln was  the exhibit's featured attraction for years.  The new liberal mindset at  Disney has replaced such deleterious nationalism with a more inclusive  sounding talk.  But the real kicker is that Lincoln is no longer the only  president to speak; Bill Clinton's robot (and I don't mean Al Gore) is now  given an oration to present!<br />Perhaps the most hateful aspect of this  remade company is virtual contempt shown to the memory of it founder.   Jeffrey Katzenberg and a handful of Michael Eisner's other camarilla seem  to delight in disgracing his name.  Remarks like &quot;I haven't been out  to his gravesite so I don't know if he's spinning&quot; pepper their  conversations.   Objective readers will acquire at least a more suspicious  view of the mega-corporation, and even the most ardent devotees should  never allow their children on to Disney property without the supervision of  a trusted adult.  While some will dismiss this extensively researched work  as the screed of &quot;Disney-haters,&quot; the Schweizers maintain  powerful credibility by being former long-time Disneyites, and they  obviously still carry tremendous respect for Walt Disney the man.  He was a  remarkable talent who brought much joy to the world.  Tragically, his  legacy is now routinely betrayed by the empire he created and the obnoxious  coterie that runs it.	2000-04-03

Instances of children bringing arsenals to school and willingly murdering fellow classmates are becoming  shamefully commonplace. Human excrement is used in a blasphemous &quot;art  exhibit&quot; at a prestigious museum in Brooklyn and when New York City's  mayor pulls its public funding, noisy bashaws condemn him not for his  failure to close the den of perversion but for ending it taxpayer-funded  hand outs.  A nazi-admiring hit man, Jack Kevorkian, fulfills contracts on  over 100 depressed and ailing individuals but goes free and becomes  something of a cult celebrity before his murder-for-hire practice is shut  down.  Every one of these atrocities is a real situation in modern day  America.<br /> All of these developments occur with the encouraging  support of many movers and shakers and much of the public at large gives  them at least tacit approval.  Still millions of others lament that such  depravity his infiltrated the United States.  How could both of those  attitudes exist simultaneously.  In her erudite treatise, historian  Gertrude Himmelfarb argues that we have become one nation with two often  opposing cultures. The two cultures she identified are similar in one way;  each is having an increasingly difficult time comprehending the other one.   Topics like abortion, homosexuality, profanity, a sex-obsessed and brutally  violent popular culture, and cross-dressing, are discussed openly and often  celebrated by one segment, while the other feels such pernicious activities  should not even be mentioned in polite society.  One side cherishes  religion, traditional family, patriotism, self-control, self-respect (not  self-esteem), time-honored manners, and personal responsibility; traits  dismissed as archaic and somewhat harmful by the antipodal culture.  One  side fights to make it a crime to burn the American flag while the other  strives to legalize same-sex marriage.<br /> The author, a Victorian  epicure, writes as objectively as possible but is obviously tendentious  toward the scoffed at counter-culture of traditionalists. She repeatedly  documents how crime rates, racial tensions, illegitimacy, declining  educational standards and so many of the other problems that the  progressive culture seems concerned about were indeed far better when the  counter-culture's viewpoint was prevalent. <br /> Fanatically liberal  readers may disagree with many of the author's arguments, but only those  whose minds have been slammed shut will fail to find her dialectics  thought-provoking.	2000-03-24

When it comes to amorality, dishonesty, and covering their tracks Bill and Hillary are mirror images of each other.  In &quot;Hell to  Pay&quot; Barbara Jordan outlines a plethora of disreputable events that  have Hillary's fingerprints on them.  Some are very well known-the Travel  Office Mess, the White Water Fiasco, and the sell-out of the Lincoln  Bedroom--while others have garnered scant media attention at best.<br />  The author cleverly begins each chapter with a quote from &quot;Rules for  Radicals&quot; by Hillary's former mentor Sail Alinsky.  These disturbed  vagaries help reveal what eldritch plans are being hatched in Hillary's  brain. <br />Barbara Olson is one of the first people to so clearly point out  what may be the Clintons most despicable defense tactic.  With the help of  their sycophantic epigones they brazenly traduce the memories of previous  presidents, and these wide-spread smear campaigns apply not only to the  likes of Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, but extend to Franklin Roosevelt,  Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington.  By treating the most preposterous  rumors as apodictic pronouncements and citing the flimsiest of evidence,  Clintonites mounted a full scale assault to drag Jefferson's memory down to  the level of Bill.  A horrendous step taken solely to help salvage his  meretricious presidency.   When writing an expose of either Clinton, it is  tempting to explore, speculate, and conjecture about their separate and  mutual sex lives, but beyond the titillatingly obvious, there is a mountain  of other scandals that warrant extensive investigating.  The author does  touch on the Juanita Broderick allegation and includes that now often  repeated story that Hillary approached the victim shortly after her  encounter with Bill.  Since that case has never been denied (or confirmed)  by either Clinton, it is a question every New York journalist andmore  importantly every New York voter should ask the senatorial candidate at  every opportunity until it receives a full, straight, non-clintonian reply.	2000-03-22

Somehow these  two polar opposites existed simultaneously for years and years, and in the  later part of their lives merged into one well-round flesh and blood  institution.<br />As a child the girl who would be come Minnie Pearl had an  atypical life for her time and local. Born the youngest of five daughters  to a college-educated mother and successful businessman father, little  Sarah Cannon grew up in an upper middle-class world complete with servants  in small town Tennessee.

When rumor spread that an  unruly crowd of vigilantes was planning to break him out of jail and lynch  him, she remembered her father and a handful of other men confronting and  dispersing the vengeful mob despite her mother's fears that he might be  injured or killed himself.  When writing the book nearly six decades later,  she said that she no longer remembered the trial or if the suspect was  found guilty or innocent; however, her family's loving pride in her  father's heroic actions were fresh in her mind.  <br />Sarah Caldwell's  marriage to Henry Cannon was far from the standard show biz union-she died  just shy of their golden anniversary, and she wrote clearly of her belief  in the sacredness of marriage.  Married in their mid-thirties, the  Caldwell's never had children which was an obvious disappointment, but they  believed and accepted that childlessness was God's plan for them.  Despite  never becoming parents themselves, the humor of Minnie Pearl remained  family friendly until her death.  Her father, who only lived to see the  early day's of his daughter's alter ego, had fortuitously advised her that  she would make a fortune off that character if she kept her kind, and  &quot;kind&quot; is a word that appropriately describes the career of  Minnie Pearl and her wholesome humor.<br />Although she was a well-known  celebrity, Minnie boasted that neither her mother nor her husband was the  least bit impressed by show biz fame.  Her mother met &quot;This is Your  Life&quot; Host Ralph Edwards at a Methodist convention and they hit off  very well regardless of the fact that she had never heard of him nor knew  what he did for a living.  In a more humorous instance, Sarah related a  classic moment when she was invited to the opening of a Broadway play.  As  she and her husband sat in a front row awaiting the curtain, an excited   hush fell on the crowd, Sarah looked over and pointed out Elizabeth Taylor  who was taking a seat near them.  Thinking it was someone he knew but was  inadvertently ignoring Henry rose, approached her, shook her hand, and  apologized for not seeing her come in. <br />Now that much of modern day  country music has veered of course, it is especially touching to read this  book.  It is important for those Nashville celebrities and all comedians  who feel they need off-color innuendo or vulgarity to be successful to  remember that Minnie Pearl's career thrived and Sarah Caldwell had a happy,  productive life without ever lapsing into such base trappings.	2000-03-21

Grant (Civil War)	Books	4	17	43	N	N	Now That's A President	There's a natural tendency when reading a presidential autobiography to compare the subject to the current leader.  In this case it is hard to believe that Grant and Clinton belong to the same species.<br />Ulysses S.  Grant embodied valor and probity on and off the battlefield.  Bill Clinton  has achieved historical profligacy in and out of his trousers.  Modern day  illuminati may scoff in disbelief at Grant's non-boastful statement that he  never used profanity, but that is consistent with the integrity that guided  his actions.  Clinton will long be remembered for perpetuating the most  obscene activities unimaginable within the confines of the Oval Office.  <br />While one dodged the draft, spent the war in England, and regularly lead  protests against his the country, the other spent years demonstrating  patriotic fortitude by fighting in an even more controversial and divisive  war.  Leading the Union army to victory in the Civil War, Grant stands as  one as one of the most salient figures who prevented the United States from  being permanently splintered.  It's easy to wonder what he would think of  today's widespread push for group rights that pose nearly as serious threat  to the nation's cohesion.  He commanded a willing army of magnanimous  soldiers in a bloody war to bring the races together and now major efforts  are underway to split them apart by rampant multicultural separatism a  century later.<br />Grant constantly displayed a steadfast devotion to his  family just as Clinton repeated betrays his.  The general saw his wife and  children as often as he could during the war, and it was his desire to be  reunited with his children who were then in New Jersey that kept him from  accompanying Abraham Lincoln to the theater on that fateful night.  Once  during the war when his oldest son was fighting a life-threatening illness,  he obtained permission to pay a visit but could not relinquish command of  the military.  Dedicated to both his duties as soldier and father (two  areas where Clinton has proved less than stellar), he went to St. Louis and  maintained control of the army via messengers and the telegraph.<br />If for  no other reason, this book warrants a read because it bears witness to a  once-in-a-lifetime moment in history: Grant's first meeting with Lincoln.  This momentous occasion was shared by the author's eldest son shortly after  his recovery form the nearly fatal ailment.<br />There are two major aspects  of General Grant's life missing.  His victory over alcoholism is not  mentioned nor even alluded to.   In the late 1800's this affliction was  probably not widely viewed as a disease.  Rather it was seen as a weakness  of character.  Grant most likely was ashamed of this deficiency and did not  want to be seen either as immoral or a victim-another far cry of the  current &quot;it's not my fault that I can't keep my pants on&quot;  attitude of the present commander in chief.  The second lacuna is his  presidency.  The book ends shortly after the war and throughout only  passing references are made to his tenure in the highest office in the  land.  Grant knew he was dying when he wrote this work-it was his effort to  provide for his widow (the deviation from Clintontonism here goes without  saying), and the millions in royalties it earned fulfilled this final goal  admirably.  Perhaps cancer prevented the second volume which no doubt would  have done justice his presidency.  Still, this work is enough to explicitly  contrast his differences from Clinton.  The war record proves that Grant  was a somewhat underrated president and a most extraordinary man; now we  are stuck with a grossly overrated president who could not be underrated as  a man.	2000-03-03

While he hits many bulls-eyes and scores several important points, the book misses the mark of being a real  page-turner.  It reads more like an extensive case study (in reality it  summarizes the findings of numerous case studies) and fails to really  engage the lay reader.  Tumescent with charts and graphs, it plods along  rather than flying like a bullet.  I certainly admire the author for being  a straight shooter who relies more on facts than emotionally-charged but  empty slogans.  He is destined to be ambushed by Rosie O'Donnell and her  myopic clones in Hollywood for daring to tell the truth rather than their  version of reality.  I just wish it could have presented with more of a  blast.     Although he sends a barrage and hits many targets in the  gun control movement's poorly defended arguments, the dragging pace of this  book may turn off some readers.   However, those who complete the book will  learn quite a few facts that gun control advocates do want disseminated.	2000-01-21

I wouldn't have believed that a novel devoted to such subject matter could be so interesting, but Harold Bell Wright can  manipulate the English language in a way equaled by very few other authors.   As the desert becomes a thriving community, the reader is right there  actually taking part in all the transmutations. <br />With his usual  multi-dimensional characters and the plot's rococo developments, the story  thoroughly captivates as it moves quickly through its exciting labyrinth.  <br />Those familiar with Wright's earlier books (Shepherd of the Hills, The  Calling of Dan Matthews, and That Printer of Udells) will be in for a  surprise. While they all prominently featured ministers, this book is  clergyman-free and makes only minor references to religion.  Still this  equally wholesome read is subtitled as &quot;the Ministry of  Capitalism,&quot; and its portrayal of ethical business dealings,  employer-employee loyalties, and the costs of progress make this work from  the early twentieth century vitally relevant to the early twenty-first  century.<br />I do agree with the bottom reviewer who pointed out that this  page's book description boasting illustrations, an introduction and a  preface (none of which exist in this version) does not apply.	1999-12-29

Politically Incorrect to the hilt, Sowell has an amazing ability to elevate  common sense to an art form.  Whether taking on the multiculturalists'  drive to Balkanize America, environmental extremists, or self-mutilating  corporations, his arguments are eloquent in their profound simplicity <br />  While liberal bashaws certainly will not embrace his erudite dialectics, no  reasonable person can dismiss his viewpoints.  Even those who disagree with  Sowell's observations will be challenged to rethink their positions if they  approach his essays with an objective and discerning mind.	1999-12-22

Ever since its publication, authors have attempted and failed to duplicate either its success or its place in  the hearts of readers worldwide.<br />Richard Paul Evans also does not reach  the bar set by the story of Ebeneezer Scrooge and his other worldly  visitors.  However, he does present a warm and enjoyable read.  Although  the story includes a few unnecessary elements that I found somewhat  distracting (what is the point to the dreams and the middle of the night  music?), A Christmas Box is a felicitous short novel.  Despite the sad  portions, it leaves readers with a very satisfying feeling at its  conclusion.<br />I have yet to read any of its sequels; perhaps the  extra-essential bits and pieces will find a fitting exegesis there.	1999-12-22

I must stress that this self-written work differs greatly from  Hollywood's distorted treatment presented in separate made-for-TV and big  screen fictionalized movies. <br />Frances tells her true story and while most  of her life was a stream of horrors, she eventually found redemption and  reached a level of peace and joy that few will ever know in this life.  <br />Readers be warned-the actress is frank in her description of the  brutality, depravity, and heartbreak she survived; much of this work is   egregiously unsettling and reads like a guided tour of hell. Those brave  enough to get through will be well rewarded, and left with an very  uplifting high.<br />In later years Frances found faith and friendship.  Her  conversion to Catholicism would shock many in modern day Tinsel Town but  gave her the fulfillment that eluded her for most of her life.  Her first  friendship-which she defines as the purest form of love-formed in  middle-age gives further testimony to her late discovery of the wonders of  God.  This late embrace of religion is both ironic and extra-encouraging  considering her teenage celebration of atheism.  Before her movie career,  the actress achieved some fame by entering a Communist organization's essay  contest and winning a trip to the Soviet Union with an entry entitled  &quot;God Dies.&quot;<br />In her denouement which included a losing fight to  cancer, she realized how lucky she was that &quot;God Lives.&quot;	1999-12-22

I finished it in less than 24 hours. <br />Mike Huckabee was governor of Arkansas when the tragic schoolyard shooting took place in Joneboro.  In  the heat of such an unforeseeable horror, many voices offered soundbite  explanations as to what could possibly have cause such   nightmare-stretching pogrom.  Unfortunately, as the governor wisely points  out, many of these diversely-intended know-it-alls look at one aspect of  the problem but fail to dig deeply enough to reach it true roots.  <br />The  books detailed hypotheses will not sit well with those who wish to utilize  such a tragedy to call for strict gun control regulations.  The authors  (Dr. George Grant collaborated with the governor) wisely explore the  current splenetic forces at work throughout American culture from the  breakdown of the family to Hollywood's repeated celebration of gratuitous  violence.  In one especially harrowing chapter the reader enters a perverse  video game and sees just how much hate and violence is being peddled at  American children.<br />If the book has one drawback is that it may be that it  will be confined to preaching to the choir.  Tumescent with quotes and  references to support every idea propounded, the authors rely almost  exclusively on conservative voices from William Bennett to Alan Keyes to  Michael Medved.  Few open-minded people could serious question the  knowledge of these sources, but their pandemic citings and the  under-representation of liberal mover and shakers  (and there a few who  advocate such common sense values) may turn off those who ideology blinds  them to the sapience of conservatives.<br />It's definitely worth a read and  will serve as a useful tool to parents who must contend with a culture that  is assiduously fighting them at every turn.	1999-12-14

In a nutshell,  Clinton gave away the store.  EVERY U.S. military secret was handed over to  China.  Of course, this nation of unparalleled human rights atrocities did  engage in several illegal forms of spying, but had Clinton and his  myrmidons not chosen to ignore the blatantly obvious, Bejing would have  been far less successful.  In stead Clinton's biggest concern was making  sure that China's crime did not threaten Most Favorite Nation status for  the world's most dangerous rogue.  While the other foreign policy lapses  covered pale compared to China's pandemic infiltration of our military  know-how, Gertz highlights several other deleterious activities.  From the  Pentagon's covering up a Russian spy ship lazing an American pilot to North  Korea's massive starvation of its citizens, the book shows many Clinton  foreign policy failures, and all the spin in the White House can't change  the facts.<br />This book has filled me with a newly rekindled respect for the  wisdom and foresight of our Founding Fathers.  Washington, Adams,  Jefferson, and the rest of those brilliant patriots created an impervious  form of government when they gave birth to the United States of America.    Any government that can survive the unbridled corruption of Bill Clinton  and his janissaries simply cannot be overthrown. The only issue that  worries me is that as of this writing 13 more Clinton-stained months  remain.<br />Still, if America survives, historians will forever look back and  wonder how the nation perdured throughout such rampant rejection of the  rules and principles that guided us for 200+ years, (and they'll also  ponder why we allowed it.)  The answer  will ultimately lead back to the  heroic sacrifices of those who gave us the Declaration of Independence and  the Constitution--two documents betrayed repeatedly by Clinton's twisted  view of world affairs.	1999-12-10

Teacher, Political Activist, and Internationally-Renowned Concert Pianist Balint Vazsonyi brings a truly synoptic perspective to his erudite  chrestomathy.  Having lived in Hungary under the control of both the nazis  and the communists, he knows something of real world oppression which is  radically different from the current widespread shibboleth  of oppression  that permeates so much of our present political discourse.<br />Amazingly (and  terrifyingly) he sees many of the same deleterious trends in modern day  America that wreaked havoc on Hungary and much of the world under both of  these failed forms of government.  <br />When he became a citizen in the early  sixties, he was called an American; Hungarian-American would have seemed  like a derogatory term as though his Americanism was somehow not quite  legitimate.  Nowadays hyphenated-Americans are commonplace and the  artificial divisiveness employed by Hitler and Stalin is finding a foothold  in the United States.  Just as the multicultural mumbo-jumbo that's  infiltrating American universities, corporations, and government programs  is often masked in halcyon terms, the communists and nazis often called for  behavior that was good for the &quot;party&quot; or &quot;cause.&quot;   Vazsonyi sagaciously points out that this whole concept of group rights is  a Constitutional affront perpetuated at the cost of individual rights.  <br />Among his most frightening observations concerns the phrase  &quot;politically correct.&quot;  Many will shocked to learn that the term  was originated by one of Stalin's sycophants decades ago, and the nazis  were fond of the saying &quot;socially correct.&quot;  He perspicuously  demonstrates how the entire group rights fad bears an eerie overlap to both  nazism's and communism's enforced class struggles which lead to their  divide and conquer reigns of terror.<br />This eye-opening book is a very good  companion to Rabbi Daniel Lapin's similarly titled &quot;America Real  War,&quot; and they both wisely articulate how high the ultimate stakes are  in the battle that currently rages in our land.	1999-12-09

Unfortunately for them, Daniel Lapin's title of &quot;Rabbi&quot; appears on the cover and his  Orthodox Judaism is proudly evident throughout this insightful work.<br />  The essence of the book is a common sense view of American history;  Christianity was an essential component in the founding of the United  States and an inarguable benefit up until the 1960's. This view would not  be polemical were it not for the power that has been seized by radical  revolutionaries in much of academia, the media, and the arts over the past  30+ years.  The rabbi readily admits that this is not what much of  intelligentsia wants to hear but courageously spells it all out,  nonetheless.<br /> Among his biggest pet peeves is the misplaced charge of  anti-Semitism hurled at anyone who disagrees with the cockamamie spewing of  any liberal with a Jewish sounding last name.  He rightly questions the  &quot;Jewishness&quot; of a person who hasn't set foot in a synagogue for  years and wouldn't know the difference between the Talmud and the Veda.   While rightly condemning the horror of true anti-Semitism, (after all he is  an Orthodox Rabbi) Lapin points out that much of what currently earns that  disgraceful categorization is in fact anti-liberalism. He cites a rabbi in  Nebraska who compared a congressman's pro-life stand to the evil views of  Hitler as though there was a direct correlation.  <br /> Perhaps his most  controversial statements concern Judaism's teaching on homosexuality.   While he argues that gay spokespeople often have Jewish names, and some of  have gone far enough to slander the noble religion by lying that Jewish law  does not condemn homosexuality, Rabbi Lapin lists several Old Testament and  Talmud dictates clearly forbidding the practice.  Furthermore he attacks  the current putative myth that the Nazis regularly executed homosexuals. In  facthe boldly points out, as well documented in the classic, &quot;The  Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,&quot; many adherents of nazism-especially  its founders--were in deed gay themselves.  He relates one terribly moving,  if daringly politically incorrect, tale of a recent roisterous appearance  by a gay group at a holocaust memorial in Israel.  One grandchild of victim  shouted at the interlopers that his grandfather was murdered for refusing  to have sex with a nazi.  Factual yes, but not something that the  diversity-gestapoes want us to hear.<br /> Like many immigrants, his  patriotism is willing displayed.  To Lapin's thinking no country-other than  Israel as ever been as good to the Jewish people as America, and he  correctly attributes this to the Christian nature of the United States.   <br /> While the religious left (those who worship secularism) would  rather pretend that Jews like Rabbi Lapin do not exist, he speaks for true  Judaism.  There is a strong message here.  Those who distort Judaism to  serve their own purposes are the counterparts of so-called 'gay  churches&quot; or others who flummox the teachings of Christianity, and  neither group of vexatious iconoclasts should be allowed to speak for true  believers. <br />Like Laura Schlessinger and Michael Medved (his long time  friend and neighbor), the Rabbi is a popular talk show host and the three  of them-along with a plethora of  true practitioners of Judaism-are proving  that valid Orthodox views are truly in sync with American idealism.	1999-11-03

A 33 page manual  describing the qualifications and uses of a hammer.  Contract bidding  procedures that unintentionally but blatantly encourage corruption.<br />These  snippets sound like lines from a Letterman or Leno monologue, but  discouragingly they are all actual government dictates documented in this  chilling expose. Phillip Howard does an admirable job of identifying the  consequences when good-hearted bureaucrats create well-intentioned  regulations, and government services get caught in a  stranglehold.<br />Perhaps even more bilious than these splenetic monuments to  red tape, are the huge work forces of administrators who are imprisoned by  this uncontrollable system.  Howard employs some macabre humor in redacting  the plight of one troublesome government employee who purchased a lawn  mower with his own money rather than navigate the labyrinth of paperwork  necessary to order a replacement.  For this breech of procedure, he earned  a formal demerit.  <br /> Although the subject matter is serious and in  deed frequently depressing, Howard often utilizes jocular techniques to  make his point.  His step by step specifications of NYC's contract bidding  ritual would be the envy of any stand-up comic.  Unfortunately, the  laughing stops upon the realization that this vapid inefficiency is  pandemic throughout all levels of our government. It's scary to see just  how big Big Brother has become.	1999-10-26

I found other recent  works like &quot;the Diversity Hoax&quot; and &quot;the Death of Common  Sense&quot; to be better caveats of these same pernicious trends.  <br />One  other complaint is the authors'repeated use of the term  &quot;humankind;&quot; a book that rightly warns of the dangers of  political correctness should not stoop to employing even such innocuous PC  terms.<br />It is definitely worth a read but should been sign more as the tip  than the hidden ice burg.	1999-10-25

Washington had every reason to complain and be resentful.  He was born a slave, and although national manumission occurred while he was still a boy, very few opportunities offered themselves to the newly  emancipated.  He fought against the odds to get an education and while he  was away at school, his beloved mother died.  His biological father was a  slave owner who never expressed any interest in his son's life.  When he  was asked to be headmaster of the Tuskegee Institute, he found himself  faced with empty land in a poverty-stricken area.  Married three times, his  first two wives died very young.  His first spouse left him a single father  with a young child, and the second time he faced widowhood he had three  small children to raise all by himself.<br />He could certainly have cursed  fate and just given up; in stead his autobiography is the work of an  unspeakably grateful and patriotic American.  Washington could not find  enough good things to say about nearly everyone he encountered in life or  the country he felt blessed to call his home.  He worked very, very hard  and success followed all his endeavors.  Rather than boast of his many  accomplishments, he seemed to feel unworthy of the nationwide respect he  earned.  He humbly described his friendships with Presidents Grover  Cleveland and William McKinley, talked of his constantly sought after  speeches throughout the United States and Europe, and detailed his  phenomenal money-raising skills that brought the Tuskegee Institute up from  a converted hen-house to a campus of over 40 buildings.<br />Throughout all  his trials and successes, he constantly advocated forgiveness, humility,  and gratitude.  Not only did he recommend these three virtues, he lived a  life that embodied them. Perhaps that's why a person born with no realistic  chance at getting ahead, died one of the most admired and well-known  individuals of his day.	1999-10-19

Her lifetime of good work and unwavering devotion to God through bold acts of faith had inspired the  world for decades.  There was very little sadness when she went home to a  richly deserved reward.<br />In A Priest Forever, we meet another individual  who was thoroughly prepared to meet God.  Unfortunately, there is great  sadness in the life of Father Eugene Hamilton because his time on earth was  so short and the promise of all the good work he could have done will never  be fulfilled.<br />From an early age, Gene Hamilton showed a maturity, grace,  and reverent nature beyond his years.  The tale offers no surprise by his  decision to enter a seminary.  Heartache awaits the reader as Gene is  diagnosed with terminal cancer, and we witness his heroic battle to live  and follow his dream of being ordained.  When the facts obviously point to  his not lasting long enough to complete priestly training, the Vatican  responds to his seminary's and Cardinal O'Connor's request granting a rare  dispensation allowing early ordination.<br />Just days before this speeded up  sacrament is to be bestowed upon him, Gene takes a major turn for the  worse.  Due to the quick thinking and actions of his brother and the bishop  at his seminary, an impromptu ceremony was held on Gene's deathbed in his  living room just three hours before his earthly existence ended.  Catholics  belief in the permanence of ordination so the title is apt. knowing that  Father Eugene Hamilton-who never even donned priestly vestments in this  life-is indeed a priest forever.<br />As sad as the story is-knowing that he  could not live out the dreams of his priesthood, seeing the family and  loved ones left behind after the loss of this extraordinary 25 year old,  and learning the pain that perdured throughout his final months-there is  nonetheless a powerfully upliftng result from reading this book.<br />His life  will never be as well known as Mother Teresa, and he did not have the  opportunity to touch nearly as many people, but in his brief  quarter-century he set a brave example and was completely ready to meet  God.	1999-10-01

His commercials seemed mean-spirited, and his  campaign came across as a one-issue rant; the flat tax would solve all of  society's woes. What a difference four years can make!<br /> Steve Forbes  is again seeking the Republican nomination, but this time he has a  well-rounded, coherent message which is fully presented in his new book.   Rich in specifics, and refreshingly vacuous on spin, A New Birth of Freedom  spells out Forbes' comprehensive plan to get America back on track.   Heroically restrained in knocking Bill Clinton (the word &quot;Monica&quot;  never appears) and other obvious targets, Forbes is more general in his  criticism of career politicians whom he sees as out of touch with America.   <br /> His message is far more than a flat tax nepenthe-although  abolishing the IRS and replacing it with a flat tax is still a cornerstone  of his would-be presidency.  Still he presents several other features and  many of them are nothing short of courageous in their specifics.  He has  concrete ideas on how to improve not save &quot;social security.&quot;   Rather than the ambulance-chasing attorneys' dream &quot;Patient's Bill of  Rights&quot; currently being forced through Congress, Forbes offers a   &quot;Patients' Declaration of Independence&quot; that will remove  government's intrusive and clumsy hands and allow individuals to make their  own decisions and empower dedicated doctors and nurses by eliminating  bureaucratic red tape.  While other candidates tremble at the mention of  the word &quot;abortion,&quot; Forbes takes a bold pro-life stance, and  perhaps unlike any other candidate since the Roe vs. Wade debacle, he has a  systematic, pragmatic plan to lead America into its proud, post-legal  abortion era.   For those of us who are sick of seeing rich politicians  send their children to exclusive private schools, while squashing poorer  parents' abilities to do the same, Forbes has a common sense goal of seeing  voucher programs thrive.  Gone will be the days of placating pushy teacher  unions while ignoring the concerns of poorer families.  Although I would  like to see him take an even  stronger stand against China, he would  replace the current U.S. policy of blind appeasement with a healthy concern  for American interests and a vociferous call for human rights in the nation  where pandemic atrocities  against mankind are common knowledge.  This is  merely one facet of his call to replace Clinton's haphazard  make-it-up-as-you go foreign policy by making America a respected  international presence again<br /> Despite being born into wealth, Forbes  shows a true understanding for people of more modest means and displays a  genuine concern for minorities which could easily explain why so many  prominent black conservatives including Alveda King and Herman Cain are  backing him.<br /> After 8 years of Clinton, anyone short of Jack  Kervorkian will seem like a good president, and some of the other  candidates-notably George W. Bush probably would be very impressive as  Commander-in Chief.  However, before making up one's mind to cast a vote  for our next president, I strongly urge everyone to read this book and  compare Forbes thorough proposals to the other noble contenders' visions.   Four years ago, I could not see myself ever backing Steve Forbes, but A New  Birth of Freedom combined with his improved broad-based message has changed  my mind.  I heartily recommend this book written by our next president.	1999-09-02

Atheism may be what brought her celebrity status, but it was just one of  her many perfidious pursuits.   Written by her estranged son-disowned by  his embrace of religion-Madalyn is shown to be at various times a  drug-dealer, pornography patron, Communist rebel-rouser, and those are her  good points!<br />  As a young mother with two illegitimate sons, her  hatred of America surpassed only by her jingoistic devotion to Communism,  she sedulously tried to become a citizen of the Soviet Union.  Her repeated  in-person requests at the Soviet embassy in Washington grew so vexatious,  the Russian staff eventually began pretending nobody there could speak  English whenever they saw her.   An unrestrained quixotic outrage at the  discovery of Bible readings in her son's public school lead to her success  in the Supreme Court's infamous decision outlawing any hint of religion in  public education.  The book details how, far more than her  supposedly-principled cause, achieving fame was her true victory.  Stroking  her cyclopean ego is shown to be the motivation for nearly every move she  made.   <br /> It is very interesting to note how her path crossed  with those of so many other notorious figures in late twentieth century  America.  From her role as a colleague of Lee Harvey Oswald in a Communist  organization, to her cozy cajoling of Fidel Castro's closest advisors to  her friendship with Larry Flynt, Madalyn's circle of influence reads like a  Who's Who of  Masterful Miscreants.<br /> The author's own story is one of  overcoming nearly insurmountable obstacles.   Bill married his pregnant,  live-in girlfriend (Madalyn had invited her to move into their house) at  17, began active adultery and drug use shortly thereafter, and seemed  headed to an early grave.  With his second marriage floundering, and his  life in a constant downward spiral, he turned to his mother's sworn  enemy-religion, and finally found the salvation and peace that eluded  Madalyn throughout her turbulent life.<br /> The recent acknowledgement of  her murder should bring newfound interest to this work, and it is a very  good analysis not only of the workings of a twisted mind but also a strong  demonstration of how so much went wrong with society over the past thirty  years.	1999-08-31
US	52806429	R336YR42Q2NOV4	0664221149	43464947	Hustled: My Journey From Fear to Faith	Books	5	49	80	N	N	It's really &quot;Larry Flynt vs. The People&quot;	With Larry Flynt as your father, you're starting life with several strokes against you, but Tonya Flynt-Vega is a survivor and Hustled describes the ordeals against which she had to survive.<br />Despite the recent movie that  glamorized Larry Flynt as an eccentric defender of the first amendment,  anyone grounded in reality can easily see through that  façade and identify  him as a woman-hating, solipsistic pervert.  His daughter adds even more  fuel to a healthily burning fire.  She describes his boastful bestiality,  womanizing, drug-use, flag-desecration (fortunately that was back when it  was still a crime), and his unnatural twisting of the First Amendment to  make it serve his own ends rather than what it clearly states.<br />Perhaps  most controversial-but not at all surprising-is the description of his  incestuous abuse of her as a little girl.  Larry Flynn has preposterously  denied this charge.  Obviously, he would go to jail if he admitted it, but  a man who has made a career out of celebrating rape is a bit hard to  believe when he claims innocence of that very same crime.  His physical  degradation of her is typical of the behavior he espouses and exemplifies.   She details many of his affairs and the overall objectification of women on  which his empire is founded.<br />Still, this book remains far more than a  &quot;Daddy Dearest&quot;-type hatchet job.  It  is a caveat on the  pernicious nature of pornography.  Far from the &quot;victimless  crime&quot; myth and Larry Flynt and his myrmidons perpetuate, Tonya  details the destructive nature of this cultural pollution.  She introduces  us to a few girls who naively believed it was a stepping stone to a movie  career only to become trapped in its ruinous vortex.  Perhaps the saddest  example of all, however, is her own father's pathetic life.  Tanya recounts  the situation of twenty-some years ago when Larry Flynt flirted with  Christianity after a meeting with Jimmy Carter's Evangelical sister.  Thebook portrays him as a lost soul who was at that time searching, and Tanya  believes he was legitimately tempted to abandon his life of perdition.   Tragically, its pull was too great, and he became even more blasphemously  hostile.<br />While Hollywood's fictional snow job slandered several brave  souls who dared to stand up to him, this book shows the heroic actions of  Jerry Falwell in bring suit against Flynt.  Ruth Carter Stapleton who is  expectedly dismissed by Hollywood's agnostic crowd is shown to be an  intelligent woman of unbelievable compassion and kindness.<br />Overall the  book is a very good insight into the psyche of one of President Clinton's  strongest supporters.	1999-08-30

She advocates such outdated notions as integrity, honesty, self-sacrifice and even the  archaic concept of abstinence before marriage.  However, she also offers  strong evidence as to why these principles are not only morally sound but  necessary to find true happiness and meaning in life.  <br />Each chapter is  devoted to a commandment, and although Dr. Schlessinger is an Orthodox Jew  and her co-writer Stewart Vogel is a rabbi, she cites many Christian and a  few Muslim sources throughout the work.  Especially brave are stands  against abortion, divorce, and self-serving lies because espousing such  standards is not currently in vogue, but equally enlightening-and perhaps  even more challenging to those who do try to live by so-called traditional  values are her calls for personal sacrifice as a needed part of life. <br />To  illustrate her message of the benefits of altruism she includes many  letters from her listeners.  These feature moving testimonies of people who  cared for elderly and infirm parents or grandparent rather than dump them  in a nursing home.  One powerful case for honesty is laid out by the   father of a high school valedictorian barred from graduation ceremony for  admitting that she was drinking on a school outing while several other  guilty students lied and were permitted to take part in the ceremony.  He  said how year's later she still regretted that one breach of rules but  never regretted her bold veracity.  <br />Also refreshing is Dr.  Schesslinger's vocalization of the outrage so many of us feel but must  stifle.   She talks of her bemusement of a woman who can't understand the  promiscuity of her live-in boyfriend's twenty year-old daughter.  Perhaps  this would-not-be step-mother is overlooking the obvious.<br />All and all it  is uplifting and challenging effort that will give any open-minded person  much to ponder.	1999-08-26

Written be law students at  Berkley, the writers lament how what was once the embodiment of true  liberalism has become an intellectual concentration camp of politically  correct dogma that unjustifiably condemns any and all who dare to  differ.<br /> Especially chilling is the way that a devotion to so called  &quot;diversity&quot;-arguable a noble goal, obliterates the benefits of  diverse ideas.  Berkley unfortunately has become an assembly line that mass  produces different color clones.  They may be different races, but the  thought process is constrainingly monolithic.  <br /> Despite the dreary  collegiate portrait painted by this representation of  students, the book  is more hopeful than dejecting.  These brave young voices are thriving  against the tsunami of group-think as they dare to speak out against this  new breed of racism that calls itself &quot;diversity.&quot;  They  courageously embrace the principles of Martin Luther King and make a strong  case for treating people as individuals.  With future lawyers like these,  America's trouble-plagued judicial system may have better days ahead.	1999-08-18

A severe prenatal development led to his very early delivery,  and although his time on earth lasted a mere two hours, his existence added  something to the world.  In that short lifetime, he experienced decades of  love from devoted parents-grateful for the miracle that he was born alive  and that they had two hours to love him.<br /> Anyone who is a parent,  godparent, uncle, aunt, or loves a child will be greatly moved by this  simultaneously despairing and joyous story.   Your heart will break for  Karen Santorum and her family, but you'll also feel a strong admiration for  her.  The Santorums will never fully recover from Gabrial's death but they  are obviously better parents-in fact better people-for having known  him.<br />Letters to Gabriel is the legacy of a baby whose abbreviated life  impacted more people than many of us will touch in fifty years.   Like most  roller-coaster rides, it is rather short-less than 175 pages, but your  emotions careen through the pages for a very memorable journey.<br /> In  addition to Karen's moving letters, the book benefits from Dr. Laura  Schlessinger's sapient introduction and a very poignant introduction by  Mother Teresa written three months before her death.	1999-06-22

We've all heard the horrid tales of a &quot;witch hunt&quot; by fascist red-baiters  and how the movie industry's upstanding innocent individuals were attacked  and lives and careers were ruined by overzealous McCarthyites.  However,  those stories have been told almost exclusively by Hollywood and its  myrmidons who have had plenty to hide.  Hollywood Party offers a thoroughly  documented study of the real existence of Communism and its stronghold on  LaLa Land. <br /> The apocryphal blacklist stories never mention Hollywood  luminaries blind support for Joseph Stalin who once admitted that if he  could take over the movie industry, he would rule the world.  This work  exposes how the so-called blacklistees looked the other way while Stalin's  enforced famine claimed nearly as many victim's as Hitler's reign of  terror.  Even when these two evil dictators conspired, few show biz  Communists offered a murmur against their Soviet icon. <br /> To show how  successful this revisionist approach has been, the author rightfully  questions just whose careers were ruined.  Among blacklist victims, we see  later Oscar winners like Ring Larner (MASH), successful character actors  Will Geer and Lionel Stander, and others like Lillian Hellman who seemed to  survive quite nicely despite their proven ties to communism.   Tragically,  this period did have a number of innocent victims.  Those who vociferously  opposed the red regime often found themselves unwelcome in many Hollywood  circles.  Ellia Kazan whose recent life time achievement Oscar brought out  the rancor of filmdom's goose-stepping crowd faced considerable hostility  for his heroic actions.  Adolphe Menjou endurded specious rumors that he  was anti-semantic spread by those who barely raised an eyebrow over  Stalin's partnership with Hitler.  Robert Taylor, Robert Montgomery, and   several others who frowned on a violent regime all faced various  reprecussions from the silver screen's intolerant communities.<br />  Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley shows great bravery by writing an apodictic,  polemical story that is certain to earn the wrath of a very spiteful and  unforgiving industry.   It's good to see the truth lain out so boldly even  if Hollywood will never face it.	1999-04-23

While still very tame compared to many books, much of the violence found here is far more graphic than  other Judd efforts such as  Bad Night at Dry Creek, Corrigan, and Mr. Littlejohn..   <br /> The story  line is as engrossing as usual, and the charcters typically come to vivid  life.  However, a disturbingly high number of likable folks meet tragic  endings-another disappointment to this story.<br /> From an unfamiliar  author, I might have given this book higher praise, but from Cameron Judd I  have come to expect a more enjoyable read, which he has always delivered in  the past.	1999-03-12

As a war correspondent, he lived in Nazi Germany, covering the darkest chapter in human history thoroughly and objectively as possible.  This 50-year old  classic is a story that tragically is not told very factually anymore.<br />  This book should be read to counterbalance all the misinformation that now  envelops the Third Reich. While the politically correct spin often claims  that Christianity is responsible for massacre of the Jews-the National  Holocaust Museum in Washington DC is founded on such fatuity--this book  details Hitler's hatred and oppression of Catholics and Protestants.  He  imprisoned thousands of priests, nuns, and ministers in Germany and warned  that he would exterminate all clerics in Poland who failed to preach his  message.  Shortly after seizing power he ordered all churches to replace  the crucifix with a swastika and to substitute Mein Kampf for the Bible-not  exactly what the radical liberal left likes to teach about this evil  dictator, who in reality despised Christianity as much as he abhorred  Judaism.  Pope Pius who today is regularly singled out as being insensitive  to nazi atrocities is evidenced to have been one of the few vociferous  voices who repeatedly denounced nazism from its earliest days.<br />  Another current myth debunked is the nazis' systematic annihilation of  homosexuals.  The book documents that many of the founders of nazism were  in fact homosexuals themselves.  When innocent homosexuals were brutally  murdered it was during Hitler's purges of party members who had aroused his  suspicions.  Often these targeted gay advisers were caught in the company  of innocent young men who were killed along with their nazi lovers. Even  Hitler's questionable sexual preference is alluded to in this voluminous  narrative.<br /> The most shocking aspect of the book is its portrayal of  Hitler's incredible ability to manipulate.  He did not gain his power by  force or treachery-rather he was one of the most skillful politicians in  history.  When he gave a speech, he could feel the German people's pain.  He promised a brighter future for the all the citizens, and skillfully  avoided discussing his fanatical plans in his campaign stemwinders.  As a  politician he accomplished a great deal.  He gave Germany a booming  economy, low unemployment rates, and his approval ratings were high right  up until the end.  Obviously, he failed in providing moral leadership, but  The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich does a remarkable job of detailing how  the one of the most evil people in history was able to assume and maintain  so much power for so long.  It should serve as a warning for all  generations to come.<br /> At 1500+ pages, it is an endeavor, but it's a  story that must be told and more importantly it must be ACCURATELY told.  Far too many innocent lives were wiped out by the depravity of nazism to  let the story be doctored to suit the purposes of  special interest groups.  The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is that rare work that truly dissects  a historical period in a very readable fashion.by  force or treachery-rather he was one of the most skillful politicians in  history.
