(Teen's Top 10 (Awards))	Books	5	5	6	N	N	"Throw 'im in the hold with the captain's daughter"	This is a novel for girls who like Pirates of the Caribbean; Nancy and Minerva are at least as exciting as heroes and pirates as the characters played by Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. (And much more interesting than the girl in that movie!) Nancy is a wealthy planter's daughter whose brothers attempt to marry her off to a violent and scary man to pay off their gambling debts.  Minerva is her slave - and her friend.  They \\"go on account\\" with an able and fair captain who rarely kills people.  It's very good in the pirate history and a fun read.<br />Someone said a girl of Nancy's social class wouldn't have done turned pirate. But Rees spent 150 pages exploring how little Nancy cared for upper class values and people. It wasn't easy for either girl to become pirate, their situation was truly dire.  The class and racial politcs ring as true as the piracy -- the most democratic place in the early 18 century is a pirate ship! Like Witch Child and Sorceress, I hope there will be another book about Nancy and Minerva.	2004-03-30

But the practices and laws of their country don't agree just before the beginning of Wold War II in remote Prince Rupert Sound on the British Columbia coast.  Meanwhile they're working at an army base and nursing a wounded bald eagle back to health.

Where Finney toured the country leading revivals in tents, where Miller prophesied the world would end in 1843, Noyes led a utopian community in Onieda and the Fox sisters heard ghosts \\"rapping\\" and began the spiritualist movement.  The last four are all plot elements in this novel set in that place and time, rather reminiscent of Coville and Yolen's contemporary Armageddon Summer.  The three Charter sisters Vern, Amy and Kate come to the attention of the Rev. Elias Fitcher, and one after the other they marry him.  Kate succeeds in rescuing herself, her sisters and most of the people living in Harbinger - when the world ends but only for Fitcher.	2004-03-30

(And I really, really didn't want to be in Drujan. It's a terrible horrible no good place.) Then they follow the Nile River to Lake Victoria. It's quite a hero's journey Phedre, Joscelin and then Imriel make. And as with hero's journeys, though a lot of land is covered, most of the changes are internal. I'm sorry to have finished this book. I read this long book quickly, without getting much sleep, I had to know what was coming next. I want to read more about these characters.

I hope you will.  Most here are very positive, mine is not. I haven't been a teenage drama queen in many, many years but I am a Mrs. Baggoli (her drama teacher.) Lola is a grating, unsympathetic heroine: she's at least as self-absorbed as her rival Carla Santini. She's also too smart by half for a 16 year old.

I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, I bought this becaue I had read it had an interesting view of sex and gender.  It does, in spades, but more I liked it for its religion and caste system, it's politics. It's rare in speculative fiction, especially in fantasy for religion to play such an important part. But Phedre is a Servant of Naamah and Joscelin is a Cassaline Brother, both are serving gods with their oaths as best they can. It is a fascinating world Carey has written and I recommend it wholeheartedly.<br />Love as thou wilt.	2004-01-18

Then I read Mission Gamma.  I'm glad I did it that way.  This is a very rich novel on the characterization side and I needed that scorecard.<br />This novel has a great cast of characters with fascinating desires and motives!  Vaughn wants to explore the Gamma quadrant to expiate some of the horrible things he's done in his long career.  His daughter Prynn is the pilot and wants her father to leave her alone.  Andorian science officer Shar wants to be left alone by his mother, but knows he's hurting his bondmates by being in the Gamma quadrant and in Star Fleet.  Kira wants to get through her religious expulsion and to figure out what's up with the diplomats on the station.  Ro wants to be able to be a good Security Chief for the station and have some fun with Quark.  Quark wants to make money, but he's also very interested in Ro.  Trier is Orion Girl hired by Quark as a dabo girl who wants to be more.  Kasidy wants to be left alone on Bajor while she waits for the baby to be born, Jake to stop being missing and Sisko to come home.  Dax is XO of the Defiant and she and Julian have issues with their relationship because of her new job.  I've ordered the next books in the series, I hope they come *soon* and that I can get _Unity_ at the library.<br />If the rest are anything like this one, I am in for a real treat!!!	2003-12-11

Sookie Stackhouse's adventures in northern Louisiana as the telepathic girlfriend of a vampire left me slightly flat in this novel.  I like her because she's so very different from Anita Blake and other vampire books: she's small town southern, a barmaid, ***normal***, except when she's not.<br />But to my taste this novel gives her too many similarities to Anita Blake.  Bill, her vampire boyfriend, betrays her, Bill's sexy vampire boss makes a play for her, as does a handsome and wealthy werewolf.  Her response to all these men is also similar to Anita's.  I like the humor, the sense of place, the surprises of these books.  After six or eight of these books I may just get tired of Sookie if she continues her Anita Blake reflection.	2003-11-28

I had forgotten that in the last New Frontier book Mark McHenry and Morgan Primus die.  Only in this book we find they did not.  He is in stasis, young Moke can see him, and McHenry speaks often to Wotan.  Morgan has become the computer.  The Beings, Gods from old Earth are still offering ambrosia and eternal life in exchange for being worshipped and killing those who cross them.  Ambassador Spock makes an appearance on a Romulan Bird of Paradise, basically so he can humorously compare Calhoun's and Kirk's styles as captains...  Only Mac and Shelby's ships are able to beat them because they don't fear them.  Wotan traps them in black hole and McHenry becomes visible long enough to tell the crew goodbye, it's now his job to watch the black hole so they don't escape.  And Kebron has changed. Oh yeah, Wotan is Moke's biological father. And Gleau is discovered dead in the last sentence.<br />In all, it was too similar to Gaiman's _American Gods_ for my tastes.  Any New Frontier book is welcome, devoured, especially in ppbk, but when it's this similar it loses some savor. (But if you're as into the series as I am, you *have* to read each one!)	2003-11-24

Cynara is Mammy and Scarlett's Dad's daughter.  She's given to another family when she's 13, but winds up working as a maid at Belle Watling's, where she meets Rhett Butler.  She becomes his mistress until Scarlett's death when they marry.<br />It's called a parody, but it's not.  It's a retelling of a fundamentally American story that needed to be retold.  I read retellings of fairy tales as fantasy adult books like McKinley's _Deerskin_ and Yolen's _Briar Rose._  Those folktales don't have lots of fans who complain about the changes Yolen made to Sleeping Beauty. I'm glad I read GWTW many, many years ago. Margaret Mitchell's estate sued over this book, it was silly of them to do, but I'm glad they did.  Otherwise I may not have heard of this book.

This book reminds me of Toni Morrison's _Beloved_ and Octavia Butler's _Wild Seed._  (This is very high praise, in case you didn't know.) None of these are hard sf -- if that's what you want read Arthur C. Clarke instead. They are mythic fiction, speculative fiction, horror, literature, historical fiction, urban fantasy, who cares what the genre is called? (Hint: no star ships here.) What Butler, Morrison and Barnes have in common is that their characters during slave times must make truly *terrible* choices to preserve their families. In the present Derek Waites, Austin Tucker and Dahlia Washington have to make similar bargains to keep their families intact. I have read Barnes' earlier work which is (for me) too reliant on physical violence.  This book which has the thoughtful Derek and the kinesthetic Tucker is much more enjoyable. In fact, I couldn't put it down.  That the backdrop for the story in the present is the Rodney King riots is visceral.<br />So-- when will Smith and Pinkett make this as a movie?!!!	2003-07-27

Having read several of Barnes' other novels I was excited about this alternative history/ universe novel. It is *not* a satire as some reviewers have called it.  Like the good speculative fiction it is, it takes its setting seriously, to tell a fascinating story. One reviewer suggested it will be taught in high school and college classrooms in 20 years.

I particilarly like de Lint's Newford stories and novels but this very special collection of stories with varied settings is an excellent choice for adolescents, their teachers, libraries and schools.  This wonderful short story anthology is de Lint's short fiction with teen protagonists.  There's two Maisie Flood stories that take place in Newford; she's just off the street herself, but lives with an adult developmentally disabled man Tommy and a great number of castoff dogs (\\"Waifs and Strays\\" and \\"But for the Grace Go I\\").  \\"Stick\\" takes place in Bordertown.  The eponymous martial arts expert defends a halfling from some Bloods, the band Horn Dance to defend him in turn, with music.  \\"There's No Such Thing\\" and \\"Sisters\\" are charming, funny and a little sad teenage vampire stories set around Ottawa.	2002-11-24

But I have some caveats: it's not for young/ less experienced readers like Napoli's fairy tale retellings or McKinley's own _Beauty_.  This is denser with lots of difficult words and concepts.  Perhaps this is a perfect book for a young teen and her/ his parent to share/ read aloud together.  McKinley is world building in this novel, it's quite successful, but not simple.<br />It's similar to McKinley's _Deerskin_ in that Rosie and the heroine of that book are transformed and make magic by their knowledge of animals.  This book's magic comes from simple things: the magic of wood carving, the magic of blacksmithing, the magic of simple charms, the magic of love.

Can he be a hero by pretending to be a hero?  Can he be a hero and be afraid all the time?  Can he be a hero if he doesn't believe he's hero?  Why would he want to be a hero?<br />For a very funny, exciting book, it's also quite thoughtful.<br />All this and I can't *wait* for the next book in the series: _The Woad to Wuin_ which has Apropos finding the sexual aid that is \\"The One Thing to Rule them all.\\"  That looks *funny.*	2002-07-12

She's right! At the beginning of the book Mary's grandmother is being tortured, tried and burned for a witch in England.  By the book's end Mary is chased out of her Puritan community in the New World for being a witch herself.  She runs to the woods, where she has an Indian friend.  She can scry the future, she can see people's animal guides, but it is petty teenage girls who call her a witch.  What is a witch? Surely she has abilities, but she is not evil, not like the witchfinders say she is. There's another book to come with more of Mary's story, including her many times granddaughter in the present.

I hope Burton continues to write, he has some cool ideas in this book.  I heard about this book in _Dark Matter_ an anthology of amazing sf by African-Americans.<br />So, this book is not racist as other reviewers say, though if you are, you may not like the book.  It's not a book written only for Black folks as other reviewers also say.  It's a quest book in a dystopian near-future.  The dystopia Burton presents seems very real to me: there *will be* a major earthquake on the New Madrid fault which would mess up everything from New Orleans to Chicago.  It may happen this year or it may happen in 100 years, but it's going to happen.  I hope we're going to have an African-American president soon.  If he were assassinated, I could imagine cities exploding in racial violence.<br />While the characters are somewhat flat and one is pretty non-existant, it's worth a few bucks or to borrow from the library.  It definately adds to the body of African-Americans writing sf.<br />(And it's dedicated to his wife, children and mother, not Octavia Butler.  Who writes her own near-future dystopias.)	2002-03-19

Well, not just novels I'm addicted to &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel,&quot; too. So, yeah I've read Laurell K. Hamilton, Tanya Huff, P.N. Elrod and others.  What makes this so successful, besides the humor, is the setting. Anita Blake is a city gal. Tanya Huff's vampire books take place in Toronto. Elrod's Jonathan Barrett books take place in Revolutionary War-era Long Island and London. Her series with the vampire PI is set in Chicago.<br />I also read books about telepaths. In a way, I'm surprised Sookie hasn't read Bester (or watched Babylon 5) and learned to erect barriers his way.

I saw the Jean Renoir movie of the same name when I was a teenager. While ~60 years old it is the most magical of the Beauty and the Beast stories around -- on film. The Disney version was surprisingly good -- for Disney-- but it stole a lot of Renoir's concepts as its own. I have a beautiful picture book of the same story by Mercer Mayer, perhaps. I was quite pleased by McKinley's _Beauty._ It's a very nice book along the lines of the Napoli short novels for pre-teens. Those retell and re-shape fairy stories into something not Grimm and not Disney, but human and magical.<br />_Rose Daughter,_ though, is something else. Its denseness and rich language make it inappropriate for all but the best teen readers. Its story, I think, will also be beyond all but the most mature teens: Beauty, Jeweltongue and Lionheart all transform themselves long before the Beast comes into their lives consciously. Like _Deerskin_ they change through hardship and hard work, to become better, richer people, not so much through magic. I also think this is a fabulous novel to recommend to friends who love to garden, especially roses.<br />The end was surprising, but ***excellent.***	2001-08-01

If half stars were available, I'd give this anthology 4 1/2 stars, not 4.  I bought the anthology because I am so looking forward to TNT's _Mists of Avalon_, because short stories in this universe by Bradley, Gabaldon and Roberson herself meant I was sure to enjoy it.  What suprised and pleased me is that theirs are not the stories I most admired.  &quot;Black Dogs&quot; by Lorelei Shannon gives the real reason that Arthur fell at Camlann.  Mordred was only the instrument, according to his favorite dog, the narrator of this story. &quot;Greivous Wounds&quot; by Laura Resnick has Arthur dying regret-filled and going back into his past to see how much he really has changed the world. &quot;The Mooncalfe&quot; by David Farland has Merlin begetting a daughter on a scullery maid at Tintagel while Uther is with Igraine.  Merlin's daughter gets revenge.  These are my favorite stories in this collection, you may have others, it is well worth reading and buying.	2001-07-11

When you think about it someways, this book is more historical fiction than fantasy.  That is, if the reader can accept a past where vengeful witches release plagues, murderers and assassins. I've read Christopher Marlowe so the king who is not very secure in his heterosexuality is not fantastical. The Elinor/ William character: again not very fantastical, it's what she needed to do, so she did it.  I like fantasy, I like historical fiction.  What is difficult about this book, is the language.  Sherman wanted us to know so much about the medieval setting that she uses medieval vocabulary.  For me, who reads voraciously it's not a problem, for my high school students to whom reading is decidedly _not_ a pleasure, it is a barrier to refer to cows as kine and vespers and matins as times of day.  I could wish this very good story were more accessible to more readers.<br />Another thing I could wish for: this book is so long out of print and recently re-printed.  Why was it re-printed as an expensive trade paperback?  This forced me to look for it for years used. (It was well worth the wait...)	2001-05-28

I finished it, but resentfully.<br />I bought it because it was inexpensive and I didn't like Dean's _Tam Lin._  I wanted to give her another shot.  I also was hoping, thinking that it would be like _The Giver._  Superficially, it is, but then it gets into the whole werewolf: should we or shouldn't we question.  To me, it was a silly question, a silly simple society and characters I found I didn't care about.<br />Rather than this I recommend Peter David's _Howling Mad._  It's about a wolf that gets bitten by a werewolf and becomes a man every full moon.	2001-04-18

Unlike the other reviewer I am a regular reader of sf &amp; f, especially feminist and/ or GLBT-themed sf &amp; f.  I love(d) this book!!!  I loved it when I first bought it in the late 70's and it is not at all dated.  (I re-read it last year and was touched and amazed and overjoyed all over again.) The love story, the space opera and the primary conflict between the two men is as real and vital now as it was when it was first written.	2001-02-13

For instance, Ellison's own about Lawrence Talbot's search for his soul, &quot;Adrift Just Off the Islets of Langerhans,&quot; is just plain *wierd.* (And, no, I don't mean that in a nice way.) There are several stories about policemen/ werewolves, kind of an interesting angle, including the great &quot;Partners&quot; by Robert Randisi. Also special is &quot;Pure Silver&quot; by AC Crispin and Kathleen O'Malley about the relationship between a homeless man/ Holocaust survivor/ werewolf and an animal shelter worker and her K9 cop boyfiend. It's regret- filled, sad, lonely and wonderful. &quot;South of Oregon City&quot; by Pat Murphy is historical, taking place in the 19 the century when the far west was a wilderness. A trapper falls in love with a strange woman who turns ut to be a werewolf; it's very sweet. Others of the stories I've read in other collections of werewolf short stories. So, I guess what I'm saying is, the book has some very good stories, but don't spend too much money on it, or have too high expectations.	2001-01-27

I really like de Lint's urban fantasy for its grittiness and despair which exists alongside its hope and beauty. I would call this book science fiction-- it takes place in the future and deals with technology we clearly don't have. It also deals with Native American/ Aboriginal spirituality and Dreamtime. It's a beautiful quest book about creating community in an awful time and place between people who are not terrible and not immediately identifiable as 'community.' I am very glad to see this book is now in print again, it deserves a large audience. I had to wait for years to find a copy, you won't have to.	2001-01-18

(Which I recognize to many will sound like damning with faint praise and to others like blasphemy.) I read the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book this time last year and didn't like it much. It didn't seem to me to be about magic, but about a school and its students. It seemed rather pedestrian to me. I already love fantasy and science fiction, so &quot;Harry Potter&quot; hardly seemed like a revelation. This is book by Shinn about a magician's training and coming of age and how that tranforms him is so much better, more mature and yet simpler than &quot;Harry Potter.&quot; I don't recommend this book to the fourth-grade lovers of HP, but the adults and 15 year olds will love it.<br />Yes, *this* is what good fantasy can be.	2000-12-30

But I'm not a teacher, not yet, only a teaching assistant and in graduate school to get a teaching credential in special ed. A few things have changed in the field since Wolff published this in 1988, but the fundamental truth is there. However, if I were a teacher I would assign this book to struggling readers in a heartbeat. In fact, it'd probably even be more useful for &quot;regular&quot; kids. The cover of my copy reads: &quot;Nick has a problem./ No... problems.&quot; How he deals with his problems should be instructive to everybody.  Much more instructive than To Kill a Mockingbird, in my opinion.	2000-12-10

While not a Saint Germain novel, this has some of the same themes: how to act rationally in an irrational time, honor, alchemy, being an outsider. It's primary characters are a discharged Polish army captain Arkady who was  fighting the Turks in 1524 who buys a beautiful blind  Indian-Tibetan-Chinese -- could you tell I was unclear -- slave Suratta who  is able to fight her enemies in shared visions during tantric sex. They  travel from Hungary to Kyrgyztan and perhaps into China to battle the bad  guy who took her sight, killed her family, and wants to plunge the world  into darkness. It's a good vs. evil quest book, but it's more and better  too.	2000-07-09

LeGuin in Four Ways of Forgiveness has written better about slavery and how it destroys  the owned and owners.<br />Octavia Butler in The Kindred writes better about  the sexual relationship in slavery between owned and owner. In that book  there are outsiders who make it easier for us to empathize.<br />Many of  Samuel R. Delaney's books are about unequal sexual relationships. I prefer  his too.<br />I liked Hallie in this book, but Frenna was too distant, too  strange, ultimately an unsatisfying hero, for me. Troah was too too scary  to also be sympathetic, as I think she was supposed to be, eventually.<br />In  my opinion, it is worth reading, if you don't expect too much from it. And  you've read the others first.	2000-06-19

This first St. Germain novel was not the first I read and that is not problem, as it is with some series. With these books there is no beginning  and ending point and I like that.<br />However, the Count in this story is  more eager to tell about himself in this novel than he is in the others.  The St. Germaine books are not vampire books, so much as they are  historical fiction with a verrrrry long lived character.  I tired of Anne  Rice decades ago, Hamilton's Jean-Claude enjoys life more, but St. Germaine  (and Olivia) I return to for the farmiliar characters in an unfarmiliar  setting.	2000-06-15

The unaminity that we who have read this book give it five stars is no mistake.  If you haven't read this book: read it!<br /><br />One quibble I do have: others are calling it science fiction, it's not, it's fantasy.  That is,  the \\"powers\\" that the main characters Doro and Anyanwu have are not explained scientifically but are magic.<br /><br />(And here, many years later I'm responding to myself: who cares? Just read it!!!)<br /><br />Whether you like science fiction or fantasy or novels with strong African-American protagonists or excellent stories or historical fiction or all of the above: read this book.<br /><br />Here's my response to the book in 2012.<br /><br />I decided for my first book of the year that I started in 2012, I'd like to read something that I know I'd like, so I chose one of my favorite books to reread. \\"She followed him dumbly. He could turn from two murders and speak to her as though nothing had happened. He was clearly annoyed that he had had to kill the young man, but annoyance seemed to be all he felt.\\" (35)<br /><br />Why does Anyanwu go off with Doro? Yes, he understands her as no one ever has, but he's so vile; but while she seems good, she puts up with him, so she is tainted as well. \\"She would learn that right and wrong were what he said they were.\\" (92) \\"Doro looked at people, healthy or ill, and wondered what kind of young they could produce. Anyanwu looked at the sick--especially those with problems she had not seen before--and wondered whether she could defeat their disease.\\" (160) Doro is a destroyer and Anyanwu is a shapeshifter, creator and healer. Yes, they understand each other, because only the other is also immortal, but reading this I also want to reread Mind of My Mind, for when Anyanwu finally decides she -and the world--have had enough of Doro. (But I won't reread Clay's Ark, as much as I love Butler's books. That one, as I remember it, is entirely peopled by people as inhuman and vile as Doro.)	2000-06-05

This is only my second Brust book, and I enjoyed it a lot. I got it for its cover that reminded me of Robinson's Callahan books. There are similarities. Both have  a lot of humor, both are out to save the universe with who finds their way  to the bar, both are both &quot;little&quot; and &quot;big&quot;  stories.<br />But Brust's is a novel and is able to give more time to  character development, not just to the musicians, as one reviewer put it,  but everyone who is part of the story. The intermezzos between chapters  describing how characters got from here to there were fascinating. Brust  also has an interesting plot device. I recommend it, and I'd drink there in  a flash.

I read _Blacked Out_ as part of a graduate program in urban education.  It is the best of all the many books I have read in all of my coursework.  It doesn't offer easy answers, or in fact many answers at all, it just states  the problem.  Until we can agree on the problem &amp; acknowlege it, how  can the solutions be found?<br />Like the other reviewer, I suggest you read  this book.	2000-05-26

I like the premise of Alien Nation, usually better than I like the actuality, but that's common on series sf TV... The Alien Nation books tend to be better than what we saw on TVs.  Besides this one I like, _Body &amp; Soul_ and _Passing Fancy_.  All are  about what is to be Tenctonese and human, that's an interesting concept to  me.<br />The reporter in this one is a not very veiled Harlan Ellison, IMO,  and I found that amusing. I also found a copy of _Black Like Me_ at a used  bookstore after reading this.  Telling _Black Like Me_ in a sf mode is  interesting, well done, worth reading if you don't end up paying too much  for it.	2000-05-08

Or maybe s/he doesn't read  much sf or much else either.<br />That s/he would call Margaret Ball's  &quot;Notes During a Time of Civil War&quot; one of the worst when it  struck me like Atwood's _Handmaid's Tale:_  Both are like a hard blow to  the solar plexus. Perhaps many men and some women don't get that fear.  &quot;Flambeaux&quot; is a beautiful, tragic, lovely story about the ties  that unite and destroy us. It's also the best story about women combatants  in this anthology. I used it in a lesson plan to teach about war fought by  outsiders.<br />This in my opinion is an excellent anthology of war fiction.  Please read it: you'll be glad you did.	2000-03-20

All of the others are better, by far. One of the difficulites in this book, I believe, is that the protagonists are telepaths. These telepaths have little humanity left in them, there are no outsiders to comment on their  arrogance. I don't recommend it, except that the rest of the series is  *amazing.* And it's crazy to love a series and not read it all.	2000-02-25

(Hint: B5 readers, even if you've thought Trek books  had nowhere else to go check out David's New Frontier. It's not your Dad's  (or your) Enterprise.)<br />Back to this book, Londo is a tragic character,  like Macbeth, ruled by events outside his purview. Waiting for a stronger  man to rule. This is a sad, remorse-filled book, with moments of hope and  humor. Read this book.<br />Julia Walter	2000-01-05

Even 30 years dead, no-nothing men are still trying to run Olivia Clemen's unLife and those of her associates. She wrote an iron-clad will, making Niklos her beneficiary. (He's a ghoul, not a vampire, whose been with her  1600 years, not 1300, as one of the pros said...) But some jerk affiliated  with the Church just wants to take it all from her and Niklos _again._  Saint-Germain prevents this, but isn't so successful in all his endeavors.

I found it particularly useful in explaining the context of the title of the first Japenese-American novel, No-No Boy by John Okada.  Takei's parents like the Okada character answered no and no to the loyalty  oath that the U.S. government made its citizens like Okada's character and  Takei's mother swear to. The Takeis, as a family, went to another camp, a  camp for troublemakers. Okada's character, a single man, goes to jail. I  have read other descriptions of camp life, but Takei's particularly useful  and helpful. (In fact, I used it as part of a lesson plan on teaching No-No  Boy to secondary students.) I also found Takei's political life  interesting. So while I appreciate Mr. Sulu, I like Mr. Takei much more.	1999-12-20

I am not a huge fan of ST books, for the most part.  They rarely tell me anything about the series I don't already know. This New Frontier series is a different kettle of fish.  I think they're great &amp; get each one as  soon as it comes out. (I've taken to buying David's other books as well,  about B5, and his own stuff too._Howling Mad_ is on my too-read list.) With  these he tells funny, romantic, exciting, political stories, that differ a  great deal from OS or TNG type ships. Mackenzie Calhoun is a different man  than the Starfleet captains we've seen. His universe, his ship, is more fun  too. But as much as possible these books should be read in order. I eagerly  await #9 and all the other NF books to come. (Don't forget the Captain's  Table book about Calhoun also by David, _Once Burned,_ you NF fans.)	1999-12-17

I have read all the St. Germaine ( and Olivia) novels (well, not the brand new _Communion Blood_)and the collection of short stories too.  This is my favorite for St. Germaine's recollections in the form of long letters to  Madeline about when he first lived in Egypt. It is in this book that we  find out details about what made him become a *good* vampire who values  life.<br />This is contrasted with Madeline's struggle to be accepted as an  Egyptologist.<br />I recommend it very highly. (And unlike some series of  books there is no correct order to read these books in. Just read them as  they come to you, but read them if you are interested in historical fiction  with  a _very_ long view. These books are much more about that than  traditional horror novels.)Julia Walter	1999-12-17

I also watched the A &amp; E 4 part series based on the book. *LOVED IT! * But, then I also love Cornwell's _Sharpe_ series, and he says he wrote that because there were no more _Hornblower_ books. I also love Trek &amp; see alot of similarity in the way Hornblower perceives duty to how Picard does, and how Kirk charges ahead where angels fear to tread as Hornblower does. I have also read Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/ Maturin and Weber's Honor Harrington-- both Hornblower and Sharpe are better soldiers and characters. There is little humanity to those officers, little questioning of duty or rightness of action. I look forward to reading _Lt. Hornblower_ and the next &quot;New Frontier&quot; Trek novels, by Peter David, another Hornblower-like captain. If you are interested in the _Hornblower_ series start with this book.	1999-11-29
