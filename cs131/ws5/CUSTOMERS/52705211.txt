Two young girls (age 11) are imprisoned for killing a baby.  The story takes place after they are recently released, although the story goes back and forth between time.  <BR>   The story centers around a new crime.  Another missing child.  Apparently, there have been toddlers missing for short periods of time prior to the abduction.  Did the girls have anything to do with it?<BR>   If you saw or read Dennis Lehane's Mystic River, you know the tragedy that results when young people are damaged by crime.  In this book, the girls had problems when the first crime was committed.  Now that they have been released, their lack of social skills and complete lack of self esteem lead them into the lair of the detective's noose.<BR>   The story focuses on several characters, including the mother of one of the girls and the detectives.  It also focuses on the family of the first child who was abducted and killed.  <BR>   I read this book in a day and a half.  Ms. Lippman is a terrific writer.  The book had me on the seat of my chair.  I burned a meal reading this book.  Highly recommend!!	2004-01-01

Many more kids are afraid of monsters, especially in the dark.  This instant classic shows kids that monsters are afraid of boys under the bed, and in the dark.  My son wanted to know why a monster would be afraid of him.  He then acknowledge what he already knew, that monsters were not real.<BR>    This is a terrific book for children aged 4-8.  The illustrations are glorious and the dialogue is hilarious.  It is a wonderful bedtime book that your child will want to read again and again.  <BR>    A companion book or movie is of course, Monsters, Inc., a story in which wonderfully creative and hilarious monsters scare young children when they are sleeping.<BR>    This story will not scare your child, which was a concern of mine.  Instead, you and your child can talk and your child will go right to sleep.  Highly recommended.	2003-08-30

While Susie is no longer a part of the real world, she is able to observe her family and her neighbor.  Life truly goes on after one dies, and Susie is able to see how her murder has affected her family.<BR>    Is Susie floating around on a cloud with Angels?  No.  Her heaven is beautiful and I think one reason that this story reasonates with so many, is that we want to believe that there is some kind of after life.  Alice Sebold's words and descriptions are absolutely stunning.  Some of her prose moved me to tears.<BR>   This book is certainly graphic in terms of the murder.  However, the remainder of the story is so beautiful that I did not want the story to end.  It is not a crime book, where the murder occurs, is investigated and the killer is found.  Instead, it is a story about a young girl who is murdered and what happens to her and her family after her death.  I have never ready such a moving and unusual book.  If you enjoy well written books and beautifully crafted language, this is a book for you.	2003-02-15

Usually, it takes a law school class or an attorney like Barry Scheck to pull if off.<BR>   In this book, Arthur Raven and his young associate Pamela, are given the unenviable task of representing Squirrel, who is less than 60 days away from lethal injection.  Arthur is a typical male attorney....short,under 5'5\\" and not particularly good looking.  At age 38, he is divorced from a disastrous marriage.  Arthur has a kind heart, though nobody to share it with.  He does have a sister, Susan, who is schizoprenic, and a mother, who took off years ago.<BR>    In his investigation of Squirrel's case, Arthur comes into contact with Gillian, the judge who sentenced Squirrel.  Gillian has recently been released from prison, though the motive for the crime for which she was convicted (bribery) does not become apparent until well into the book.  Gillian and Arthur are from different ends of the stratosphere.  Of course, opposites attract, and the attraction is one of the storylines.<BR>    Meanwhile, the ambitious tough prosecutor, a woman, of course, has her hands full, as her political aspirations could crumble if Squirrel's case crumbles.  Muriel made her name as the prosecutor for this case, and will do anything, to protect her reputation.  Muriel and the detective of the same case have a personal history and seem to jump in and out of bed with each other, when the time is right.  Will Muriel give up her ambitious husband and several bad marriages to engage in a real relationship with the detective??   <BR>  Turow explores priorities.  Is a career more important than being happy?  Is there such thing as true love?   If we knew the bad things about our mates, would we still love them?  These issues are woven throughout the book.<BR>    Did Squirrel actually shoot three people in Gus's diner late one night?   Why would he have done it?  How do the victims fit together.  <BR>   There are many, many, twists and turns in this book.  About midway through, I thought there were too many twists.  However, I ended up reading the book at 3:00 a.m., and by the time I finished the book, I was a satisfied reader.<BR>   In my opinion, Turow develops characters with more depth than Grisham.  His plot lines are also more intricate and suspenseful.  This book is highly, highly, recommended.	2003-02-15

Who is the sweet Beverly, the woman next door, who confesses to murdering the Count?   I had high expectations of this book.  If Beverly did not do it, why did she confess?  If Beverly did not murder the Count, who did?  <BR>   This book was about one third longer than it should have been.  I read a lot of crime novels, and this one just did not have the pizazz that I expected.  Moreover, there is no mystery.  The characters and author solve the \\"mystery\\" at the end of the book.  It really isn't a mystery, so much as botched forsensics.  I don't want to spoil the story by telling more.  My recommendation is to read the book when it comes out in paperback.  I really wanted to love this book.  That just did not happen.	2002-06-21

Prior to this book, Dennis Smith was a fabulous writer and editor of Firehouse Magazine.  He is a firefighter and was on the scene soon after the WTC Towers collapsed.  He knew many of the men who were killed, and he knows many of the living.  He knew Chief Ganci and Father Mychal Judge.  He also knows the politicians. What Mr. Smith has done is put together a masterpiece of grief.  He has taken the firefighters' own words to tell their stories and he has connected the stories, so for instance, if one firefighter talks about Fireman X being lost in the collapse, he then finds another firefighter who was with that fireman, or who last saw him.<BR>   I wanted to read a book about the WTC without rubbernecking.  Although many books have been published in the months following the attack, this is without a doubt, the definative book.  The grief and suffering of the families is so great, that I was not able to read this book for more than 20 pages at a time, without taking a long break to cry for the firefighters, police, EMS workers and their families.  Mr. Smith points out to the lay person that Duty and Sacrifice come together for these men women, that the firefighters never questioned their duty.  That the surviving firefighters would go into another tower again, after all they say, you cannot leave people in a building who need help, explains their heart and soul.  After reading this book, I do not believe that you will ever view a firefighter, policeman or EMS worker the same.  There are some very graphic scenes in this book about body parts and this book is not for the squemish.  It presents ground zero from the day of the attack until months after and it will probably been one of the books that historians will look to when remembering this tragic and awful attack.	2002-04-28

This is a wonderful book, packed with information, in a very easy to read format.  There are 12 chapters:<BR>Facing Breast Cancer; Breast Cancer Basics; Diagnosis and Staging; Surgery; Reconstruction; Radiation; Chemo; Hormonal Therapy; alternative treatments; Clinical Trials; Life after Cancer; A guide for your partner.  Each chapter explains what the chapter is about, e.g. What is chemo?  How is it given?  How it Works.  Side Effects.  Common Chemo drugs.<BR>  This book is unique in that it has testimonials throughout from women, and their partners.  It also has terrific drawings.  I purchased a LOT of books when I was diagnosed.  This was the book that I went to during my chemo and before surgery, to really find out what was going on.  It is difficult to know what questions to ask your oncologist or surgeon, when everything is new.  This book helps you prepare and should give you the confidence to make treatment decisions about your life.  Highly, highly recommended.	2001-11-06

Her family is still deeply troubled.  Pilot and Eric were Fiona's brothers.  The book begins with the most realistic journey into mental illness that I have ever read, as Pilot descends into psychosis.  Eric, his brother, and a neurosurgeon, seems to want to help Pilot.  However, Pilot has a secret, and that is, that Eric is responsible for the abduction of Fiona, or is he?<BR>  Complicating matters is an unrealistic, yet readable relationship between Pilot's new psychologist and Eric.  This is a whodoneit where the reader believes he knows the answer at the beginning of the book.  Like any good mystery, the plot twists and turns.  This book was a finalist for the Edgar Award for First Fiction and it is much better than a good mystery.  It is however, deeply disturbing.  Highly recommended for the reader who loves mysteries and has a strong stomach.	2001-10-19

How do you reconcile a relationship that is based on a false foundation?  Do you really know your spouse?  Alice Hoffman explores these questions, as well as questions of morality, in a story that takes place in a small storybook New England Town called Monroe.  Though her attempts to tell the tale through the voice of different characters is interesting, it ultimately fails to give us the true psychological insight into the characters that Ms. Hoffman can usually deliver.  This story has no happy endings.  It is however very realistic.  Had this been a first book from an unknown author, I would have rated it five stars.  From Ms. Hoffman, I expect a little better.	2001-09-23

Others just want to get through treatment.  If you are one of the former, this is the book for you.  The 610 volume answers almost every question you may have about breast cancer, and some you did not even think to ask.  When going through an initial breast cancer diagnosis, it is very easy to absorb only a little of what the surgeon or oncologist is saying.  This book will let you slowly absorb the facts about breast cancer.  It is filled with diagrams and charts.  It is a clinical reference but certainly written for lay people.  For me, reading this book and some of the references, helped me to push for a more aggressive treatment plan, than had been recommended by my physicians.  This book is highly, highly recommended!	2001-09-23

You will experience your child's delight when he or she correctly figures out what is beneath the flaps.  This is definately an &quot;interactive&quot; book.

I purchased it immediately and have been delighted ever since.  The detailed illustrations are absolutely terrific and on some pages you could actually spend hours counting the millions of cats.  This book is a true classic as it has been around for generations.  An old man sets out to bring back a cat for himself and his wife.  Instead, millions and millions of cats return home with him.  Their home is soon overrun with felines and some drastic action has to be taken.  All of the cats leave except one small kitten.  And they lived happily ever after.  The Reading Rainbow books are wonderful.  After reading this book, I hope you agree.  Highly recommended.	2000-10-31

You see, the little girl's mother told Lisa that she did not want Corduroy because he had was missing a button.  The following day Lisa returns with her saved piggy bank money, buys the bear and takes him home to his very own bedroom.  This book is incredibly sweet and is appropriate for 2 years old and older.

The cadence in this book and the rhythm mesmorized my son from about 3 months on.  While he certainly did not understand what letters were, the  illustrations are colorful and eyecatching for babies and he was clearly  very interested.  The story concerns the letters of the alphabet as they  climb a coconut tree.  The tree eventually bends at the weight of the  letters.  I have the boardbook version which is well worn.  I have seen the  cd version at my son's school but have never found it on the web.  Now that  my son is 4, his interest in the alphabet is real.  This book is a true  classic and probably belongs on the shelves of all youngsters.  Highly  highly recommended!	2000-09-04

When my son began potty training or toilet learning to be PC, I bought any book on the subject to help.  This book interested him, althhough I am not  sure it made much of a difference.  The Potty video and book held his  interest more and, as he got a little more advanced, the Everyone Poops  book interested him.  However, the price is cheap enough and if you want to  make the transition as easy as possible, anything helps.  I therefore  recommend this book.	2000-09-04

Each page contains a shape and a color and a flap that opens to reveal an animal and  a texture.  For example the circle is filled with fuzzy yellow cotton that  opens to reveal several ducklings.  The textures will fascinate your child,  and each time you open a flap your child will be amazed at the animals  hidden beneath.  This book is not meant to be read by the child as the  flaps will easily rip.  It is however a perfect first book for a baby,  especially when the baby begins to develop eye hand coordination so that  s/he can touch the textured materials.  Your child may even learn the names  of the shapes and the names of colors as an added bonus.  This book is  beautifully ilustrated and bound and will complement any young child's  library.  Highly highly recommended!	2000-09-04

I bought this book when my son was two and  he did not express any interest until about 3.  Young girls may be  interested sooner.  This book explains that everyone poops and that poop is  the byproduct of our food. Written in clear language with simple and  tasteful illustrations, especially considering the subject, this book is  for all parents of children who will soon be potty training.

These books are perfectly sized for you and your baby to read.  Moreover,  your child can even read to him/herself as the board book pages are thick  enough for a young child to turn.

Unfortunately, Ned lives in New York.  So it begins...as Ned travels in an airplane only to  have the plane explode as he falls from the sky in a parachute that has a  hole in it.  Ned is fine.  This book is illustrated beautfully and simply.   The word &quot;Fortunately&quot; tells the tale of how Ned extricates  himself from each unfortunate event.  The word &quot;unfortunately&quot;  begins the unfortunate event.  The fortunate pages are in color and the  unfortunate pages in black and white.  Of course Ned ultimately ends up at  the party.  He is never hurt although he comes close.  After receiving this  book, I read it before sitting down with my 4 year old son.  The  &quot;unfortunate&quot; pages provoked a LOT of discussion about what was  happening to Ned and would he be hurt.  This type of  &quot;cliffhanger&quot; is entirely new to my 4 year old who reads only  books, so far, where nobody is hurt or injured.  Fortunately, Ned is  &quot;saved&quot; by turning the page and all ends well.  I think this book  scares my son and I have put it away for now. This book is probably better  for children older than 3 or 4.	2000-08-27

The book begins with dinosaurfathers, who are human, not dinosaurs, putting their dinosaur children to bed.  Dinosaur mommys (human) put their dinosaur babies to bed in the second half of the book.  Some of the dinosaurs pout, some ask for another story to be read, some keep on playing and refuse to go to bed.  I think any parent or grandparent who has tried to put a child to bed will recognize the scenarios.  My son certainly recognized some of his excuses and commented &quot;I do that sometimes&quot;.

The alliteration and rhyming combined with the hilarious pictures of five completely incompetent sheep trying to drive a jeep, who end up in a mud puddle to then be helped by pigs with tatoos,  only to soon end up in a heap, is great fun.  The premise is so bizarre  that the kids I know who have read it, or been read to, sit on edge and  can't wait to turn the page.  The Sheep books are truly a treasure.  My son  has enjoyed them since he was 2 and one half.  The book is relatively short  and you and your child should be laughing by the end.  Highly recommended.	2000-07-12

We &quot;read&quot; this book to our son when he was a few weeks old, not because he understood the pictures, but because he could track the black and white pictures.  Reading is extremely important to any child and we  wanted to start early.  So, eventhough our 4 week old had no idea what the  words meant, he would nestle as we described the pictures to him and turned  the pages. How else does a child learn to love reading?  When our son was  approximately one year old he could begin to describe some of the pictures  and he would sit on the floor and &quot;read&quot; this book himself.  An  excellent, excellent first book for your baby or for a gift.	2000-07-12

Beautifully illustrated and the winner  of the 1963 Caldecott Medal for illustration, this is a fantasy of a little  boy who is put in his room for misbehaving (a time out in modern day  language).  Max turns his room into a jungle and sails away on a ship, over  seas with fire breathing dragons and monsters, then to arrive on an island  where the wild things live.  If you are of the 20th century, you must have  seen these illustrations as they are part of our culture.  Max becomes the  king of the wild things and sees the wild things through a rumpus, where  they hang from trees and have a wonderful time.  Max decides to leave as he  misses his mother and returns to his room where his mother has left him his  supper, and it is still hot.  No need to psychoanalyze this story.  Your  kids will enjoy it.  The monsters are not scary and the story and  illustrations are terrific.  You and your kids should greatly enjoy this  story.  Highly highly recommended!	2000-07-11

I love this story of the determined spider who is blown on a fence and begins to weave her web, too busy to play with the other animals.  She catches her fly at the end.  The typical farm animals are represented and  young children will be able to identify the animals by the pictures and can  make the noises of the animals portrayed.  The web can be felt with the  fingertips, although my son was never and is still not impressed with this  feat, although his mother is.  Eric Carle is a masterful illustrator and  story teller.  If you have never read his books to young children and seen  the fascination of a 2 year old sitting and waiting for the page to be  turned, you are missing out.  He does not have one bad book.  His  illustrations are stunning.  We have a LOT of books at our house and this  one is chosen at least once a week for a bedtime story.  Highly highly  recommended.	2000-07-11

We have this book in a small and large size together with anEric Carle videotape that has the story.  A young caterpillar is bornand begins to eat his way through the world and through many foods that you child will be able to identify.  These foods are eaten on each of the seven days of the week, an added bonus, as your child begins to learn that Sunday is a different day that Monday.  The caterpillar gets very fat.  He builds a cocoon and then emerges a large beautiful butterfly.  My 3 year old does not tire of this story. He learns about nature, food and the days of the week in one absolutely stunningly illustrated book.  You can't get much better than this for young children.  If you have young children, or if you are looking for a gift for a 4 year old and younger child, this book is highly, highly recommended.  Enjoy.	2000-07-11

Like, is the boy hurt when he falls in the well?  Not asked, but wondered by me, was the question about why the first born son gets the  long dramatic name, but the second son, who is admittingly less important  in this book, gets a simple one syllable name.  Not exactly politically  correct; however, my son did not raise this issue, I did.  My son easily  follows this story and can repeat the Tiki-tiki tembo song, together with  all kinds of variations on the song.  The underlying story is not nearly as  important or as fun as the long rhythmic words.  Recommended.  This book is  a classic.  Your child will enjoy it, although you may wince at the items  mentioned above.	2000-07-11

Books	5	29	31	N	N	A book for every young child's bookshelf	This was the second book (Tana Hoban's black and white book was the first) that I read to my son when he was a few months old and read it again and again.  He was fascinated by the bright pictures in the book and the  rhythmic language.  Brown Bear brown bear, what do you see?  I see a _____  looking at me... As he began to recognize animals and moo like a cow and  quack like a duck, the pictures began to take shape for him and he would  recognize them for what they were drawn to be.  Mr. Carle writes and  illustrates wonderful books.  My son who is now 3, close to 4, still enjoys  the book and he can now easily anticipate which animal is on the next page.  I have this book in the board book style and when my son began to  &quot;read&quot; for himself, this was one of the books he would frequently  reach for.  Highly, highly recommended!	2000-07-11

He is completely uninterested in fighting and when the local bullfighters come out the field to find fighting bulls, they ignore  Ferdinand....until Ferdinand is stung by a bee and puts on a show that  impresses the matadors.  Ferdinand is taken to the arena for a bullfight;  however, he refuses to fight and is returned to the field. The matadors  have all the gory swords which are not used in the book.  My 3 year old son  wanted to know why there were swords which presented an interesting  dilemma.  In my opinion, this book is not for children who are younger than  3.  As stated above, 3 year olds need a lot of careful explanation about  the story.  They do not need to know why and how the swords are used.  The  violence of the bullfight is not central to this story.  Ferndinand's  character and his refusal to fight is.  This is a beautiful story that your  child will enjoy.	2000-07-11
US	52705211	R29RLT7T296LOU	0671776126	362447474	Plain Truth	Books	5	13	16	N	N	A guaranteed bestseller!	The word plain refers to the Amish, a simple and humble community that strives for sameness.  In this book, Jodi Picoult recounts a tale of infanticide, the killing of one's baby.  While the phenomena of young girls  killing their babies at proms or dumpsters outside hotel rooms is  relatively recent, it is not ever expected to happen in Paradise  Pennsylvania in a community of Amish.  Ellie Hathaway, the ardent criminal  defense lawyer from Philadelphia who is just starting to reek from her own  sense of disgust at getting certain criminals off, has taken a break to  return to Paradise.  She decides to defend Katie Fisher, the 18 year old  Amish girl who denies giving birth in a barn to an infant who is found  dead.  As part of the bail agreement, Ellie moves onto the farm, which is  the most unbelievable part of this story.  There are lots of psychologists  and theories about what happened, most of which are soundly debunked as  Katie's memory begins to return.  The last third of the book deals with the  trial and is tightly written.  The book paces well and has a kicker of a  twist at the end.  Ms. Picoult is a terrific writer.  If you have never  read her, I suggest this story and The Pact, a story about two teenagers  who make a pact to kill themselves together.  Ms. Picoult's characters are  deep and the reader is quickly pulled into her novels.  As an added bonus,  the reader will learn a great deal about Amish life.  This book is highly  highly recommended.  My guess is that it will be a bestseller.	2000-07-10

He is also excellent at the  classic twist and turn.  This book however has a few too many twists.  The  first half revolves around a search for a kidnapper and his victims, which  is very intriguing and well paced.  In the second half of the book Amelia  Sachs, Lincoln Rhyme's girlfriend, does something with the kidnapper that I  did not find to be credible.  However, you need to accept what she does in  order to follow the second half.  Lincoln Rhymes, the brilliant  quadraplegic forensic scientist is in North Carolia for medical treatment  when he is called in to assist on this North Carolina crime.  Mr. Deaver  knows forensics and it is fascinating to see how dirt and other physical  evidence is chronographed and each physical piece of evidence is dissected  psychologically and scientifically by Lincoln Rhyme to yield clues.  The  interplay between Lincoln and Amelia is not as tense and consuming as I  would have preferred.  All in all, this is a very good read.  Though not  his best book, I recommend it highly.	2000-07-08

We ourselves our at the dawn of a new millenium.  We ourselves have just been given the blueprint of human life and all our  expectations of curing disease that come with this knowledge.  This  attitude of a new century, new knowledge and a new frontier is what this  book is about.  It is also the tragic character flaw of many of the  characters.  With 20/20 hindsight, we can look back at this terrible storm  and experience the arrogance of a generation. Of course, with the advent of  this very internet you are now using, and the data available on it,  including incredible weather forecasts and &quot;strike  probabilities&quot;, which, for those of you not living in hurricane alley,  means what percentage the experts think our lovely island is going to get  struck by a hurricane that is thousands of miles away in the Atlantic and  churning closer every minute.  Of course, in 1900, there were no weather  satelites and scientists and meteorologists really did not know all that  much.  What a devastating storm this was.  Having lived through Hugo and  Marilyn (and many less major hurricanes), my friends and I in the Virgin  Islands have a great deal of respect for the hurricane.  Even when we know  it is coming, it strikes fear in our hearts.  Even when we are shuttered  up, with aluminum paneled shutters on the doors and aluminum or wood  shutters on the windows, even when we have radio (until the tower blows  away) we are scared.  It is impossible to imagine the fear that the people  in Galveston experienced when this storm became a monster.  As many  hurricane &quot;virgins&quot;, the town people were curious and excited  when the water started to flood the streets.  The excitement turned to fear  and panic when the water kept rising...4 feet in four seconds, can you  imagine?  This book starts slowly and then picks up speed as the storm gets  closer.  It is full of interesting details about the lives of the people of  Galveston and the city itself.  It has been thoroughly researched and it is  an impressive tome.  Galveston is extremely flat and close to the sea.  Ten  thousand people died in this storm.  That is a LOT of people.  This storm  was a secret in the sense that nobody talked about it until this book came  out.  It is an excellent read.  Nothing like &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;  which is a boat story.  This book is riveting.  Although the reader knows  what is going to happen, you actually feel the fear and pain as person  after person is killed or swept away.  Especially upsetting are the deaths  of so many children.  This is a heavy book.  You will not feel  &quot;better&quot; or purged when you finish it.  You will however respect  Mother Nature.  Highly, highly recommended!	2000-06-29

Imagine, dragging your four young girls off to live in the jungle.  The father Nathan Price has some serious character flaws which are fascinating  to uncover.  The first part of the book is voiced by each daughter and the  mother taking an alternate chapter.  This book is long and it is good.  It  is not for the Danielle Steel crowd.  In addition to learning about the  Price family, the &quot;natives&quot;, and missionaries I also learned a  great deal about the Congo and the politics that surrounded it in the  1960s.  This book is an excellent book, the kind you may keep on your  bookshelf for years and actually re-read years down the road.  Highly  highly recommended.	2000-06-29

If you have not yet read Harry Potter and refuse, simply because the books are so popular, you are seriously missing out.  The books are so popular because Ms. Rowling captures the heart of a child.  She knows the fears and  fantasies of children and she writes for this audience.  If you remember  what is was like to be a child, and believe in magic and dragon and to be  afraid of ghosts and to have a best friend whom you love so much that your  heart hurts when she or he is not around, you will appreciate this book.  This book is not for young kids, but then again, I assume you already knew  this.  These books are perfect in that they simply capture the heart and  imagination of a child.  I will keep this short so that you can read the  other 2,000 reviews.  Enjoy.  Highly recommended.	2000-06-29

He told me a about a scam where the mob would hang out at the blue movie theatres and follow the men who came out, and who were wearing wedding  rings.  The mobsters would take the license plate number and have their  buddies at DMV run the plates.  Then the blackmail would begin.  So,  Grisham did not invent the scam but he certainly perfects it in this book.   The judges at the Club Fed are all interesting.  The political thread of  the story is less so.  How the two intertwine is for you, dear reader, to  find out.  This is not Grisham's best book.  However, he did perfect this  genre and comparing his books is, to me, like comparing different caviars.   Grisham's books are all delicious.  They are beautifully written.  I felt  this story was a tad weak; however, it still was a terrific read.   Sometimes you get beluga and sometimes you get sturgeon.  The bottom line  is that they are all good.  Enjoy.	2000-06-29

Read this book if you are an adult who remembers what it was like to be a kid.  If you remember your fears, you will love this book as it plays on the worst things a kid can imagine.  Like your parents being murdered and  then having to move in with your aunt and uncle who hate you and make you  live in a closet under the stairwell and where your cousin hates you and  everyone in the house treats you terribly.  Also, your fantasies, like  walking on a train platform and disappearing into a new world, a new  dimension that is full of magic.  Now, this book is not for little  kids.  I won't venture to guess what age kids would start to enjoy the book  as my son is 3 and obviously, too young for this story.  Well, there are  2,700 more reviews for you to read so I don't want to take any more of your  time.  Highly highly recommended, as are the other volumes.	2000-06-29

If you have not yet read Harry Potter and are  reluctant to do so, simply because the books are so popular, you are  seriously missing out.  Ms. Rowling knows what makes a child tick.  She  knows what kids are scared of.  She knows what kids are fascinated  by...magic, ghosts, monsters.  She is a terrific writer.  These books are  remarkable for the simplicity of the prose.  The adjectives and  descriptions make the characters leap off the page.  My son is three and I  can not yet share these stories with him as he is too young.  I am not at  all surprised by how popular these stories are all over the world.  They  have a universal appeal.  I will keep this short so that you can read the  other thousand reviews.  Enjoy.

As a first time mom to be, I slept with this book under my pillow.  Only kidding (almost).  Although I am an avid reader, I had no clue what to expect during my pregnancy.  What was going to happen to my body and my  mind?  What was going on with the baby?  How was he growing?  What was he  doing?  My most obsessive thoughts when I was pregnant had to do with the  upcoming labor and delivery.  What should I eat?  Was what I was thinking  &quot;normal&quot;?  I couldn't even think past the delivery.  I assumed  that I could care for the baby easily once he was born.  Of course, this is  when you need &quot;What to expect the First Year&quot;.  I have many years  of schooling.  Big Deal.  I had no clue what to expect and this book gave  me peace of mind.  If you have already given birth, you do not need this  book although you would probably enjoy it.  My husband, who is not a  reader, actually read some of the chapters.  The authors are very funny and  terrific at anticipating questions you may have.  I have given this book as  a gift for friends having their first child and have yet to hear a  complaint.  Highly, highly recommended!	2000-06-28

Last year a woman who was a &quot;radical&quot; and a fugitive was found in some suburban town where she was &quot;loved by all&quot;.  This book concerns fugitives from other lives.  In this book, the present Jo is much  different from the persona she adopted when she lived in a Cambridge  Massachusetts commune in the 60's.  She has gone suburban, though not  really as she lives in the sticks.  The tension between Jo and her husband  the minister and Jo's longing for something else, something special,  reminds me of the Feminine Mystique.  Please don't get turned off by that  analogy as this book is a good read.  Yet the emptiness of Jo's life both  in the 60s and presently, despite her change in circumstances, is very  telling.  The introduction of Eli, a long lost commune member who lived  with Jo in the 60s and now lives close by in a large expensive development  shows how these baby boomers have &quot;grown and matured&quot;.  Of  course, you can make whatever judgment you like about the change of the 60s  generation into a generation that values material wealth.  This is one of  the underpinnings of the book.  Add to the recipe some dysfunctional but  entertaining almost adult children, and you have a very readable story.  I  feel as though Jo is very distant.  You never really get to know her.  Sue  Miller writes terrific books that hook you, although this one took me  almost 20 pages to get hooked, which is slow for Ms. Miller.  If you have  never read Sue Miller, this is a good book.  If you have read her, you will  not be disappointed.	2000-06-28

My 3 year old son loves and I mean LOVES the stories.  We bought the books after listening to the tape 200 times.  The Frances stories are hilarious.   Frances loves but sometimes is annoyed with her baby sister Gloria.   Frances insists on eating only bread and jam, only to become utterly bored  with this delicacy.  Frances' friend Albert is a too the point, absolutely  honest child, as most children this age are.  Frances loves chompo bars  which we now buy for our son.  We call the Nestle Crunch bar a chompo and  he is quite happy eating it.  Frances does not like to go to bed and while  it is no longer appropriate to spank a child, which is mentioned in this  book, my son, who have never been spanked, does not dwell on this issue  that book.  Frances also makes up little songs in all of her books which  are hilarious.  My son whom I thought only loves trucks, cars and trains  loves these books and adores the tape.  Accordingly, this book comes highly  highly recommended by one very satisfied 3 (almost 4) year old boy.	2000-06-28

It is broken up into three parts (and this is not a long book).  Some of the language is archaic and you need to turn the page and turn the page to read some of the sentences.  Andy checks out a book about lion and the adventure begins.  The lion and Andy come in  contact at the start and at the end of the book. While this book has been  around a long long time, there are definately better books out there.

I bought this book based on the fact it was a Caldecott Honorable Mention and based on the reviews.  I have to say my son loved the book until we got to the part where robbers in Halloween masks jump out of the bushes and put  a gun to Pearl's head.  Hello?   You reviewers out there.  My son (3,  almost 4) was shocked. He asked a zillion questions about the robbers.   Weren't they bad?  Did they hurt Pearl?  Why (how come) they were robbing  her?  The next day the questions continued.  I bought 10 Caldecott books  and we were reading the books right out of the box and I failed to preview  the story.  Big mistake.  This book is charming and wonderful except for  the robbery scene which is graphic and extremely disturbing.  That scene  also seems out of place.  In my opinion, it does not belong in a children's  book.  Parents of young children--beware of this book.  Adults, enjoy it.	2000-06-26

This book has an anticipatory depressing premise:  a spouse accidentally injures his spouse catastropically.  The accident has  already occured when the book opens and the family is leaving New York City  for the tranquility of their small town, one year after the accident and  one year after extensive rehab.  This book never has an uplifting moment.   Sure, the guilt Dan experiences and the anger of his wife over the accident  is expected.  But where is the reconciliation?  The two kids seem like they  are on the periphery throughout the book and despite her injuries, the  mother never reaches out to her children.  I read this book through hoping  it would get better.  The Wellseley wife lives this injury solely  intellectually.  The distance between the husband and wife is palpable yet  never breached.  I was very disappointed in this book, regretfully so,  because I usually adore Ms. Brown's books.  Unfortunately, I cannot  recommend this one.	2000-06-25

I learned of this book when I purchased another book and Amazon recommended it.  What a sleeper!  I had never heard of it.  My 3 year old son laughs everytime we read it.  The mouse insists on teasing the sleeping  or relaxing cat, who then pursues him.  The mouse runs to mommy to protect  him. However, during the last chase, mommy cannot help and the mouse has to  figure out how to save himself.  There are some real slapstick scenes which  my son loves. The cat has his nose tweaked, the cat falls off of his  hammock, typical three year old humour.  Highly, highly recommended!	2000-06-18
US	52705211	R3JDPKCFFQA5Z3	1570980985	302263646	The Little Gearhead Series Box Set	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Terrific bedtime stories.	These are three small books (about 3 x 5).  In Tale of Three Tractors, the tractors go to a fair.  All three excel at different things in the contest.  Nobody wins and the tractors all agree that &quot;we each do what we do  best and they went home happy as could be&quot;.  This book teaches  acceptance.   In Big Cat the Proud, Big Cat is the biggest and most  arrogant bulldozer, who gets help from someone he never paid attention to  when he flips over and gets stuck.  The two become friends.  This book  teaches humility.   In Jimmy the Beet Truck, Jimmy is belittled at a gas  station by Mack, a huge truck carrying cattle.  Jimmy had always been happy  doing what he was doing and the put down, quite frankly, took me by  surprise when I first read it.  Eventually Jimmy hauls his beets and helps  feed the cattle, without which beets the cattle would not live.     My son  has loved this books since he first turned three.  The stories are short  and he always asks me to read them again.  You don't get a better  recommendation than that.  Enjoy!	2000-06-18

The illustrations are incredibly colorful and true to life in the islands.  The volcano that has erupted and buried Montserrat is mentioned and show in the book, and though Monteserrat  is now buried under ash and not at all like the paintings in the book, your  child does not have to know the details.  My three year old loves this  story and pictures.  He is familiar with Carnival and many of the  &quot;island&quot; fruits and vegetables mentioned in the book.  If you  live outside the Caribbean, you could go to an island marketplace with your  child and actually find and eat these delicacies.  Overall, this is a  wonderful story about a boy and his best friend who travel to Montserrat  for an all-too-short vacation.  Again, for you statesiders who have not  been to the Caribbean with your kids, you will have to explain some of the  pictures; however, this is what imaginations are for.  Enjoy the book.   Highly recommended.	2000-06-18

He is three and still loves the book.  I recommend the board book for very small kids.  On every two pages there is a picture of some type of  construction or activity(like eating lunch).  The sentences are three words  long.  The action in the illustrations will mesmorize your young one.  My  son learned the names of all of the construction equipment from this book  (the book does not discuss the equipment, we did).  Highly, highly  recommended!	2000-06-18

The anticipation Peter feels when he wakes up and see the snow falling.  The crunch crunch that his feet make in the snow.  The shapes his feet make and of course, snow  angels.  The illustrations are beautiful and my 3 year old who has only  experienced snow once, absolutely adores this book!  An added bonus is that  Peter is African-American, a rarity in the old award winners, even of the  Caldecott award.  Whether you live in the tropics or the snow belt, your  child will probably love this story.	2000-06-18

In this story, the boy Eddie gets trapped behind the Bear's huge teddy bear.  He pretends he is the huge teddy by speaking back to the real bear who is sad.  The two become  friends.  My son laughs everytime we read this.  It is a complement to the  other bear book by the author, in which Eddie is left out in the woods with  the Bear while his mother runs back home to fetch an item for their picnic.  This is a wonderful read.  Highly recommended!	2000-06-18

The storyline definately needs explaining to small children.  My 3 year old son wanted to know why the small man could take the Queen's baby away.  Of course, Rumpelstilskin never actually takes the  baby because the Queen learns his name.  However, the premise of the story  is unsettling to small kids.  Nevertheless, I would not go overboard with  political correctness as the story is a classic and so long as you explain  the story, your children should enjoy it.  I also recommend Mr. Galdone's  other books as his illustrations are absolutely wonderful!	2000-06-18

It is based on a poem the author wrote which came to him as he was walking a street in New York City, on a snowy winter night.  The book takes place in the suburbs in 1948.  It  focuses on the anticipation of the snowfall, the actual snowfall, the  children playing and loving the snow and then the beginning of spring.  In  this age of FEdEX and high technology, it is fun to see a postman and  policeman walking their route.  The story really seems like a fairy tale.   It is absolutely charming.  It has endured since 1948.  Your children will  enjoy it, and so will you.	2000-06-18

You could study this book at Evelyn Wood as it is such a fast read.  Mr. Patterson must have had other things on his  mind when he wrote this.  While Alex Cross is a very likable character in  other books, like Dr. Alex Delaware in a similar genre, the plot does not  make a lot of sense.  Diplomatic immunity is an interesting subject for a  story, but why would a diplomat, especially a psycho diplomat with blood on  his hands, choose to go to trial just to make a point.  You can say that is  because he is psycho, but I say it is out of character.  Dr. Cross'  girlfriend is kidnapped and this aspect of the story is never adequately  developed.  It seems like Mr. Patterson shook his dice (a part of this  story) and mixed and matched different crimes and characters in order to  make a story.  Unless your name is OJ Simpson, how can a person commit a  bloody murder and three minutes later end up on a penthouse with not a hair  out of place.  Not very realistic.  Not Patterson's best effort.  If you  have never read Patterson, choose another title.  If you love Patterson,  buy this book in paperback.  It is not great, but it is not awful.	2000-06-03

He enjoys the repetitive story and is bemused by the grandmother who runs around trying to help her grandson get to sleep.  This is not a scary story and in fact, helps me get my son to  sleep.  It is also very funny, especially when all of the animals are in  the bed with Nathaniel and the bed breaks.  It is a fairy tale which is why  it is so fun.  Enjoy the story with your child or grandchild.	2000-05-27

Although he knows the plot by heart, he still eagerly awaits the turn of the page to see what is going to happen  to the boy who is left in the woods with a bear.  My son's favorite part is  when the boy hides in the picnic basket from the bear.  This is a great  book to read with your kids because you can talk about it with them as the  story progresses.  This is a nice bear and a terrific story with beautiful  illustrations.  Highly recommended.  Not limited to 3 year olds but older  kids will also enjoy the story.	2000-05-27

I am going to read it a second time.  This is the kind of story that enriches the reader each time it is read.  What a cast of characters.  What  a backdrop.  You can read the other 200 reviews for what happens.  If you  are reading this review to decide whether to buy the book, the answer is  YES.  This is a thinking person's book.  It will sweep you away to another  land and place, that was as unreal as many of the characters might, at  first blush, appear to be.  This is a stunning, complex book.  Not for the  Danielle Steel crowd.  For those of you who appreciate good  &quot;books&quot; and even the &quot;L&quot; word (Literature), this book  is for you.  Enjoy!	2000-05-27

A small boy refuses to go to sleep and vrooms away from his mama in a toy car...on his way to the sleepy world where his toy animals and toy soldiers and train await him.  The mother is looking for the boy  and will not sleep until she finds him, at which point the boy asks to go  to sleep.  My 3 year old son loves this book.  He likes the independence of  the boy who says no to his mother when she asks if he is ready for bed.   (As though my son actually articulated this to me).  The illustrations are  wonderful and the story line is terrific.  My son actually yawns when the  toys yawn and when the little boy is finally ready to go to sleep, so is my  son.  Highly, highly recommended!	2000-05-27

This bear thinks he is one tough cookie...that is, until his mommy sneaks in and sees how he is misbehaving.  My 3 year old loves  this story.  The illustrations are terrific and the story will reinforce  good manners.  Everytime we read this story, my son says &quot;Mommy, that  is a bad bear&quot;.  Waht a delight!  Highly recommended.	2000-05-27

Sure, Dr. Spock is not perfect.  However, he does know what he is talking about.  Should this be the only childcare book you should buy?  No.  Check out Penelope Leach and Dr. Brazleton, but should you not buy this book.   Absolutely not.  Dr. Spock started the children's movement, where kid's  were listened to and the rod and hand were kept away from the child.  This  book is a classic.  It is not outdated and should be read by all new  parents, whether it is your first child or fifth.  Highly recommended!	2000-05-27

There is not a single book that tells you everything a nervous first time parent needs to know.  This book however, comes close.  I have not read it in a year and a half-- my son is almost 4.  For that first year and a half,  it was comforting to have.  Ms. Leach answers the questions and gives a  first time parent confidence in handling a baby or toddler, and as  important, the confidence to know that not every child develops at the same  speed.  Get this book.  You will use it and enjoy it.  I liked to read  ahead to see what my son would be doing in 6 months.  Our generation wants  a more detailed book than Dr. Spock, whom, you must also buy if  you are  stocking your bookshelf in preparation for your first child.  I don't think  you need this book if you kids are older than 3.  Highly recommended!	2000-05-27

This is the first book I have read by Ms. Scottoline.  I will  give her other books a shot.  Read this one in paperback and enjoy.  It is  worth the price.	2000-05-27

My three and a half year old son loves this story which is about a gingerbread boy who runs away from people and animals who want to eat him, only to wind up in a river, on the back of a sly fox, who pretends not to  be interested in him.  The fox eats the boy but this story is not scary.   My son tells me it is &quot;OK that the fox ate the gingerbread boy because  he is really a cookie, and not a real boy&quot;.  I would not recommend  this book to kids who are three and younger as it might scare and confuse  them.  This is an older traditional story, a classic.  Highly recommended.	2000-05-26

The normal conflicts between a mother and daughter are heightened and made more dramatic when the mother is jealous and stuck in the 60's, always thinking about the &quot;what  ifs...&quot;.  This is the type of woman Betty Friedan was writing for in  The Feminine Mystique.  This is definately a woman's book, and many women  will recognize people they know in the story.   The mother was born ten  years too late.  Poor Sylvie is pushed into the shadows by her mother's  need to be recognized and acknowledged (bold, audacious clothes and a  complete lack of tact), so Sylvie is forced to retreat into the shadows and  intentionally underachieves so that her mother looks better than daughter.   This seems to be a uniquely American trait.  Sylvie finally escapes to New  York to be an artist, only to learn, soon after moving to New York, that  Mom has terminal cancer.     Many scenes are highly moving.  Sylvie's  struggle with forgiveness and anger toward her mother is remarkably  touching.  Her mother's spirit is indominantable and it is Sylvie's father,  the normal nice company man, who garnered my sympathy.    I highly  recommend this book.  It is spiritual in that the lesson I learned is that  when all is almost said and done (and mom is dying) all that matters is the  love between the mother and daughter.  All transgressions and omissions  stand by the wayside for this special time.        Hopefully this book will  be reviewed and recognized and will shoot for the bestseller list.  It is  terrific!	2000-05-20

The family is multilayered and psychologically complex.  At every turn there is another &quot;incident&quot; that left me gasp.  This book is a  modern american tragedy.  Ms. O'Dell does a masterful job telling this  story which is heart wrenching.  At the end you will find yourself  empathizing with all of the characters...the good, the bad and the ugly.   Though I do not expect it, I would love a sequel to find out what happens  to the characters.  Enjoy.  This book is hard to put down.	2000-05-09

Mr. Eggers allows us to visit his mind, which is sometimes rambling, sometimes very funny, and always very deep.  This book is unlike any book you have already read.  If you are over 50, you may not be able to  appreciate a 20 something who, as one review said is \\"wise beyond his  years\\".  What effect does the death of one's parents (within 32 days  of each) have on a family?  How about a 20 something young, bright but  immature man, who has to raise his 8 year old brother after their parents  have died? This makes for very compelling reading.  Mr. Eggers is always  aware of his reader and though he sometimes panders to the reader, he  forces the reader to become intimate with him, because he puts the reader  in his brain and allows us to hear his thoughts.  He is poignant in the  passages, of which there are many, about his mother.  His family, before  the deaths, lived in true mid-west suburbia.  But the Eggers family was not  a traditional upper-mid-class suburban family.  There are secrets which are  revealed throughout the book.   This is one of those books that you  \\"should\\" read because it really is groundbreaking.  Whether Mr.  Eggers can ever deliver another book of this magnitude remains to be seen.   This book may well define the early 00's much as Portnoy's Complaint and  Catcher in the Rye defined their eras.  Highly recommended!	2000-03-13

John Colapinto has written a remarkable work, giving insight to a story that should be science fiction, but is not.  Nobody listened to David/Brenda during the first 14 years of his life when he made clear he was unhappy with his &quot;reassignment&quot; to a girl.  His parents,  especially his mother, tried earnestly to make this experiment work.  Blind  to reality, the parents chose to ignore all signs that their son was not  turning into a girl.  When David is finally able to assert himself and live  as he was born to live, he begins to flourish.  It is amazing that external  genitalia, or the lack of, has lead to boys becoming girls or vice versa.  That one man, Dr. Money, was able to make a name for himself at Johns  Hopkins based on this one very failed experiment with Brenda/David, is  astounding.  Where were his peers?  It seems everyone was so awed by Dr.  Money's huge ego and personality that nobody in the medical profession, was  willing to question results, which were very different that those results  published in Dr. Money's many books and publications.  That David is able  to forgive his parents for the ruse of his first 14 years is incredible.  His parents tried their best, yet they made terrible mistakes.  This book  is highly charged.  While Mr. Colapinto generally sticks to the facts, the  emotional underpinnings of this story are devastating and one will be hard  pressed not to feel for this little boy.  Highly recommended.	2000-03-04
