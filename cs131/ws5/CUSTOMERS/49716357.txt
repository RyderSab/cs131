US	49716357	R11IBGGACP47TJ	0312276966	603778953	The Forger: A Novel	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Interesting premise	I owned this book for a long time before I could muster up the desire to read it. The premise sounded very interesting and the historical facts behind it were new to me, but something about reading about WWII sounded depressing. <br />The book was anything but depressing. It started off alittle slow and picked up great speed after Chapter 5 or so. The characters were well-developed, although somewhat stereotypical and predictable. The story was less about war than about loyalty and honor. I have to disagree with other viewers when they stated that too much detail was devoted to the descriptions of art and their forgeries-I found it all very interesting. The plot was quick-paced, but when I thought only days were passing, it turned out to be years.  <br />I do recommend this book. I must admit that I did look forward to picking it up and continuing to read it once I started. While suitable for both, I think that men might find the plot and wartime atmosphere more appealing than women.	2005-09-23

I liked how the story came full-circle at the end; although it was tied up alittle too neatly, alittle too fast and held too many unbelievable coincidences. But, I must say, it was very clever thinking by the author. My only real fault: I wish the author had used diffrent names for the male relatives; I found all of the 'E' names too similar and confusing and I spent too much wasted time trying to figure out who was who.  <br />On the whole, I enjoyed the book and looked forward to the times that I could sit down and read. Give it a try.	2005-09-15
US	49716357	R15HJ8107LVOMG	0618562036	719178727	Empress Orchid	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Good, not great	A good read for any historical fiction fan. While based on the true story of Empress Orchid, the story had the typical plot of a lower class young woman defying all odds and expectations of women of her time and gaining unprecedented wealth, fame and power. Of course, the themes of deception, treason and alittle romance were thrown in for good measure. I kept having to remind myself that there was some truth to all of this soap opera. <br />We read this for my book club and most of us were disappointed by its average and typical plot, but agreed that the writing was well done. Shold be enjoyed by most historical fiction fans-an interesting time period-I learned new things.	2005-08-22

Too weird for me and difficult to follow. What was the author on when she wrote this? It didn't seem  to be so much about the ultimate love as it was about voyeurism, obsession and a severe psychiatric disorder. No thanks.	2005-08-19

The individual characters providing their own first person narratives added to the detail of the story and gave various insights and perceptions of same events. The storyline was alittle weird (to say the least), but somehow believable. It seems to have been based on true events ( or a historical legend) as the author provides some factual details and biographical information at the end. I usually find metaphorical references in books difficult to follow, but despite the fact that this book is filled with them, they were all well placed and easy to understand. Some of the characters' religious ranting was alittle confusing towards the end, but the author did an excellent job of weaving the plot around them and ultimately explaining their meanings through the storyline.  <br />If you are a lover of historical fiction, I would definitely add this to your list.	2005-08-19

I am an avid historical fiction reader and was alittle tentative about reading a sci-fi book about time travel. A kind member of my book club chose it because she wanted the sci-fi factor, but knew that it could be enjoyed by the historical fiction fans, too. It was a good choice.  <br />Obviously, as a result of my preference for history, I very much enjoyed the chapters related to the medievel times. The scenes were realistic and informative and the relationships between the characters were easily conveyed. The present day scenes(or actually the future) were alittle more contrived and far-fetched and the characters had alittle too much of a superhero feel to them. However, the author did a wonderful job of using characters and metaphors to show the intricate relationship between the two time periods. <br />The book did get alittle long at times (especially in the middle)and Mr. Dunworthy's neverending obstacle-filled battle to rescue Kivrin could have been shortened by 100+ pages, but I do understand how the author used the struggle to build the suspense. And while I couldn't wait to see what happened at the end (I really had no preconceived ideas), I was eventually disappointed with the quick and hurried, perfect superhero ending. I won't give it away. But Ms. Willis must have done something right because this book won so many awards. <br />All in all, an enjoyable read and I'm glad it was chosen by my group as it was not something I would have picked up otherwise. Definitely a page-turner and worth the time.  <br />	2005-05-09

Actually, three stories in one as the two main characters tell their own life tales in the context of the book. A story about overcoming hardships and tragedy through friendship, love and most importantly, hope. I felt especially drawn to the character of Mr. Serle, portrayed as a kind and warm \\"father-figure\\" type whose wisdom was both powerful and inspirational. The gastronomically descriptive text always made me hungry and wishing I was sitting at the tables enjoying the delicious foods with characters. I recommend this book.	2005-03-11

I loved the diary format and first-person narrative. I thought the author did a wonderful job of showing the progression of Sarah's maturity simply through her diary entries. Some of the scenes were alittle graphic and tragic, but I suppose that was the reality of the time period. I did find that Sarah and Captain Jack possessed some superhero qualities at times that could have been minimalized. Lastly, I was unhappy with the sad ending that seemed contrived just to bring the story to a quick and rushed finish.   I know that the sequel is due for release in a few months and I do plan on reading it. The few faults of this book were definitely outweighed by the positive traits.	2005-03-11

I do have to agreee with another reviewer and feel that this book was mistitled. It is not so much about Mozart's marriage and his relationship with his wife as it is about his early years and the relationship he had with the Weber family (more specifically, the four Weber sisters). I, too would have liked to see it go on further and explore the marriage, itself.  <br />It did start out alittle slow, but after about 75 pages, or so, the pace quickened and the plot got more lively. It is a quick and enjoyable read and I do recommend it. Mozart fans will love it.	2005-01-31

While at times it read a little like a soap opera, the fact that it was based on a real Countess' diary kept it real and lent the story credibility. Anna's passion for love, life and her country was inspirational and touching. I also liked the fact that while I was being entertained by an intriguing story, I was being given a wonderful history lesson as well (being from a Polish background, I am embarrassed to say all of this was new information for me). It is a novel filled with intrigue, suspense, mystery, revenge, passion, love, faith, glitter, jealousy, greed, war, death, solidarity....the list goes on and on.  <br />Best of all, I hear that the author is in the process of writing a sequel as I speak.

I strongly doubted that a nonfiction book would be able to hold my interest for long as they can be so dry and tedious, but the topic sounded interesting, the review was promising and as I am a huge historical fiction reader I thought it might be worth a try.  I am so grateful that I ran across that recommendation or I would have missed out on a real gem! <br /> <br />The story grabbed me in right from page one. I couldn't wait to find some free time to be able to get back to reading! While definitely written as nonfiction, the story at times reads like a simple novel with short dialogue, letter excerpts and diary entries. These personal touches add a wonderful element to the book. The scientific explanations were presented very simplistically and were easy enough to understand. They too, added a wonderful and important element to the story. <br /> <br />Marie Curie's life was fascinating: a woman of rare intelligence and genius, she was also plagued by severe depression (especially after the loss of her beloved Pierre) and faced the constant struggle to prove herself and receive her much deserved credit in what was a very male-dominated field. Yet despite these struggles, her devotion to science and her world-changing discoveries never diminished; they enveloped her very soul. I must admit that at times, when reading about her accomplishments and the ease at which science came to her, I felt alittle inadequate and less than intelligent. She was an inspiration!  <br /> <br />I was very happy to discover the wonderful coincidence that while I was reading this book, the anniversary of Marie Curie's discovery of radium and radioactivity took place. I strongly recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in science, history, women's rights, medicine or just plain life!	2004-12-23

I found the characters to be overly stereotypical, completely predictable and just plain dull. The only one who had any depth at all was Anne. The conversations were boring, especially the political ones. The entire scandal about lesbianism was anticlimactic and dull - how did anyone find it enticing or exciting?  <br />I expected to love this book as I was captivated by Ms. Donoghue's SLAMMERKIN.

The plot was easy enough to follow: an exiled queen befriends a recently freed slave (once a prince in his own country) and the two secretly marry and have a child together. This part of the story was interesting and compelling enough to make me want to read on, but the long religious dissertations and never-ending references to upcoming war and the complexities of European politics at the time often left me confused and bored. A geneology chart and a short explanation of the time's politics at the beginning of the book would have been extremely helpful. In addition, the author seems to have a strong preference to elaborate details and conversations with huge, fancy words. I can't imagine that these people would actually use them in daily conversations and it only added to the tediousness of trying to get through the story. Simpler wording and language would have made for an easier and more pleasant read and would not have taken anything away from the storyline.  <br />This book was immediately sold to a used bookstore when I finished it. I would have loved to continue on reading the rest of the trilogy, but don't have the time to be so taxed in my reading efforts.	2004-10-08

Taken in by a loving and spiritual black beekeeper and her somewhat eccentric family and circle of friends, she finds herself surrounded by acceptance and love and begins to deal with the troubles of her past. While her problems are resolved rather quickly, the story is still touching and emotional and readily exemplifies the troubles of the racially-charged South during the 60s. I was left with teary eyes at the end and for me it is always a good sign when a book can elicit outward emotions in the reader.

Although I did finally finish the book, it never had that \\"can't wait to get to the next page\\" feel. And the ending was so anti-climactic! One question bothered me throughout: Why was Esther so head-over-heels in love with her cousin and unwilling to let go of an impossible dream of being with him? She barely knew him and he showed no signs of returning any of her affections. Enough said..I won't blow the whole story for you.	2004-09-06

I especially enjoy British history and knowing little about its medieval times, I thought this book would be worth a try. Alittle slow at first, it finally picked up about halfway through and then I couldn't put it down. I found myself often confused about the many names being dropped and had to reread passages to clarify their roles. I also had to read the facts behind the unraveled mystery over and over to understand the connections-maybe it's just my lack of understanding and that's why I stay away from mysteries in the first place. Once I took the time to slow down, I understood the plot alittle more clearly. I was able to figure out the mystery of Alais' son right off the bat; way before it was divulged by the author. <br /> The reading was easy and fast. I enjoyed the first person narration and the main character, Alais, was likeable, even if sometimes she was alittle too brash and brave. I was alittle disappointed that some sex had to be thrown in near the end to cheapen the story.  <br />All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in historical fiction (I did learn a lot about the Plantagenet era)and anyone who enjoys a good mystery.  <br />By the way, did anyone else notice the discrepancy on the cover? The main character repeatedly refers to her malformed left hand (I'm not giving away any big secrets); yet, the hand holding the letters on the cover is a beautifully formed woman's left hand. Just thought it was interesting.	2004-07-28

About two women who struggle to find their own religious identities and ideals (and clash in the course), this book opens up all kinds of questions about religion, faith and piety. It's an interesting documentary on the religious conflicts of the times and people's needs to find someone or something to believe in. Being about actual people made it all the more interesting, but I can't say that I believe either of these two women did anything to deserve the title of Saint. Reads alittle like nonfiction at times, but is still an easy, quick and enjoyable book.	2004-07-18

I had previously read THE TWENTIETH WIFE and FEAST OF ROSES by Indu Sundaresan. Both of these books tell the stories of this main character's ancestors and family. similar   The three together tell a wonderful story and make a spectacular trilogy. The authors have a similar writing style and you don't feel like you miss a thing. Try to read them in the order I've mentioned, but if you've already started this book, you'll enjoy reading the others, too.<BR>John Shors has an easy and relaxed writing style. I was especially impressed with how wonderfully he was able (as a man) to express the feelings and insights of such a complex and emotionally-ladened female character (in first person narrative, no less). I was especially touched by the relationship between Jahanara and her father, the Emperor. I did find certain spots alittle violently graphic for me, but I suppose that's how the story actually went. <BR>I, like a previous reviewer, also jumped ahead and did some research on the Taj Mahal as I was reading. I have to agree with her, that as hard as it may be, avoid doing so. While being very interesting, it definitely gave away a few secrets and ruined a few surprises in the plot of the book. <BR>In all, this book was an easy, quick and enjoyable read and I recommend it.

I was alittle disappointed that I didn't like Mehrunnisa very much in this book; fame and wealth can definitely change a person. The fact that this book was based on actual history made it all the more fascinating and the author's notes at the end were a plus.

I've read three of Krakauer's books and enjoyed them all immensely. <BR>I'm not sure what to think of Chris MacCandless and his deadly adventure; my opinions changed frequently while reading about his life. While opinions as to why he chose such a secretive and lonely journey could be debated forever, it was the emotional torture that his parents and family endured that really tugged at my feelings. No matter what his motivation to go alone into the wild (and I do believe some mental instability played into it), there was no excuse not to contact family in even some tiny way. As we can tell from his letters, he had no problem sending communications to even the most casual of acquaintances he met along the road. <BR>We have decided to make this the first book reviewed in a book club that some friends and I have started.

When I accidentally discovered this book at a bookstore, I bought it immediately and expected to love it just as much! I can't say that I did!<br />I never felt any kind of a bond with the main character, Hannah, and the story never seemed to pick up any steam. Although I think that the author tried to portray Hannah as young woman discovering her independence and asserting her individuality and strength, I found her to be wishy-washy, timid, indecisive and just plain disloyal. One moment she was the faithful servant of a member of the royal family and the next moment she was spying on them. She should have been tried for treason a hundred times over! The premise of the story (the unlikely relationship of a young Jewish girl escaping the Spanish Inquisition only to become an intimate member of the English royal court) was very interesting and carried so much potential, but the story never went anywhere and the details were superficial. The fact that Hannah was not a real person only added to my frustration in trying to determine to what extent the storyline details actually took place.<br />On a positive note, I did enjoy learning alittle more about 'Bloody Mary.' I have read so much lately pertaining to the Tudors, but have only limited background on this Queen.<br />All in all, I can say that I will definitely read any forthcoming book from Philippa Gregory, but can't say that this one compares on any level to some of her previous works.	2004-03-05

I immediately went out and bought some informational books on the Priory of Scion and the premise of the Holy Grail. If this book had been about some other fictional topic, I would have put it down after the first few pages. The murder mystery plot was predictable and the &quot;leave-you-hanging&quot; endings to every chapter got old quickly (especially with the large number of chapters in this book). The speed at which this fast-paced mystery and its cryptographic puzzles was solved was completely unbelievable and, quite frankly, insulting. Admittedly, I did find the Epilogue alittle surprising, but nothing else caught me offguard. I'm not one for reading murder mysteries, but because this came so highly recommended by many, I did. Now I've confirmed for myself why I won't be reading anymore.	2004-02-23

I knew that I would have to read this book when a friend told me about it. Let me start by saying that I could not put it down! The subject of religious fundamentalism and the polygamist lifestyle is fascinating. While the story of the murders of two innocent people as a result of these beliefs is an integral part of the story (and somewhat graphically detailed), it didn't captivate me as much as the history of Mormonism and fundamentalist Mormonism did. Jon Krakauer did not use this book to bash, degrade or embarrass those of the Mormon faith; he was telling the story of and explaining the history of the LDS Church as it happened so that we could understand why some people choose to live the lifestyles that they do. When I mentioned some of the more negative historical information to an LDS friend of mine she was quick to reply that his information was wrong! This book is not about who is wrong or right (although most Mormons will quickly debate you when negative Church history is presented to them), but simply presents the true (and for some, painful) history behind the ultimate founding of both the LDS Church and the Fundamentalist LDS Church. <BR>Krakauer's writing style draws you in right away.

US	49716357	R194O0IKXE47OW	0385720696	522247700	Red Water: A Novel	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A history I never knew about	I had this book on the shelf for many months before picking it up to read and I wish I'd picked it up sooner. It is the story of John D. Lee, a Mormon pioneer and leader in the 19th century, and his alleged involvement (and ultimate execution) in the Mountain Meadows Massacre. As I live in northern Arizona, I have met polygamous families and always been fascinated by their lifestyles, but I never knew anything about this event until now. Most interestingly, the story is told from the perspective of three of his nineteen wives.  All had different stories (I liked Emma's the best) and perspectives of his involvement and of the Mormon lifestyle in general (at that time). It is obviously a novel, but based upon factual events and thoroughly researched history.  I hesitated to read it at first as a Mormon friend of mine thought that the fictional tone of the story took away from the importance of the true facts, but it didn't. This book just whet my appetite to learn more about this period in time, the people who lived it and the tragic massacre that took place on Sept. 11, 1857. I can't wait to read more book about this time in western U.S. history.	2003-11-12

I have about fifty more pages until I am done with this book; it's taken me more than a month to get to this place! I love historical fiction and devour anything about English history, so after reading &quot;The Secret Dairy of Anne Boleyn&quot; I couldn't wait to get my hands on this sequel (the possibility of an illegitimate royal heir is intriguing). I'm having a hard time finding the desire to read on to the ending; at this point it has dragged on so long that I just don't care. I have to agree with other reviews when they state that the chapters devoted to Arthur Dudley's dairy entries are boring. The endless descriptions of war, spying and fighting (approximately the last quarter of the book)are monotonous and just plain uninteresting. I so eagerly look forward to the chapters devoted to Elizabeth, but there are few towards the end and they almost all have to do with war. And one chapter had something to do with a weird supernatural pagan ceremony encouraging Elizabeth and Robin Dudley to have &quot;relations&quot; for the sake of saving England in the war-bizarre and unnecessary!! It started out well enough, but has turned into a slow-moving war epic - not my cup of tea. On a positive note, as inaccurate as many say this story is, I have learned a great deal about English history during this time. And for good measure, I probably will finish those last 50 pages...and then sell the book to a secondhand bookstore!	2003-10-28

My first grade daughter and I just read this book (and listened to an accompanying audio recording) at the library today. It was so enjoyable that I plan to purchase it for my four-year-old nephew as a holiday gift. The illustrations are bright, colorful and very clever.

All of the others have painted a negative picture of Anne Boleyn as a woman without morals and intent on manipulating anyone who opposed her plan . Quite frankly, they shaped my interpretation of her pesonality. This book, on the other hand,presented her in a brighter and more positive light. It offered the possibility that she was a caring and kindhearted woman who was grossly misunderstood and mislabeled. She still had the capability of manipulating those around her, but without the malicious intent other books suggest. I don't know which is true, but would love to do more research to find out.<BR>I was even more captivated by the story of Elizabeth I (who I admit to knowing little about). This book will be the stepping stone to more reading more literature about this interesting and powerful historical figure. <BR>Robin Maxwell's writing style is wonderful and easy to read and clearly tells a story using dialogue, diction and mannerisms of the time. I look forward to reading more of her books.	2003-09-09

There were times when a character got engaged, married and had their first child all within a couple of paragraphs and other times when entire chapters were devoted to seemingly unnecessary details, dialogue and events. Added to it all was a sometimes cheap, sometimes nauseatingly overdone romance. In the midst of a tragic and deadly war, a young soldier repetetively dotes his sugary-sweet affections on a young beautiful woman he met only once before as a child. He goes from killing enemies to declaring his undying devotion in a matter of minutes-constantly! The war scenes are often graphic and gory-you may want to skip over some chapters entirely if you have a weak stomach. <BR>All in all, the writing style is simplistic (and almost juvenile) and the reading pace fast. What started out as a subject matter with a lot of potential, quickly became a sappy romance just barely a step above a Harlequin novel.	2003-08-24

I can say that I learned a lot about Henry VIII and this time period that I never knew and it definitely has aroused a new interest in me, but it was so long. It took me about a month to read this (and I read often); some points kept me interested and other parts just dragged. I most certainly enjoyed the parts about his wives! So many names were introduced and mentioned that I found myself often lost and confused as to what role they played in the story. After reading over 900 pages, I found the end very anti-climactic and was simply thankful that I was done. Overall, the story, itself, was very interesting (how can anyone say Henry VIII isn't?), the writing was enjoyable, but it was just too looooong!	2003-07-26

This is probably my favorite group of books and everyone I have let borrow them feels the same. All are well-written and easy reading (as well as interesting history).

It drew me in from the very beginning and I didn't want to put it down. The author didn't spend lengthy pages describing the characters backgrounds, yet I felt like I had all the information to I needed to understand them and their actions. I agree (with some of the other reviewers) that it was predictable at times, but it didn't keep me from wanting to read more and I, for one, was surprised by the ending! This is simply a little book about fate and relationships and all that stuff that makes the world go 'round.<BR>I definitely recommend this book.

I found it in a bookstore and was drawn to the beautiful cover and the fact that it was historical fiction; the insert in the book jacket sounded interesting. I, admittedy, had never heard about the Borgias prior to this. <BR>The overabundance of references to Greek and Roman mythology (some written in Greek) left me confused and struggling through dialogue. Shorter, less detailed references would have been just as effective. Also, have a dictionary available when reading; I learned many loooong, new words (which isn't necessarily a bad thing).<BR>The story, itself, was interesting, but alittle slow. The drama and speed definitely picked up through the last third of the book. It was easy enough to guess about the sick and disturbed lifestyle the Borgias lived, but no actual references to the details were brought up, again , until the last third of the book. They appeared out of the blue, as if they had been discussed all along. I failed to see Lucrezia as the villain she is reputed to be, but rather saw her as a victim of a manipulative, incestual, egocentrical, power-hungry and downright psychotic family. Sure, she loved her jewels and money, but all her actions were the results of the sickness that surrounded her. To be forced into two marriages, then have them tragically and forcibly ended by the evil powers in her family (after she found love in them) would lead anyone to a life of hate and bitterness.<BR>I felt for Lucrezia and her life story, but the writing was too complex and tried to hard to be masterful. A more readable attempt by the author would have been more satisfying and enjoyable.	2003-05-14

I am so glad that I picked it up (and admittedly, had a hard time putting it down)! I must claim igonorance because I had never heard of John S. Sargent or his controversial piece of work. The story was well-written and thoroughly enjoyable. While I did find Madame Gautreau openly egocentric, self-centered and just plain conceited, her attitude only added to the appeal behind the painting's controversy. <BR>I definitely recommend this novel: an enjoyable, quick and entertaining book.	2003-04-26

The black and white cover with the brilliant blue contrasting dress tells it all: I was never able to visualize anything of bright color or beauty while reading this book. From one-eyed old hags to a baby with grotesque birth defects to foul-mouthed old drunkards to grave-robbing doctors to a young prostitute trying to make it in the world, this book covered life's worst representatives. Oh, I forgot, detailed descriptions of death by cholera are also sprinkled throughout. Although the ending (the last 4-5 pages) makes a small effort to bring a touch of optimism to the story, the remainder is dark, depressing and disturbed. <BR>My favorite books are about late 19th century England, and admittedly, stories about the prostitutes of the time, but this book was alittle too heavy and too dark. If not for the beautiful writing style and narration, I probably would have put it down without finishing it.	2003-04-20

I am so glad that I picked it up! I won't go into a narration about the storyline (you can read other reviews for that), but I will say that this was a well-written and beautifully expressed piece of fiction. Ms. Donoghue's style is easy and fast to read, yet elicits the full flavor of the period. I felt all extremes of emotions when reading about the fate of the main character, Mary- love, hate, anger, fear, bravery, sadness, humiliation- it goes on. I am eagerly looking for more of Emma Donoghue's books to get my hands on.<BR>One piece of advice- definitely not a book for those who are offended by blatant sexual references or don't have a stomach for England's criminal justice system in the 18th century.	2003-03-15

I enjoyed the first third of it and eagerly and captivatingly read through the last soap opera-ish last third, but found myself dragging through the middle. The writing style was beautiful and I thoroughly enjoyed the author's style of narration (that's where the four stars come from)!  I just wish the book wasn't over 800 pages long; alittle too much and too drawn out. The ending (as other reviewers point out) was alittle open-ended, but the narrator openly admits to this as being construed purposely. My one major disagreement with the other reviewers is that many of them found this book to contain strong sexual vulgarities and foul language and were somewhat offended. The story is about a prostitute...need I say more? In acuality, I opened this book expecting to find MANY references to sexual \\"events.\\" Intimacy is referred to throughout and blatant (maybe vulgar?) words are used to refer to bodyparts, but nothing to the extent I was expecting to find. A Harold Robbins novel probably has more explicit sex scenes. <BR>All in all, I did enjoy this book (especially the writing style), but am glad to say it's over. Alittle too long.	2003-02-16

I'm afraid that I have to agree with the minority here - I can't understand what everyone else is raving about. I just wanted to scream, \\"Hey, Kathleen, get a good shrink, a prescription for a huge bottle of Prozac and get a life!\\" What a depressed and self-absorbed character. It took the author over 500 pages to tell a story that lasted a little over one week in her pathetic, melancholy life. The only parts of interest were the main character's attempts at writing a love story about some long ago Irish residents. Unfortunately, she became so absorbed in their fictional lives when she should have been dealing with repairing her own sad life (which she made an attempt at in the last twenty pages or so). Ultimately, their story, too, was filled with sadness. The author's frequent flashbacks and references to memories left me confused at times (she jumped all over a two hundred year period) and the lacking of quotation marks made the flow of conversation difficult to follow at times. <BR>I did manage to finish the book with the hope of learning more of the great potato famine (which I did to some extent), but it will not become a part of my personal library.

I learned so much about this woman and a time in history that I always wanted to learn about, but never did. Not only was it enjoyable reading, but it was educational as well.

I only wish I had had more time to read  it and was able to spend more time with it at any one sitting - I didn't want to put it down. Yes, on occasion it had the predictability and sappiness of a soap opera, but just knowing that it was loosely based on a real person's life made it intriguing and alittle more believable. The historical and religious inaccuracies (as some other reviewers were so eager to point out)were minimal and didn't take away from the actual story. The heroine was strong, powerful, intelligent and had an insight to life beyond her years; I kept having to remind myself that she was only a teen through most of the book. Remember, this is fiction!<BR>While I definitely learned a lot about this time period (and especially Italian history), I must say that I found the storyline surrounding the wars alittle tedious (however relevant they might have been to the story) and often found myself confused as to the people and events involved. <BR>And on one more note of negativity (there aren't many): the author liberally uses italian and hebrew words/phrases throughout the book, but without any reference as to their meanings. I wasn't always able to determine a word's meaning from the context in which it was used and felt like I was  missing valuable information. A glossary would have been a nice addition. <BR>I found the ending particulary moving and thought-provoking. While definitely sad (I'm not giving anything away), I felt a complete sense of closure and appropriateness by the ending the author chose. Too many times, I find that the endings of books are anticlimactic and leave me feeling cheated. Not so here.<BR>I definitely recommend this book- to Italians, Jews and anyone else interested in a wonderful read! Definitely part of my permanent collection!	2002-11-28

I borrowed it from the library and actually went out and bought my own copy before I even finished reading it. I was particularly impressed that a man was able to write the journals entirely from a woman's perspective and be so convincing. I was awed by May's strength, leadership and positive attitude during such a frightening and unexplored experience. Despite her tragic past and tragic demise, she lived a beautiful, respectful and loving existence among &quot;the savages.&quot; I found her to be very inspirational.<BR>As I live among a very high population of Native Americans and within miles of a major reservation, I find myself having newfound respect for the trials and tribulations the Native American people faced in the 1800s (and still today). Their lifestyle was not &quot;savage,&quot; but beautiful and natural.  It was how the white settlers treated them that was the tragic savageness of the story.	2002-10-04

I admit that it was the simplicity of the cover that caught my attention. The writing style was wonderful and I always enjoy a book written in the first person narrative. The main character, Cassandra, was easy to listen to. A girl on the verge of womanhood, she showed wisdom, insight and sensitivity beyond her years. Considering that she lived in such a dysfunctional family, it was miraculous that she turned out to be so well-adjusted. <BR>The writing style was beautiful-not too wordy, but allowing for crystal-clear descriptions of the family and their surroundings. I did find that the plot was alittle predictable and events that should have taken time to evolve, happened at a whirlwind pace. At times I thought that months or years had passed, until the narrator indicated that it was actually the next day ( I just don't think that the kind of events described happen that fast in real-life).<BR>In general, I found this to be an enjoyable and pleasant book. No sex, no drugs, no violence - just the likable story of a girl coming of age. <BR>P.S. Men might not find this story as compelling as a woman might-it's definitely a \\"girl\\" book.	2002-08-24

I always seem to enjoy books written in the first person narrative because I feel like it allows me into the narrator's mind and let's me get to know them on a deeper level than a story told from another narrator's perspective. It was as if the main character, Merivel, opened his soul and emotions to us and allowed us into his private thoughts. His open honesty about his personal faults (there were many), his anger,his obvious depression, his dreams and his often lusty desires was moving. I found his deep personal attachments to others and his insightfulness into others' lives compelling (being that he was so unhappy in his own life) . I could tell that he wasn't the type of person that I could be friends with, but I often felt like I wanted to hug him and make all his problems go away. <BR>I've heard others say that theycouldn't &quot;get into&quot; this book, but I was captivated from the first page.

I did enjoy the historical aspect of the book and I did learn many interesting tidbits about Washington's life that I previously did not know. But I never felt the &quot;love story&quot; aspect until the last ten pages or so. It was obvious that George felt deep emotion for Martha (or Patsy, as he called her), but it seemed more of a comfort, security  and convenience based relationship on his part. Clark refers to their love for eachother repetitively, but I was never able to feel the passion of it until the last pages when the dialogue actually contained the words, &quot;I love you.&quot;  The only thing Washington truly showed any outward passion for was his home, Mount Vernon. And an ongoing obsession with an old friend's wife.<BR>I found myself disappointed in Washington's demeanor and motivations. There was a perpetually underlying theme of depression and he never seemed happy with his lot in life (he would definitely be in therapy if he was alive now). I got the impression that he resented having been chosen as our first President and I found myself resenting him in return. It spoiled my childhood illusions of our great leader.  <BR>The book contained little depth and the conversations were simple and bland. Clark's writing style is simple and reflects a style that is used simply for the mass marketing of a book;one that will appeal to the general population. The style lacks originality and individuality. <BR>Overall, this book was a quick and easy read. The story was simple and the plot superficial. It was generally pleasant, but not close to being on of those books you just can't put down.	2002-07-29

It may have had a few faults as some other reviewers have mentioned, but none took away from the story or my enjoyment of it. Some have said that they found the fact that it was written in first person narrative inappropriate and distracting; I found it refreshing and it allowed me to feel like Artemisia was talking directly to me. I also agree that some of the language may have been inappropriate for the time period of the story, but the story was still clearly expressed and understood. <BR>Most importantly, I was able to feel Artemisia's passion for her painting. Some of the other descriptions and conversations may have been superficial, but the description of the art, the act of painting and Artemisia's yearning to paint was deep and moving. Her desire to paint brought her ultimate happiness and deep pain at the same time. The colors were vivid and clear and I felt like I was seeing the beauty in the art with her. When I finished the book, I immediately looked up some of her art on the internet just to be able to witness it with my own eyes.<BR>I also especially enjoyed Artemisia's relationship with Graziela. It was one filled with unconditional love and overwhelming wisdom. Graziela's words were touching and filled with a beauty that I can only wish to posess.<BR>I definitely recommend this book. It is quick and easy to read.  Its title most certainly reflects the true depth and expression of this talented painter.	2002-07-16

Recently, I am into reading books with historical references that cover eras gone by. I thought a book about England at the turn-of-the-century would be interesting. <BR>Halfway through, I remember thinking to myself that this book was going nowhere. Each of the characters spoke independently of one another in a kind of diary format. Little snippets of the story were weaved together as each character told their version of the tale. The absence of a single narrator left me feeling as if I were just a spectator in the lives of these people; I felt like I never had the opportunity to get close to any of them. Their stories seemed short and lackluster. <BR>Fortunately, just as I was thinking about putting this book away, some excitement began. The last third of the novel had more action and drama, but not of a topic that I felt was compelling (at least, for me).  This sudden whirlwind of action ended in tragedy and sadness, which seemed to be an underlying theme throughout. For lack of a better way to express myself, everyone always seemed so depressed-even when things were going well. As I read the book and pictured the scenes before me, I always seemed to imagine them in black and white images; I was unable to find any color in the story (if that makes sense).<BR>I did manage to finish the book and do admit to enjoying it to some small degree. If you haven't read either of Chevalier's novels yet, I do recommend reading Girl with a Pearl Earring first. It was, by far, her better effort and achievement and thoroughly enjoyable. While Falling Angels is not on the top of my personal list, it seems as though many others found it to be a good piece of work. However, reading it first may not give you the true feel for this author's capabilities.	2002-04-30
US	49716357	R3AXMIIDAUPMMR	0345416260	21574649	Pope Joan: A Novel	Books	5	71	76	N	Y	A Papal mystery	I just finished this book and loved it! I was alittle skeptical to continue when I first started it as I am easily upset about references to torture and medieval lifestyles. I am so glad that I continued reading. Unfortunately, the scenes of torture and representations of women as being lowlier than dogs was fact in this era (ninth century) and an important part of the story. They provided the basis for understanding what drove Joan to make the decision to live her life as a man. She was a woman filled with a passion for learning and exploring all that life had to offer the men of her time, but was forbidden for women to know. She was brave in the face of danger, had a keen and intelligent mind, and yet always exhibited an underlying femininity as she nurtured the sick, the poor and the children and when she spoke of her love, Gerold. She not only wanted to better her own life, but was committed to helping those around her as well.<br />I am not Catholic and was completely unaware of her so-called legend. It is still debated as to whether or not she existed; some believe that the Catholic Church has deliberately removed her from any records of the time to avoid having to deal with the embarrassment of her rise to be Pope (the author spends a short time at the end of the book presenting this debate). I, for one, want to believe she existed. She represents all that is good in people and proves that we can attain our goals if we truly believe in them.<br />Definitely, recommended reading!	2002-04-30
US	49716357	R2BMIFPWDG9EAB	0743427149	427242449	The Twentieth Wife: A Novel	Books	4	7	7	N	N	An historical soap opera	To sum it up quickly: this is the ULTIMATE soap opera. It would make a great movie! Mehrunnisa's life was filled with happiness, family warmth, sadness and tragedy, abuse, and most importantly, an all-encompassing passion for life and the love of her life, Emperor Jahangir. As overwhelming as her life seemed at times, I never found myself disbelieving its events. I felt as if I was drawn into her time and place right along next to her. I am unfamiliar with her real-life story or this time and place in history (this is historical fiction), but find myself wanting to learn more about her and this era.<BR>The only downfall of this book was the constant introduction of new characters with difficult Indian and Persian names. Characters' names changed as they attained different status in the empire and the author liberally uses common Indian terms and references. Although I think these terms and names only added to the authenticity of the story, I found it confusing at times and I had to slow down many times just to figure out the pronunciation of or the identity of the character. Thankfully, the author has added a glossary and family tree of the characters to help.<BR>To those of you who enjoyed &quot;The Red Tent&quot; or &quot;Queenmaker,&quot; this should probably be on your &quot;to read&quot; list as well. Very similar storylines. A pleasant and entertaining book and definitely recommended.<BR>P.S. I hear there is a sequel in the works-can't wait.	2002-04-11

I can't say that it was a masterpiece, but there was definitely something about it that captured me. The mysterious path that each individual story lead me down kept me wanting to turn to the next story to learn of its relationship to the previous one. Some of the vignettes were definitely better than others (and I especially enjoyed them as they went further back in history), but I enjoyed the &quot;quickness&quot; of each story and meeting each new character. Any monotony with a particular character might be quickly replaced by an entirely new character. The insights of &quot;the girl&quot; in the last story were especially compelling. <BR>My only difficulty with this book, and the reason that I bought it after borrowing it from the library, is that I need to read it over again and reexamine the stories' connections (in praise of the author, I have never considered reading another book twice). The book, as a whole, tells the story from present to past; however, each  individual story takes place in it's own present time or is a short journey forward in time. At times I found this confusing and often found myself thumbing back through a previous story just to understand their relationship. I would have loved for the author to have spent more time telling about the actual transfer of the painting between each story's characters instead of the keeping the stories so distinctly separate. <BR>On the whole, I would definitely recommend reading this book. It is pleasant and enjoyable and a quick read. A short escape from the present.	2002-02-19

Over the course of my first six months on the diet I lost the 20lbs I had intended and my cholesterol level dropped 60 points!!!!  It is over a year later, and while I am not as strict as I initially was, the weight has stayed off and I follow the basic diet principles every day! I have learned so much about the importance of proper eating and have been greatly motivated to continue investing in my health.<BR>The book, itself, is easy to read and follow. I have heard some people say that they found Suzanne's personal stories and photos alittle too \\"mushy\\" and unnecessary, but I found them pleasant and a nice way to break the monotoned script that so many diet books seem to present. <BR>I have since \\"turned on\\" many friends to this diet-although I seem to have had the most success. I have since bought her subsequent diet books as well and have found them equally as motivating. I am forever in debt to Suzanne (my friends laugh when I say this) for presenting this diet and book to us.	2002-02-19
US	49716357	RVM5FSN2M4AZ4	0761520821	74391915	Natural Health Bible: From the Most Trusted Source in Health Information, Here is Your A-Z Guide to Over 200 Herbs, Vitamins, and Supplements	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A must-have for your refernece library	This was the first book I purchased when I decided to &quot;get into&quot; herbs and supplements. I was looking for a concise, yet thorough, book of herbs and the ailments best treated by each. I wanted as much information as possible about the pros and cons of each herb, interactions and contradictions-not just a listing of the popular uses for each herb. While this book doesn't provide &quot;how-to&quot; recipes for salves, tinctures, teas, etc., it does give the beginner a great basis for understanding herbal uses and options in a very easy and user-friendly format. It has everything I was looking for in an herbal referenece book and it IS my bible. It has whet my appetite for more herbal reading material and possibly a career in herbal health. Recommend!!	2001-08-09
