Mitchell takes apart the Big Bang Theory in a careful, methodical manner, turning nearly all the data scientists think actually proves the Big Bang happened. Mitchell examines red shifts and the sacred Hubble constant; he examines the age of white dwarfs (many as old as 20 billion years, older than the age of the universe); he discusses, for the first time, the age and life-cycles of galaxies and how these cycles cover tens of billions of years; he examines the nature of entropy and finally concludes that the universe has been in a steady-state for perhaps billions upon billions of years, infinite in all directions. Mitchell, of course, is ignored, pilloried, and excoriated by mainstream scientists, but he is also one of the few who have chosen to challenge mainstream ideas that are held just because they are comfortable. I recommend this book highly to anyone who is interested in where astronomy, physics, and cosmology might be headed in the 21st century, if anyone other that Halton Arp and William Mitchell, finds the courage to go against the contemporary grain.	2004-09-01

Lately his writing seems to be an exercise in sleepwalking. He can write so well that he doesn't need to put things in such as plot or characterization. He's done this in Alien Years and half a dozen recent books. Roma Eterna has two to three good novellas in them; the rest is blather. In fact, two of the middle stories (published in Asimov's no less) have no real science fictional content and are basically expository: someone is telling the reader of a story someone told _them_. There is little dialogue in this collection; mostly it's just Silverberg adroitly peppering his narrative with details he's gleaned from books about ancient Rome. Time and time again Silverberg seems to crank out passable stories and novels that will get published just because of his name's cachet.  (Like Greg Bear, Orson Scott Card and Harry Turtledove, three more lazy writers.)  <br /> <br />Having said all this, you can't beat the Silverberg of the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Man, he was good back then. He wrote novels that were quirky and new . . . and now he just coasts.  In Roma Eterna, he's just coasting, coasting, coasting . . . .	2004-08-01

What's missing are the facts of a third world war: the collapsing world economies, the broken alliances, the failed currencies, the disrupted food delivery systems, the millions of refugees in Europe, the panic in the streets, the police crackdowns, the political chaos at home and abroad. Presidents aren't mentioned; diplomatic efforts aren't mentioned. It's all rather clinical. Ships are blown up, planes are hidden behind interesting displays of chaff, subs sneak around each other, and all the characters speak the same, act the same and are one-hundred percent military (except for the occasional Soviet rapist). In this novel, China doesn't take advantage of the situation to invade Taiwan or Japan and absolutely no one thinks of the nuclear option. The Azerbijani terrorists who started the war (out of a private spat with the Soviets in their region) are never mentioned, nor are any of the other Soviet satellite countries, most of which are Islamic republics and, as it turned out, absolutely hated the Soviets. They aren't given any further role in this novel. Clancy gets all the gizmos and hardware right, with some nice surprises. But I felt Clancy wasted a good opportunity to examine the horrors of war, REAL war, and instead focused on the sexy hardware and what it might do if turned loose on the Soviets. This novel read like a giant game of RISK and seemed oddly bloodless by the end.	2004-07-20

Here you have a school (or a series of schools) for gifted children beset by government officials or self-appointed vigilantes who want either to kill them outright or put them in \\"camps\\", as in the X-Men movie. I kept expecting adamantine claws to extend from a character's hands to slice up a bad guy (but that never happened). I tried to push the images of Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Children out of my mind, but I couldn't do it. The writing is competent, but the drama is flat. The other lasting criticism I have of both books together (Darwin's Radio and Darwin's children) is that the specialness or unique qualities of the new children aren't made all that clear. Perhaps this will come in the last novel of the series. As it is, there are far greater classics of mutants in the genre.  It's hard to beat Van Vogt, Stapelton, and Sturgeon who've already done it better.	2004-06-07

It's a perfect follow-up to the other books in the series, and it may very well be one of the greatest fantasy series ever written. Mr. Card is simply the best writer of his generation and perhaps one of the best in the world. I believe that this book will garner Mr. Card hundreds of thousands of more fans than he already has. I loved this book; I was enthralled all the way through. I even bought three copies to pass along to friends. This book will change your life and make you a fan . . . if you aren't already one.	2003-11-12

It's been hailed as a literary masterpiece and it probably is. However, the book has no plot. There is no real sense of &quot;conflict&quot; that drives the characters. There is no real &quot;resolution&quot; to what passes for plot in LITTLE, BIG. No real character growth or epiphanies in the end.<br />What is exceptional about this book is, as everyone has pointed out, the stellar quality of the actual writing. Its almost a 700 page lyrical poem. Because it has no plot, you can open the book anywhere and start reading, set it aside, open it up tomorrow at a different place and it won't make any difference to your comprehension of the story. No one chapter is contingent on the chapter that precedes it. No one chapter ever really resolves anything.<br />Also its fantasy elements are very few and far between. Only Crowley's prose style keeps the fantasy element alive just by the lyrical nature of the writing itself. You _know_ you're in a fantasy world; but much of the time nothing ever really happens and very little of the novel stays with you after you're done. <br />Yet, this is a book to be recommended, if only as a sui generis type of literary fantasy. I think Crowley wanted to write something like Garcia Marquez's ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE, but overshot the goal in LITTLE, BIG. (He certainly can't match Garcia Marquez's gift for the fantastic.)  <br />I can't tell you how often I wanted the book just to end . . . and how many times it could have ended at any one place but didn't. Honestly I can't say that I enjoyed this book.  But I was impressed by it.	2003-09-19

I'm in the latter category. Despite the excellent quality of the writing--which made this book a quick read--the plot is all a jumble. At first it's a story about dinosaur hunters. Then it becomes a political/religious thriller involving sabotage by conservative religious terrorists (a subplot that is very quickly abandoned as if Swanwick didn't want to go there). Then it becomes a typical time-travel paradox novel with aliens in the future testing human beings &quot;in the field&quot;. <br />The problem here is that a group gets stranded in the early Triassic and rather than face the ugly fact that they'll be stranded there forever, they set about to &quot;do science&quot;. Meanwhile in the future, a rescue effort takes its time being mounted. And even though the future people literally have all the time in the world to rescue the stranded group, Swanwick stretches the novel out unbearably with unrealiztic characterization and wasted SF tropes.  Then the conclusion is one of these: this is what happens to character A; this is what happens to character B; and so on.<br />Swanwick is a fantastic writer but this isn't one of his best efforts.  I did like the Bird People though, particularly their noncommunicative arrogance.	2003-09-17

One descends from the postromantic lyric, the other from Black Mountain (by way of the Pisan Cantos) where only language (not content, not anecdote) counts. This collection contains mostly poems by poets who have an extraordinary gift for free-association. Very few of these poems make any contextual sense and fewer still make any _grammatical_ sense. Are these the \\"best\\" poems of 2002?  Not by a country mile.  In fact, try imagining readers in 2050 reading this book.  How many of these poems will endure?  How many will resonate in the minds of the average college student fifty years hence?  To be sure, choosing the \\"best\\" of anything is always a reflection of the editor, but Mr. Creeley has lost all sense of judiciousness and cultural perspective here.  Most of the choices here are simply incomprehensible.  They are the random babblings of massively gifted poets with little or nothing to say.  And what little they do have to say is unmemorable.  Blah.	2003-09-10

It's exceedingly well-written, very well paced, and richly envisioned. It's also a bit underachieved for the Silverberg most of us know and love whose masterpieces of SF in the Sixties and Seventies still resonate in out minds. <br />On the other hand, as a stand-alone novel (and boy do we need more of these), this book is a very pleasant read and for readers new to Silverberg, THE LONGEST WAY HOME is a good place to start.  (I gave this book only three stars because I know that Silverberg can do much better.)	2003-08-13

Basically, this is a no-holds-barred space adventure of a group on Moon-based scientists who attempt to curtail an alien invasion. A giant &quot;halo&quot; flies through the solar system and seeds the earth with globes that stultify the human mind. The Moon Men act as a team and travel to the source of the halo in the second half of the book. My only complaint is that the book seemed to be a compression of two novels. I guess Bantam wasn't into series back in the mid-1980s when this book came out. I'd have loved to see both halves expanded. Great book. Track it down if you can.	2003-06-19

But Niven's writing style is very disjointed and erratic; it has none of the polish that his novels with Jerry Pournelle (and Steve Barnes) have. It's as if Niven is writing with a wink and a nod to his huge fan base--the wink being for \\"in\\" jokes and a nod given to the hard-core fan who understands what he's writing about. He writes in such a way as to leave things out, such as transitional phrases or descriptions, assuming (I think) that the reader will fill in the rest. This was an awful book in a great package. Tor seems to be doing this lately: great packages for lousy novels (Card is one, Williamson is another).	2003-06-19

Like a lot of &quot;novels&quot; that are jury-rigged around extended short stories, this one has all the weaknesses and few of the strengths that other such novels have. (The best novel of this kind is Fred Pohl's Years of the City, a clear masterpiece.) I found the only good section of this book to be the first. It sets up a remarkable premise and sets about unfolding it rather well. But by the time the book ends, you really don't know who is who and the far future earth seems more like modern-day Africa. Not a single imaginative trope in sight.<br />This would be an excellent first book, however. Unfortunately, it isn't. The five star ratings this book has received clearly are given to the man and not the work. This isn't a good place to start with one's reading of Jack Williamson.	2003-05-06

In fact, there's nothing to these poems at all and the people listed here who've liked the book are only fooling themselves. Indeed, claiming that they understand these poems is another way of patting themselves on the back and I would really love to see any one of Jorie's (many) sycophants write a considered, analytical paper extoling (or even making sense of) the virtues of this book. I am not an frivolous reader or a superficial one and these poems don't cut it. This is an absolutely unreadable book of poems by a poet whose entire reputation rests solely on the advocacy of lone-wolf critic Helen Vendler. These are, quite simply, bad poems. Avoid this book at all costs.	2003-05-02

I give it three stars for the stellar quality of the actual writing style Mr. Reynolds possesses. But the novel's plot is exceedingly complex; characters come and go with astonishing rapidity; and the chapter units are far too short and clipped to sustain any kind of interest over the long haul. And it is a long haul.<br />Like Vernor Vinge and a number of others (Peter Hamilton, Dan Simmons, Stephen Baxter) Mr. Reynolds crams in all kinds of science fiction conceits and mysteries as if we're watching a juggler trying to juggle as many balls as he can when he only cares how good he looks while doing it.  Instead, a few less balls in the air might have made for a better performance. The ideas came fast and furious in this book, but what annoyed me more was Reynolds' habit of writing only a page or two on one character then shifting to another just as the action was getting interesting. He does this so much that after a while all tension falls from the book. I got about halfway through the book before I finally got tired of it and put it down.<br />I suppose that to new readers of SF \\"Revelation Space\\" will appear like a breath of fresh air, but it's really not all that good or memorable. But, boy, can Reynolds write. I give him that.	2003-04-24

(Quality))	Books	2	6	10	N	N	Eccentric Choices from Editors Who Should Know Better	Naturally the judgments of the casual reader are often attended with sneers of contempt by those in the know. Those in the know, know that Silverberg and Haber are very able editors, writers, and extremely nice people. But about half of these stories are not only among the year's worst, some actually don't make any sense at all. The odd choices are Robert Reed's \\"Coelacanths\\" and Orson Scott Card's \\"Angles.\\" The Reed story is one of those intentionally confusing stories that compels the reader to \\"figure out\\" what's going on--as if readers really enjoy doing that, particularly when the reader is never, ever told, even in the end. Were the human beings in the story actually \\"bacteria\\" living on the surface of one character's bicuspid? Were they microminiaturized and living in multi-dimensions? I read the story twice and I still never understood where this was taking place or why. The Card story, published on his website (which means it was probably rejected by all other magazines), is part lecture about parallel universes and part story with obscurely elitist overtones. Only the last three pages make any kind of sense whatsoever. (I thought, in structure, \\"Angles\\" was trying to do what Harlan Ellison did so expertly in his story \\"Deathbird\\" of a decade ago.) Then there's the opening story by Charles Stross called \\"Tourist,\\" an over-written, hyper-cyberpunk story that must have been included because of Mr. Stross' clear control of the English language. It's also a story that attempts to out-cyber William Gibson. But sparkly, techno-hip lanugage does not necessarily a techno-hip story make.<br />The truly great stories here are those by Brian Aldiss, Christopher Priest, and Geoffrey A. Landis. Indeed, the Landis might even be a classic of a kind. It's an old-fashioned John W. Campbell Jr. romp about conflicting ideologies regarding individualism and a great chase through relativistic space across the centuries. It's also very economically written and drew me right in.<br />But overall the anthology is very uneven and inexplicably eccentric. Like all other anthologists, Silverberg and Haber are mostly spotlighting their friends and not looking to publish the ACTUAL best stories of the year. (What a concept!) Card may be the success story of the year (perhaps the decade, and some would say of the century), but his contribution is easily his weakest story here and probably should have remained on his website. It was, however, the reason I bought this anthology in the first place. <br />I recommend buying any other collection but this, especially if the Landis is in it. Oh, one other thing: Be advised: there are only three SHORT stories in this collection. All others are Novella or Novelette length, a lot less bang for your buck.	2003-04-04

Wilson's strengths are his ideas and storytelling style.  He's not flashy or rushed and I found Chronoliths his best book to date, and the best book of the year. I won't repeat what others here have said in praise of the book, nor will I dwell on what might be perceived as its weaknesses (many people didn't like the inconclusiveness of the ending).  I will say that I happened to like the inconclusiveness of the ending because in life some things remain mysterious.  <br />More importantly, Mr. Wilson has come up with an original time-travel concept and stayed with it.  I believe this book to be a contemporary SF classic and recommend it over just about everything that's being written today.  It's not a sexy book, just a well-written, thoughtful meditation on communication with the future and communication with those we love.  Well done, Bob.	2003-03-17

Upon reading it in a day and a half I realized that all Card is doing now is cranking out product that his legions of fans will buy automatically without thinking. I was once one of those fans, when Card was an &quot;automatic buy&quot;.<br />About SHADOW PUPPETS: There's hardly a &quot;there&quot; there. Despite the heavy &quot;portentiousness&quot; of the writing (you can tell Card is writing &quot;literature&quot;), the plot seems contrived and the characterization thin and the novel is over all too soon. Card, by now, is a multi-millionaire and a movie of ENDER'S GAME is coming out soon; but right now, with this unexceptional book, it just seems that Card is abusing his fans by cranking out a book based on characters that should have been put to rest long ago.<br />I know this review will offend Card's followers, but I'm not writing these words to offend anyone. (And I know I won't persuade a single Card reader.) This is just my opinion, the opinion of a former true-beliver. (I've even read his Mormon books.) My advice to Mr. Card would be to write a decade of stand-alone novels such as PASTWATCH or A PLANET CALLED TREASON or HART'S HOPE. If he did, he might get people like me back. But I don't think he will. There's too much gold in them thar hills and Card was never one to turn away from a gold mine. (Perhaps no one would. But Card's weathly enough now to do anything he wants. And I want the old Card back. Not the new one. Not the superstar. I want the hungry writer of Analog stories of old.)	2002-09-10

Learning to &quot;stalk&quot; the self, learning to achieve equilibrium in a world full of petty tyrants (including the petty tyrant of the &quot;self&quot;) are among the most trenchant lessons Castaneda provides us.  This book is the place to start with Castaneda and you'll even find within it Don Juan doing magical passes 25 years before Castaneda finally admitted there were such things.

He's taken with a lot of star power and evidently lets a writer's prestige be the only criterion for inclusion in his anthologies. Most of these stories are competently written, but they lack spark, that sense of wonder that used to fill the field until about 15 years ago. It's like a lot of rock music these days: great talent with nothing much to say.  How some of these stories made it into a &quot;year's best&quot; book is beyond me, but one thing is clear. The science fiction field is running dry.  No story here has a decent (or even a twist) ending.  Nothing here is genuinely memorable.  I so much wanted these anthologies to be a counterpoint to the drab Dozois anthologies, but they aren't.  If this is the best we can do, then I'd say we're in trouble.

I've read everything she's written . . . up to now. I was unable to finish THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE and it's taken me a while to figure out why. Beattie's voice in this novel is so bland and noncommittal that almost every sentence challenges the reader to continue. I got about 75 pages into the book and still didn't know the characters well, or even some of their names, let alone what they looked like. I didn't even know what the novel itself was about by page 75 or why I should care enough about these characters to continue on reading. Also missing here is the author's famous wit and her keen observations of contemporary life. Most telling of all, this novel really highlights Beattie's lack of dialog skill. Her characters speak as if they know they're in a novel. Nothing here smacks of reality. The book is an extraordinary bore.<br />That said, I still remain a fan. Her last book of stories, PERFECT RECALL, was nearly faultless. If you are starting here with Ann Beattie, don't. You will get all the wrong impressions. Try her stories before moving to her novels. There, she excells.	2002-03-27

What's extraordinary is that the book has no plot and it has two graphic male... \\"love\\" scenes that serve no point other than they fill space. They certainly don't advance or enhance the story, what little there is of it, and it tells us nothing about the character of China Mountain Zhang other than he likes boys and not girls.

Part of the problem is that it's hard to sympathize with the trials of a visual artist when (the author's use of) language simply fails to convey the uniqueness of the main character's art.  That said, it's just as hard to imagine the intelligence of molecule-sized nanobots in Chry's head.  They think, speak and emote exactly like humans, but humans are what they are because their brains are made up of densely-packed molecules, billions upon billions of them.  I just couldn't buy this conceit.  The plot is trivial--and in places makes no sense whatsoever.  You can have more fun with Greg Bear's much more original story, \\"Blood Music\\".	2002-01-29

These stories seem to encompass everything middle America became after the 1970s, about the time of O'Hara's death.  O'Hara has a simple writing style that nonetheless captures the complexities in human relations, to say nothing of the complications of human sexuality.  His characters were &quot;shacking&quot; up long before the sexual revolution of the 1960s and he was one of the first of the modern writers to show us the destructiveness of alcohol and the terrors of small-minded people that surround us all with their bitter stench of failure.  These novellas catch him at his best and you'll never forget &quot;Andrea&quot;.	2002-01-14

Many of these poems are first-draft indulgences, collected in a helter-skelter manner.  This book would clearly not have been published in America, nor could it have gotten past many of the poetry manuscript contests here.  Reading is best at keeping his mouth shut (&quot;Alert!&quot;, a poem several pages in length should have never been written, let alone published) and his thoughts mysterious.  And if there is a failure here, it's in Reading's lack of an editor (an editor who is also a ruthless critic).  Every writer needs one, Reading more than most.	2002-01-14

Here we have an excellent &quot;primer&quot; for late 20th century science fiction. About half the stories are clear &quot;masterpieces&quot; while those closer to our own time seem merely to be Card's favorites. The Lloyd Biggle Jr. story is an example. Biggle was a fine writer in his time, but is he high enough to have a story listed with the 26 greatest sf stories of all time? I don't think so. The greatest anthology of clear &quot;masterpieces&quot; was Robert Silverberg's SCIENCE FICTION HALL OF FAME, Volume One. It ends in 1964 but captures the very essence of sf in its infancy under the influence of John W. Campbell. Card is less enamored of the 1930s and 1940s. It's the 1980s and 1990s that interest him. That's where all his friends are--and some of them are in this book.  (And no one has yet to beat the Asimov/Greenburg Great SF Stories that DAW published years ago.) Still, this anthology is a good read, especially for the younger fan . . . which is the audience Card has always aimed for.	2001-12-31

But I couldn't finish this book. Card is beating the same dead horse over and over again: talented, but abused children rise up to best their betters (grown-ups) and win the day. However, I couldn't help but get the impression that Card's just writing to fulfull a contract or to wring as much blood out of the Ender turnip as he can. I never believed that these characters were children, nor could I get into their plight. I think I've out-grown Mr. Card's universe (as well as his turgid writing style). Mr. Card is writing pulp now. Perhaps he will improve with his Biblical fiction. That seems to be where his heart is anymore.	2001-09-25

King's basic weakness as a writer is that he provides the reader with EVERY thought the protagonist has at EVERY turn of the story. This pushes what could have been a basically sound story at maybe 350 pages to an almost 700 overly-packed monster. King is better when he is working short and concise, as in FIRESTARTER, DEAD ZONE, and the stories in FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT. Only die-hard fans of King will like this book. But for me, I ended up skimming the last half. And I _hate_ doing that. I like to honor the words writers write, but I don't like writers who are thieves of time--_my_ time.	2001-08-13

CALCULATING GOD has quite a few good ideas about God (the aliens here are trying to find the hand of God in evolution), but nothing here isn't dealt with in a freshman level college philosophy class. But the biggest problem I had was the trivial plotting and the point of view shifts. He has two American red-necks, one named (of course) Cooter, who shoot up a fossil exhibit, both of whom are one-dimensional at best. However, the main character is dying of cancer and you'd expect a less energetic narrative from such a man (and certainly more self-pity); but no, Sawyer just plods happily along. (I envisioned the character looking like the smiling picture of the author on the back cover.) This wasn't a good book at all and seems, in the end, to have been something Sawyer just knocked off to get some money out of Tor. The last thing that galled me were the constant references to all things Canadian. Sawyer never explained why the aliens chose the Royal Ontario Museum to land at, out of all the great (and greater) museums in the world. Sawyer appears to want to constantly remind the reader of Canada's importance the way Orson Scott Card hawks all things Mormon and Harlan Ellison hawks ... well, all things Harlan Ellison. Read FLASH-FORWARD, Sawyer's clear masterpiece and avoid this book entirely.	2001-07-23
US	52481040	RO0L4GBEJVLIE	0061091316	56455717	Lost Boys	Books	1	13	16	N	N	Not really horror, not really mainstream	By now we all know that this book is a loose autobiography of Card's life in the early 1980s when he had, for a while, to write computer manuals. LOST BOYS does a good job detailing the  foibles of a young Mormon family. In fact, the first half, which is almost completely devoid of any traditional &quot;horror&quot; elements, is expertly written and not a word is wasted. But about halfway through, it's as if Card suddenly realizes that this testimony must be &quot;about something&quot;. So here he starts throwing in his creepy moments. But these moments are too spread out to sustain any tension in the narrative. As traditional horror-genre tropes, they don't build on one another, so when the &quot;lost boys&quot; of the novel finally do appear, I was left saying &quot;huh?&quot; Card just cannot master Stephen King's technique and he fails miserably as a horror writer. (LOST BOYS was originally marketed as a horror novel though it says &quot;fiction&quot; on the spine. This is because Card is trying to switch over from science fiction to mainstream writing where the big money is. Which is strange since he's a millionaire twice over and ENDER'S GAME is being made into a movie.) What LOST BOYS does do quite admirably is show the Mormon way of life. However, Step and his wife DeAnne are too perfect to be believable, DeAnne especially. Clearly modeled after Card's wife, DeAnne is the perfect mother/wise woman who knows her husband's deepest thoughts and knows her role implicity. And some scenes are in the book just to flesh out the Mormon elements--the home teaching scenes, the long, drawn-out Mormon baptism scene, etc. Card, a writing teacher himself, should know that _every_ sentence, every paragraph _must_ be relevant to the novel as a whole. Huge sections of the book could have easily been cut or condensed in LOST BOYS, but then bestsellers these days have to be 600 pages long to be any good. I didn't like this book and it just confirms a notion I've had for a longtime that Card is clearly a competent writer but he's just as clearly overrated. But Card is now review-proof and people just keep buying his books. As for me--a member of the clear minority--I'm through with Card.	2001-06-24

In fact, Ruiz captures the most important concepts toward the end: the ego as parasite. Castaneda called it the &quot;foreign installation&quot;, but it's a crucial concept because the Four Agreements wears away at the parasite. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it if you don't want to explore Castaneda. (If you do, I recommend Journey to Ixtlan and Tales of Power.

I had never read anything by Linda Nagata before and lately I've shied away from thick SF (and fantasy) books, books that are hundreds and hundreds of pages thick because publishers know books hundreds and hundreds of pages thick sell. (That's why nearly all the SF and fantasy bestsellers are overwritten by hundreds of pages.) VAST, however, needed the space to tell its fascinating story. It's a genuinely brilliant novel. VAST is also one of a dying breed: an SF novel in the John W. Campbell tradition. (This book in some ways reminded me of early Van Vogt and E.E. Doc Smith, two of Campbell's greatest writers.) The science is credible, but more credible are the characters who are off on an interstellar mission that's truly mindboggling. You really don't need to read the earlier books in the series. VAST eventually fills you in on what had happened earlier to the characters. Lovely book. I highly recommend VAST to you.	2001-02-19

Science fiction has been undergoing a crisis in imagination even while its writers are getting better at their prose styles. Mr. Sawyer has produced in FLASHFORWARD an delightfully original concept and a gathering of characters, flawed though they are, and we watch them as their lives are changed by a glimpse they receive of the future. Sawyer has restored my faith that Campbellian science fiction can still be written with panache and verve. FLASHFORWARD is a delightful book that surprised me almost with every turn of the page. I very much recommend this book to you.	2001-02-12

Science fiction is more to my taste, but I really liked THINKING OF YOU. It has all of Cook's plotting genius, plus several of his more interesting characters. The Moon Man is simply the best. But Cook has really pegged the California lifestyle. The story concerns a woman, a psychologist, who learns, through her clients and her own experience, that there may be a group of people in her town who are engineering the lives of everyone else in town. Why becomes the mystery. And the ending ... well, Cook is the master of the switcheroo. Witness the end to THE ENGINES OF DAWN. It's here that THINKING OF YOU _almost_ become science fiction. For sure it would make one hell of a good movie. The one problem I had was with its cover. It looks like a romance, but it isn't.	2001-01-03

The problem he faces is that his books, always excellently conceived, usually peter out by the end. As in BIOS, the characters are basically victims of a (well-conceived) planetary environment, the &quot;bios&quot; of the title. The characters are mostly stock and are removed from the novel one by one in such a way as to give the impression that the book has no real plot. It just ends, leaving me with the impression, &quot;Is that all there is?&quot; To Mr. Wilson's credit, the book is excellently written and the sci-fi elements all credible and in place. It's not a bad read, but I wanted more &quot;novelistic&quot; elements threaded throughout the book. I wanted a plot.	2000-12-16

Basically, the book involves two people who are after a piece of information that may or may not be hardwired into a mysterious computer supposedly able to predict Condition Venus. The novel takes place entirely on a disney riverboat on the Seine with LOTS of descriptions of rooms, furniture, food, clothing, textures, flowers and plants, ENDLESS descriptions that merely show Spinrad's affection of all things French. Then there are the obligatory sex scenes, the kind that used to shock in the 1970s, Spinrad's heyday, but now only seem infantile. (Authors should know by now that sex is not the be-all and end-all of a person's life and that some readers prefer other aspects of characterization from their authors.) The one thing the sex scenes certainly do is take up space. There isn't much of a plot and not much of a conclusion. And while much of the writing is gorgeous, many aspects of the novel were just smug--as if the world within which the novel was taking place was, in the end, a joke and that the characters were fools. Spinrad (like Harlan Ellison) seems only interested in showing the reader how clever he is. I never understood the Big Blue Machine or the Bad Boys. I liked the disneys and the white tornados, real or imagined. But it just wasn't enough, in the end, to do much for me. It was like walking through a Louis XIV drawing room with lots of flowers and paintings and ornate furniture and not much else of interest.	2000-12-02

Its thesis,  that complex life similar to life on the Earth, is probably very rare in  the galaxy, if not the universe. The authors meticulously build a case for  Earth's special place in the cosmos, showing how bacterial life might be  common but that anything bigger than simple organisms might not be able to  survive the ravages of time and comets and wandering axial tilt. As other  readers have pointed out, this doesn't necessarily mean that silicon-based  life or some other kind of life can't exist in the universe, but it does  demonstrate that Fermi's Dilemma might in fact be true. As a science  fiction writer, I was stunned at how much this book could change the way  science fiction is written. No more Star Trek universes with complex life  in every system, no more &quot;federations&quot; or &quot;foundations&quot;  or &quot;assemblies&quot; of thousands of inhabited worlds. According to  the thesis Ward and Brownlee present, habitable worlds might be few and far  between. Humans may very well find no other worlds beyond the Earth upon  which to live. RARE EARTH will make it difficult to read books or watch  movies that envision a galaxy filled with wonderful and curious creatures,  where humans spread out across the galaxy as if they were so many islands  in Polynesia. And if the Rare Earth hypothesis is true, then we are also  obliged to get our act together here and now if we are going to become a  space-going species. I think this book puts a lot of science fiction  writers out of business. It certainly makes a lot of science fiction,  including my own, seem downright silly.	2000-09-05

Most  of the reviewers here have been women and they have elevated Ms. Shinn to  the ranks of bestsellerdom because of her leanings toward Romance. To her  credit Shinn's protagonist has a bit more assertiveness that the usual  female lead in sf novels, but that is all given up when she achieves what  she's after in the end.

Thus her poems have all the touches of William  Wordsworth's &quot;emotion recollected in tranquility&quot; but lack the  immediacy of the real perils Rosa Parks and her comrades experienced. There  is some brilliant writing here; but now the patina of political correctness  is wearing thin. Ms. Dove, as all the Iowa City grads, has mastered that  somber, priestly, and overly-dramatic voice common to poets who've take on  the mantle of greatness and who presume to be the moral authorities in our  lives by telling us &quot;the truth&quot; and all things that &quot;truly  matter&quot;. This book reads as if it's destined to be another book of the  Bible, meant to last forever and meant to be the correct gloss on the  African-American experience. Instead, its pendantic solemnity returns its  focus over and over again to Ms. Dove's self-absorption and to the sad fact  that she is, in the final analysis, a person removed from history (by class  rather than race) and the mainstream of American life, black or white.	2000-06-13

To be sure, she has a few exhibitionistic friends along for the ride, but  the images Ms. Merritt has captured rarely transcend the merely salacious,  and seem, in the final result, just indulgent. Images such as those  contained in DIGITAL DIARIES can be found in almost any trendy magazine  (adult and otherwise)at any newsstand and, as such, they seem rather  uninspired. (Consider how Madonna's book SEX still, in some ways, shocks,  perhaps now that Madonna Louise is a mother.) Moreover, DIGITAL DIARIES  makes one wonder just what is being &quot;communicated&quot; in this  &quot;diary&quot;, what is actually revealed about the author. It has no  narrative thread (perhaps one is not possible) and that may not even be a  fault. But I think it all comes down to whether the reader has an interest  in a very attractive young woman's adventures in photographing herself  mostly in the bathroom.  Truth must be said, though, that many photographs  are quite artfully done. But in the final analysis, DIGITAL DIARIES is but  another document stemming from the narcissism of the 1990s. (Then, too, I  also wonder what kind of book DIGITAL DIARIES would be if Natacha Merritt  looked, instead, like Ed Asner. I don't think many of us would want to  spend $30 looking at photos of Ed Asner in the tub.)	2000-05-20

Mr. McDonell's story-telling abilities radiate in this bittersweet rendering of the genuinely wacky inhabitants of 19th century California--including a cast of  drunken Russian sailors and the historical Zorro, a sad figure if there  ever was one. And, of course, several hundred hilarious No See 'ums--real  and imagined. This is a very much neglected masterpiece. Read it and weep  with laughter.	1999-05-06
US	52481040	ROJ05AOJVUWGM	0345416872	281816523	Enchantment	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Card's ABSOLUTE VERY BEST	No one is doing in any genre of the publishing world (mainstream/sf/fantasy) what Mr. Card is doing. The mixture of fabulation, history, time-travel, and sheer magic pushes Mr. Card into the realm of  writers such as Italo Calvino, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Jorge Luis Borges  and John Fowles. His imaginative capacities are seemingly boundless, his  writing style absolutely engaging, first word to last. This is the  breakthrough novel for Mr. Card, pure and simple and should bring more  readers back to his other masterpiece, HART'S HOPE. If I wore a hat, I'd  take it off in a grand salute to this man and this masterpiece. (But no  sequels, please. Onward and upward!)	1999-04-07

Dubie's poetic vision approaches the mystical realm for the first time in this book  and shows definitively that Dubie's talent flows both broad and deep.	1999-02-11

Books	5	9	11	N	N	Well-written, succinct literary analysis	Dr. Helms covers new ground in this excellent literary deconstruction of  the Gospels. His goal is to see what we can learn of the actual authors of  the Gospels, then secondarily to see what we can logically deduce from  those findings. What's revealed is the human side of the fledgling Jesus  movement that will certainly remain controversial. Why no one else has done  this to the Gospels before is clearly a mystery. I highly recommend this  book for anyone at all curious as to who the writers of the Gospels might  really have been.	1998-09-20
