Ferguson's argument is that America is an empire, albeit a reluctant one.  He alludes to believing that this could be a good thing -- both for America and the world -- but often also shows how the costly running an empire really can be.  He concludes the book by stating \\"I believe the world needs an effective liberal empire and that the United States is the best candidate for the job.\\"<br /><br />But what makes his book extremely interesting is the historical context he uses.  Ferguson goes over so many of the U.S. large wars and tiny wars over the last 150 years.  He also draws many parallels to the British empire -- and shows how a great deal of their forays were not successful (both in terms of British and the colony's interest).<br /><br />The examples that most stared at me were the Philippines and Egypt -- where he draws parallels to Iraq.<br /><br />The first example is one that is often used.  America \\"liberated\\" the Philippines in the Spanish-American War and lost about 1000 lives conquering it (which was a very small amount for that day).  However, people in the Philippines were not content to just shake off one master and get a new one.  Over the next decade America lost another 4000 lives due to rebel activities on the islands.  The war and conquest, which in the beginning was extremely popular, became increasingly less so over time.  So much so that successive Presidents were trying to find a way out ... and fast.<br /><br />Egypt is an example I have not yet heard.  The British effectively took over Egypt in 1882 when the country's pro-British ruler was overthrown.  And though the British claimed on countless occasions that it wanted to leave Egypt as soon as possible, it was still ruling the country for the next 74 years.  In fact, in 1956, the year the British did leave (and only because the national purse could not afford it), the British still had over 80,000 troops on its Egyptian base -- which was a tract of land near the canal that was the size of Massachusetts!<br /><br />We learn from these examples that our transformation of Iraq is going to be enormously difficult and costly.  If odds makers were making bets (and some surely are), the odds would definitely be against us succeeding.  And Ferguson weaves in Americas huge debts (see Running On Empty by Pete Peterson) of unfunded liabilities to the tune of $45 trillion (!!!) make saving the world an increasingly difficult thing to do.<br /><br />Like Peterson's book, my outlook after finishing Colossus is one of decided gloom.  And gloom is generally not in my character.  Though I tend to be an eternal optimist and believe the world is becoming an increasingly better place, it is difficult to not see the enormous challenges that lay ahead of my generation.<br /><br />Summation: Colossus is a academic book, but very much worth reading.  I'd like to leave you one of Ferguson's key quotes from the book:<br /><br />\\"there are three fundamental deficits that together explain why the United States has been a less effective empire than its British predecessor.  They are its economic deficit, its manpower deficit and -- the most serious of the three -- its attention deficit.\\"tian base -- which was a tract of land near the canal that was the size of Massachusetts! <br /> <br />We learn from these examples that our transformation of Iraq is going to be enormously difficult and costly.

This book is one of the best books I have ever read. Ever.<br />It is certainly not an uplifting book. In three months, the Hutu power regime in Rwanda killed 800,000 minority Tutsis.<br />The book tries to answer the question of why genocide happens. what can compel one people, living side by side with another people for centuries, to rise up and mass kill? What drives Hutu, who's wife might be a Tutsi, to kill his wife's brother and mother? What drives mass rapes? What drives a man to hack up his neighbor into bits with a machete?<br />why does this happen?<br />Philip Gourevitch writes an amazing and detailed account of Rwanda and of its neighboring countries like Uganda and the Congo (formerly Zaire). Gourevitch has incredible access to the leaders of these countries and his &quot;man on the street&quot; interviews are extremely revealing and mind-expanding.<br />The book was given to me by a friend who said that I &quot;had to read this book!&quot; And it just sat on my bookshelf for a long time. After about a year, I dusted it off and read it. I am a better person for it.<br />Summation: Don't wait a year, read this book now.	2004-04-09

The book discusses the Algebra Project, an organization founded by 1960's civil rights leader Bob Moses, to teach algebra to kids in inner-cities and rural communities.<br />The beginning of the book reads like Moses' autobiography about his years organizing in Mississippi. He then discusses how groups like the Jews, Koreans, and Chinese relied on math as the basis for their upward mobility. Moses' theory is that as the world becomes more and more focused on technology and innovation, math will have an even greater importance.<br />Summation: Read this book -- it is very eye-opening.	2001-12-23

Hungtington's premise is that world alliances and conflicts will mostly develop and arise out of culture blocks.

He divides the world into nine distinct blocks: Western, Orthodox, South American, African, Islamic, Sinic, Buddhist, Hindu, and Japanese.<br />I don't quite agree with Hungtington as I see a global alignment divided around nation-states (UN), corporations, NGOs, and crime and terror sydicates.	2001-01-15

The book details the lives of five conservative activists (Bill Kristol, Ralph Reed, Clint Bolick, Grover Norquist, and David McIntosh) who shaped conservative thought and activism in the 1980s and 1990s.  Though I disagree with the positions of many of these conservative activists, their lives are fascinating.  Some are true romantics and others are completely Machiavellian.  All in all -- a great book for anyone who considers themselves (or aspires to be) an activist, a revolutionary, or someone that has a fire to make change.	2001-01-12

If you are a history buff like me, you'll love this book.  Allen Dulles, former lawyer, former diplomat, former OSS Operative, former President of the Council on Foreign Relations, for Director of the CIA (under Eisenhower and Kennedy), and brother of the Secretary of State (John Foster Dulles who the airport is named after), and member of the establishment -- this book is quite a treat.  It takes us through the post-WWI years and then through WWII where Dulles was stationed for OSS in Bern.  It then details the formation and escalation of the Cold War.  Grosse does a terrific job detailing Dulles's public and personal lives.  Highly recommended.	2000-12-26
