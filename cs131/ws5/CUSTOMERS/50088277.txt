Map of Bones Review<br /><br />The story starts when an army of masked intruders invade a service at a cathedral in Cologne Germany. Dressed in monks' clothes they gun down worshipers and clergy in a horrifying blood bath. They have not come for the churches treasures of artwork or gold, but for the bones of the three Magi who once paid homage to the baby Jesus. With this prize they plan to change the world!<br /><br />After reading \\"Ice Hunt\\" and \\"Sandstorm\\", I have certain expectations from Mr. Rollins, action-adventure, mystery, a wee bit of science-fiction, and maybe a love interest. His latest book \\"Map of Bones\\" certainly has all the usual things we come to expect; but the book reminded me of another book, what was it? It's unfortunate for Mr. Rollins that \\"Map of Bones\\" is being compared to the \\"DaVinci Code\\"; it seems lately anyone that writes about the \\"Knights of Templar\\" or the Catholic Church, they are immediately compared to Dan Brown. Sure, \\"DaVinci Code\\" was an excellent novel, but \\"Map of Bones\\" is just as good...but not for the reasons one might think.<br /><br />Although the book does refer a lot to the Catholic Church, Knights of Templar yada yada yada (see above), James shifted gears a little bit, and threw in some violence. I know what your thinking, \\"James Rollins is a sophisticated writer, he doesn't need violence in his books,\\" true, but in a post-DaVinci Code era, I am glad James turned up the violence a notch. Otherwise, \\"Map of Bones\\" would probably be another \\"DaVinci Clone\\" book that you see in the bargain bin at Barnes & Noble.<br /><br />As far as the characters, Gray, Rachel, Monk, and Vigor, they are all solid, character development and all; not an easy thing to do in an action novel. But the one character I love is Raoul, he's so evil! Yes, there are some cheesy lines from Raoul, but I don't care! What he does to Monk, oh man that is so wrong on so many levels!<br /><br />For those of you out there that complain that \\"Map of Bones\\" wasn't realistic, I have a new flash for you...\\"It's a book!\\" You know, suspend your disbelief just a wee bit? Ok, I'll get off my soap box; woe is me.Bones\\" wasn't realistic, I have a new flash for you...\\"It's a book!\\" You know, suspend your disbelief just a wee bit?

Rex, a hunted man and wife, a monk, an assassin, a young scientist, a rogue military operation, and a greedy (but not so smart) paleontologist? That's what Douglas Preston answers in his latest book, \\"Tyrannosaur Canyon.\\" There are many characters in the book, but all are memorial in their own right. Preston keeps the action moving with short chapters, and within each chapter are mini cliffhangers that lead to the next chapter.<br /><br />The chapters are short, about 2-3 pages, short and sweet. Those of you that find short chapters annoying; this book definitely has short chapters. I can only guess the reason for the short chapters are to keep pace of the book from losing momentum.<br /><br />I know I am reading a good book, when I start reading it and finish half the book from the first night reading it. To me that is a sign the author knows what he's doing. I just hate it when authors get way too deep into the science (or science-fiction) for pages and pages; some authors go into what I refer to as \\"lecture mode.\\" Yes I know, the devil is in the details, but if the author is not careful, the reader can lose interest. The science in the book does not go over anyone's head, as I mentioned before, Preston keeps it short and sweet.<br /><br />My only gripe, without giving out spoilers, was that there was a major character that was introduced way too late in the book. This character could have been in the story a little earlier, and Preston could have teased the reader a little bit more. For those of you that read the book, I am referring to the government agent in charge of the military operation.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is a fast paced action novel. There's a certain amount of predictability in the book, a kind of \\"oh I know where this is going...\\" but an entertaining book nonetheless. This is my first Douglas Preston book, and I'll be looking for books written by him from now on.ng for books written by him from now on.	2005-09-03

So here we are, the end of the Christ Clone Trilogy. Just to quickly recap the first two books:<br /><br />Book I - Was kind of disappointing, too much U.N. political rambling. Excellent premise, the actual cloning of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Book II - I took a chance, and decided to read the second book, and I wasn't disappointed. This book was a wild ride describing the asteroids, locusts, and the plagues.<br /><br />Book III - The plagues are not over, and things are not what they seem. This book is full of violence and blood and gore, and I am not kidding here. The blood and gore are necessary to describe the level of death and carnage that was inflicted on the earth.<br /><br />Those of you out there that are not particularly religious, but like to read an excellent story, I believe you will not be disappointed with these books.	2005-08-21

After reading the first book, and being a little disappointed, I decided to give book two a shot. It's not that the first book was bad, it just had too much back story regarding the political figures in the U.N., too much back story for me to even care. Book two centers around two profits that will bring death and destruction to planet Earth. Before Christopher can reveal himself of his true nature to the planet Earth, the atrocities brought on by the two profits will have to run their course, killing billions of people across the globe.<br /><br />This was a fast paced book, much faster than the first book. For those of you who read the first book, Tom Donovin makes a cameo appearence. For those of you who hadn't read the first book, you might not get much of the back story, since there's a lot of references to the first book.	2005-08-14

By now you've heard of James BeauSeigneur and the Christ Clone series, but probably have not read the book yet. If you are like me, and read the reviews before reading the book, you might had noticed there were a lot of comparisons to Dan Brown's \\"The DaVinci Code\\", or the \\"Left Behind\\" series. In my opinion, the only things common between the books are the references to Jesus Christ and political intrigue. The book attempts to separate from other Christian fiction books by the science of DNA and cloning, and the political behind the scenes of the U.N. But for me, there were too much political ramblings of the U.N., and not enough stories about Christopher. The first half of the book was quite exciting, but the second half was too much back-story about the players in the U.N., this made the book uneven. My hopes are that the second and third books will compensate for the unevenness of this book.<br /><br />To my knowledge this is the first of its kind on the subject of cloning Jesus Christ; if you like books that are the subject of \\"What If...\\" you might enjoy this book.	2005-07-31

But who cares right? It's Clive Cussler. Like Ian Fleming with his high-tech gagets, and babes galore. Clive Cussler has his brand high-adventure and action (usually on the high seas), and with Dirk Pitt's 'aww schucks' attitude toward heroism, what's not to like?<br /><br />If you are reading Clive Cussler for the first time, and you chose Valhalla Rising; just know that Clive's writing isn't Jules Vern or H.G. Wells. But as mentioned before, high-adventure and action. For me, I'd like to read Clive Cussler novels on a long trip, or out in the backyard drinking a couple of beers, but again that's just me.	2005-07-11

This is a hodge-podge of a whole bunch of ideas that came dangerously close to being a total failure.<br /><br />Things I liked:<br /><br />* Description of Mayan culture<br /><br />* Origins of the elongated skull - creepy!<br /><br />Things I didn't like:<br /><br />* Julius's Journal<br /><br />* The dim-witted intern, Dominique<br /><br />* The ending<br /><br />In my opinion, this book is good for reading if you are going on a long plane trip, or on a beach. If you are like me, and like to read at night before falling a sleep, this might not be an ideal book. It's hard to put my finger on it, but I just couldn't get into this book as much as I wanted to. Once I was getting into it, Steve Alten would insert the journal of Julius's journal, for some reason that would break the rhythm, then I would have to start over again the next night. I wanted to give this book a chance, but there were too many faults with the book.	2005-06-03

What happens when the Earth will be struck by a deadly solar flare from the Sun?  That is the basic premise for this book.<br /><br />Like many of the other reviewers, I too was waiting for this book to be released as a sequel to \\"A Time Odyssey.\\" I liked this book because of the possible plot of what the characters were doing to save Earth. Of course, I won't state what they did; what the characters are doing kind of reminds me of a social science-fiction novel I had once read.<br /><br />Being that this is a novel by Authur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter, there are the \\"Will I dream?\\" moments between the A.I. and humans.  What is it with Clarke and artificial-intelligence anyway?<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was the lack of Bisesa's involvement in the book. As one reviewer put it, \\"Where's the go getter?\\", exactly. The only thing that ties the first book and this book was Bisesa. However, if you haven't read the first book, you can get a good idea what happened to Bisesa on Mir.	2005-05-01

The reason for that is the main character in the book, Robert Langdon, was a little more believable in the \\"DaVinci Code.\\" For example, there was a scene in \\"Angels and Demons\\" involving a helicopter that Langdon managed to get out of, that was a little unrealistic. Also the ending was a little disappointing. Up until the end, the book was a real page turner!	2005-04-24

I have read a few reviews, and I was surprised at the amount of people that stated that this book was too self-righteous for its own good, or that this book was self-propaganda.  I am not sure of the religious background of those people, but I think those people had thought this book was self-righteous, or was self-propaganda were disappointed because the book did not agree to their views. Well guess what? This is a book on orthodox Christianity; there is no apology. From reading the reviews, there were a lot of people that had trouble with the explanations given in the book of why the characters in the book were left behind.  If they were Christian, they should read Matt 7:20-23, just mere declaration is not enough, and this is the point the authors were trying to drive home.<br /><br />For the folks out there who are not particularly religious, but like to read interesting stories, this story may interest you. This is not science fiction, there were mentions of a synthetic fertilizer that can make plant life grow in a desert, but that's it, no hard science or hard science fiction. As far as the action goes, the action is not Clive Cussler caliber, but there is action as far as the action having similarities in the bible.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad book, but not a well written one. Some of the dialog between the characters can only be described as 'corny.' Perhaps the reason the writing was not great was because it was the first book in the series.	2005-04-04

Before I started reading this book, I didn't know there was a real Tunguska Event. In June 1908, there was a cataclysmic explosion in the Tunguska region of Siberia. What happened? What was cause of the explosion? That is where the book starts to take place.<br /><br />This book was filled with factoids about Black Holes, the Russian Government, and computer technology. This is an excellent debut from Bill DeSmedt. If I didn't know any better, I could have sworn he had written science fiction books for years.<br /><br />Even though this is an excellent book, I couldn't give it 5 stars. I can appreciate the fact that the two man characters, Jon and Marianna, had to go on a boat, but in my opinion there were too many pages written during their time on the boat. (Or is it ship?) Also, there were three main characters profiled on the inner sleeve of the book: Jack Adler-The Maverick Astrophysics, Marianna Bonaventure-The Rookie Secret Agent, and Jon Knox-The Sought After Consultant. Out of the three characters, Jack Adler was not nearly written about in the book as Jon and Marianna.  There was another character too, Mycroft, I thought he was a hoot!<br /><br />If you enjoy smart science fiction, then get this book.	2005-03-26

I am always on the lookout for alternative history books, so I thought I would give Mr. Turledove a chance by reading 'Days of Infamy'.<br /><br />Mr. Turtledove tries to answer the question, \\"What if the Japanese Army and Navy follows through with an invasion after the attack on Pearl Harbor?\\" He details the attack from the Japanese Army/Navy, and the defense from the American forces. The details are very well written, having a military background myself, I can appreciate what the American forces go through in the book.<br /><br />What I didn't like was the detailed lives of the non-military people in Hawaii. I didn't care about the Japanese fishing family, I didn't care about the surfer dude; Ok I 'get it', life under Japanese rule sucks. The only interesting non-military character was Jane Armitage, and her experience under Japanese military rule.<br /><br />Had I known this book was a start of another series, I wouldn't have picked up this book. Without giving too much away for those who have not read the book yet, I'll just state that I was disappointed with the ending.	2005-02-14

This time the family is in on the action, father (Pitt), son (Dirk), and daughter (Summer).<br /><br />Having lived in the Pacific Northwest and having served in Korea, I had a personal bias for loving this book. Anytime someone writes a book about the location I had once lived or served in, I immediately will like the book.<br /><br />This was my second book Clive Cussler novel.  The first one I read was Lost City.  On my Amazon-review of that book, I was a bit critical of the dialog because normal people do not talk like they were in a bad James Bond movie, \\"Curses! Foiled again!\\" But I get it now, Clive Cussler writes novels that are entertaining; some people even made the comments that his novels are of the comic book action genre. Clive's novels are entertaining and they follow a standard formula, with the occasional paragraph about a real restaurant that Clive probably went to, and enjoyed. There's not a lot a character development, but there's a lot of action. Not the most intellectually stimulating novel, just good old fashioned butt kicking, getting the girl, and saving the day.	2005-01-23

But for one reason or another, I put reading MEG on the backburner; I think the reason I waited so long was because I had a hard time finding a hardcover. Well, the time came when I was in the mood to read MEG, after finding a hardcover.<br /><br />Before writing this review, I wanted to know what other people thought of this book, I didn't read all 400+ reviews, but it seemed people either hated it or loved it, no middle ground. For the people that hated the book, from the reviews I read, they thought the writing was poor or at least not developed. Ok, but lets give Steve Alten a break. This was his first book, and from what I gather about Steve Alten, his  journey to get MEG published was not an easy one. After all, of all the people that didn't like the book, how many of them are published authors? From what I understand, the odds getting a book published are not in your favor. However, I do agree with some of the more constructive criticisms of the book. A lot of people mentioned the fact that the ending was weak, or underdeveloped. I agree, the ending was very weak. I wanted to know what happened to Jona, Terri, and Mac after the ending. What were there lives like? Did Jona and Terry go on a vacation together? What was Mac's life like after his experience with the MEG? And what of the offspring? If Steve Alten answered these questions, I think he wouldn't have receieved so many bad reviews regarding the ending. As for the writing, there are a lot of clich&eacute;s in the book. The scientist that needs to be vindicated. The bitchy career driven wife of the scientist that has the morals of an Enron executive. The millionaire that has more money than sense, and the list goes on. You will have to decide if the clich&eacute;s are appropriate, or not. Is this book intellectually stimulating? In my opinion, no; but the book was entertaining to read. The description of the MEG's biology was interesting, and so was the premise. I never heard of a Megalodon before, and I like stories about nature running amok on mankind.<br /><br />I know that Steve Alten has written many books since MEG, I hope that his writing improved with time, and I look forward to reading his books in the future. I will give Steve Alten a second chance, he deserves it.iption of the MEG's biology was interesting, and so was the premise.

After reading a number of science-fiction and adventure-action books, I was in the mood to read something different, but I didn't know what type of book to read. I was browsing through the book store one day, and there was this dark cover on a book with interesting art work that caught my eye. From the looks of the cover, it appeared the book was a western; I was never big on western motifs, but like I mentioned, I was in the mood for something different. Remember when we were told as children to not judge a book by its cover? Well, I was glad to judge this book by its cover; because if I didn't pick this book up, I would have missed out on a series of short stories that were very entertaining to read!

That doesn't mean Sandstorm was a bad book, it was just that some of the characters really bothered me. It's hard to put my finger on it, but the characters, `Painter' and `Safia' didn't have that special element that authors need to make their books work. First, Painter showed some promise as a covert operative working for the American government at the start of the book. As soon he meets Safia, Painter has mixed emotional feelings towards Safia. He likes her, he loves her, and he doesn't love her and so on...please. Yes Painter had plenty momentous action scenes in the book, but he was not interesting to me. He was just a former Navy SEAL that had some romantic feelings toward Safia, that's all. The character, Safia, was too whiney for me. She kept on thinking of her bad experience back in Tele Aviv, and I kept on thinking, \\"Get over it! Move on!\\" Maybe I am being too harsh on Safia. The one character I did like was Omaha Dunn. He was smart, he was funny, and he was not perfect. His character was much more interesting that Painter's; in my opinion James Rollins centered on the character Painter a little too much.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, I thought it was original and very entertaining to read! Just like the last book, Sandstorm was fast paced, and exciting, especially at the end. There's also some real life truths written in the book, just read the epilogue<br /><br />If Mr. Rollins ever decided to use a character again, I hope it is Omaha Dunn!	2004-11-07

I have always wanted to read a Clive Cussler novel, and my first novel was his newest release titled Lost City, co-authored by Paul Kemprecos. This was a story of great action adventure, mixed with some science and science-fiction. The story begins with a pilot that was shot down in 1914, only to be discovered years later in the French Alps by an expedition team. Who was he? What's the connection between the mysterious pilot, and a life prolonging enzyme found on the ocean found in an area called, \\"Lost City\\"?<br /><br />There are many characters in the book, but the book was written in a way that will make it easy for you to keep track of the characters. In many of the action-adventure novels that I had read, there was little character development; Lost City is no exception. Personally I like character development in the novels I read, in the book the only thing that developed between the characters was the attraction between Skye and Austin. Which is understandable, in order to keep the story moving, sometimes character development has be sacrificed in order to keep the pace of the story moving.<br /><br />For the Edgar Allen Poe fans out there, there are many references to his stories that you might appreciate.<br /><br />One of the things I didn't like about the book was the dialog from Emil and Racine. It's hard to put my finger on it; I thought the dialog was a bit dated. It's almost as if the authors stole the dialog from an unknown-bad James Bond movie. Perhaps the reason for the dated dialog was to give the book a classic motif.<br /><br />Writers these days have a challenge of creating something new that no one has done before. As I stated, this was my first Kurt Austin novel. As I was reading, I couldn't help getting a sense of \\"I've read this before\\" or \\"I've seen this in a movie\\" from the book. The book is a bit unoriginal, and has dated dialog; but the book is VERY entertaining to read.	2004-10-05

When I heard about this book, I was a little leery, I thought this book was another edition to all other books that try to become blockbuster, only to end in failure. Boy, I was I wrong! Mr. Long takes his time with the characters, and doesn't rush the plot. To me this is very refreshing. Also, I'm not a scientist, but the science is very well explained and is easy to understand.

For example, (without giving too much away), one of the characters betrays the rest of the team for reasons there were...well, not original. Out of all the reasons the authors could have used for a book that was set in the future, the character's motivation was not original. I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't.<br />On a positive note, I thought the military culture written in the book was well written.

We've all seen the movie, but I was curious to find out how it all started.<br />The book centers around Dr. Okun, and how he became involved with Area 51, and the trials he goes through finding the clues to the alien invaders.<br />This book is a nice addition to the movie, and can't wait the read &quot;War in the desert.&quot;<br />If anyone has a used hardcover of the book Independence Day: War in the Desert, they can sell me, please email me at rking@king7.com	2004-05-31

This book deals with the main character, Nick Hyde, at the beginning of the book has a violent encounter with the White Devils.<br />There are many characters with subplots Mr. McAuley woven into the book, and the future regarding biotechnology.<br />Mr. McAuley writes about the science of the future without getting into what I call &quot;lecture mode&quot;, as I see in many science fiction books.<br />If you like action, science, and a believable plot in the not so distant future, then get this book!	2004-04-18

Story a little uneven	This was my first Greg Bear book, and I had some mixed feelings about it.<br />First of all the premise of the book was excellent! I appreciated the fact that Mr. Bear had done his research for the book. Because of the many biology terms used in the book, I found myself going back to the glossary many times.  Right or wrong, Mr. Bear chose to use the biology terms in his book. At times during reading the book, I wondered to myself is Mr. Bear writing for biologists, or for the general public?<br />The first half of the book was intersting, then the last half was a bit boring and kind of dragged. I felt he spent too much time writing about the political side of things, explaining the political ramifications on the effects of SHEVA. He did write on some of the effects SHEVA had on society, but not enough.<br />I was really surprised when one of the main characters kind of dropped off until the end. I wished the Stella character appeared a little earlier, she was very interesting, and could have added another twist to the plot. Just my 0.02.<br />This is not a typical science fiction bang-bang shoot'em up type of novels. But a thought provoking story about man kind, his past and his future.	2004-04-13

This was my first book by Mr. Rollins, and I must say I was impressed. The story, characters, and plot are woven into each other very nicely.<br />I did think the book had too many characters, but that I just 0.02. Although I did appreciate the character list, and the visuals at the front of the book.<br />I thought the book was original, and well developed. The only thing I didn't like was the book cover and the title of the book. The title didn't seem to fit the story. The cover art didn't look like it was finished.	2004-03-01

I've always liked his reporting, and I even remember from Good Morning America.<br />I liked the sections when he writes about free market vs. govt; providing better services.<br />I also thought the report on the $330,000 outhouse in Pennsylvania was a hoot!	2004-02-18

I was looking for a book about Time Travel, and I have found it. This book has all the elements that I look for: Good Plot, Good Character Development, and Excellent Storytelling. <br />The only thing I have trouble with was the Sable Jones character. I thought her character was a little over the top. For example, Sable was about to be attacked by a seasoned war mongol. The war mongol was probibly ten times stronger then Sable, but Sable &quot;some how&quot; was able to defeat the war mongol. Just a little unrealistic. <br />If you love history, excellent story telling, and are interested in the subject of time travel, then get this book!	2004-02-17

There are writers that write for a movie (at least hopes for a movie), and there are writers that write for the reader. Mr. Koontz, in my opinion writes for the reader. The way he gives details about the characters Odd has contact with, it gives the book more meaning then just a cookie-cutter formula some writers follow.<br />My only wish was that Little Ozzie had a bigger part in the book; he sounded he could have really made a contribution to the story then just a mere friend of Odd Thomas. I thought Little Ozzie was a hoot!	2004-01-30

The South Pole sections were interesting, but had nothing to do with the main story. Same thing with the sections on the trip to Giza. I believe an Amazon reviewer stated it best as the sections were 'narrative endings'. This was an easy read. I read the book in about a day and a half, 14hrs total.<br />I gave the book 3 stars:<br />* Good Concept<br />* Incorporating real events into the plot<br />* The book had a nice quick pace.<br />Out of all the characters in the book, I liked Dr. Paula Winnick the best. Her dialog was intelligent, and she was giving a real message to the reader. In my opinion, Winnick should had a larger part in the book. Just my 0.02.	2004-01-29

Great plot, characters, and science (real / unreal). Because this book contains a lot of references to religion, science, and cultures around the world, the book was a little too slow paced for my liking. But excellent reading none the less! Although this book was not as fast paced as I would like, I would recommend this book to all of my friends!	2004-01-05

Durant's experience in the &quot;Mog&quot;. Durant also  describes his personal account as a POW and as a helocopter pilot. The book gets you in the mindset of Durant as he explains what it is like to be a POW, his hopes and fears. The book does contain chapters on Durant's military career that has nothing to do with with Somalia, but an interesting read none the less.	2003-12-26

This is my first Dan Brown book and I must admit, I was a little leery reading this book because of the book's popularity. Sometimes popular does not always mean better. However, 'The Da Vinci Code' is the exception. You do not need an extensive background in art or religion to enjoy this book. Mr. Brown covers those areas in detail in an easy understandable format. If you come from a religious background you may (or may not) accept the writings in the book.<br />Please keep an open mind.	2003-12-04
