Hayek	Books	5	28	30	N	Y	An other opinion heard from	First off, I want to echo the other reviewers in my praise for the book.  The background in economic history was valuable to me and helps put the work that Hayek did into perspective.  Though it may be \\"academic\\" (any look at the philosophy behind economics is probably not for the same audience as more instrumental books -- like \\"How to be successful\\" or whatever).  That being said the book is well written and if anyone is interested in the influence of positivism on economics, the division of psychology and economics into separate disciplines, the roots of socialism and other foundational material, this book presents that information in a logical, clear way. <br /> <br />It cautions at the beginning that Hayek's work was complex and interdependent.  There is a tendancy to take a paragraph by Hayek from one place and use it as a representation of the whole, like the blind men and the elephant.  I would suggest strongly that to call him foundational in the current US conversativism is probably wrong.  One clue is that as an extra to the \\"Constitution of Liberty\\" there is an essay by Hayek called \\"Why I am not a conservative.\\"   <br /> <br />Hayek was fascinated with \\"knowledge\\" in the sense that somehow humans manage to coordiante activity and believe that we share knowledge, but in reality it is not possible.  Each of sees what we see and we do not see what others see.  Somehow, unconsciously, we have evolved a way of being able to use the knowledge of others as well as our own.   <br /> <br />His argument against socialism was basically that it breaks some of the ways of knowing what others are doing.  A standard definition of Economics is that it is about how people make decisions in conditions of scarcity.  In other words, there is an assumption that there is never enough to go around.  If you think about it, even people with virtually unlimited amounts of money still compete with each other for status and other such things.  We are all often in a position that if we choose X, then we cannot have Y.  <br /> <br />Hayek thinks that that decision should be left up to the individual.  He says that the mistake that people who believe that scientific central planning make is that they believe there is more of a consensus that there is.  Someone's choices wind up overriding other's choices.  There is more to it than this, but this is the basis of the argument.  It is simple and not really one that falls easily on a liberal/conservative spectrum. <br /> <br />     It is, however, probably the source of the claim that he is \\"conservative.\\"  Maggie Thatcher was a fan of Hayek as was, apparently, Ronald Reagan. It can be construed that the opposite of governments actively trying manage economies is lazie fare, hands off, anything goes conservativism.  But that would be a misreading of Hayek and simply because a conservative likes Hayek's arguments about one topic does not make Hayek a conservative.    <br /> <br />     There is another point where Hayek would probably diverge widely from current \\"conservatives.\\"  By popular demand the borders in the US are getting tighter.  For instance, it is now difficult to come back and forth from Canada, foreign graduate students are looking elsewhere, the \\"conservative\\" governor of California (himself an Austrian and alledgedly a fan of Hayek) is supporting vigilanties to prevent border crossings from Mexico.  It does not seem that this is condusive to \\"knowledge\\" in the sense that Hayek uses it, as something that is distributed throughout humanity. <br /> <br />Hayek's greatest interest was in how we each take our little snapshot of the world and interact with others to build stable social structures without any direction.   It is not that someone decides that we should have a structure like such and such, we find that these structures are there and we can all recognize them.   In a way, he is talking about the \\"invisible hand\\" of Adam Smith.  Somehow we coordinate activity so that I can be writing this right now on a computer I got somewhere, a DSL connection and so on and I have not talked to the people involved with making it happen, they have not talked to each other and no one directed them to do it.  <br /> <br />    Hayek is interested in the rules that make that happen.  Now we talk of complex adaptive systems and the idea of \\"spontaneous order\\" is widely studied to day.   Current work on \\"connectionist networks\\" now mention Hayek.  He was way ahead of his time. <br /> <br />    I also want to point out that even though some call him \\"the father of libertarianism\\" he was not against governments making rules that cause markets to function better, for instance, regulation against monopoly.  Libertarians were up in arms against the threatened breakup of Microsoft, something Hayek would not have been against in principle. <br /> <br />     I hope more people will read this book.  It is remarkable how many ideas we think are brand new have been around for a while.  This book helped me understand how they got sidelined.  It is really a lively book, filled with people as well as ideas, which is important, because sometimes politics trumps insight.  Hayek's remarkable ideas are just beginning to be widely noticed and recognizing what is happening is an exciting benefit of this book. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-28

It uses many standard economic ideas, but does not assume the reader knows them and it explains them clearly and simply.  For instance, his description of the &quot;Luddite Fallacy&quot; is one of the best I have seen.<br />The subject that economists study, human interaction, is too complex to be a solved problem.  Over the years there have been guesses that have not worked out.   The theme of this book is based on the idea that people are entrepreneurial.  If the developed world gives the less developed world a whole pile of money, then the entrepreneurial thing to do is to try and get some of it.   Unfortunately, that will not necessarily be the use of the money that is best for the long term growth of the country.<br />There are a number of well meaning actions that the developing world has taken that have had unintended consequences and Easterly gives great examples of them.   The question he asks and what he proposes is: what actions will incentivise people to do the things that will result in the best long term results?<br />Sometimes that might require toughlove, and as such may not be politically appealing, but it makes sense, as William Easterly so clearly shows in this readable and significant book.	2004-04-25

This book gives a step-by-step method of analyzing one's own social networks and through them, learning more about oneself.  These social networks are not groups of people that you socialize with, but rather the core people that make up your life, your family, your co-workers and others.  <br />Having diverse social networks is a good indicator of many metrics of success and happiness.   People with diverse social networks make more money, get promoted faster, ... they even get fewer colds.   But how diverse is your social network?  How can you improve it?   This book shows how to figure it out and teaches about social networks while doing it.	2004-03-15

In this book Cozzens looks at the 4 groups that &quot;simultaniously&quot; discovered the opiate receptor and shows that what happens is a complex social process.   The process includes the ultimate identity of the discovery itself and the pressure from other scientists, publications, and values.  Using citation indices, interviews, publications she dissects a case where the historical record is still fresh.

However, it is not impossible to understand, and I am glad I took the time.<br />To give the flavor, the biblography is 50 pages and White expects that you are familiar with everything in the biblography and refers to them.  Or more accurately, he put so much work into the book that he expects you to read them.  <br />The interesting thing is (and Amazon must love me), if you take the time to read the references it opens up an amazing world where cognative psychology, linguistics, micro sociology merge.  One arrives at a view of society and even of socially constructed reality as far more restricting than one might at first think. <br />There are profound assumptions in the book, or better profound elements that are based on new information about the world.  For instance the organization of society into hierarchies cannot be based on the attributes of individuals.   White extends these results upward through institutions and large social formations.  <br />The book looks at our concept of &quot;self&quot; and challenges the view that has lead to our modern psychology, sociology and economics. <br />Finally, the critical point of the books is about &quot;getting action.&quot;  How is it that someone embedded in the web of ties and relationship we are all in can succeed at doing anything?<br />I have spent nearly 6 months reading this book, reading it, reading references, and then reading it again and I do not feel I have wasted my time.	2004-02-04

When they start using technical buzz words I can tell real quick that they are using words with no real subtance behind them, but I have avoided talking about &quot;value chains&quot; and &quot;best practices&quot; because though I understood them from context I did was not sure of myself.   This book explains many of the key buzz words used in management in clear terms. <br />It also provides references and resources for further study.  For instance it recommends &quot;Competitive Strategy&quot; by Michael Porter.   I asked a friend that is a Wharton graduate if she was famliar with the book &quot;Competitive Strategy&quot; and she answered &quot;by Michael Porter?&quot;   There are so many business books it is nice to have a guide to cut the wheat from the chaff.<br />I am glad I read this book and it even inspired me to make some changes in my business that have been useful.	2002-12-11

For instance, when reading about Jefferson, Adams and people that founded the US I find they are fluent in Latin and Greek and read the classics extensively. <br />I have read the Histories, the Pelloponesian Wars, much of Plutarch and survey books I could find and though I found the stories interesting I have been groping for some context.  I felt like one of the blind men and the elephant, only apprehending the little piece I was in contact with and not having any idea what a whole elephant is like.<br />I came across this book by looking through ...(this very place) and it looked like it would give me an overall structure. The book succeeded beyond my expectations. Starting with Egypt and ending with the Byzantine Empire it covers the myriad civilizations around the Mediterranean during that period. It puts Solon and Dracon into their context. It explains how the Etruscians related to the Greek civilization, and then to Roman. It discusses the Phoenecians, the Latins, the Gauls, the Celts and all the various people that interacted with the Romans as their empire expanded and then the Germans, Huns and other that became important as their empire declined.<br />Much of what we know about the ancient world is relatively new because excavations are ongoing and techniques are improving. Besides that our thinking aout the ancient world is evolving as well. This book trys to understand the period it covers not just from the point of view of the wealthy, literate folks that wrote the classics, but from the point of view of craftsmen, farmers and slaves as well.<br />This is definately the book I had been looking for to get me started learning about the influence the past has had on the present. I may not know yet what the elephant of ancient history smells like because I have not been that close, but I have a pretty good idea what it looks like thanks to this book.	2002-02-20

I am glad I did.   <br />In a straightforward style he talks about the minds of fanatics of any stripe and looks for the common elements that you will find in the followers of Jim Jones or Osama Bin Laden.  He makes a compelling case that people who feel that their own lives are pointless and they cannot make a difference in the world ally themselves with huge, great causes and subsume their own selves into the great cause.<br />He makes concrete lists of characteristics that you will recognize in people you meet every day, encounter in the letters-to-the editor columns of your newspaper as well as those that have closed themselves off in a cult or mass movement.   <br />I found the book said things that several months after reading it I still think of often.

Much of the discussion comes from anecdotal evidence or from a particular point of view.  Of course, it is impossible to be completely objective about anything, but since the mission of the World Bank, the publishers of this study, is &quot;a world free of poverty&quot; it's point of view at least attempts to not view globalization from the perspective of any particular nation or group and to represent different views.<br />The result is a strongly documented case for the beneficial effects of our increasingly globalized world.  This books is a good reference books with facts about the distribution of income, poverty rates throughout the world, changes in GDP over time and other things that are frequently misrepresented by anti-globalization folks.<br />The book covers many things that are in books like The Lexus and the Olive Tree, A Future Perfect and so on about how the legal and social structure affect investment and growth.   This book references the original studies and is a good starting point for research. <br />It also points out that the forces towards globalization, better communication, transportation and financial markets can easily be stopped in their tracks by trade wars as happened in the 1930's so educating oneself about the benefits of an integrated world economy can help make sure we do not have a repeat of the Great Depression.	2002-02-16

The not so good part is that it assumes knowledge about many peoples that contribute to the story.<br />When I read \\"The Histories\\" by Herodus I had a terrible time getting through the part on the Scythians. That is because I had know idea who they were. I went to the Net and found a reference to them that was just a few paragraphs, that they were Indo-European, that they may have invented horseback riding, that their decendents still lived in the Cacus mountians. After that I was interested in them and had not trouble reading the material.<br />I say this to point out the biggest drawback of this book. There is no mention of the ethnographic or linguistic relationships between the various groups. Today it is important that Serbs and Russians are enthnically close. This books doesn't give a hint of these kinds of relationships. That makes it more difficult to remember the information.<br />However, it is still a valuable book to help understand the events that made the world the way that it is. It is scrupulous about its sources and there is no question that the information is as accurate as possible.	2001-10-24

The book is challenging. The Metaphysical Club points out that William James did not understand Peirce at first, so it is a bit much for mere mortals. It is especially daunting because the first essay is written with respect to Kant's categories, not something I know off of the top-of-my head.<br />However, as the books progresses many of the things that are assumed in the first essay are explained. For instance Peirce explains in detail what he means by a sign.<br />He discusses cognition, or consciousness and shows that logically our internal experience is based on external stimulation. It soon becomes impossible to ignore the fact that you are reading the works of a logician and that that is where he is coming from. But even though you might have to reread parts several times, once you master the arguements, it is satisfying indeed.<br />According to the introduction of the book and references, Peirce was influential.  William James, Oliver Wendel Holmes and John Dewey were all influenced by him.  Modern cognitive psychology owes much to William James.  Psychology took a different direction through psychoanalysis and then behaviorism but cognitive psychology is now the dominate paradigm.  Because of this Peirce has renewed importance.<br />My advice is to read it through once and not feel you have to get everything and the reread it because he explains things later that he assmes you know earlier.	2001-08-22

I have also been interested in CS Peirce and read his &quot;How to make our ideas clear.&quot;  Learning more about these two motivated me to read this book.   The book was far beyond my expectations.<br />Starting at the civil war and the changes in thinking it brought about it incorporates statistics and natural selection into complete worldview that is profoundly different than what had gone before.   It ties together history and thought in an organic way.   It talks about the beginnings of modern education, from the founding of a school of science at Harvard to the works of John Dewey.    There is just enough history and description of the personalities of the people involved to bring them to life, but not so much as to detract from the central point.    The central point to document a profound shift in thought from idealism to a more statistical and relativistic view of the world.  <br />It answered many questions I have had and I could not put it down.  I am sorry I am limited to 5 stars.	2001-07-23

I am not sorry I read it. <br />I can't imagine what the book's editors were thinking.   There is one point where for no obvious reason McCullough tells us that the people ice skating on the pond were doing a complex figures and then that Adams and his family climbed a bell tower and looked at the town.   I had to go back an reread that part to seem if I was missing some connection to the narrative but as far as I could see there was no reason for it to be there.   Throughout the book he goes into great detail about what they had for dinner and things that.   <br />That being said, I am glad that I read it.   Though probably 25% of the book could have been left out with no loss, the remaining 75% is worth reading.  Since reading Albion's Seed I have been comparing the people with the culture from which they came.  It is ineresting to see Adams as a product of his culture and his own nature and the book enough detail to make it interesting.<br />Be patient.  The first 100 pages or so are pretty slow going with tons of irrelavant or marginally relevant characters and detail whose only purpose seems to be ambiance, but after that the revolution itself is such an exciting event that the pace picks up.	2001-06-24

The description of Sparta here is the benchmark. Understanding the modern issues of culture and development can be made much richer by reading the laws of Solon (who laid down the groundwork for Democracy) and Lycurgus (Sparta - the ultimate egalitarian state) you can see the seeds of a dichotomy that has lived to this day.<br />This two volume set contains the lives of many of the people that you hear about again and again.  If you plan to study the classics and read Plato, the Histories or other of the great books, these books are a perfect companion.  Instead of reading them straight through, you can read about people as you come across them.<br />With much soul searching I gave the books 4 stars instead of 5. The reason for this is that the translations are challenging. They are not terrible and they are better than other tranlations I have seen, but they have endless sentences and word choices that are not common in modern American English. If you are into personal growth, this may not be a bad thing, because you can look up the words and expand your vocabulary, but it does make it somewhat more slow going than it could be.	2001-03-13

More than once I found myself going back to the copyright page to assure myself that the book was written in 1960, not 2000.  <br />Within the first few pages he disassociates himself from a pure libertarian position, saying he believes that the govenment has an important place in extending freedom.   In an afterword he explains &quot;Why I am not a conservative.&quot;    For people that like to go beyond categorizing everything into left/right left/right like drill sargents Hayek throws a curve.   He strongly believes that the feedback from free markets is the only way that society can adapt to change, which would be something labeled &quot;conservative,&quot; but he goes into detail about the ways that governments can help make that happen.<br />I am not surprised that people like Noam Chomsky never seem to mention Hayek.   Chomsky carefully selects the facts that help make his case and ignore the ones that are counter to it.  Hayek's argments against socialism, or command economies are so good that they pretty much lay the matter to rest.   I recently read a speech by Chomsky where he says that because of the unequal distribution of wealth that our &quot;free&quot; markets are just socialism for the rich.   Hayek addresses that directly by pointing out that luxuries are luxuries because few of them are produces and only the rich can afford them, but if they are useful or liked people figure out ways to make them less expensively and they become available to everyone.  That's just the way it is.   How could it be possible that someone could anticipate the breakthroughs humans continue to make?  <br />That is one little nugget from this book.  I read once that Maggie Thatcher used to give away copies of this book saying &quot;this is what we believe.&quot;  For that reason alone it would beworth reading because of the influence her reforms had on not only England, but the thinging of the whole developed world.	2001-03-06

Since it is the most widely used survey book on Economics, any person that would like become more economically aware should read this book.   Some concepts, like Capitalism, are pretty humpty-dumptish in that the word means whatever someone choosed it to mean.  However, for those who are not trying to politicize economics and are willing to look at it for what it is, a social science studying an aspect of human behavior, this book is essential.  That is because it is so widely read that most people with some economics training are familiar with the way it uses terms and it provides a common ground for discussion.<br />The book is excellent in that it takes complex mathematical relationships and by using graphs instead of the formula that create the graphs it is easy to see what is happening with demand curves, marginal utility and other concepts.<br />The question of whether economics &quot;works&quot; or does not work is silly.  It is an attempt to describe an aspect of human behavior and like psychology, sociology, linguistics or an other such attempts, it is incomplete.   This book provides a good introduction to the terms, the concepts and the issues of Economics.   It is no accident that it is still the most widely used introduction to Economics text.	2001-03-02

Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet.  I though that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed.<br />You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible.   <br />He says it WAY better that I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs.  But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things.  Since I rediscoverd the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerly thanked me.	2001-02-28

It points out that 72% of Americans believe in angels, nearly half believe that the world was created by god in its present form 6000 years ago.  Since I am trained as a scientist, read Science each week and other similar periodicals I feel a compelling need to believe in evolution to make sense of the world I live in.  I am guessing that people who believe in angels may not like the book.<br />Hopefully, I am wrong about that.  Mr. Goode makes a scrupulous effort to not be judgemental.   He carefully tracks the kind of reasoning that it takes to reach various conclusions and points out that many scientific conclustions are remote from human experience.   A scientist might immediately tend to discount the claim that &quot;UFO's must be real because I met someone who was actaully kidnapped by one and they told me their story.&quot;  The scientist might be weighing in his or her mind the likelyhood that modern physics is totally incorrect vs. the likelyhood that the victim of the kidnapping might have been dreaming and mentally vote that it was a dream, while someone else might think of all the times scientists have been wrong and prefer the eyewitness account.  <br />The book delves into the philosophy of science, various studies that have been done and other methods of showing the way various ways of thinking can lead to different conclusions.   It is not a fluffy book and demands thought.   I found myself reading it and thinking about it all day at work just waiting to get home to finish it.	2001-02-27

The issue is local control vs. being subsumed by global homogenity.   This book shows why the main force of globalization is really just openness.   <br />In short, the book points out that more and more people are becoming investors and that investors want to make money on their investments.   If a country or company is secretive and is run in a way that benefits the people running the country or company more than the investors, investors may choose to invest in a less risky situation.   However, without investment, countries and companies cannot succeed in the long run.  For that reason companies and countries need to follow account practices, manage themselves correctly, respect private property rights, contracts and other such things.  These are the main outside influences that are forcing countries and companies to be more the same.<br />Each abstract point that Tom Friedman makes in this book is backed up with compelling stories based on his vast personal expeience.   I remember being in Russia in 1998, right after their currency had collapsed.  I talked to everyone I could about their hopes and fears and life in Russia and it really helped me sort out what I had read and give things more appropriate weights.   Friedman has that kind of experience with almost every country in the world and has talked to every type of person.   It what he says gives the feeling of &quot;of course, I can relate to that, I'd feel the same way if I were in their shoes.&quot;	2001-02-19

I read the Histories, the Pelopponesian Wars and I believe I am getting some idea of the world of the time.  I knew I could not really understand the influence the Greeks had on subsequent civilizations without digging into Plato.<br />So, I looked around and found this book, which is more that 1,000 pages.   It has different translators and he says that he is trying to make Plato as alive for the 21st Century as he has been for the last 24 centuries.   That sounded promising.  I took it home and wondered if I should read it like a novel or just hit the high points.   I had no idea what was what.<br />Fortunately, the introduction to this book proved to be a wonderful road map to the volume, with insight on how to read it.  I have found that following the guidence the book is actually fun. As an adult, I have heard so many of the issues reaised throughout my life, it is pretty cool to have them reduced to their essence.  <br />We all know that everyone should read Plato and he is the most important philosopher and all that, but there's a lot of stuff I &quot;should&quot; read that is too tedious.  This book turned out to be compelling and once I got started something I wanted to read and not just something I was reading because I &quot;should&quot;.	2001-02-02

It basically points out that a legal system that values private property rights is essential for entrepreneurs to use that value to create or expand businesses.  He argues the point persusavily and give concrete example from origial research.  If a person is unfamiliar with ideas, this would be a good primer for the subject.<br />The only drawback is that he take a tone that he has made an amzing discovery that no one else has ever figured out.  This same thing has been proposed by (for example) Landes in the Wealth and Poverty of Nations and in the collection: Culture Matters, both recently.  Looking further back into the past, however, F. Hayek discussed this issue in many books as far back as the 30's and it is not so far from ideas explored by Weber at the turn of the century.<br />I think it would have been a better book if he had pointed readers into ways of exploring the ideas instead of acting like he was the first to discover the concepts.  He does present the concepts well and the book is definately worth reading.	2000-12-29

Though most of the essays start with the premise that it is better to be rich and healthy than it is to be sick and poor, Richard Shweder represents a huge segment of people who oppose change in any form.  Having an essay such as this in the book gives it depth, because his view is a common one that cannot be ignored.<br />Most of the other authors look for ways that we can emperically evaluate and define our intuitions about culture.  They dare to ask the question: is it possible that some cultural choices could lead to groups of people being mired in poverty, while others lead to greater health and happiness?<br />Most of them address the subjectivity of what they are studying, but they often come up with very satisfying discussions.<br />The book has wonderful discussions of Africa, Latin America, the role of women in various societies and other sociological information.  It addresses foursquare the questions of post-modernist cultural relativism, including, as I mentioned, both sides of the discussion.	2000-12-11

For instance, the principle of &quot;monotony.&quot;   This does not mean what we generally take it to mean, but it is the idea that people can focus on one thing at time.

However, there is something that does not sit right in the long run. It is better to be rich and healthy than sick and poor.   This books shows how squandering human and material capital can lead a country into poverty and investing it wisely can help a country flourish. <br />For anyone interested in the world, the book also provides a jumping off point to other fantastic books.   It referred often to Albion's Seed, a wonderful book about the USA; to Cruelty and Silence - a disconcerting by important book about Iraq.<br />The scope of the books is immense.  Dr. Landes touches on topics as diverse as maleria, the Spanish Inqusition and Islam to present a case based on a satisfying balance of material and social factors that fit with common sense as well as the fine scholarship used in writing the book.<br />I have been recommending it to everyone.	2000-11-08

It discusses the imporance of the connections.   One idea I found especially useful was the idea of &quot;bonding&quot; vs. &quot;bridging&quot; relationships.  <br />Bonding helps us get by, like family and close friends.  Bridging helps us get ahead, relationships with people unlike ourselves.   The book documents the importance of bridging relationships on the development of the country and even on personal health.<br />This book is incredibly important because it shows without a doubt the issues that are confronting us and what we need to do to help society and individuals stay healthy.	2000-11-08

Do these beliefs still exist, or were they wiped out by the communists?   One of the difficulties of finding the answer is not having an understanding of what those beliefs were.<br />Because of lack of communication and bans on travel in Russia that go back to the time of Ivan, there a many Russias.   The part of this book I found most valuable was the description of the various monastaries Rasputin visisted and the practices of the khylst sect.   This book really gives a sense of the non-European layer of Russia.   <br />I found the book provided a valuable window into a more private side of Russia.	2000-11-06

A recent trend has been to look not just at material explainations of how things turn out, but also at the cultural and social values that guided behavior.<br />This book examines the personalities and actions of a few closely connected people and how the decisions they made set in motion later events, like the success of the republican government they created, the civil war and more.  <br />The thread that ties it together is the dynamic between strong federal government and states rights.   The book shows that the issue was never resolved.   Instead, a system was created where the relationship could be dynamically reformulated over time.  The book shows how the personalities and beliefs of these key people and the compromises they made at that time created a system which has proved to be incredibly resilient.<br />The book is very well written, with turns of phrases that make me laugh out loud or read them to my wife and friends.	2000-11-06

I could not put down Steven Lattimore's translation.  The funeral oration of Perikles was so beautiful tears came to my eyes as I read it to my wife.   <br />I liked that portion of the book so much that I researched it and discovered that I was not alone in being impressed by it, and that it is considered some of the greatest writing ever.  I compared the same passage in several tranlations found most of the to use somewhat archaic words that do not quite have the impact that they do to a modern reader as the words in Lattimore's translation.	2000-10-31

It is generally referred to as an overwhelming tide that either must be embraced or stopped.<br />The book discusses the results of globalization in several industries, and it takes the economic perspective that comparative advantage will continue to operate.   But it goes beyond that and discusses the loosers as well as the winners.  <br />The most interesting idea I found in the book was it's discussion of what they call &quot;cosmocrats.&quot;   An elite that is without geographic identity and more bound to others of their class than to their traditional communities.   The book &quot;Bowling Alone&quot; documents the breakdown of traditional social networks.   It is easy to see in Silicon Valley's libertarian culture the people who feel they are &quot;self made&quot; and do not feel a need for reciprocal relationships with their geographic communities.  This belief, of course, is totally without foundation.  However, the belief that a technical elite should run society has been tired in Germany, Russia and other places with horrible results.   The books does not go so far as to raise that type of alarm, but the dislocation that they document is well worth considering.	2000-10-24

Or the day to day life in an Iraq prison, where beatings, starvation and living in squaler are not &quot;torture.&quot;   When they want to torture someone, it is far worse that that.<br />The biggest crime is to disagree with the government.  In Iraq Shiites, Kurds, Marsh Arabs and others are killed routinely.  Yet intelligent people like Noam Chomsky and others feel that such behavior is justified because of &quot;Arab pride&quot; or cultural relativism.<br />Makiya uses his sources as an Iraqi to describe the cruelty and then asks the question: why the silence?    Since I have read the book I have seen many article berating the US for the embargo on Iraq.   Yet the fact is that Iraq is exporting more oil now than before the embargo.  The money is being used to continue the nightmare.   At least it slows Saddam's ability to create weapons, for he would be sure to use them. <br />This book is a welcome antidote from the steady stream of driviel from the academics.	2000-10-24

Some economics books are statistical and metrical.  Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations argued from simple observations about human nature with which most people will agree.  The Road to Serfdom is in that vein.<br />Hayek's book has paragraph after paragraph that makes me thing &quot;that's just what I think.&quot;  Only said much better.  For instance when he talks about the imporance of economics, or acqusition of money he agrees that to all but a miser it is not the highest of human goals.  The seductive idea of planners it that the creation of our necessities could be automated by technocrats.  He turns this by pointing out that the reason that in a free society the reason that what money buys is not important is because when we have too little, the things we choose to do without are the very things for which we have the least regard.<br />The fundemental message is that economies are too complex for humans to direct and that any attempt to do so winds with the worst of both worlds.  We wind up without personal freedom and bad economies as well.<br />Apparetly, this books was utterly rejected when it was written, but history has shown the results of socialism and what he says reads almost like a history book rather then lucid model of the relationship between politics and economics that it is.	2000-10-23

This book provides a snapshot of the world of the US at one of it's most exciting times.   The end of the 19th century was the &quot;Progressive Era&quot; when people came together and formed groups and associations that are still with us today.  His metaphor of dipping into the cool clear water in which we are sailing for the human resources to build society is as true today as in 1890.   His statement that the most pressing problem in America was for rich and poor to understand how each contributes to the whole and to learn to value each other is also timely.<br />Besides the fascinating historical perspective of the thinking of the time, there is the insight provided by Booker T. Washington himself.   His adulation of labor is reminisint of Kahil Gibran in &quot;The Prophet.&quot;  The most repeated idea in the book is that any person that adds to the economic well being and comfort of their community will be sought out and cherished and that race has nothing to do with it.  Coming from a person who started with so much less (he was a slave) that most of us have today and really practicing what he believed makes him someone that we all can admire.    To put it in less academic terms, this is a book about an incredibly beautiful person that made me think deeply about myself and the world I live in.	2000-09-20

This book expands on that with information about German folkways and African folkways.   This books gives a sense the people that expanded westward. There is also a philosophical current about the nature of historial inquiry.  He addresses various ideas about frontiers and shows that the process of expansion is not open to one-size-fits all explainations.  Though Fischer depricates purely materialist explainations of history, the interplay between the cultural values of the Virginians and the physical limitations of the land is a compelling explaination of the westward expansion.	2000-09-20

The premise is that  ther culture of each of the groups persisted and that these cultures  provide the basis for the modern United States.  The folkways are the  cultural beliefs in religion, magic, child raising, family, age,food and  other interesting things. Since reading the book I have been asking  everyone I spend any time with about their background and quizzing them  about beliefs. The book has opened up a whole new world to me about the  types of things Fischer discusses in his book.  Traces of the cultures he  describes are still very much with us and I am finding it remarkable the  degree that you can predict the overall pattern of a person's beliefs based  on their background. Another aspect of the book is that though it is 900  pages of text, it never got boring to me.   By talking about people and how  they lived it brings them to life as well as any novel.	2000-09-05

On page 13 he says that &quot;Gates and Allen created the programming language, Basic.&quot; This is not true, it was developed in 1964, more than a decade before Gate's version. On the same page he says &quot;while he ruthlessly fought to dominate the market, he never tried to dominate its direction&quot; (referring to Gates). Anyone involved in high tech knows this is not true, and the recent ruling by the court of appeals shows this is not rue.<br />If you read a book that uses facts to make its case, and the facts are incorrect, sometime you find yourself in the embarrasing position of stating a fact and then being proven wrong.  The author of this book makes up facts, so take it with a grain of salt.<br />As for Machavelli.  When I saw this book I was excited becuase I had recently read the Prince through 3 times.   I discovered if you substitute the word &quot;fire&quot; for &quot;kill,&quot; &quot;aquire&quot; for &quot;conquer&quot;, &quot;CEO&quot; for &quot;Prince&quot; and read the book with no other alterations it was stunningly accurate in describing contemporary events.  For instance, the outcome of the Mercedes Benz Chrysler merger was accurately predicted.  <br />There are so many refrences apologizing and lauding Microsoft business practices, I suspect that the book is really a PR book paid for by Microsoft and not what it claims to be at all.	2000-06-04
