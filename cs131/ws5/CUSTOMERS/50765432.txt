It is especially helpful because the two authors come from the opposite ends of experience in private practice: he has been working in private practice for years and she has just started recently.  The book doesn't go into any depth on how to start and maintain a private practice, but it's a great starting place to get yourself acquainted to what you need to consider if having a practice.  Highly recommended as a starting point!	2002-02-26

This book should be most beneficial to persons who are attempting to implement or improve the delivery of family reunification programs.  However, there are &quot;jewels&quot; throughout the book that should help anyone working in the foster care setting.  <br />The various authors not only explain why it is important to reunify families when possible, but methods and programs are shared to give case workers ideas of how to improve their services.  A great bonus with this book is that it is well-edited  so that the chapters are actually enjoyable and easy to read.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-12-29

This is one of the most important family systems theories in the history of family therapy and it is still one of the most widely used theories for working with families.  Anyone that is studying family therapy should read this book as it is the seminal work on Bowen Therapy.  Essential ideas such as triangling, emotional fusion, and intergenerational transmission are well explained.<br />One of the best things about this book is that it is highly readable.  This book can be beneficial to anyone interested in learning more about families.  It can be helpful to the lay person as well as to the professional family therapist.	2001-12-29

Of course, if you're getting your first copy it is best to start out with the most recent edition.<br />The main thing that I would like to encourage you to do is to buy this desk reference edition as opposed to the full size edition.  Most anything you would need to understand and to make appropriate diagnoses is included in the desk reference.  It comes in a size that you can carry around with you wherever you go and is therefore not burdensome like the &quot;full size&quot; DSM.  My desk reference has been a &quot;life-saver&quot; many times.	2001-12-29

This book explains the concepts behind the theory and helps the clinician understand how to put the therapy into practice.

In so doing, the reader is able to do some of their own &quot;therapy&quot; without having to pay a family counselor.<br />I often recommend this book to persons that I see in counseling and those that read it have come back with glowing reports.	2001-12-22

Persons who are acquainted with Christian scripture should consider reading at least the New Testament of this edition since it is the primary English Bible that has been used in the past several hundred years. There is also something very nice about reading scripture in this antiquated and poetic language. Some may have difficulty reading in 17th century English, but it is worth the effort. For those who are unacquainted with Christian scripture, I would reccommend starting with a more modern version. It's a lot easier to understand the stories when you aren't also trying to figure out the language. This version only doesn't get the full 5 stars because it is extremely difficult to read many parts of the Old Testament in \\"Olde English.\\"	2001-11-15

It's been a while since I've read the book, but I wanted to share some of the general impressions that I had of this book when I read it.  By showing the example of inadequate police work in one community, the author is able to raise many questions about the legal system in America. Plenty of evidence is given in this book which shows that a person was convicted for murder and likely sits in prison unjustly. Anyone who believes that justice is always served in our court systems should read this book to learn how various factors can come together to work against possibly innocent persons. This book is important, intriguing, and difficult to put down.	2001-11-15

I often had trouble putting the book down. Unfortunately, the brilliant parts of the book were too seldom. I am from Fresno and really enjoyed the parts of the book that dealt with Fresno's history of corruption and I also enjoyed the author's investigations into the murder. However, the family history was largely irrelevant to the murder and generally boring to me (I think that Armenian immigrants or other European immigrants would probably enjoy these parts). The author could have written two seperate books: one about his family and one about the murder. The author has put a lot of time and research into this book and I hope that he will consider writing a more complete history of Fresno's history of police and political corruption.	2001-09-05

This is truly one of the best books that I have ever read. Not only is it enjoyable and easy to read, but the authors give good examples of how people can change their relationship with money and take control of their life. This isn't like other &quot;money&quot; books because this one really advocates a paradigm shift and encourages you to place emphasis in your life on things that are really most important to you. My wife and I follow many of the ideas presented in this book and it has helped us work less and spend more time with family than we would if we were still driven by consumerism.	2001-08-30

It was especially interesting to see how she dealt with the polygamy issue with Joseph Smith and also to see how well she raised her children after his death. The only reason that I marked this book down a little was because the first third of the book was a little difficult to get through. In this part of the book it seemed to me that I was reading a biography of Joseph Smith, rather than Emma. As a footnote, it was also interesting to note some of the trials the authors have faced from church leaders due to their writing this book. They seemed to have gotten into a little trouble for sharing some of the less flattering aspects of Joseph Smith's and Brigham Young's actions. If anything, the authors treaded lightly in these areas and could have been much more blunt in sharing their character defects in regards to their treatment of Emma. But kudos to the authors for being willing to write what they did.	2001-08-27

It's really pretty boring to read, too. There are some parts that provide inspiration, but they're few and far between--or else they're just copies straight out of the Bible. If you're buying this book to learn about Mormonism, you're better off starting with a commentary or history of the Mormons.

It seems difficult for biographers to be neutral on him. Although the author genuinely attempts to be unbiased, she often takes facts from his life and comes up with a negative interpretation of his actions: much the way a church member would take the same events and come up with a positive interpretation.<br />The book is very readable and there is factual information in the book that is difficult to find in other places. These are the highlights of this biography.<br />The downside is the author's unintentional slant against Joseph which leads to many assumptions that may or may not be accurate.<br />In sum, to better understand the life of Joseph Smith this would be a good book to read, but the reader should certainly get more than this one view point before making any firm judgements.	2001-08-09

The author helps you to challenge the dominant paradigm and to better understand that our world may not have always functioned under the patriarchal model that currently predominates.  She gives several examples and paints a wonderful picture of how things might have been in the past and how we can improve our society currently.  The only reason that this book doesn't get &quot;Five Stars&quot; is because it is so highly based on speculation.  Anyone who thinks that the author's assumptions are definitely true doesn't understand how little we really know about our distant ancestors.  If the reader can keep in mind that this book is primarily speculative, it is a book that should be on anyone's reading list.	2001-08-09

Unfortunately, that is also it's only drawback. Brody gives much of the \\"negative\\" information while minimizing the many characteristics that made Joseph Smith such a charismatic and popular figure. It is good that people have a place to learn about Joseph's deceitful living as a youth, the real history behind the Book of Mormon, and his philandering with married women while prophet; but the biography would be much more powerful if it included a more balanced presentation of his strengths, also.<br />Despite the slant against Joseph Smith, this book is excellent. Brody has done thorough and well-documented research and has written in a style that makes this book a pleasureable read. It is a must for anyone interested in American, Western, or Mormon history. However, this is probably not the book that a practicing Mormon who is happy with their faith should read.	2001-08-09
