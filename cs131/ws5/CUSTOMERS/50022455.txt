Coleman wrote AT MOTHER'S REQUEST (1985).  I found it by far the more informative and gripping of the two accounts. <br /> The authors relied on different sources.  Alexander seems to have been very diligent in exhaustively interviewing members of this extremely dysfunctional family.  But Coleman had better access to law enforcement sources, and so tells the story as a police, and prosecutorial, man (and woman) hunt. <br /> The different sources and perspectives have many consequences.. For example, Alexander mentions at one point that Marc Schroeder's defense attorneys introduced into court a tape of his mother berating his sister (who was 6 years old and a budding ballerina, the inspiration for Alexander's title).  Frances shrieks at the young girl in the most horrible way for her inability to spit out the complete definition of a sentence.  &quot;A sentence begins with a capital letter, expresses a complete thought, and ends with a period, exclamation point, or question mark,&quot; -- quite a mouthful to memorise at six! <br /> As I say, Alexander mentions this tape, but we have to take her word for it that it shows Frances doing that.  Coleman actually reproduces a substantial portion of the transcript of the tape for us, so we draw our own conclusion about Mom's abusiveness.  <br /> Both authors seem to have invented false names to protect the budding ballerina.  Alexander calls her &quot;Aradne&quot; as I think I remember.  Coleman calls her &quot;Lavinia.&quot;  If ever there was a good case for changing the name to protect the innocent, this is it!  Still, we can draw the conclusion that she must have some multi-syllabic and classical//mythical name.  She must be an adult by now of,course (2000).  I wonder whether she grew up all right after all this and whether she had an adult ballet careeer and even what she is doing now. <br /> Alexander wrote a decent book.  But if you're only going to read one, read Coleman's.	2000-12-17

I've been out of college for several years, yet I would expect that many political-science courses still include some reference to various debates over &quot;pluralism&quot; as a theory of how the American system of politics works.  Pluralism in the form Weber has in mind was classically formulated in the writings of Robert Dahl in the 1960s.  <br /> The general model came under immediate attack from both the right and the left.  The left thought the model was actually an idealization of the way decisions are made in the U.S. which is  (they charged) more elitist and class-based than Dahl's books made it out to be.  <br /> Many scholars to Dahl's right complained that he assumes a post-New-Deal world, with a wide-ranging regulatory system in place, and only wants to study how a plurality of interest groups influences that system.  He thus forecloses by assumption what is for some of his critics the crucial question whether that system should exist in the first place, whether it should not in fact be dismantled. <br /> Such arguments over pluralism were getting a little passe when I took undergrad poli-sci courses in the late 1970s, but they were still considered important enough to require coverage.  If that is still the case, then this will be a valuable book.  An interesting group of environmental issues and detailed coverage of how decisions are made, leads Weber to some updating of the old Dahlian model.	2000-12-09

I had some prior exposure to some of the matters treated here (for example, I was already knowledgeable about the life and work of Pascal) but even where Bernstein covered matters I know, I found the style fresh and amusing. <BR><br /> In other areas, Bernstein covered matters of which I had been completely ignorant, and I learned a good deal.  I plan to pursue some of the sources in his notes. <BR><br /> All that having been said, the book is not perfect.  John Maynard Keynes seems to be an idol of Bernstein's, and he is an idol with feet of clay.  Take the half-chapter devoted to worship of Keynes with that caution.  <BR><br /> Furthermore, Bernstein sometimes retails an aneecdote as if its solid historical fact.  He quotes Morgan saying, &quot;prices will fluctuate.&quot;  That is an aphorism attributed to many financiers over the years -- Baruch most often.

Now Neftci has obliged us again, adding seven new chapters on recent and more complex material in this fast-changing field of applied mathematics.<br />The new material focuses on normalization -- the technique of obtaining pricing equations for ratios of asset prices instead of for the prices themselves. Normalization is a very powerful tool for grapplig with dynamic situations.  And as it happens one of its applications is to martingales, the relation of an asset price to the passage of time.  Normalizing a martingale proves to be, in Neftci's words, &quot;quite useful in pricing interest sensitive derivative instruments.&quot;<br />Obviously not a book for the mathematically faint of heart, but the title provides sufficient warning!

Grant made a second, and related, error in personally directing Meade, while leaving Sherman to himself.  These goofs caused many thousands of lives on both sides.  The war could have been brought to an end much sooner had the full weight of the federals been put behind a drive to and then beyond Atlanta, under Thomas' leadership and perhaps with Grant's supervision, with Meade left in control of the Army of the Potomac.<br />On the confederate side, I see this book as rehabilitating Hood, and as driving a stake through whatever remains of Joe Johnston's once-high but always undeserved reputation.	2000-11-16

Obviously, historical perspective is one part of our grapplings with that issue.<br />Unfortunately, this book has a very narrow scope.  The author usually uses the word &quot;school&quot; to mean &quot;public school,&quot; so he has very little to say about private or parochial education, or the home-schooling movement.<br />Still, he makes an important point.  The public school establishment, administrators and teachers alike, constitutes in many ways a distinct social class, with its own view of the world, and a view that is at odds with the views of many parents. Thus, conflicts between parents and teachers, even on some seemingly trivial points (how much homework?  what kind of Christmas decorations should be allowed) is necessarily a political struggle.<br />The public-schooling establishment sees itself as the bearer of some high altruistic apolitical virtue.  But that attitude is just one political fact among others.	2000-11-08

Hansen spent a lot of time with the Penan villagers of Borneo some years back. In order to help these villagers develop a cash crop, Hansen devised what he thought was a practical plan for an orchid nursery. Of course, to a pragmatist this doesn't seem at odds with the goal of protecting orchids from extinction Â­ it is in fact a means to that end, a harnessing of the profit motive for that cause. To his shock, Hansen discovered that CITIES stood in his way. <br /><BR> He quotes a scientist friend who told him, &quot;It is perfectly legal to flood an orchid habitat with a hydroelectric dam, log it, level the hillsides for a road, build a golf course on the site, or burn the jungle to the ground for agricultural purposes, but CITIES' influence and rules makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to salvage the plants and sell them.&quot; Hansen was intrigued enough to study the question and provide us with this book. He profiles several men, and some women, who have each been portrayed in the international press as scheming orchid pirates threatening the ecosystem for a quick buck. He finds them to be, in fact, pragmatic conservationists. Read it not only for the point, but to make the acquaintance of Eleanor Kerrigan, Terry Root, Ali Kumbaser, Au Yong Nag Yip, and especially Dr. Guido Braem, whose encounter with CITIES regulations has a positively Kafkaesque feel to it.	2000-11-03

Dunbar explains  much that Lowenstein simply assumes we know -- things like what is an  interest-rate swap, and why the parties on both sides of it are acting  rationally in entering into such a contract, WHEN they both are. <BR><br />  From a narrative point of view, Dunbar has a more compelling emphasis, but  both authors have something of value to contribute.  Dunbar sticks closely  to the partners themselves -- giving fascinating bio. sketches and  psychological insight for Meriwether, Scholes, Merton, and Mullins.   Lowenstein takes a very different approach, because he seems to have gotten  his story mostly from the &quot;counter-parties,&quot; the folks outside  LTCM who dealt with it on a regular basis.  So his book belongs to Herbert  Allison and David Komansky (of Merrill Lynch) and Jon Corzine (then of  Goldman Sachs, now a New Jersey politician), and others in similar  positions. <BR><br /> This emphasis provides the book's interesting moments,  and is why I can give it two stars.  It is a worthwhile addition to the  literature developing around this inciddent. <BR><br /> Politically,  Lowenstein has his axes to grind.  He wants to discredit Fed chairman  Greenspan, the late philosopher Ayn Rand, and the efficient markets  hypothesis.  He scores no real hits on any of those targets, but his sloppy  efforts to do so are distracting.	2000-09-17

There are three very different audiences  for works on finance.  There are ordinary folks, who work for wages or  salary, have built up a modest nest, and want some rise-averse suggestions  on how to invest it.  Then there are people with enough money to get more  daring with it, or at least with some portion of their portfolio.  This  second group, the so-called &quot;sophisticated investors,&quot; are the  ones who are literally looking for alpha. <br /><BR> Then there is a third  group, those whose concern with matters of finance is mostly intellectual.   They may want supplemental reading for a college course, or they may be  life-long sufferers from curiosity, or even Washingtonian policy wonks.  <br /><BR> My point is -- a focused book begins with a decision as to one's  audience.  Warwick never makes that decision, there are bits and pieces of  this book for all three, but a satisfactory whole just isn't here for  anybody. <br /><BR> The book is also error prone.  Consider the very first  graph, on page 5.  The caption tells us, &quot;The part of the curve  extending from point A and above designates the optimum return for a given  amount of risk.&quot;  But the above graph doesn't contain ANY POINT A!   One can figure it out eventually, where point A should be.  But the value  of a well-drafted graph is that it gives us a sense of certain  relationships at a glance. So this sort of mistake -- one example of many,  is devastating.	2000-08-19

W. von Metternich, Ludwig von Beethoven,  William James, Josephine Baker, Dorothy Sayers.  Yet this is not simply an  encyclopedia -- it is a single, coherent narrative in which all those folks  and so many others find a natural place, and through which we get to know  them better than we could through any amount of browsing through  encyclopedias! <br /> Very briefly, the book turns on such themes as  primitivism and emancipation.  If you have in mind some conception of a  &quot;golden age&quot; before all the modern troubles entered into the  world, then for you primitivism and emancipation tend to merge.  We must be  emancipated from those relatively recent shackles to return to that  wonderful world.  For Martin Luther and his followers, the primitive golden  age was the early Church, so they proposed to set aside all subsequent  theological and ecclesiastical developments.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau had a  different sort of golden age in mind, the world of the noble savage. <br /> In  the 1920s, Josephine Baker's Parisian admirers thought her dancing  &quot;primitive,&quot; and so emancipated/ing. But since in our own time  everybody can choose their own preferred golden age, possibilities lie  before us like so many items on a menu, the notions of emancipation  conflict with one another and produce a deadlock, central to the decadence  of the title..	2000-08-05

The book's  epilogue actually begins with the question, &quot;In the end, did Alan  Greenspan save the world?&quot; It doesn't provide an explicit answer, but  the general drift of the final pages of this book is in the direction of a  &quot;yes.&quot;<br />The policy implication, which I think is dead wrong, is  that central bankers need to be given more power and discretion so they can  &quot;save the world&quot; more reliably in the future. Actually, Dunbar's  own evidence shows the LTCM was the victim, not the cause, of such events  as the collapse of Russia's ruble.  Greenspan did not &quot;save the  world&quot; from such shocks, which are continuing and must continue.  He  simply took part in one particular instance of their repurcussions.   <br />Still, it is a merit of this book that it gives you the conceptual tools  with which to argue with its conclusions.	2000-05-20

It is a classic of conservative thought.  Not libertarian or pro-capitalist thought, either, CONSERVATIVE thought.<br />What does that mean?

So I'll just add my little bit by quoting a sample of Catton's prose, to show how he puts the reader right in the  middle of the action.<br />This passage concerns the Union charge at Cold  Harbor. <br />&quot;Two hundred yards from the starting point Gibbon's  division hit a deep swamp whose existence nobody had known about, and the  swamp split the line in two....The swamp grew wider as the men advanced and  the separated halves could not rejoin, and in the swamp there were many  snipers who took a heavy toll, and in the end two separated brigades went  staggering up to the invulnerable trenches....there is memory of a colonel  standing on a parapet, swinging his sword and shouting to his men to come  on.  But the colonel went down, his lifeless body draped across the  parapet, and he was hit thereafter by so many stray bullets that when a  truce was declared a few days later he could be identified only by the  buttons on his sleeve.&quot;	2000-02-22

The analogy between Reconstruction in the period just  after the Civil War on the one hand, and the Civil Rights movement of the  1950s and 1960s that Kousser calls the &quot;second&quot; Reconstruction,  is lame.<br />The very first sentence shows some of the problems with this  book.  &quot;Institutions and institutional rules -- not customs, ideas,  attitudes, culture, or private behavior -- have primarily shaped race  relations in America.&quot;  If he took that sentence seriously, it would  lead him into a definitional swamp, analyzing the different but overlapping  meaanings of all the words used there, discussing which one is  &quot;primary&quot; and for what reason.  He does not take it seriously  enough to get us mired in that swamp, but it remains a weak opening.<br />The  best book in this field is David T. Canon's, RACE, REDISTRICTING, AND  REPRESENTATION.	2000-02-20
