Her earliest memories were of her father's death, and going to Paris to live with her mother.  It was Gloria's greatest desire just to be noticed by her mother, to hear her voice, and maybe, if she were good enough, to actually be loved by her.  But they were never alone; they were always surrounded by relatives, lovers, movie stars, and even royalty, and her only source of love was her beloved nurse.<br /><br />At the age of ten, Gloria was involved in a controversial custody battle between her mother and her aunt, who became Gloria's new guardian.  Gloria lived in a series of mansions and penthouses and watched the whirl of high society life around her as through a veil, never really connecting with anyone and having no idea who she really was or where she belonged.<br /><br />This book is a rare peek into a girl's soul, a girl who just happened to be the most famous little rich girl in the country.  She called herself The Imposter; fatherless, almost-motherless, whispered-about but never talked to, her life directed by lawyers and drowning in loneliness.  As she said, if her story were a play, her part would be so small, she would be an understudy.  \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is exciting, touching, and well-written, and impossible to put down.<br /><br />Kona	2005-10-02

It clarifies the often-conflicting stories of Yul Brynner's birth, describes his childhood in Paris (where he spent his time entertaining in gypsy night clubs), and his memorable stint on Broadway in \\"The King and I\\" in the 1950s.  His film successes, such as \\"The King and I\\" and [[ASIN:B000CNESNA The Ten Commandments]], and his many screen flops are discussed, but it is Yul, the family man, who is at the center of the book.<br /><br />When Rock was young, his father doted on him; even after his parents divorced and Yul moved on through three more marriages, the two were close. But when his son failed to achieved stability or success as a young adult, Yul summarily cut off all ties with him for a while.  In the 1980s, out of money (as always), Yul began an eight-year tour of \\"The King and I\\" which was hugely successful, but he identified with the role so completely, he became an unreasonable tyrant, alienating himself from those closest to him.  He kept doing eight shows a week even after he was diagnosed with cancer, dying just weeks after his 4,633rd performance as the King.<br /><br /> This is a riveting biography about a fascinating man.<br /><br />Kona	2005-09-19

Bridget obsesses constantly about her weight and unmarried state, and as the year begins, she also obsesses about her playboy boss, Daniel Cleaver.  They flirt madly and have an on-again, off-again relationship, but he is a commitment-phobe (and a bounder!).<br /><br />All through the year, Bridget's flighty mother, Pam, tries to pair her up with successful barrister, Mark Darcy, but Bridget will have none of it.  As the year comes to a close, however, Pam's legal woes bring Mark to the rescue, and the diary ends on a happy note.<br /><br />Every page is filled with situations and emotions that all women who have dated, dreamed, been disappointed, and found solace in ice cream will find utterly hilarious.  Bridget's  descriptions of daily exasperation, desperation, and moments of sheer bliss make her very likeable and real.  The short diary entries make this book perfect for reading when you just have a few minutes, although you'll find it hard to put down, and may find yourself laughing out loud (a lot).<br /><br />Kona	2005-09-03

She adored him, but he was cold and aloof, and died when Mia was young.  By 20, she was a TV and movie star, and Mrs. Frank Sinatra.  A few years later, she married conductor Andre Previn.  By the time she met Woody Allen, she had a large biological and adopted family; Woody disliked the children and was openly contemptuous of them.  He was often distant and abusive to Mia as well, although she appeared in 13 of his movies.  The appalling revelation of Woody's affair with one of Mia's daughters and molestation of another made the last part of the book truly horrific.<br /><br />I listened to the audio cassette version, read by the author.  Mia's flat and unexpressive reading voice had no variation in inflection or pace to express either happiness, grief, or anger.  Without explanation, another reader took over in the seventh tape, and Mia returned in the eighth.<br /><br />The events of Mia's life were dramatic and mesmerizing, with an endless parade of the rich and famous.  From her childhood, she tried desperately to please the men in her life, to gain the strength she lacked through them, at the expense of her own self-esteem.  She finally found the peace she was seeking in her role as mother to her 14 children.  It is an absorbing and moving story.<br /><br />Kona	2005-08-11

Charlton Heston's larger-than-life screen presence comes through on every page of his wonderful 1995 autobiography, which is a really great read.  Heston grew up poor in the woods of northern Michigan, where he was lonely and painfully shy.  He gained confidence in his high school's senior play, and as he says, he never looked back.  He won a university scholarship, and there he had his first-ever date.  Her name was Lydia; she was an acting student, and they have been happily married now for over 60 years.<br /><br />Heston began his career on the stage; he loves acting in and directing plays, especially Shakespeare, and has done almost as many plays as movies.  We get all the fascinating behind-the-scenes stories, learn which movies he is most proud of and those that make him cringe, the co-stars he admired and those he didn't.  He has no false modesty about his power as an international movie star, yet he comes across as a genuinely nice man who treasures his family.<br /><br />Fans of Charlton Heston are sure to enjoy this heartfelt autobiography.<br /><br />Kona	2005-08-04

This is the touching story of one very important summer in a young girl's life.  Lily is fourteen, miserable, and motherless.  Her mother died when Lily was four; a gun was involved, but it's just a blurred memory.  She lives on a peach farm in rural South Carolina with her loathsome father, T. Ray.  It is 1964; the Civil Rights Act has just been signed and is affecting white and black people alike.  Lily decides to run away and sets out to learn the truth about her late mother.  Her journey takes her to the \\"calendar sisters,\\" May, June, and August Boatwright, whose world embraces and transforms her.<br /><br />Each chapter of the book begins with a bee factoid which foreshadows what will happen next. The author paints a vivid word picture of life in a dusty, suffocatingly hot Southern town, where segregation has been the norm, but that is about to change.  You can almost hear the soothing hum of the bees and smell the honey as Lily and August work in the honey house.  You really feel Lily's confusion, torment, and self-loathing.  I  enjoyed this compelling tale of a girl's search for happiness and the women who help her find it.<br /><br />Kona	2005-06-21

He also found salvation and peace.<br /><br />I listened to the audio cassette version, read by the author.  He has a very flat reading voice which was hard to get used to, but I did, and the story was so touching and believable that I was sure it must be autobiographical.

She and Toby marry, and then she uses her new power to destroy those who hurt her. Little did she know it would all end in murder.<br /><br />This novel is a departure for Sidney Sheldon, who usually writes thrillers with beautiful, young heroines facing disaster every few pages. He does know show biz, however, being a prolific Oscar and Emmy-winning writer. Here he creates two characters who manage to be sympathetic despite being completely without scruples, and you'll find the book hard to put down. He carefully weaves characters and details, slowly building to a surprising and very satisfying conclusion. This is a well-written, exciting  story about the world of actors, agents, and directors (it's fun to try to guess which characters may have been based on real people).

He has rituals to help protect himself, such as avoiding the colors yellow and brown, hiding in very small places, and counting cars to see if it's going to be a good day or a bad day.

Mary Ashley is brave, but definitely from the Donna Reed School for Wives and she has two (perfect) kids, to boot.

Their decision is met with disbelief, curiosity, and even hostility by their neighbors, who always decorate their homes alike and can't understand the Krank's decision to opt-out of the usual lights, tree, cards, parties, and gifts.  The Kranks are firm in their resolve, however, and are eagerly anticipating their Caribbean vacation, when their daughter arrives on Christmas Eve (complete with a new finance) expecting all the usual trimmings. What are they going to do - go on the cruise as planned or run around like mad people fixing up the house for Christmas?  Well, of course, we all know the answer to that one.<br /><br />This story is so predictable and corny that I was amazed John Grisham wrote it.  It can easily be read in one sitting and has absolutely no surprises or drama or honest emotion.  The humor is only mildly amusing at best, and the book reads like a half-hour sit-com script, full of pratfalls, non-stop, manic action, and stereotypical characters we don't really like or care about.

Oh, she's also a professional criminal.  The story opens as Tracy is wrongly convicted of attempted murder (well, OK; she DID shoot him!) and begins serving a harrowing prison term.  After her surprising release, she plots revenge on all the people who have hurt her.  This was my favorite part of the book.  Tracy then becomes involved with a con-man and ends up as a world-famous thief, stealing treasures in the capitals of Europe.  She also finds love with another thief, but can she trust him?<br /><br />If you can overlook Tracy's criminal life and the joy she takes in it, you'll love this book.  It describes in minute detail how she manages to steal from the most securely-guarded museums, stores, and homes in Europe.

This year, the school is hosting international students, and the mysterious \\"Tri-Wizard Tournament\\" is taking place.  Although Harry doesn't enter the competition, his name is drawn from the \\"Goblet of Fire\\" and he is one of the four players, along with Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts and students France and Bulgaria.   They must face three dangerous challenges during the school year. Will Harry master them or will he be killed trying? Who entered his name in the tournament and why?      The book begins and ends with surprisingly violent scenes that may shock you, but will certainly grab your attention.  There is a very funny chapter concerning the Yule Ball; you'll smile at Harry and Ron's efforts as they face the daunting task of inviting girls to the dance.  And the students, of course, have a new D.A.D.A. teacher; this year it's Mad-Eye Moody. This book truly has it all; exciting characters and heart-pounding action, as well as the great friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione that is the heart of all the HP books.  You won't want to put this book down, even after 700 pages.  Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter so far!    Kona	2004-10-04

The second Harry Potter book finds Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione back for their second year at Hogwarts School.  Two new characters are introduced - a house elf named Dobby who wants to save Harry's life, and the new DADA teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, a pompous braggart. This year, a secret room in the castle has been opened; it contains a monster which has  attacked some students. As Harry and his pals try to learn who is controlling the monster, they find a fifty-year old blank diary, which belonged to a boy named Tom Riddle. There is a very exciting climax involving Harry, Tom, and the  monster. As always, the friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione is the key ingredient that makes the HP books so heartwarming and memorable.<br /><br />Jim Dale does not merely read the book, he performs it. Each of the many characters has a very distinct voice and personality. Hermoine is girlish, Lockhart is comically vain, and Dumbledore is frail, yet powerful. I happily recommend the audio version thanks to Jim Dale's entertaining performance.<br /><br />Kona	2004-10-03

They have recently lost their parents and are on the run from their mean grandfather, whom they have never met.  They find an abandoned boxcar in the woods, set up housekeeping, and live quite happily on berries, bread, and a little meat bought with the oldest boy's gardening pay. Life is very good until one of the girls becomes sick and they must tell an adult about where they live.<br /><br />The book was written in the 1942 by a teacher who cleverly used only the 500 most common words in the English language to create a very easy to read, yet exciting, beginning chapter book for 7 and 8 year olds.  Most of the story concerns the children's sense of fun and boundless resourcefulness, as they take care of themselves, all the while being cheerful and thankful for what they have.  Children who are ready for a chapter book will be delighted to find this one is very easy to read.  They will enjoy the children's adventure of living in the woods without adults, and, of course, it has a very happy ending.  This book is the first (and I think the best) of a very long series of adventures for the Boxcar Children.	2004-09-26

The story opens on Christmas morning, as a little boy receives a stuffed rabbit and plays with it - for a few minutes. Gradually, the boy does come to love the rabbit, whose innocent little heart almost bursts with joy, because he knows that being loved is how toys become \\"real.\\" The boy and rabbit are fast friends, until one day the boy becomes very sick...<br /><br />This story is so timeless and honest in its emotion, you will not be able to read it without shedding tears. The little bunny's desire to be real, and how that wish comes true, make for a classic story that I enjoy reading again and again.  It deserves more than 5 stars. Read it aloud with your child!	2004-09-26

This riveting tale of fear, suspicion, and love opens as the unnamed narrator reminisces about her former home, the grand English estate, Manderley.  She had been young and shy, a lady's companion, when she met the wealthy recent widow, Maxim de Winter, fell in love with him, and married him in a matter of weeks.  They returned to his home, where she was immediately overwhelmed with the responsibilities of running the house and dealing with her forbidding housekeeper as well as the memory of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca.  She had been beautiful, sophisticated, and supremely confident, and the narrator felt lost and helpless in comparison.  Her new husband was strangely distant to her, until a horrible secret was revealed that would change their lives and the very existence of Manderley.<br /><br />Daphne Du Maurier has crafted a wonderfully spooky story with remarkably little action, but a great deal of atmosphere and a steadily mounting feeling of impending doom.  The ravishing Rebecca is never seen, and yet she is the main character, dominating the story with her passions and cruelty.  Another main \\"character\\" is the great house itself, which is described in such fascinating detail that I felt as if I had walked its long hallways, descended its grand stairs, and had tea in the library.  The narrator is purposely kept anonymous to contrast her with the larger-than-life Rebecca, and Maxim is a seriously flawed but lovable man.<br /><br />Anna Massey does not just read the story, she performs it, delighting the listener with her upper-class British accent, giving a different voice to each character.  I happily recommend this audio cassette version of Rebecca to those who enjoy exciting tales of suspense, psychological dramas, and mysteries.	2004-08-09

They are resourceful children and cleverly escape a near-tragedy, only to find themselves preparing to live with yet another unknown relative in Book Two.<br /><br />I was curious to see if this series lived up to the hype, and unfortunately for me, it didn't.  Maybe children are drawn to the author's quirky name, the Adams-family-like cover illustrations, or the the book's length (it's more like a short story than a novel).  In any event, the story is completely lacking in emotion or excitement; the very thin plot never captured my imagination or made me care about the characters.  The setting and time of the story are annoyingly vague (the children see horse-drawn wagons and also mention computers) and the plot alternates between trying to be real and fantasy.  There is little description of the children's grief or fears, and chores like cooking a meal are treated as child abuse.  Worst of all, the storyteller is very self-important and patronizing toward his readers, frequently interrupting the story to define words and warn about the supposedly horrible events to follow.	2004-06-27

The Pilot's Wife is an insightful tale of loss and betrayal.  As the story opens, Kathryn, a pilot's wife, has been told that her husband's plane has crashed and there are no survivors.  We follow Kathryn into the numbing, silent, surreal world known to those who suffer loss.  Memories of her happy marriage engulf her and paralyze her, but she begins to cope with the help of a kind man from the pilot's union.  In the second half of the book, Kathryn pieces together clues left by her husband that lead to shocking revelations about him, and eventually, the healing process begins.<br /><br />The first half of the book was an accurate picture of one in the grieving process; unfortunately, it was too long and became somewhat tedious.  The second half, however, was very exciting, and I could hardly turn the pages fast enough to see what would happen next.  The climax is quite satisfying and made me glad I stuck with it and finished the book.<br /><br />The Pilot's Wife would make an excellent movie, with lots of romance, tragedy and intrigue.  If you like stories that are full of surprises, you'll enjoy this book.	2004-06-04

This book is a memoir of their personal and professional life together starting as the toast of vaudeville, continuing with their radio show for seventeen years, and later, situation comedy stars on television.  Both George and Gracie started appearing on stage as children, and they teamed up in 1923, earning five dollars a week, doing four shows a day.  At first, Gracie was the straight man and George said the punch lines, but they soon learned it was better the other way around.  Gracie played the ditzy girlfriend and wife for thirty-five years and, as George said, he just stood next to her.  He never stopped being amazed at her talent, beauty, and intelligence, and he loved her more with each passing day.  The book ends with her death, from heart disease in 1958, and one is left with a lovely and intimate picture of their marriage.<br />Burns wrote the book as if he were talking with a dear friend, and there is a vaudeville joke in nearly every paragraph.  The jokes are still funny today, and the book is a quick and very entertaining read.  There is a lot of behind the scenes chatter about their famous Hollywood friends, especially Jack Benny, but it is first and foremost a tribute to Gracie and the love they shared for so many years.  I heartily recommend this book, especially to those who enjoyed the Burns and Allen TV show in the fifties.  It will bring back a lot of happy memories.	2004-04-14

He has rescued young Michelle Trutor from her abusive boyfriend, and brought her to his New Hampshire home (believed by some to be haunted) to unravel a mystery.  He wants her to write a book about his much older and long-dead sister, Caroline, who raised him and his twin brother, but was a cold and cruel stranger to them.  Caroline left a series of riddles, a strange map, and a journal as clues to her secret life and her real identity, which take Trutor from Boston to London and back again in a shocking conclusion.<br /><br />This unusual story will keep you guessing, and will give you some scares and laughs along the way. The author has created unique and vibrant characters:  Trutor is strong, intelligent, and brave, Arthur is sweet and vulnerable, his brother Proctor is wildly eccentric, niece Roberta is hard as nails, on the surface at least, houseguest Sissy is struggling with an abusive husband, and Caroline's character reaches out from the grave to frighten and fascinate.<br /><br />The picturesque countryside of New England is described in such enchanting terms you will want to see it for yourself.  You will enjoy trying to figure out the riddles and clues to Caroline's double and even triple life, but even more, you will enjoy the deep bond of friendship between Trutor and the Balloonist.	2004-04-10

The killer now stalks Lacey, who must enter the witness-protection program and begin a new life.  Lacey tries to piece together clues about the death of the woman's daughter by reading her cryptic journal.<br />&quot;Queen of Suspense&quot; Mary Higgins Clark  writes about attractive, independent young women who are in peril.  I always picture a young Jacqueline Smith  playing all of her heroines.  This novel is not one of her best.  It is full to overflowing with a cast of forgettable characters meant to keep us guessing which one could be the villain.  The plot unfolds at a snail's pace and is padded with minute and distracting details that lead nowhere.  A new character, introduced in the last chapters, changes the outcome, which feels suddenly rushed and trite.  Clark has written many nail-biting thrillers;  Pretend You Don't See Her is not among them.	2004-04-06

Lawyer Emily Graham has just moved into her ancestral home in a picturesque seaside village when a series of murders begins.  And not just any murders:  They replicate to the last detail a series of murders that took place there one hundred years ago, and  the anniversary of the last killing is this Saturday...who will be next?<br />Mary Higgins Clark has created a strong heroine in Emily and filled the story with a large cast of suspects that will keep you guessing until the last minute.  My favorite chapters were those narrated by the unseen killer, who may be just demented or may be the reincarnation of the original killer.<br />The frequent comparisons between town life in the Victorian era and the present make me think this would make a lovely and suspenseful film.  And the big question (has the original killer been reincarnated?) makes for fun, if creepy, speculation.  Heartily recommended.	2004-03-24

Kathy, a recovering alcoholic who barely makes it from day to day, finds her modest home taken from her for non-payment of a small tax.  The house is sold at auction to Colonel Behrani, a former Iranian Air Force officer who is having a hard time preserving his pride as he works picking up litter on the highways.  Kathy's bizarre efforts to reclaim her house and the Colonel's stern refusal to negotiate gradually lead to a surprising and overwhelmingly sad conclusion.<br />The story is alternately narrated by Kathy and the Colonel, thus bringing us their most intimate thoughts.  Kathy sees herself as a helpless loser, at war with the world; the Colonel seeks to regain his former power and honor as he strives to understand the strange people in his new country, and the reader must choose who is most deserving of the house. Dubus uses all of the senses to intimately describe their thoughts and it is so absorbing, I could not put it down. If you like character-driven, intensely dramatic stories about ordinary people in conflict, you will enjoy House of Sand and Fog.	2004-02-23

In the process, he discovers Peter's secret life and exposes some of the most powerful socialites in the Hamptons as the ruthless killers they are.<br /><br />In typical Patterson style, this book is a very light, quick read, with 108 (!) short chapters and a doozy of an ending that ties up all the clues and makes you wish it could really happen that way.  Unfortunately, the reader, Gil Bellows, does not have much energy; in fact, he sounds downright drowsy throughout.  His womens' voices are overly breathy and whispery making them sound empty-headed and silly.<br /><br />This is a good book if you like James Patterson's predictable style.  It's a little padded, but still a fun ride to see how the Everyman character of Jack will topple the ultra-rich villians.	2004-02-16

She is a quiet, intelligent girl, fully aware of her rather helpless situation:  She must do the hardest work from morning til night without sympathy or kindness in the cold house.  She does, however, greatly admire the elusive Vermeer, and to her shock and secret joy, he asks her one day to be his model for a painting.<br /><br />Since the uneducated Griet is the story's narrator, author Chevalier has written in a very simple, uncluttered style:  There are virtually no compound sentences, few adjectives, and even fewer words describing emotions.  This is because Griet's lot in life is to serve; it makes no difference how she feels about people, events, or tasks, so she doesn't dwell on them.<br /><br />Griet never refers to Vermeer by name; he is always \\"The Master,\\" or simply \\"Him.\\"  While a bit of an affectation on the part of the author, it reflects Griet's view of him as bigger than life; godlike.  She never puts into words her feelings for him and we learn little about Vermeer, except that he took scant notice of his homelife, which was rife with domestic conflict.  The book is a leisurely-paced picture of life in 17th century Delft.  The last chapter was the most intense and was a satisfying end to Griet's quiet story.	2004-02-06

The story opens in the Louvre, where the curator has just been killed.  His granddaughter, Sophie, a police agent, and Robert Langdon, a famous American &quot;symbologist&quot; become involved in the case - at first to help solve the crime, and then, as the prime suspects.  The crime is connected to two religious organizations; one's mission is to guard the secret truth about the Holy Grail, and the other's job is to keep that information from ever being told.  The action moves from Paris to Rome and on to London in a frantic race to not only solve the murder, but possibly to change the course of Christianity forever.<br />I loved the first one-third of this book!  It was so well-written, I had goosebumps and could not put it down.  The characters are interesting and the plot (in the beginning) is dynamite.  The middle section - which explains the role of the Grail - got bogged down in the details.  The author is exceptionally well-versed in the history of the Opus Dei and Priory of Sion societies.  (Members of the later have included such illuminati as Da Vinci, Botticelli, and Newton over the centuries.)  The problem is, he spends too much time explaining their theories and the action and suspense that characterized the beginning of the book are lost.  The final third, where the story moves to London, regains the original excitement and fast pace and it is, overall, a very good story.<br />Brown knows his art history, and I couldn't help but look up many paintings and artists as he described their significance to the plot.  Those who have been to Paris or London will enjoy revisiting those cities here.  I learned a lot about art, religion, history, and even word origins from reading The Da Vinci Code.  I think it would make an exciting movie.  I heartily recommend it.	2003-12-27

It is narrated by Riddley, who lives in what is left of England, about two thousand years after civilization as we know it was destroyed by a nuclear war. He describes an odyssey he takes when he turns twelve years of age. What sets this book apart from others is that it is written entirely in \\"Riddleyspeak,\\" a kind of pigen English that has evolved after all remnants of society and learning have disappeared. The people of Riddley's world live almost like animals, scratching out an existence, believing in superstition and legend, reduced to the most basic elements of survival. Riddley, on the other hand is semi-literate, thoughtful, and curious about the past and the future.

Justin Chastain walked-on to the University of Oklahoma's Sooners football team and made history.  This is his story.<br /><br />Justin had a rough childhood; his parents should never have married or had a child.  Orphaned at 19, he went to live with his older cousin, Mike, an insurance man who always wanted to play college football - and not just any college, he wanted to play for OU.  Mike had the competitive passion to play, but not the athletic ability; he was destined live in the faded glory of his high school football career. Then, soon after Justin came to live with Mike, there was a mysterious electrical storm, and the lives of the two men were changed forever.<br /><br />This story is a must for football fans. There are vivid descriptions of Division 1 football from practices to the Orange Bowl.  Football fans will feel right at home here; the author shows a real knowledge and love of the game.  This is a story of one man's courage and motivation; it is also a love story and a fantasy.  I recommend it to those who love football, especially at the college level.  Even those who don't know football can appreciate the book's message:  The desire to compete means everything, and that's a lesson everyone can understand.	2003-11-03

I recommend The Life of Pi to those who enjoy stories about courage told in simple, yet quite often profound, terms.	2003-11-01

He tells his life story in a funny, friendly, and exceptionally modest way, as if he were sitting and chatting with his best friend.<br />Michael grew up in a Canadian military family that moved around a lot.  He got his first acting job as a teenager, then dropped out of school to try his luck in Hollywood.  The tv series Family Ties brought him stardom, and the rest is history.  This is not a Hollywood insider's kiss-and-tell book, however.  Indeed, there is no name-dropping or gossip about the rich and famous.  He focuses, instead, on how the love of his parents, siblings, wife, and four children has kept him grounded, helped him overcome alcoholism, and now gives him strength in his battle with Parkinson's disease.<br />Fox loved his work, and faces life without acting, because of the increasingly debilitating symptoms of PD.  He is hopeful for a cure, takes an active part in educating people about it, and helps raise money for research.  This is a quick read, engagingly written, short on self-pity and long on gratitude for his career and his family.  I recommend it to his fans and to those who want to learn more about Parkinson's disease.	2003-10-11

She watches over and visits her family and friends on earth often over the next ten years, as her life and death continue to affect them.<br />The author's writing style is friendly, chatty and irresistible; I couldn't put it down until I was finished.  It is a very quick read - the kind of book you wish wouldn't end.  I loved the first half and cried through it, liked the second half, and understood the ending (but selfishly wish it could have been different).<br />This is a book about a dead child, but it is not macabre; it is warm, loving, honest, and hopeful.  Those who have lost a loved one may well find comfort by reading The Lovely Bones.  I recommend it to those who enjoy insightful, well-written fiction.	2003-10-01

White Oleander is the story of Astrid, a young teenager who comes into the foster-care system, after her hateful mother is convicted of murder.  Astrid tells her story in the first person, as a stream of consciousness, a non-stop, no holds barred description of cruelty, neglect, and utter loneliness.<br />Astrid's tale examines the five foster homes she endured in as many years.  The care-givers ranged from illiterate, drug-addicted trailer [folks] to wealthy, upper-class families, but they all shared the same horrible traits:  They were incredibly selfish and used Astrid to their own ends, ranging from meal-ticket to emotional caretaker.  Astrid describes the horrors she faces calmy and stoicly.  She quickly learns that hope is for [foolish folks]; everybody leaves you eventually, no body cares about you, not even (and especially) your mother.<br />At first, I found Janet Fitch's constant use of analogies and excessive description of minutia to be annoying; however, it soon became a necessary part of the book.  Astrid is a friendless girl who lives in her mind; she is intelligent, analytical, and keenly observant.  Her non-stop flood of description is her way of connecting the past and present, of justifying the evil around her.  I especially appreciated Astrid's comparison of her shattered life to shipwreck skills she read about.  She was constantly trying to \\"drink the dew off the sails\\" of life, as she battled to stay afloat.<br />As I read this book, I found myself thinking, \\"This is real.  This can't be fiction!\\"  The words and emotions ring painfully true and are agonizingly hard to read.

Suddenly, Harry is whisked away to \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" in London; the headquarters for Dumbledore's small anti-Voldemort group. Finally, after about 200 pages of shouting and unfinished sentences, Harry is back on the Hogwarts Express to school.<br /><br />This year at school, there are a few changes: Ron gets on the Quidditch team and he and Hermione are now Prefects. Cho is coming on to Harry, and a sadistic new DADA teacher is making life miserable for everyone. The kids have to study all the time for their OWL exams. Basically, the next 500 pages concern the everyday goings on at school - and we never learn Harry's exam results. I kept waiting for something to happen...some new insight into Snape's role in the Order, Dumbledore getting closer to Harry...but nothing. In fact, Dumbledore doesn't even speak to Harry for most of the story. The story does allow Harry to grow up, come more independent, emotional, and aggressive.  The story  is the the weakest of the series so far, although fans will certainly want to read it.	2003-07-10

When Darkness Falls is a futuristic tale of a man's quest to punish the killer of his parents.

The exciting conclusion finds Jack coming to terms with himself and his past.<br />The book is the first in a series about Jack.  The story is violent to be sure; it is also exciting and visually satisfying.  This book is recommended to action-adventure fans as well as those who enjoy character studies.	2003-06-13

He desperately wants a girlfriend, but doesn't know how to go about it.  He has started college, but finds it boring.  He doesn't feel connected to his family, peers, or God; in fact, he isn't sure how he fits in this world. (He sounds like a lot of nineteen-year-olds, doesn't he?)<br />The boy's fears, frustrations, and longings are examined, and then the story takes him completely out of his familiar surroundings.  He finds himself experiencing something others have only dreamed of and, in the end, discovers what his true purpose in life is.<br /><br />You will enjoy this intensely personal book especially if you also are searching for answers, or know someone who is.  It may even bring back memories of your own youth, and the ending will surprise you!	2003-05-23

It is a humorous  look at one (perhaps more than one?) man's efforts to go to America to live the good capitalistic life.<br />&quot;SGS &amp; S Co. Kettle&quot; is a parody of the overly-complicated and silly instructions that sometimes come with Japanese products.<br />Most of the stories are told in the first person, by people who sound completely rational, but are, in fact, easy targets for ridicule. Russia and the late Communist regime are frequent objects of derision.  The author is constantly playing with words and their meanings, questioning the reader's beliefs, and putting our shortcomings under the microscope.<br />Readers who enjoy thought-provoking and sarcastic reflections on life will certainly enjoy &quot;Arrogance of Truth&quot; by Boris Zubry.	2003-05-20

It concerns Stanley Yelnats, a sad-sack teen who gets sent to a youth camp for supposedly stealing a pair of sneakers.  The camp is in the middle of a desert, and the daily routine for the inmates consists of digging a five foot deep hole in the hard, dry earth.  The mysterious warden believes a treasure was buried there and wants the boys to find it for her.<br /><br />Stanley slowly adjusts to the rigors of daily digging and makes friends with his campmates - a motley assortment of delinquents that includes \\"Zero,\\"  who wants to learn to read and write.<br /><br />This is an entertaining story. The author is a man of very few words, and I found the book less enjoyable than the film version, but several 12 year-olds have told me they loved the book.	2003-05-09

I can, because I have read \\"Miles of Experience,\\" a wonderful collection of short stories by Boris Zubry.  The Twain-like stories are told in such a way that I pictured myself sitting on the author's front porch (or perhaps his  dacha, overlooking the Black Sea), watching the sun set, listenting to the night insects buzz, while he spins warm and fascinating tales of his childhood adventures, his work abroad, or serious stories about Russia.<br /><br />The twelve short stories are told in a gentle and deeply personal voice.  The author speaks with the wisdom of someone who has seen the best and worst in people, and who still manages to find humor in life.  Many of the stories take place in the author's native country, Russia.  \\"Crickets,\\" my favorite story, is the bittersweet tale of one idyllic summer spent at a dacha, when the author built a toy castle and caught crickets to populate it.<br /><br />Those who enjoy reflections on the human condition, told with intimacy and great detail, will surely enjoy \\"Miles of Experience.\\"  I feel I have come to know the author quite well from this book.  He makes me smile.	2003-05-04

Lewis' stepson's life	Lenten Lands is the autobiography of Douglas Gresham, the stepson of C. S. Lewis, the famous writer of many books on Christianity and childrens' fantasies.<br /><br />Douglas Gresham is certainly not famous enough in his own right to warrant writing an autobiography. He came to love C. S. Lewis in the ten years he knew him, but spent the entire time away at various boarding schools.<br /><br />The subtitle of this book is \\"My childhood with Joy Davidman and C. S. Lewis,\\" and yet he writes very little about them. The subject of the book is Douglas Gresham, who had a very ordinary childhood. Those fans of C. S. Lewis hoping to gain insight into the man will be disappointed.	2003-04-19

He was distraught, shocked, and confused, especially about the meaning of life.  The journal rambles from one throught to another, reflecting his daze and despair.<br /><br />I found the book rather difficult to read.  It is only 72 pages long, but each sentence needs to be reread, carefully, in order to follow Lewis' thought processes.  He finds no answers to his questions (mainly:  How could God take his beloved away from him?); he simply asks them.<br /><br />For me, this was not a particularly helpful or insiteful book on grief,  merely one person's thoughts on the subject. I am sure however, that admirers of CS Lewis would find it of interest.	2003-04-19

Catch Me If You Can is Frank Abagnale's account of his life as a con man.  His book is thrilling, incredible, and true.  When he was 16, Frank's parents separated and he ran away to New York City.  Frank, armed with supreme confidence, charm, and intelligence, successfully posed as an airline pilot, attorney (he even passed the bar!), a physician, and a college professor, while living the good life with millions of dollars he got from passing bad checks in over 20 countries; and all of this before he was twenty-one years of age.<br /><br />Frank's wild exploits are told in a humerous, quick-paced style that is very readable.  The joy he found in living the high life and romancing countless ladies around the world is matched by the the utter despair he faced in a brutal French prison where he was entombed in solitary confinement for months.<br /><br />It's clear that Frank knew he was doing wrong, but was so addicted to the high he got from conning that he didn't want to stop.  Frank is now a respected authority on counterfeiting and, in fact, teaches at the FBI Academy.  This is a very exciting book!	2003-01-01

She works all winter on her eggs, and also feeds the wild animals that live around her.  One day, some hunters shoot a goose; she takes it in and nurses it back to health.  She names the goose Rechenka.  Quite by accident, Rechenka ruins all of Babuska's beautiful eggs, but she gives the woman magically painted goose eggs in their place.  Babushka goes to the contest and wins first prize with Rechenka's fabulous eggs, and when she comes home, she discovers one more very special gift from Rechenka.<br />Told very simply with large, colorful illustrations, this story is enjoyed by 6-9 year olds.  It stresses kindness and gratitude, as well as showing a little about Russian customs.  The ending is quite poignant and heartwarming.  It's a beautiful book!	2002-10-23

On the way to school one day, Andy meets a real lion who just happens to have a thorn in his paw. Clever Andy takes the thorn out with his handy pliers and makes a friend of the lion. Weeks later when the circus comes to town, a wild lion escapes from the ring. All the people in the audience run for their lives but, of course, it's Andy's own lion friend, and Andy saves the day.<br />This charming tale is delightful in its fantasy; most 6-9 year olds never quite understand that the lion is in Andy's imagination. The yellow and black illustrations are dated, but they are funny. The book is a winner because of its sweet message of friendship. Who wouldn't want to have a real lion for a friend? Kids 6-8 love this book!	2002-10-23

Okay, this book is not for kids, it's for teachers, principals, school board members, and others involved in that dreaded springtime ritual we like to call \\"Standardized Testing\\" (or as Judy Finchler calls it, the \\"IPTU Test\\"). The humor is there, it's just aimed at adults. Kids young enough to enjoy picture book won't get the scarcasm about the stress teachers and administrators go through each year but adults will howl with laughter!<br />As a teacher, I can honestly say NOTHING in this book is exaggerated...it's all true. The author must be or know a teacher, to understand how agonizing the standardized testing procedure is, and what a meaningless mystery it is to kids. Continuing in the same vein as Miss Malarkey Doesn't Live in Room 10, with a child's-eye-view of teachers, this one also has minimal text and outstanding illustrations. Forget the kids; give this book to a teacher-to-be, or put it in the teacher's lounge during testing week. It will be a sure hit and give them something to chuckle about before they go back to the classroom to say, \\"Make sure you bubble in the entire circle; make no other marks on the page, do not fold, spindle, or mutilate your answer sheet.....\\"	2002-10-23

As a little boy in Japan, he wasn't supposed to play near the neighbor's carp pond, but he did, and fell in!  Mother was a little mad at him, but she was preoccupied with making origami cranes.  She put them on a tree that she brought in from the garden, and explained to her puzzled son that this was called a Christmas tree. (She had lived in California as a girl.) The boy asked for and received a Samurai kite as a Christmas gift.  He never forgot that day, because it was the first time he learned about Christmas, and he never played in the carp pond again.<br /><br />This lovely story introduces us to a traditional Japanese family and to a child who experiences two cultures.

He dreamed (or was it a dream?) that he went to the land of the wild things and became their king. He had a lot of fun there, but missed home, so he came back, and his supper was still warm (I love that line).

The text is very simple, as are the illustrations.  The story is quite touching as the grandfather ages, and can never return to his beloved second home, because of WWII. Cultural differences, such as dress, are shown, as is the unchanging importance of family and tradtion.The author also moved to California as a young man, and now understands even more about his grandfather.  This is liked by children 7-9, and adults will appreciate it on their own level.  After your child reads this book, I recommend Allen Say's book, \\"Tree of Cranes.\\"	2002-10-19

This book has become part of American culture and folklore, and should never be forgotten.  Tom lived in a small town on the Mississippi River in the mid-1800s.  His idyllic life was full of boyhood adventures.  He believed a dead cat could cure warts, you got engaged to a new girl every few weeks, and rules were for the unimaginative.  We all know the major events in the story - the whitewashed fence, Injun Joe, finding buried treasure; but the real story is the glimpse of life as it was so long ago.  The villagers were honest, straight-forward folks who knew everybody's business. They looked after one another and led moral lives. Kids were expected to push the limits while they could, and then grow up.  The rural, folksy dialog is so colorful that it's a must for reading aloud.<br /><br />I recommend this book to adults.  The dialog is so rich and charming and its view of childhood so wistful, you'll want to run away on Tom Sawyer's raft.	2002-08-31

This is the story of  Hank, an ordinary guy who finds a fortune in a crashed plane. His first inclination is to turn the money in, but he's persuaded not to. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, he has murdered someone to protect his secret. This is just the first in a series of blood-curdling events that are so intense and real that you won't be able to put the book down.<br /><br />Hank narrates the story in a very calm, rational, and guiltless manner. Each act is, to him, completly necessary and therefore, blameless. The violence comes quickly and, just when you think it can't get any bloodier, it does. The one constant thread is that Hank still considers himself to be a regular guy, despite having committed unspeakable acts. His conscience is clear and life can go on with very few regrets.<br /><br />The movie version isn't as graphically violent (it couldn't be!) or terrifying (too bad!). I recommend this book to fans of suspense, mystery, and crime. It is a thrilling story!	2002-08-25

Harry Potter is a rather abused 11-year old orphan, who lives with his mean aunt and uncle and their brutish son.  One day, Harry discovers he is a wizard and has been invited to Wizard School. On the train to school, he meets  magical kids Ron and Hermoine who become his best  friends.  Together the trio deal with suspicious teachers, play quidditch (a game played on broomstick), and even solve a mystery involving the evil wizard who killed Harry's parents.<br /><br /> At the heart of the story is the close bond between Harry, Ron, and Hermoine.  They are loyal, courageous, and true-blue, right to the very scary conclusion. This is one page-turner you simply won't want to put down, whether you're a child or an adult.  The writing is nop-notch and you'll soon be off for the bookstore for the other books in the series.	2002-05-06
