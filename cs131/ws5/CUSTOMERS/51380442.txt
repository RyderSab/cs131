TaRessa's debut novel, Hot Spot, is an entertaining and scandalous read to be slowly enjoyed on a cool, autumn day.  Kendra Harrell is highly educated, professionally focused, and looking for the love of her life.  To keep her grounded and add a little spice to her life are Kendra's good friends:  Meghan Bennett and Stephanie Ivey.  When a business deal goes sour and a new opportunity knocks, but it requires jaunting to the Caribbean's, Kendra's girls are there to cheer her on, encourage, support and quickly pack their bags so that they can join her  and get their tan on.  But, they also bring their mainland baggage with them and must slay demons while trying to have a good time and keep up a good face.  What Kendra does not plan for is one of her clients stalking her and following her to her destination.  This client isn't just any client, she is a client with a secret and she needs Kendra's public relations expertise and 'spin doctor' approach to help her out of her dilemma.  And my oh my what a dilemma it is--totally unexpected and unpredicatable!<br /><br />From the witty to the wicked, Hot Spot is a charming and steamy read.  Taressa explores \\"the hot spot between romantic and professional success, and the things we do when they conflict with one another.\\"  (I bet you thought she was talking about another type of hot spot and not to be disappointed she does mention it.) The characters held my attention and in the process, made me laugh, fuss, angry, and laugh some more. The  pacing wasn't as smooth as I would have liked and the plot stalled in the middle but the unexpected twists and turns were enough to keep me reading until the end. There was one twist that was so original, I did not anticipate it or see it coming! Actually it caused me to pause and sit with my mouth wide open for a minute before regrouping and continuing the read.  Although the trio sister friend theme was not original, TaRessa interweaved other topics that held my interest such as the business side of the public relations industry; workplace romance; maintaining one's ethics in a cutthroat workplace competition; and erotic moves that would even surprise the Kama Sutra. Hmmmm! If you are looking for a quick, easy and entertaining read, centered around three female friends, then I recommend you pick up the Hot Spot by TaRessa.

Pretty Evil by, first time author, Lexi Davis is a thrilling roller coaster ride that you do not want to end.  It is just that good!  The Pleasure Spot, once a decadent Beverly Hills brothel, has sat empty and unoccupied for 99 and three quarters of a year, as the original owner-sexy, sultry, nymphomaniac, she-demon named Vixx and her crusty, crumungedy side-kick, a one hundred twenty-something  ghoul named CrÃªp impatiently sat waiting out the rest of their term (just three more months and the 100th year term would be completed) in the cellar before they could be released to freely roam the mansion and carry on as they did prior to their exile.  So Vixx has little patience and will do whatever is necessary to scare off visitors-including  incorporating roadblocks and obstacles at every turn if it means that they want to move into her home-or even killing them.<br /><br />Supernatural occurrences and obstacles aside, a bachelor trio (Rice, Coach and Geffen) is determined to move forward with owning the place and turning it into a Pleasure Palace, despite the continual warning from their best sister friend, Sunnie Clark.  Sunnie was born with a sixth sense and she believes that an evil spirit lurks within the haunted mansion.  Of course, the fellows are cocky, arrogant, obstinate and they are more determined than ever to own the mansion and do not heed her advice.  Vexed that her years of waiting might have been in vain, Vixx has three months left to get rid of the `trespassers' and she will do it by any means possible.  But, first she must find the Achilles heel for each man.  In order, to break the curse all she has to do is take out at least one of them before the 100 year exile ends. Easy, piece of cake or is it?  Using hilarious divide and conquer methods, she plots friend against friend as she attempts to destroy their relationship and the bond that holds them together.  But will Vixx be able to break Sunny's \\"spell\\" over the men?<br /><br />Told with wit and flair, Pretty Evil is a hilarious, rolling on the floor laughing your arze off, paranormal read.  Davis successfully incorporates spirituality, romance, comedy and horror so it is difficult to pigeon-hole her book into one single genre.  Pretty Evil reminds me of a horror movie spoof or Cruella Deville meets Disney...some sections are just that kooky but creatively crafted.  This is a book that one can read at anytime without being scared out of your wits-unless you are scared too laugh too hard for fear of wetting your pants. Davis is a fresh new voice on the scene with a unique and original voice in the African American literary landscape.  I look forward to reading future books from this upcoming talent and would love to see Pretty Evil turned into a series or a movie.  Horror fan or not, this is a book that I believe will entertain and delight anyone looking for a well-written plot.<br /><br />APOOO rating:  4.5 stars.<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookCluband flair, Pretty Evil is a hilarious, rolling on the floor laughing your arze off, paranormal read.

It was a chick-lit read which reminded me of the television show Girlfriend.  It is about four(4)friends, Ivy League Grads, who met while they were undergrads at Harvard.  Now in their late twenties, they are dealing with life in the real world and the fast lane.  They share the same concerns as most young, attractive, professional single women--beauty, finances, weight and job woes.  Although family and boyfriends might let them down the girlfriends always have their back--whether it is a shoulder to lean on, words of encouragement or a swift kick in the butt--you can always count on girlfriends.<br /><br />Wonderful story that portrays young African American women in a professional, as well as postive, light and also shows that YOUNG women can be friends...and can be the best of friends.  FAB was a quick and easy read that captivated and held my attention until the last page.  I recommend it to fans of chick lit and those who enjoy reading girlfriend storylines.  Nothing really original about the book--but it is a good feel good book that is well told from the perspective of four up and coming authors.<br /><br />APOOO rating:  3.5 stars.	2005-10-12

Paris Montague is happy with her no-strings,commitment-free personal life.  She has bigger issues to be concerned about-like when is she going to move up in her father's lobbying firm; she wants him to allow her the chance to prove that she is worthy and capable of handling more complex projects.  After all, she does have two degrees, including a Masters in Business Administration (MBA), and she is more than capable of handling whatever comes her way.  Actually, some new ideas and out of the box concepts might be just what the firm needs to move into the new Millennium and a higher revenue bracket.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Paris's mom, the perpetual, busy body and control freak, has other plans for Paris.  She believes that at Paris' age that Paris is too old to be a single woman and she needs someone who can take care of her; preferably a wealthy man or at least one who is more well off than Paris.  While Paris is busy keeping company with her `maintenance man,' her mother is busy looking for eligible men in \\"Who's Who in African American Wealth\\" and believes that she has found a suitable mate for her daughter.  Enters Jabari Nolan, who is as fake as a two (2) dollar coin but as savvy and debonair as they come.  However, he does not have anything in his past that a comprehensive background check would not have uncovered upfront. Question is will anyone discover who he really is before he says \\"I Do.\\"<br /><br />Foxx's books are usually hit or miss for me and I almost passed on her latest novel.  Recently, I have been reading blogs of various authors and one of the blogs that I enjoy checking out regularly is Foxx's.  I enjoy reading her blogs so much so that I decided to take a chance on Marrying Up.  I am happy to say that it was a HIT for me!  Marrying Up is a charming and fun read that successfully combines romance, intrigue and suspense.  Foxx travels familiar terrain with Marrying Up and the ending is very predictable, but the backdrop as well as surprising twists and turns help to set it apart from similar storylines.  One added bonus of Marrying Up was the opportunity to read excerpts from Foxx's blogs/journals. If you haven't had a chance to experience Foxx's commentaries, visit her site and check her out today.  Foxx is a writer who does not appear to veer very far from the same storyline themes, however, for those moments when I am looking for an Entertainment Purposes Only (EPO) read she has the ability to satisfy and quench that thirst.  If you read her first book, but have not picked up another one of her books, give her a chance today with Marrying Up.  You might be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClubromance, intrigue and suspense.

It is about a middle aged man who is a recovering alcoholic (12 years sober) who travels to Europe (Haarlem, Netherland) to find the mother who abandoned him as a child.  Not only does he discover his mother...and a few other family members but the journey also allows him time to find himself.  Haarlem is a literary read with crisp/descriptive prose. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this book as much as I did.  I read Neff's first book and did not care for it very much because it was too narrative driven...this time she had the right balance and pacing.  I enjoyed this book thoroughly and definitely recommend it to those who want a break from contemporary fiction reads as well as tho' who enjoy reading books by James Baldwin.  As Haarlem sort of reminded me of a couple of Baldwin's books. APOOO rating:  4.5 stars.<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClub	2005-10-12

Nicholas is a gifted storyteller and this debut novel includes all the ingredients of an exceptional read:  unforgettable characters, vivid imagery, fluid pacing, rich dialogue/prose,  moving plot, a timeless/classic theme, and strong writing. Nicholas delivers a powerful and emotionally engaging story about a young lady-Celeste Tyree-who comes of age during the summer of 1964-Freedom Summer.  For Celeste Tyree, a middle-class, attractive, green-eyed, red-boned, Detroit native, 1964 would be one of the hottest and explosive summers that she would experience literally and figuratively.<br /><br />Celeste would join other college-aged students from as far away as Stanford University, as close as Tougaloo College (Jackson, MS), who would journey to the backwoods of Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama to  make a difference in someone's lives as they idealistically hoped to  open doors for Southern Negroes (we were Negroes then).  These were people still living in a racially oppressed society which  \\"made children think less, speak little, and dream almost never, bending many of them into the hunched old people they would eventually become.\\"  The Freedom Summer volunteers hoped to make a great difference in someone's lives and  envisioned  \\"roads would get paved, schools would be improved, and children would be able to go into the library to read the books or take them home.\\"  It would be the summer to end segregation in the South.<br /><br />Celeste's destination would be Pineyville, MS where she would spend the summer teaching Negro kids history during the day and the evenings preparing adult Negroes to register to vote. Celeste would recall the summer of 1964 as one of terror and triumph.  It would  be a summer of getting folks to vote, watching friends beaten within an inch of their lives by those who were to protect and serve, spending hours in a jail cell, hearing about churches being bombed, and  deaths of innocent children.  She would wish for home/Detroit many times in her dreams, her walks to the outhouse, her daily struggle with the lack of running water, her soaked clothing because of the oppressive heat, her bitten and sore skin because of hungry mosquitoes,and most overwhelming and challenging at times--her loneliness.  It would also be a summer of self-discovery and identity.  Surely, a summer she would never forget and one that would go down in history as remarkable-and she would  be part of that history.<br /><br />Freshwater Road is an uplifting, compelling and captivating read.  Although the story floundered in several spots, and Nicholas didn't necessary flesh out each character, these issues aside, Freshwater Road is a very powerful story.  Nicholas takes us back to a time that many would like to forget and others need to remember so that history does not repeat itself.  Freshwater Road should be required reading for every high school/college student curriculum and every African American family should own one copy.  It is a story that should not be forgotten and should be told at every family reunion-so that our people do not perish due to lack of knowledge and we do not forget from whence we came.<br /><br />APOOO Rating:  4.5 stars<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClubbombed, and  deaths of innocent children.

Tyson who returns to his rural hometown of  Swamp Creek, Arkansas after a ten-year hiatus.  Tyson left behind an abusive father, emotionally detached mother, sullen older brother and a loving younger sister, Cynthia.  T.L. adored Cynthia and she was his reason for living and wanting something better than his humble, backwoods beginning.  It is because of his sister that he is now returning home after completing ten years of higher education and receiving a Ph.D. in Black Studies-which leaves his father wondering why he wasted good money on learning about Black Folks-when he could have told him everything he needed to know!  His sister,who was not even 10 when he left home,was his pride and joy, childhood friend, spiritual confidante and was his only reason for wanting to stay connected to folks who obviously had no commitment to him.  However, ten years is a long time to be gone and to have very little contact with family, so much to his surprise and chagrin, he learns upon returning home that his sister is gone-she died.  No one notified him of  her untimely death and no one wants to talk about it nor tell him how she died.<br /><br />In his tantrum and angry quest to find out what happened to Cynthia, T.L. will rip open the dysfunctional fabric that holds his family together.  He will discover that the glue that seals them together includes generational secrets, incest,  adultery, emotional annihilation and self-hatred.  Going home will also bring him face to face with his favorite teacher who is dying and who has a few secrets of her own.  She also has a demanding request of T. L. that he is not sure that he can honor. Since returning home, the baggage of the past is suffocating him and stifling his reason for being-and now that his sister is gone he is in more of a hurry to return to his beloved NYC.  But can one ever really emotionally or physically leave the place they call home?<br /><br />They Tell Me of a Home is a powerful, universal story of a young man returning home and coming to the realization that  \\" my coming home was because I had missed the most critical lesson any student can learn-that transforming the world begins with love of one's own people.\\"  Black delivers a poignant message as we journey with T.L. and he discovers that just maybe being from Swamp Creek isn't so bad and drives home  an even greater message that many folks of color still need to hear today-\\" that until we teach ourselves, we will always hate ourselves' -and continue to run away from the situation rather than to deal with what ails us.<br /><br /> Filled with wit, wisdom, social messages, folklore and rural southern black folk and their ways, Tyson's debut novel is creatively crafted and a page-turner.  Beautifully and lyrically written, colorful characters including secondary characters that felt like family and  inclusion of my two favorite topics-African American History and religion quickly moved this read into my Top 10 for 2005.  Anyone who has ever spent time in the South or still has family there will identify with at least one of the characters in the story.  They remind us of folks that we would  not choose if given a choice but because of blood relations these are the same folks that we lovingly and sometimes grudgingly call family.  I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a refreshing and wonderfully crafted story featuring an African American male  protagonist who endearingly worms his way into our hearts and leaves a few unforgettable gems of nuggets for us to chew on-as only a Southerner can do!<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClubave the place they call home?  <br /> <br />They Tell Me of a Home is a powerful, universal story of a young man returning home and coming to the realization that  \\" my coming home was because I had missed the most critical lesson any student can learn-that transforming the world begins with love of one's own people.\\"  Black delivers a poignant message as we journey with T.L. and he discovers that just maybe being from Swamp Creek isn't so bad and drives home  an even greater message that many folks of color still need to hear today-\\" that until we teach ourselves, we will always hate ourselves' -and continue to run away from the situation rather than to deal with what ails us.  <br /> <br /> Filled with wit, wisdom, social messages, folklore and rural southern black folk and their ways, Tyson's debut novel is creatively crafted and a page-turner.

Infidelity and deceit threaten a Christian family when they are forced to face the lies that are creating mistrust, disorder, and tension in their lives.  Wendy Phillips is a newlywed with a baby on the way, whose life is turned upside down when she receives devastating news from her doctor.  Believing her husband is guilty of having an affair and that her life is in jeopardy due to his infidelity, Wendy contemplates divorcing her husband and aborting their child so that she will not have any lasting memories or connections to her husband.  As Wendy becomes consumed regarding the abrupt ending of her short-lived marriage, she turns inward and shuts out loved ones, church family, and God.<br /><br />Sanders is a fresh new voice in the Christian Fiction genre and she does a good job of  writing a plot that engages even the most fair weather fan of this genre.  She captures the reader's attention from Chapter One with a suspenseful and intriguing set up.  Sub-plots involving Wendy's mother and  grandfather; younger sister and grandmother; and a friend who suddenly reappears in Wendy's life round out this entertaining and compelling read.<br /><br />Sanders allows the reader to witness characters who are struggling with personal tribulations develop a closer relationship with God and mature in the Word.  However, I enjoyed the realism of the story, and  must admit that I was happy to see that not everyone conquered  their demons.  The true to life presentation helped to set this book apart from many of the other books that are currently available in this genre. I enjoyed Sander's debut novel and look forward to reading future releases from this talented, young author.<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClub	2005-09-09

Southgate takes us into the realm of the mother/daughter world as we experience life from the point of view of three generations of women: Mildred-mother/grandmother; Angela, daughter; and granddaughter, Tamara.<br /><br />Mildred and Angela shared a tumultuous history, however, their love of movies and their weekly movie outings was the event that bonded them during Angela's teen years.  So enamored with being in the movies, Angela runs away to Los Angeles in the 70s and finds herself at the height of the blaxplotation era.  Angela-along with thousands of other girls from small town, usa-- auditions constantly for the role that will maker her a star.  As the years move forward, stardom eludes her, and her greatest claim to fame is a movie starring Pam Grier-where Angela has a small speaking part in a fight scene and she is the `third girl from the left.' Tiring of the daily drudgery of auditions, limited income, dreams deferred and wanting to experience a little happiness -if just for a moment, even if that happiness includes consequences, she throws caution to the wind as she engages in unprotected sex and becomes pregnant.<br /><br />Tamara is the by-product of that act, and the child who appears to be able to accomplish what her grandmother and mother could not.  Estranged from her family, Angela's daughter knows very little about the life she left behind in Tulsa.  However, when a call beckons Angela back to Tulsa, Tamara quickly jumps at the opportunity to join her mother and find out more about her maternal side of the family.  It is Tamara-the budding film producer-who brings mother and daughter together and discovers the impact that the Tulsa race riot of 1921 had on her grandmother and her relationship with others.<br /><br />Rich with history regarding the Tulsa race riot, the 70s blaxplotation era and women in film, Third Girl From the Left will evoke poignant, and powerful memories.  Albeit, at times a slow read, Southgate is deliberate in producing a provocative and though provoking read that is layered with rich details about family, culture and history.  It is an intimate look at African American women and the strides we have made over the years as we struggled to achieve our dreams.  This is a book that I highly recommend for a book club selection, as it will definitely stimulate lively and engaging discussion.<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClubthe Tulsa race riot of 1921 had on her grandmother and her relationship with others. <br />   <br />Rich with history regarding the Tulsa race riot, the 70s blaxplotation era and women in film, Third Girl From the Left will evoke poignant, and powerful memories.

Greatest challenges seem to center around:<br /><br />--Girlfriend Norma, an established dentist, who resigns from her promising dental practice to follow her dream of appearing on the Wheel of Fortune. Since she does not have a job to return to in Baltimore, and her personal life is not going the way she envisioned, she throws caution to the wind while thinking about  skipping the wedding and starting a new life in California.<br /><br />--Moor's new `best friend', Anthony, works at the bank which transferred Moor to the West Coast.  Anthony has been a mentor to Moor, but when Anthony is downsized and loses his job and his significant other as well, he questions whether or not he has the energy or the spirit to be Anthony's best friend more or less best man. Anthony has always been a Sly Stone fan so when he hears that Sly's brother pastors a church in the Bay Area he takes off in hopes that he might spot Sly at one of the Sunday morning services, Wednesday evening bible studies, Tuesday afternoon prayer service or maybe in the men's room.  Anthony is determined to find his idol for the inspiration he needs to jumpstart his music muse.<br /><br />Ewell takes us on a mystical journey with Norma and Anthony in their quest for answers and resolution.Both are two lost souls in search of self, love, and peace-but a little spirituality might also help each of them out of their valleys.<br /><br />Filled with quirky and eclectic characters, witty dialogue, vivid imagery and God's word, Foster's latest read is entertaining and engaging.  At times,  the reading experience was slowed down by a few too many characters, messages that were a little preachy, and various sub-plots were difficult to follow. However,if fans of Christian Fiction and Ewell are willing to overlook these concerns, and stick with the storyline, they will find that growth does occur in the valley for the characters and that Foster has a wonderful message to impart to believers.

But this time she will not have to worry about him ever coming back, in fact, he has a very good reason for not coming home to her and her nine year-old son.  What transpires after that is enough to send Daisy over the edge, as she comes face to face with unknown relatives, lies, betrayal, deceit and secrets from the past.<br /><br />Pushing Up Daisies is an intriguing and suspenseful novel that I could not read fast enough to find out what would happen next.  The first chapter grabbed me and would not let go! Dames had me on a wild goose chase as I traveled from New York to California and picked up more clues and skeletons on each coast.  Dames did a good job of introducing multiple characters and storyline as well as wrapping up the various sub-plots.  I have read both of Dames books and almost passed on Pushing Up Daisies.  I am glad I did not, as Dames demonstrates much growth with her latest release.  Creatively crafted, Pushing Up Daisies is a contemporary fiction novel which will appeal to any lover of drama filled reads.  Good read for a lazy summer day.<br /><br />Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClub	2005-08-11

When Brandi Spencer catches her husband (Vernon) of more than a decade with his mistress (Tanya), she decides to forgo the crying, kicking and screaming and to attack her husband where it will hurt him the most-by going after and taking his mistress!  What woman does not need someone to take up the slack with cooking, laundry, taking care of the children, extracurricular activities, but what wife goes so far as to actually hire the mistress-with contract to boot-and moves the other woman into her home?!<br /><br />In the midst of it all, both women realize that they have both been used and that Vernon deserves to be taught a lesson.  As Brandi and Tanya scheme and plan how to get even with Vernon, they bond and a friendship is formed.  Each woman also reclaims her self-worth and self-importance as she sheds baggage and horrible memories and experiences of the past.<br /><br />Every Woman Needs a Wife is more than a catchy title with over the top drama; it is a plausible storyline with an inspiring and empowering message for all women who have ever felt they were less than a woman if they did not have a man in their life.  Multiple plot twists and turns help move the storyline along and although the ending is a little too neat it does not deter from the overall enjoyment of the storyline.  Naleighna Kai has created a compelling read with unforgettable characters and sub-plots.  If you are looking for a contemporary fiction relationship novel to enjoy with a cold glass of lemonade or sweet tea on a warm, summer day, then check out Kai's latest novel.<br /><br />Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClub	2005-08-11

Denee takes us into the lives of three women and gives us an intimate look at the friendship the threesome share as well as their relationship with the opposite sex.  A messy encounter brings together-Tina, Shari and Nia-and an unlikely friendship is formed.  These women share a lot in common including their age (late 20s/barely 30s), professionalism in the workplace, ability to turn the heads of many men, and disaster when it comes to relationships with the opposite sex.  Tina is attractive-and knows it-but in her quest to satisfy self she often lacks self-respect and self-control and her latest antic finds her in a situation where the outcome might not turn out the way she has planned and schemed.  Shari is the married one of the trio, after several distratous relationships, she has finally married the man of her dreams, but will her insecurity cause her to make a rash decision, which might threaten her marriage?  Nia is the youngest of the group, somewhat timid and shy, and contemplating hooking up with a former lover who committed a taboo crime years ago.  Each sister friend is likeable enough-even Tina has some redeeming qualities, however, there are moments, many of them when the reader wants to pimpslap one, shake another one and just completely ignore the third one!<br /><br />Filled with wit and sassy dialogue, colorful characters, lively antics, and solid pacing, Take It There is a good read for a lazy summer day. The secondary male characters, as well as Tina's younger sister, also add excitement to the storyline as we follow them via the various sub-plots.  The two endings were clever and my vote goes to version one-it was definitely suspenseful and worthy of a sequel.  My overall concern with the storyline is that it was a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu experience for me, no new territory was covered nor was the storyline told in a breakthrough manner. That aside, Denee's writing is engaging and I do believe her fan base will expand as she continues to hone her craft and create storylines that are fresh and unique-as she has already demonstrated that she has the storytelling abilities to pull it off.<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClubd I do believe her fan base will expand as she continues to hone her craft and create storylines that are fresh and unique-as she has already demonstrated that she has the storytelling abilities to pull it off. <br />   <br />Reviewed by Yasmin <br />APOOO BookClub <br />	2005-07-26

Smith introduces the reader to a formidable, sometimes sexy, sometimes sultry, sometimes `evil' but always keeping it real character known as Eva Glenn.<br /><br />Via Eva, a woman's point of view is used to expose the reader to the hip-hop music industry. Eva Glenn is the IT girl--but what price does she have to pay to stay at the top of an industry that is dominated by white men, vicious cutthroat environments, rampant backstabbing and few women or minorities at the executive level, or in the board room, where the power deals are made.<br /><br />As Bliss opens, we witness Eva doing what she does best--hosting a glitzy showcase in Paradise Islands, Bahamas for one of the shining stars under her Roadshow Records label.  As readers' journeys with Eva, we quickly realize that although she exudes a cool, calm and collective outer exterior, internally--Eva is juggling a lot of balls in the air and realizing that all of them might come crashing down at a moments notice.  Eva has been in the music industry so long and has put her personal life on eternal hold that she has forgotten that she might just want what many other woman want--a child, husband, and a home with the white picket fence.  Her stay in Paradise Islands leads to some serious soul-searching as she looks deep within to make some arduous decisions regarding an unexpected pregnancy, her all-consuming career and a wicked love triangle.<br /><br />Set against the backdrop of love and music, Smith's latest novel is sometimes quirky, sometimes eccentric and sometimes brutally honest about the music business.  At times, the novel's hip-hop emphasis was lost on me (my musical preference is R&B, Jazz), however, I enjoyed reading about the behind the scenes business view of the industry as well as hanging out with Eva and her flaky sidekicks.  This contemporary literary read is great for passing the time on a lazy summer day.<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClubor passing the time on a lazy summer day. <br />  <br />Reviewed by Yasmin <br />APOOO BookClub <br />	2005-07-23

Artemis stays true to her mission as a hip hop artist and activist as she delivers a poignant and riveting story that relays the power of hip hop as a tool of transformative expression.  Set against the backdrop of New York City and interspersed with the teachings/writings of feminist poet, Audre Lorde, Black Artemis introduces the reader to Tupac's number one fictional hip-hop fan, Esperanza Cepeda.<br /><br />Esperanza Cepeda --aka Espe-- is a recently released felon who took the arrest rap for her hood rat, drug dealing, and hustler boyfriend, Jesus. Espe is representative of so many young women who lack the structure and discipline of a functional home environment and the love/guidance of a mother and a father so they often mistake negative attention as love. Especially if that attention includes a fat wallet, nice ride, and fly clothes at the expense of someone else.  So it is easy to understand why Espe mistook Jesus' interest in her as love. Reared in a culture where machismo trumps and women are pawns, Espe is a product of her environment.  Unfortunately, more and more young women are becoming criminal statistics as they take the rap for crimes committed by 'their man,' while the main culprit goes on with business as usual while continuing to pollute the community. For boys like Jesus, girls like Espe, are nothing but just another piece of tail and once the Espes of the world are out of sight they are often truly out of mind to their male partners.  Jesus clearly demonstrates this mindset as he continues to live life by his rules and conducts business as usual while Espe serves prison time.<br /><br />With Jesus missing in action as she serves 'his' jail time, Espe had a lot of time to think about her life and with the help of an older inmate named Isoke; she is encouraged to make changes so that she can fulfill her vow of never being imprisoned again. We watch Espe enter prison as a rebellious, free-spirited, around the way girl who emerges from jail months later as a young woman to be reckoned with.  Privy to Espe's thoughts, we watch as she hesitantly comes to the realization that her idol, Tupac is not flawless.  Just maybe some of his lyrics are offensive and demeaning to women and he is just another man pimping young, naÃ¯ve women. As she removes the shackles of Tupac's influence, and begins to embrace the teachings of Audre Lorde, we watch Espe transform into a young woman who desires to be in control of her destiny.  Lorde's teachings force her to think about who she is and encourage empowerment, confidence and self-esteem as well as love for self.  While morphing into the empowered sister she can be, Espe has assistance along the way from her She-roes: older sister-Dulce (who raised her when her mom went to jail); GED teacher-Maite Rodriquez (a former militant); and her still incarnated friend, Isoke (an older woman/mother figure and former Black Panther member). Even with the support and encouragement of these strong She-roe figures, the day-to-day living is not easy for, an ex-felon like, Espe as without education, skills, or funds she believes she is reduced to the lowest common denominator. As needs and wants go unfulfilled, it is hard for Espe to continue on the straight and narrow path.  It is still the shallow, materialistic things that matter to a young adult like Espe, who lives for the moment rather than tomorrow, so wearing last year's fashions and performing menial labor at a fast food restaurant is not an acceptable alternative.<br /><br />As Espe tries to do right and stay legit, there is still an electrical charge that is ignited when she is around Jesus; she realizes that Jesus still has a hold on her body, soul, mind and heart.  Longing for the luxuries of the past, she considers doing \\"one last job\\" for Jesus to earn some quick cash and roll out of dodge.  But can she do it?  Will she forget about the lessons of the three women she respects the most, who care about her and want her to succeed against all odds?  Will she once again become another statistic, just another chicken head that sacrifices her freedom because she confuses a man's control/abuse as love?<br /><br />PMR is a coming of age story set against a hip-hop environment.  The storyline captures the language and feel of the current hip-hop generation while also delivering a powerful social message.  Black Artemis is all about young women reaching their full potential by stretching themselves to the fullest.  Espe is a woman of color, but more importantly, she represents every woman who has sought to move beyond the abusive clutches of a boyfriend and an oppressive environment by any means necessary.  Artemis demonstrates that women must learn to love themselves if they are to stop the domestic abuse, hurt, pain caused by the little boys in their life parading as men.  As Espe's hunger for knowledge is stimulated by the works of Lorde, she discovers the confidence she needs to plot her fate and destiny.  Question is will she picture herself rollin' with Jesus-the boy who equates love with abuse or will she join the ranks of the strong sisters who have gone before her-the sisters who have decided they have the inner strength and desire to change their own lives--and if Espe is willing she can.  Artemis has written a powerful and poignant story with believable characters that will resonate well with today's youth while also enlightening parents and adults.  For those who enjoy books with an urban feel-and that are well written--PMR should become part of your library today.<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClubroll out of dodge.

Action-Packed. Fast Paced.  Triple Take is all of that and more as we travel through the mean streets of Chicago with main character, Jonathan \\"JC\\" Cole. JC has just been released from prison and he is out to seek revenge and right the wrong of three individuals who set him up and betrayed him ten years ago in order to save themselves.<br />I must preface my review by saying that I do not usually read books where the storyline is centered primarily on characters that appear to have no redeeming qualities and exist primarily to be thugs, drug addicts, dope pushers and prostitutes.  However, I was more than a little intrigued and inquisitive regarding whom was the author that could bypass the self-published route and go straight to a national publisher, and have their street life novel published!  While these types of novels are growing in popularity (and many are even being compared to Donald Goines), most of them are \\"underground\\" and primarily self-published. I must admit that Moore didn't disappoint me.  I started Triple Take at 2:00pm and was finished just shy of three hours later.<br /> Not since Sister Souljah's Coldest Winter Ever have I read a novel about street life (or as some call them ghetto fab reads) that captivated, fascinated, and held my attention until the very end.  Thinking about living vicariously and walking on the wild side?  Then check out Triple Take by Yanier Moore and get ready to experience a world that most of us hope to only read about and experience as a voyeur. Triple Take is an explosive and energy charged novel that many will enjoy especially young readers and the male audience. I'm glad I took a chance on Triple Take and I look forward to future novels by Yanier Moore!<br />Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-06-06

It is a novel that will touch even the most cold-hearted individual and easily bring tears to those who are more sensitive.<br />Symone is only eight years old, yet she's already led a hard and horrific life.  Born three months early to a teenaged, unwed, drug-addicted, prostitute strolling mom, Symone's life has been primarily one of poverty, blight and having to be mature enough for both she and her mother.  Symone's daily routine consists of cleaning up body fluids left behind by her mom, avoiding her mom's drug jones, scrounging for food, showering in filthy sub-zero water, dodging falling ceiling tiles while she eats, sharing a toothbrush with her mother,  and befriending two rats that she considers pets with the names Honkee Honkee and Nigga Nigga. Even though Symone considers her mother, Delores, chemically imbalanced, suicidal, self-destructive, neurotic and an alcoholic drug addict, Delores was all Symone had as she never knew her father and loved her mom with all faults unconditionally as only an innocent child, not yet scarred by the world could do.<br />But one day, Delores does something really bad. She dies prematurely and Symone is forced to move to the local orphanage and wait it out there until a nice, rich family from Michigan comes along to rescue her.  But all that glitters is not gold and all that is pretty is on the outside is not pretty on the inside.  And all children that come from two-parent, well-to-do households are not okay. And every child that comes from the Huston household will be dysfunctional and have some serious issues because things that are done in the dark do affect ones sanity during the day.<br />Rising by Darnella Ford, although lyrically written, is also very graphic, raw, dark and gritty.  The details are so sharp and crisp that I often wondered whether I was reading a novel or someone's actual life story because some of the incidents were just too bizarre to only be imagined.  I kept wondering whether some things so incredible could only be imagined!  Real or imagined, Symone's story reinforces that all children need to be protected and that the system needs to be more aware, concerned about all children regardless of the family's economic status and more involved in the lives of those who are least able to defend themselves.  Rising by Darnella Ford is a compelling and engaging read that is creatively crafted and uniquely written.  My only issue with the storyline is that some of the happenings were just a little too over the top to be realistic or believable even for a fictional novel.  That aside, I recommend Rising to those who have eclectic reading taste and can withstand dark stories regarding child abuse and molestation.<br />Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClubere just too bizarre to only be imagined.

Memories of Yesterday is a moving and touching book by first-time novelist, Cheryl Robinson.  Set against the backdrop of Detroit and told in the alternating voices of the male and female characters, Robinson introduces the reader to two individuals who must move beyond the memories of yesterday in order to survive and overcome the obstacles of today.<br />Winona and Porter are two individuals leading separate lives who meet when Winona's teenage son is in a car accident.  From that encounter they hesitantly began `seeing each other', slowly getting to know one another and casually dating.  But experiences of the past continue to disturb each of them and both continue to hold secrets from each other.  Secrets that are painful, harmful, volatile, and explosive but that need to be aired if healing and redemption are to occur.<br />Memories of Yesterday is a compelling read that immediately captures the readers attention and keeps them glued to the storyline until the last line.  Written in a fluid and seamless manner the story touches on a multitude of subject matters (sexual identity, self esteem, parent/child relationships, absentee parents, extramarital affairs, sensuality, sexuality, career issues) without missing a beat.  Generously dished along the way are surprising twists and turns that sometimes makes your hair stand up on your head but nevertheless keep you rapidly turning the pages.

American Book Award-winning author Elizabeth Nunez's latest novel, Grace, is a moving and poignant story that explores a woman's search for self.  Justin Peters and his wife, Sally are an African-American, middle-class couple in distress; both are highly intelligent, educated and successful in their careers but things are amidst in their marriage.  Sally is on the verge of turning forty and it appears experiencing mid-life crisis; all she knows is that she needs space from her husband Justin.  For her happiness has always been based on a slogan she saw once which said `joy is a learned skill, and that it takes strength to be happy.\\"  Justin has observed lately that Sally is still a good wife, a good mother, a good friend and a good role model; but is she happy in her role as wife and mother or does she need more to complete her.  When Sally is not forthcoming with why she is unhappy or why she needs space Justin begins to believe it is because she is seeing someone else.  Justin is at wits-ends and struggling emotionally because he does not know what to do to make Sally happy and keep their marriage intact.  As he surmises why Sally no longer wants him, he comes to the conclusion that she never got over her former lover and believes that therein lies the problem.  However, when Sally decides to move out with their four year old daughter, Giselle, and into a girlfriend's apartment, Justin becomes extremely suspicious and suspects that his wife is a lesbian.  Will Justin find the TRUTH and the answers to the questions that elude him?  Can he create a solution before it is too late?  Can he save his marriage?<br />Nunez paints an exquisitively written novel yet complex portrayal of a marriage in transition.  She takes a mundane subject (i.e. marriage) and adds her creative flair to make it a fluid and mesmerizing tale.  She writes deftly while inserting lesbianism, racism, segregation, and classism into a story that also speaks truth to marriage, friendship, love and commitment.  Grace is well crafted and Nunez does an excellent job of narrating the character's point of view especially Justin's. While Sally was the partner experiencing the crisis it is Justin's male point of view  and voice which the reader more closely empathizes with and even identifies with; one cannot help but have compassion for Justin and admire that he is an African-American male who is not ready to give up on his union.  I felt like I was in his head and sharing his thoughts as he struggled to figure out how to save his marriage.  I also enjoyed the voices of the secondary characters and sub-plots along the way as they gave depth and substance to the novel without feeling forced or out of place.  I have only read two novels by Nunez (although she is now one of my favorite writers and I plan to read all of them); however, in both of them she adds rich African American history as a backdrop.  In doing so, her stories not only entertain and provide a means to escape but they also teach and enlighten without being preachy or condescending.  Nunez is a phenomenal author with an excellent talent for weaving a beautiful and intricate tale while simultaneously offering the reader a great deal of knowledge and outstanding stories.  I appreciated that she did not necessarily wrap Grace up in a neat little package but left just enough of an opening to allow me to form my own opinion regarding the ending.

Tracy Price-Thompson, best-selling author of Black Coffee, delivers an intense and passionate new flavor in her sophomore novel titled Chocolate Sangria.  It is a tale of friendship, family, love, secrets, betrayal and redemption.<br />Juanita and Scooter were eternal childhood friends.  Both were orphaned by their parents and left to be raised by extended family.  Due to their similar circumstances they were drawn to each other.  Considered outcast by residents of the projects in their Brooklyn neighborhood, other kids taunted Juanita and Scooter frequently because they were different-Juanita because of her green-eyes and light complexion and Scooter because he had \\"a little sugar in his tank.\\"  No matter what the circumstances they always had one another to help pick up the pieces and to comfort and support one another.  They promised to be each other's friend for life.<br />Fast-forward ten years later and their friendship is still intact.  They survived life in the projects. Both are in college well on their way to achieving their dreams and career aspirations.  As is their custom, they still spend a lot of time with each other, including riding public transportation to their respective schools.  One day, a harrying bus experience brings a chance encounter with best friends, Jorge and Conan, which would change the lives of all four friends forever and possibly the future of Juanita and Scooter's friendship.<br />Price-Thompson has another best-seller on her hands!

From the intriguing prologue, the reader is immediately immersed into the lives of the characters and anxiously anticipates what will happen next. Chocolate Sangria is complex in that Price-Thompson challenged herself to cross color and racial lines to deliver a story with multi-cultural characters and nuances while providing the reader with a believable cast.  Chocolate Sangria's characters bare no resemblance to the characters of her debut novel...except that they are equally as enticing and colorful.

Can they love each other beyond their flaws and secrets?<br />Carter weaves a colorful tapestry about friendships and the ties that bind them. The storyline is engaging and a quick read. It is filled with real life experiences, emotionalism and enough drama to keep you turning the pages.  The characters will have you shaking your head, talking to them, fussing at them and chuckling at their antics.  As If Nothing Happened is a 3.5 on the APOOO chart; and a good read for a laid-back, relaxing afternoon.<br />Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-02-26

Freshman novelist, Kendra Norman-Bellamy, delivers a heartwarming and refreshing love story with her debut novel titled For Love and Grace.  Dr. Gregory Dixon and Attorney Derrick Madison are best friends who are torn apart when Jessica \\"Grace\\" Charles accidentally interrupts their lives.  Dr. Dixon is anxious to operate on Grace and save her life because he has other plans for her; Attorney Madison wishes that Grace would die just like the lady she hit-his mom.  With two opposing forces at work only by the Grace of God will these characters discover and understand the truth behind the tragic death of a loved one.<br />Norman-Bellamy has written a Christian Fiction romance novel that can be enjoyed by someone as young as a teenager and as seasoned as a senior citizen.  The storyline is one of love, laughter, tears and romance but void of profanity and obscene sexual scenes.  The male characters are presented in a positive light and they exhibit the behavior and characteristics that any woman would want in a relationship.  But the characters which really captured my attention and added life to the story were the parents of Greg and Grace-Ms. Lena and Ms. Mattie.  These two characters were colorful, humorous and cantankerous and made for many laugh out loud moments.<br />For Love and Grace by Kendra Norman-Bellamy is an uplifting and motivating novel that touches on true love, true friendship, true faith and true happiness.  It is a pleasurable and easy read that can be read in one sitting.  Fans of Christian Fiction and Romance/Love stories will especially enjoy this well-written book from new-comer Norman-Bellamy.<br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-02-20

Ever dealt with an indecisive brother and wondered why you were part of the equation? Maybe reading The Choices Men Make (Choices), an entertaining and witty novel from newcomer, Dwayne S. Joseph, will help you gain a better understanding of why Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus.  Choices explores unfaithfulness in marriage, infidelity in relationships and male bonding that endures through thick and thin.<br />Choices cast of characters includes Colin Ray who chooses a new woman the same way he shops for grocery-WEEKLY; Roy Burges who thought he had married the right woman until the skeletons started falling out of her haunted house; and Vic Reed  who decides that six months of marriage is too long and seeks his happiness elsewhere.<br />Choices is an entertaining and engaging novel; Joseph takes a volatile subject (infidelity, extramarital affairs) and delivers it with comic relief.  It was a reality check of why men make the choices that they make but the women weren't necessarily without their flaws or secrets either.  Joseph delivers a couple of surprising twists and turns along the way that left me feeling empathy for the fellows but disturbed by the actions of the sisters.  Choices is a quick and delightful read that will have you talking, shouting and LOL.  On the APOOO chart, Choices Men Make by Dwayne S. Joseph is 3.5 stars.<br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-02-20

True Lies by Margaret Johnson Hodge probably leans more to the latter for many folks; esp. those who will see their story on the printed pages.  True Lies took me into a world,that while familiar with it, I hope never to personally experience it.  Hodge gives us characters that are over the top, however, she never allows the plot to dominate the storyline, instead it is the characters (and as it should be) who TELL us their story.  In telling us their story, Rick, Dajah and Gina bring us up close and personal center stage with front roll seats.  True Lies is about deceit, secrets, family ties and baby mama drama.  It's a story that some have even experienced.  You know the one where the man (i.e. Rick) meets a nice woman (i.e. Dajah) but he's already in a relationship with his tired and trifling baby mama (i.e. Gina).  The new lady in his life says...&quot;when you get rid of her and get your head/life together give me a call.&quot;  The guy thinks that he has it together so he calls but he forgets to mention a few important particulars to said new lady who continues to travel from point A to point B because she's been told that everything is fine, baby mama is no longer in the picture and the plan is a go.  Unfortunately, baby mama realizes what a good man she had, misses him and will go through any means necessary to get him back.  And there in lies the rub.  I must admit I had a difficult time reading True Lies because I was looking for a light, entertaining read and for me it was neither.  However, it was well-written, with excellent character development, vivid imagery and a storyline that some folks need to read/hear so that they don't make the same mistake.  It was a compelling read that I devoured in one sitting even thought I stayed in one zone as far as the characters were concerned...primarily disgusted and appalled.  In fact, none of the characters were likable even little Kanisha was annoying as heck with her womanish ways. But you were drawn to them because you knew some folks just like them who you wanted to slap up side the head for being so foolish.  It was a book that made for a lively, stimulating and sometimes heated discussion with my fellow bookclub members and two weeks later we're still discussing this book as thought these characters are real people.<br />On the APOOO chart, True Lies is a 4.5.  I recommend True Lies to new readers (if you've never experienced Ms. Hodge's work you need to; start by reading Butterscotch Blues) and fans alike who are looking for a well-crafted read from a talented and skilled author who continues to hone her craft. Ms. Hodge I can't wait for your next release Needful Things and I'm looking forward to devouring another wonderful book from you.<br />PS-Next time can you also give me some characters that provide comic relief as well? ;)<br />Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClubnoying as heck with her womanish ways.

In A Man Most Worthy, Major introduces us to John Sebastian, Mister Extraordinaire and the envy of many.  Sebastian has risen from the school of hard knocks and inner city poverty to become a tremendously successful businessman and multi-millionaire before the age of 40.  He has all the trappings of success-he is good looking, has an extravagant home and Scent.  Scent is the nice, sweet, intelligent, attractive, svelte, young 23 year old that he sports on his arm.  She is good to look at and turns the head of many men, but Sebastian isn't sure he really loves her.  As Sebastian reflects about his life, he realizes that although everything looks good on the surface, something is amiss; primarily the woman that he allowed to get away seven years ago.  Lately, Sebastian is unable to stop thinking about Josephine Flowers Prescott and decides to return to his hometown of Newark on the pretense of business, but really it is the business of Josephine that he has on his mind.  Josephine hasn't thought about Sebastian since she left him years ago; only months after her break-up from Sebastian, Josephine quickly found someone else.  She had no sooner dropped the egotistical, self-absorbed, controlling Sebastian before she was engaged and married to Darrien Prescott.  Sebastian isn't used to hearing no and although Scent is still on the scene he seeks to correct the wrongs of the past and reconnect with the woman who got away.  Getting rid of Scent might be the easy part, but will he be able to sway Josephine?  And oh there's also one slight dilemma that he seems to keep forgetting...Josephine is married.  But is she happily married?  Is he deserving of her love after all these years?<br />Read A Man Most Worthy and find out!  Major has given us another creatively crafted novel that is worthy of consideration as it has all the ingredients of a good book...tight writing, great characterization, vivid imagery, and witty and contemporary dialogue. As expected, a Major book wouldn't be complete without his trademark sensuous love scenes and positive male role models.  A Man Most Worthy is an entertaining and insightful novel told from the male perspective that will keep you anxiously anticipating what is going to happen next as you encounter surprising and shocking plot twists and turns.

She has gone through a nasty divorce from the adulterous, no good Reverend Borum but she still has to see him much too often.  The no good Reverend is the pastor of the church where Ruth grew up and still plays the piano at ...no charge of course...because Ruth has always had a big heart that others take advantage of.  Some of the parishioners frown upon Ruth being at the same church as her husband, but if they knew even half of the truth they would run the no-good Reverend out-of-dodge.  As Ruth regretfully meets each new day, her self-esteem seems to be at an all-time low and her weight an all-time high, until she meets two of the cutest kids she has  ever seen.  Throughout her marriage all Ruth wanted was to carry a child to term but that was not to be; so when she meets Tee and Dee who look like her (biracial with freckles too) she immediately falls in love with them and their white dad.  Only one problem, their dad is not really interested in Ruth in a romantic way and so Ruth takes matters into her own hands.<br />Ruth is a woman of contrast.  One minute she seems as passive as a door knob as she allows everyone to walk over her, but then in the next minute we see a three-dimensional character that we love and care about.  Ruth shows that through it all she can survive -- living in the hood; scraping by working at a small beauty salon with her girlfriend Dianne; hanging out with friends who are both professional, attractive and critical; and still have love to give to two kids and their father who need it more than she does.  But will Ruth find a match made in heaven when love does not even seem possible between two people who could not have been more mismatched?<br />Something Real, JJ Murray's sophomore novel, is just that...\\"for real.\\"  Murray does an excellent job of developing the character of Ruth as well as the colorful cast of secondary characters that she befriends and loves.  Something Real is about love...love of self, love of significant other, love of family/friends and love of children.

Sometimes a first novel is a homerun; this is the case with This Side of the Sky by Elyse Singleton.  Beautifully written and creatively crafted by a fresh new voice in fiction, Singleton's debut novel is vividly detailed and movingly awesome.  This Side of the Sky is a unique story as Singleton shares with us a time in history that is seldom written about and often overlooked.<br />Singleton introduces us to lifelong friends and two great African American heroines, Lillian Mayfield and Myraleen Chadham.  Mayfield and Chadham's friendship is one that would begin in the early 1900s and span into the new millennium as they charter life through unknown territory.  They would survive the harsh realities of segregation, racism, broken romances and economic hardships as they search for their rightful places in rural Mississippi, Philadelphia, PA, an army base in England, and postwar Paris.<br />This Side of the Sky portrays life for African American women during a time where we are mostly forgotten and rarely (if ever) mentioned.  It was engrossing and compelling to read about two African American women who were WACs during WWII and the problems they faced as a result of gender as well as race.  Singleton writes with vivid imagery and fluid dialogue and makes the reader feel as though they are there in history experiencing events along with our heroines Lillian and Myraleen.<br />Historical fiction fans (and those who are not), folks interested in reading about women of color during WWII and those who enjoy a good romance will enjoy This Side of the Sky.  Elyse Singleton is an excellent storyteller and I highly recommend her novel to those who like literary reads with a universal appeal, timeless subject matter and stories that entertain as well as enlighten.

Her Mom is an alcoholic and barely pays any attention to her while her father and twin brother taunt her because she's obese.  Claudine seeks food for protection and believes it provides a cushion between her and the rest of the world.  Claudine's aunt, the mysterious and exotic Hattie Mae Jones, recognizes early on that Claudine is gifted and that it is possible for dreams to take her away from the dysfunctional family members who do not deserve or appreciate her.<br />Francesa Valentine is one of the most talented violinists in the world.  She is attractive, slim, well-spoken, well-traveled and well-known.  She is also a workaholic, touring constantly, giving interviews and doing what ever is necessary when it comes to her career so that she can avoid life.<br />Despite Claudine and Francesa's dreams and accomplishments, would either one of them be able to really escape her past?  What happens when three generations of lies come to the surface? Power, deceit, greed, and lust collide-leaving you with sheer Bliss.<br />Bliss is a story about powerful women, fearless women, and strong women.  Women who handle stress under fire with grace and lack of tears.  Via Claudine, Francesa, and Hattie Mae we experienced feelings of hope, determination and perseverance.  We felt pain, the struggle and the joy of the journey and we also laughed and smiled along the way.  Bliss is about love, hate, secrets, lies, deceit, betrayal and mother/daughter relationships.  Its a riveting and compelling story of triumph over adversity; I highly recommend this book to others.  I read it on the same day that the mailman delivered it and several hours later I was finished and satiated.

Donavin Jackson is smooth, debonair, handsome, and intelligent and he comes from a well-respected family.  However, he is also a member of the BDP aka the Billion Dollar Players whose primary objective is to \\"screw em and leave em.\\"  During a summer internship in NYC, he meets Jasmine, a college graduate of his current college, and she seems to be on top of her game and has a few surprises for Donavin. Donavin enjoys the challenge and the chase and finds himself wanting to get to know Jasmine better and potentially continue a relationship once he returns to college to finish his senior year in Atlanta, GA.  The road of LOVE is rarely without bumps, curves, sharp turns and potholes.  However...Haunted House might be a better description to describe Donavin and Jasmine's relationship as it was filled with the bad, ugly and downright scary once they tried to stay in touch via a long-distance relationship.<br />That's the Way Love Goes (TTWLG)  by first-time author, Daryl Diggs, is hilarious, witty and well-written.  TTWLG is truly Jasmine and Donavin's story as with the exception of Donavin's parents, who had True Black Love going on and were definitely a pleasure to read about, the other characters were not very distinctive.  I found myself oftentimes rereading passages to try and recall which friend was who.  After a while it did not matter because I did not necessarily consider them germane to the storyline.  While reading TTWLG, I had to keep an open-mind regarding the characters.  I considered many of their pranks and antics immature, childish and sometimes just downright stupid. I had to keep in mind that the characters were young and inexperienced.  As such the outlandish and comical situations that they encountered were not out of the norm for that age-group.  If you are looking for an entertaining, engaging and quick read then look no further than TTWGG.  At just shy of 200 pages, I was able to finish the book in one sitting and was happy that the author did not add extemporaneous information just to extend the storyline.  Young Adults, the college crowd, males (especially those trying to relive their youth) will especially enjoy TTWLG.

Yolanda Brook Callegari's debut novel, First Love, is an urban contemporary Christian novel and coming-of-age story about a young girl and her first romantic relationship with the opposite sex.  Amani Nicole Shepard is content with a life that revolves around school and church activities.  She finds comfort in her spirituality, her strong relationship with God, knowledge of the Word and her mother, Olivia Shephard.  Amani meets Marley Jamison, a star UCLA basketball player, during her senior year of high school. Marley is everything that Amani could wish for--he is intelligent, handsome, manner able, affectionate, kind and considerate.  Like Amani, Marley is in love for the first time, a born-again Christian, a virgin and is committed to staying that way until he marries.  As Amani and Marley fall deeper in love, Marley decides its time to trade in their celibate lifestyle and to consummate their relationship because after all they plan to marry each other after college.  Amani faces a dilemma...should she give into her boyfriend's demands and just do it like everyone else...or should she continue to save herself for marriage.  As Amani struggles to hold on to love and her boyfriend she does not want to lose herself in the process.<br />First Love is an entertaining and inspiring novel for the times in which we live.  The characters and the situations they encountered were realistic, real world issues that teens and adults face everyday. Callegari-Brooks' used biblical verses throughout the storyline to show that if we meditate on the Word, God will hear our cries and answer our prayers.  I also liked how Callegari-Brooks' incorporated a parent/child theme to draw adults (especially parents) into the storyline.  Amani's mother, Olivia, has high hopes and expectations for her youngest daughter who is the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter.  (The significance of the seventh is symbolism which stands for the completeness of the life cycle; in the biblical sense God created the world in seven days.)  ... Amani finds out about her mother's past and her entire foundation is shaken.  To make matters worse everything Amani believes about those closest to her-her mother, her boyfriend, her best friend-all appear to be built on sinking sand.<br />First Love is a story that entertains, inspires, encourages and teaches us all to put first things first. It is a Christian fiction story that examines maintaining values as a young person, as well as helping parents understand that communication, honesty and openness are key to a trusting relationship with a child and oftentimes can help prevent the same mistakes from reproducing in generation after generation.  First Love is about choices and consequences.  In light of the rising rate of teen pregnancies, abortions, and HIV/AIDs, First Love is a necessary read for young adults and parents today.  At times, Callegari-Brooks' might appear preachy to some, but I think it is only because she is passionate and strong about her beliefs and wants others to know that they do have options.<br /> I felt her book equipped me as a parent for when the time comes that I need to explain to my children \\"what thus says the Lord\\" about premarital sex.

Britton, Indera, Damascus, and Chyna are friends bonded by unconditional love and tragic childhoods.  Each character is colorful and memorable but underneath the humor and cool exteriors are scars that have not healed and souls that are truly shattered.  Emotional baggage and repressed childhood memories are threatening to erupt and control their adult lives.<br />On the surface, Shattered Souls appears to be just another novel about friends and their antics, but when we peel away the layers we find four individuals who are haunted by the hurt and pain that was inflicted during childhood by those that they trusted and those that should have known better.  Shattered Souls brings out a myriad of emotions...laughter, shock, tears, anger, sadness and joy.  Its a story that entertains but also enlightens.  Birch has done a fine job of addressing the after effects of abuse, neglect and abandonment.  I recommend this page-turner to others but I must warn you that the storyline includes graphic sexual content and off da hook foul language.  Fortunately these two issues were not enough to stop me from reading and enjoying this compelling storyline.	2002-09-02

As the story opens, Brunswick takes us into the life of Arthur, now a young man, who is traveling cross country via bus, as he has done so often since he ran away from home almost a decade ago.  Through flashbacks/journeys back into time we witness what life was like for Arthur, who was raised by a father who was emotionally and physically abusive, while his mother, who was in poor health, silently sat by and endured the wrath of her husband against her son.  Arthur was a gifted and talented student; however, while in high school, he committed an infraction that the school considered serious enough to suspend him as well as one which would probably promise brutal, cruel and unusual punishment from his dad.  Deciding that he had had enough abuse to last a lifetime, Arthur and a childhood friend decided to run away from their small town in Georgia, to the big city of Atlanta where it would be hard for anyone to find them.  But along with anonymity, Atlanta was also filled with demons and vices that could quickly overtake two young runaways who did not have much money.  Because he had limited skills, Arthur did what so many runaways living on the street are often forced to do; he became a prostitute servicing gay men.  Eventually, it was fear and a run-in with the law that made him return home and to once again endure the wrath and rage of his father. Although Arthur returns home life is worse than before he left.  Basically, he must fend for himself; but through all the trials, tribulations and obstacle courses, Arthur endures and actually has a chance to lead a normal, productive life.  Through the journeys which always begin with a bus ride, our hearts go out to Arthur, as we become a passenger on the road with him and learn firsthand who he really is.<br />Journeys of a Tortured Soul (JOATS) by Caesar Brunswick is a very disturbing story and not one for the weak and faint of heart.  Its a dark, raw and gritty tale that is realistically written and portrayed with graphic sexual scenes and depiction of life on the streets. Arthur Wilsons character felt real and it was heart wrenching to read and watch the turmoil and trauma that his father put him through as well as the consequences of some of his own actions. Some of the actions of the father were downright inhumane and should have been reported to Child Welfare.  Even worse is realizing that there are parents in real life who act like Mr. Wilson.<br />JOATS is the story of a young man who struggles to survive, while searching for love, self esteem and his sexual identity. Brunswick has a strong handle on the life of a young male living on the streets and growing up in a household with a loveless tyrant as a father and a helpless mom, so much so that I wondered if this was his story.  JOATS is a story that I definitely recommend to African American males to include teens and adults.  Its a story that most males should read and one that should not ever be experienced in real life.  On the APOOO 411 scale JOATS is 3.5 stars and a good read.<br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br />APOOO Bookclubweak and faint of heart.

From Chapter One, I was captivated and held hostage until the last page.  The characters while flawed were lovable.  I cried, laughed, became angry, frustrated, and was saddened by events in the characters' lives.  I felt like a family member for the few moments that I was allowed into their lives.<br />Living is an emotionally powerful story filled with wit, humor, candor and vivid imagery.  It is a story about friendship, family and relationships between the opposite sexes.  The storyline was wholesome and clean and as such a book that could be read by almost anyone without embarrassment.  I recommend Living to others who are looking for an entertaining, fast-paced, summer read and one that positively reflects African American males and females.  I look forward to other works from this talented author.<br />Yasmin...	2002-08-05

Ali Connery is young, attractive, married to a wonderful husband and appears to have a satisfying job.  But her perfect world is falling apart, as she continues to fall into the abyss of pills, marijuana and alcohol addiction.  When Ali continues to have nightmares regarding her abusive childhood, her husband suggests that she seek a professional for counseling and therapy.<br />As Ali roller coasts from a Therapist to a Psychiatrist, the reader quickly realizes that Ali really doesn't want help as she continues the yo-yo cycle of falling off the wagon so often that it becomes ridiculous and rudely annoying.  Actually, Ali possesses both of those traits along with being one-dimensional and self-destructive.  Since she was the main character, I kept looking and expecting some redeeming quality but unfortunately none was forthcoming.  So...I ended up liking all of the other characters and truly disliking Ali.<br />Afraid of the Dark has a strong premise but the execution needs improvement.  The story was plot-driven but the subject matter really called for more character development.  I wanted Ali's childhood abuse to be explored further and more rationale provided as to why.  I wish that Ali showed at least once that she wanted to be helped.  I commend Devlin on a gramatically well-structured book; however, I hope that future reads are more compelling, in-depth and that the characters are better developed.<br />Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClub	2002-08-01

After a parent raises her children, she should be able to stroll into the sunset and enjoy her twilight years in peace, and without the headaches of taking care of someone else's child.  Unfortunately, this was not to be the case for Bobbi Strickland, the protagonist in Evelyn Palfrey's latest novel, Everything in Its Place.  When Bobbi was barely out of her teens, she was a single-parent raising her twin children, Darcy and Darlene.  Now in her middle years, she's raising her grandchild and Darlene's daughter, Monee.  Monee has been with her grandmother since she was a tot; and now she is a normal, well adjusted but active preteen who keeps Bobbi busy shuffling her from one activity to another.  Except for choir rehearsal and Bobbi's career, as the principal of an inner-city elementary school, Bobbi really doesn't have a life outside of taking care of Monee and worrying about Darlene.  So when Ray, handsome, retired Armed Force personnel, newly divorced, and very handy around the house, enters Bobbi's life it is unexpected but can it lead to a pleasant surprise...riding into the sunset and living happily ever after?<br />Once again Palfrey has graced the reader with an entertaining and compelling read about \\"marvelously mature\\" adult romance.  Bobbi &amp; Ray are characters that we can easily relate to as they deal with the drama of raising adult children and trying to get a little adult romance going on the side.  As is her norm, Palfrey doesn't just bring us a relationship saga but she also gives us characters that are three-dimensional and have lives beyond the (bedroom) sheets.  And finally, it just wouldn't be a Palfrey novel without mystique, intrigue and suspense...shocking and surprising plot twists and turns.<br />Palfrey's Everything in Its Place is a solid page turner that held me captive and able to finish in one sitting.  On the APOOO scale, its 4.5 stars, and I recommend it to others who like mature reads with realistic drama.<br />Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClubookClub	2002-08-01

I almost didn't read Travis Hunter's most recent novel Married But Still Looking (MBSL) because of the title.  I wasn't looking forward to reading yet another \\"he say, she say\\" relationship saga.  Fortunately, Hunter showed me that you can't judge a story by the title.<br />Yes, Genesis Styles, the main character, is engaged but still whoring around and as such questioning if once he's married he will still be looking...for that piece of  \\"fresh meat/new bait\\".  But Genesis' story is only one aspect of this multidimensional and faceted story that takes us into the lives of Genesis' siblings as well.  These are the characters who kept me quickly turning the pages and anxiously anticipating what would happen next.  Each of the siblings were dealing with their own demons:  Genesis's brother was a drug-addict and ex-convict; oldest sister, Phyllis, had \\"white man\\" addiction; and youngest sister, Grace, used escapism to New York City as a mechanism to avoid the family drama in Atlanta...as the age old saying goes \\"she could run but she couldn't hide\\" and at some point she would have to come home and deal with the noise.<br />In his sophomore novel, Hunter proves that he has a solid career as a writer and that we can continue to look forward to his trademark of solid reads portraying positive African American brothers.  Of course, Genesis was a baby bow wow but even he had some redeeming traits...well you had to look real hard to find them.  I enjoyed MBSL and this is a book that will truly have you talking to the characters, shaking your head, and wishing you could take some folks across your knees and give them a spanking.  Looking for an entertaining and fast-paced read with in-depth character development, vivid imagery and shocking plot twists and turns? Then check out Married But Still Looking by Travis Hunter.

Readers who may have been turned off by Zane's prior works due to the profanity, explicit sex scenes, and over the top Jerry Springer situations will be pleasantly surprised by The Heat Seekers.  Zane gives us a strong storyline with her latest novel, where she allows women and men to engage in monogamous relationships, shows us men who are flawed but still have redeeming qualities, and doesn't rely on sexual escapades or shenanigans to carry the storyline.<br />I enjoyed The Heat Seekers. Its the story of best friends, Janessa and Tempest, who meet and date best friends, Geren and Dvonte.  While the story does not follow her usual pattern, Zane's unique creative style is still evident with mentions of midgets, Niagra and the infamous \\"ghetto\\" wedding.  However, its the seriousness of opposite sex relationships and the love story between young  African Americans, which caused me to read The Heat Seekers nonstop.  Zane might not have given her avid fans what they wanted; however, The Heat Seekers brought her storytelling abilities to the forefront and hopefully captures some new readers and brings them into her target base.<br /> The Heat Seekers is entertaining, engaging and fast-paced and one that I recommend.  I applaud Zane for taking a chance and a departure from her previous writing style and I look forward to future reads ...where she continues to write outside of the box.<br />Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClub	2002-07-26

Folks sure come from far and near ...as they all jockey to Sit on the Front Pew.  Close and distant relatives, family and friends, all want to sit on the front pew when a loved one dies.  The Naylor clan is no exception and at times more colorful than your average clan...but many of their antics ring close to home in Parry Brown's latest novel, Sittin' in the Front Pew (SITFP).<br />Edward Naylor was a solid African American male and respected pillar of his community.  He was a devoted father and family man and single-handedly raised his daughters after his wife's untimely death decades ago.  He represented the epitome of the Father of the Year to his four daughters, as well as their friends.  When Edward Naylor dies unexpectedly his family is upset, shell-shocked and in denial as they hazily make his funeral arrangements. But the s8%# really hits the fan when the family discovers a mystery woman in Naylor's will!  Who is this \\"hussy\\" who deserves a byline in the Naylor girls daddy's will?<br />Sitting In the Front Pew is a compelling and touching read.  Brown surpassed my expectations with her latest novel...as she creatively crafted and delivered with wit an African American funeral(there are none others like it).  From the prologue, I was glued to SITFP and eagerly pondered and asked...\\"What Else Can Happen Next?\\"  The characters, to include the secondary characters (who can forget Roberta), were colorful, sassy, outrageous and yet very believable.  The storyline twists and turns were shocking and surprising yet realistic.  Brown took us to the top of the emotional Richter scale without losing control with SITFP.  I laughed, I cried, I experienced feelings of love, disgust, and frustration, but in the end I was satisfied by a well-written and entertaining story.  Parry Brown shows her readers that she is more than a one or two book phenomenon.  SITFP proves she's here to stay and will continue to write about and portray African American males who are positive role models in spite of their shortcomings.  SITFP is a must read novel and I highly recommend it to others.<br />Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClubwho are positive role models in spite of their shortcomings.

Promises To Keep by Gloria Mallette is a page turner and compelling read.  The storyline is intriguing and suspenseful and tugs heavily on the heartstrings.  Mallette introduces us to the Kirkwood family and takes us on an emotional rollercoaster to track down the murderer of Troy Kirkwood.<br />What started out as a normal day, typical father-daughter outing ended in a tragedy.  Meika, already abandoned by her mother, is now left fatherless at the tender, young age of 5.  Troy's parents, Nola and Ron, are in shock and left wondering who would commit such a heinous act against their eldest son.  As far as anyone knew, Troy didn't have any known enemies...except for maybe his crack-addicted, ex-wife, Cordelia.  With the help of their younger son, Vann, Nola and Ron must come to grips with the moment, bury their son and then search for the murderer.  Along the way, life still goes on and as tempers are pushed to the limit regarding Troy's untimely death, Nola and Ron must face their own shortcomings as well as deal with the demons of envy, jealousy, deceit and insecurity.  Vann must confront head-on issues that have dogged him since childhood.  Will this family be able to survive the obstacles that continue to run them down?  Will they ever find Troy's murderer?<br />Promises To Keep is a multi-dimensional story.  Mallette gives us a story that is equally plot and character driven.  She gives us characters that we feel-whether it be empathy, pity, sorrow, happiness, joy, or hatred-we feel something for each character presented.  Promises To Keep is creatively crafted and Mallette treads topics that are rarely written about in a fictional manner-Missing Persons, Children Raised By Fathers/Paternal Grandparents, and the worst situation of all...a mother who appears to care more about the pipe rather than her own flesh and blood.<br />Mallette's latest novel is an entertaining and engrossing read than can be read in one sitting.  Fans and newcomers alike will enjoy Promises To Keep.  I recommend it to all and look forward to Ms. Mallette's next novel.<br />Yasmin<br />APOOO Bookclubromises To Keep.

Someone To Catch My Drift at more than 400 pages is a thick debut novel from Jacqueline Powell.  The story is well-told, engaging, entertaining and at times just downright ridiculous...however, it still comes across as just another \\"He Say, She Say\\" relationship novel.  Told in alternating voices of the two primary characters, Powell gives us Her Story (Nakai) and His Story (Robert).  Nakai and Robert both have issues.  Nakai has a knack for picking the wrong man ALL the time.  Robert thinks he's a Mack Brother who needs more than one woman to satisfy the itch in his pants.  Both of them have low self-esteem which is the root of their EVERY problem.  Why they stay together and how they stay together is anyone's guess.<br />STCMD is a well written and engaging story but no new territory is chartered.  Early on the reader quickly predicts how the story is going to end.  There were no shocking or surprising plot twists and turns.  However, I do give the author credit for developing characters that got under your skin and annoyed the hell out of you!  If this was her objective she was definitely successful.  Jacqueline Powell demonstrates that she's an excellent writer and has the skills to write an outstanding story. For those who like \\"He She, She Say\\" reads then I highly recommend STCMD.  As for me, I would like to read future novels by Powell, but I hope she's able to think outside of the box and give me a little more intrigue and suspense with her next novel.	2002-06-17

A young married couple...who're not very happy with each other.  Randy, an advertising executive, is on a three-month temporary assignment in Paris while his wife, Mikki, feels left behind in NYC.  Of course, she could have been in Paris with her husband but she decided to stay behind and run her bridal boutique. While Randy is in Paris he has asked his best friend, Marcus, who's divorced, to look out for his wife Mikki.  Marcus and Mikki form a vicarious bond.  Additionally, while Mikki is worried whether her marriage will survive she also has to contend with the crumbling marriage of her parents.  For Mekhi life is one lesson after another of \\"why did I even wake up today.\\"<br />LDLHA is a well-written book but it wasn't very compelling.  The characters seemed stiff and lifeless; and they weren't very likable. From page one it was obvious that Randy &amp; Mikki didn't belong together.  So when things started to spiral out of control it was difficult to feel any type of emotions for either of these characters...and easy to say \\"Enuf Already.\\"  And then there was Marcus...I wish his character was more flushed out.  I knew who he was but I didn't understand why he did the things he did.  It was like he appeared and disappeared in the same instance without any explanation as to his reason for being.<br />LDLHA is for anyone who's an avid fan of relationship novels...for those who want a more compelling and engrossing read...one that covers different territory... then this might not be the book for you.	2002-06-17

Set against the backdrop of the military arena, Thompson takes us into the world of Sanderella Coffee and Romulus Ceasar.  Sanderella (aka Sandy) is a round-the-way girl who's had to overcome obstacle after obstacle in her short life here on earth.  Joining the military was probably one of the best things that happened to her as it gave her the discipline she needed to grow up and become a responsible individual.  But the military introduces more than discipline and sacrifices.  Sandy also meets Romulus (aka Rom).  Rom is a drill sergeant who knows that it's wrong to have an affair with an enlisted member of the Armed Services...but does that stop him?  Does he think about the fact that he's already married and that while his marriage is loveless he's been content with it for the last 10 years as he tried to be a \\"Do Right Man\\" and stay in a miserable marriage because he wanted to be apart of his two young kids lives.  None of it appears to matter when Sergeant Coffee comes on the scene and has his nose wide open.<br />Black Coffee by Tracy Price-Thompson is a good read.  Initially the storyline started off on a slow note for me...but after about the first 50 pages the storyline really picked up and I wasn't able to put the book down until I finished the last page.  The thrust of the drama begins when Sanderella meets Drill Sergeant Romulus Ceasar, but what really drew me into this story was the family drama going on with the rest of Sandie's siblings.  I liked that the characters were very colorful and came to life with their gritty and raw dialogue.  One of the most poignant and chilling twist for me was toward the end and will probably remain with me for years to come. The situation stands out for me because it was truly over the top and one that would probably not be easily forgotten or forgiven by most women, especially an unmarried woman.<br /><br />Black Coffee is an entertaining, engaging and quick read with shocking and surprising plot twists and turns.  My only disappointment was that the ending was too neatly wrapped up...but that aside, I would recommend Black Coffee to others who enjoy contemporary fiction with a lot of drama. I look forward to other novels from Tracy Price-Thompson and I wish her much success in her future endeavors.and quick read with shocking and surprising plot twists and turns.

In his debut novel, Egeston provides a coming of age story about young Benny Dempkins.  From Chapter One...its on as Benny shows out and his mom gives him a much needed whippin'...at least from her perspective.  Through the years we get to know Benny, as well as, his parents and extended family.  Egeston took me down memory lane as I though back to my own childhood (and the lack of physical discipline) as well as family reunions and the proverbial peach cobbler.  WSPC is a book that enlightens, informs and shares heartwarming as well as LOL situations.  I liked that Egeston tried to show balance of \\"proper\\" discipline.  He exposed us to parents who didn't discipline at all as well as parents who SHOULDN'T  haven been allowed to have children more or less apply physical discipline because they were all-out child abusers! These were the folks that 911 was created for.<br />WSPC is an engrossed and creatively crafted novel from Egeston.  I loved the character development and especially enjoyed the colorful extended family members to include Aunt Flappy and Uncle Sho Shack.  I felt like I personally knew the folks from WSPC and I shared in their joy, pain, anguish and frustration.  These characters were real and came to life for me...so much so that they jumped off the pages and into my life during the brief time we were together.  Egeston's writing is refreshing, humorous and has wit while also providing a moral commentary to the AA community.  \\"WSPC is an unforgettable tale about family, adversities and the events that make us laugh while healing our souls.\\"  I recommend WSPC to anyone who wants to curl up with a good book.	2002-06-14

From the author of So Good and All of Me, Venise Berry is back with Colored Sugar Water a very different novel from her first two novels.  Colored Sugar Water is about friendship, relationships and spirituality.  It's a thought-provoking book that may have you questioning what you believe.<br />Meet Adel and Lucy.  Adel is stuck in a job that she doesn't enjoy but the six-figures keep her going back day after day.  Then there's her husband who lives in la-la land and reminds me of Tommy from the old Martin show.  Remember Tommy supposedly had a job but no one knew where?  That's Adel's husband...a man that she is definitely too good for.  Adel's spiritual life is lacking and she's not sure of what to believe. Lucy, Adel's best friend, is single but has been in a comfortable although uninspired relationship with Spencer for the past few years.  Unfortunately he no longer floats her boat.  Lucy who believes in everything including Christianity, voodoo and the psychic hotline decides to explore.  Her exploring leads her to Kuba...the mystery man from the psychic hotline who takes her on a roller coaster adventure.<br />Colored Sugar Water was an engaging and page turning experience for me.  I kept reading because I wanted to know the outcome. Berry brought us full circle with Adel and Lucy and their spiritual journey. Colored Sugar Water is about what the two characters, Adel and Lucy believe, and their ability to come to terms with their beliefs in order to grow spiritually as well as in their professional and personal relationships.  I liked that Berry didn't preach about religion but rather showed us that we have choices and that faith might mean something different to each person. In fact, she touched on all the religions/spiritual beliefs that individuals might hold.  There was one scene with the Jehovah Witnesses that was a Kodak moment...I loved it!  I must admit I was slightly disappointed in the ending.  Berry left it open so that you could form your own opinion...or as she said in an online chat...Â¨The ending is whatever your belief system is.&quot;  Hmm...while it was true to what Berry wanted to accomplish with Colored Sugar Water I took that as a copout because I wanted a direct answer. :)<br />But that aside I enjoyed the story and recommend it to those who enjoy creatively crafted and refreshing reads.

Bittersweet is Freddie Lee Johnson's debut novel and is the story of three very different brothers and their struggles with marriage, relationships and life.  It's about their love (sometimes hate) affairs with the women in their life but more importantly it's about their love for each other and the bond that holds them together.  Bittersweet is a good story.  It's a positive portrayal of African American men who're taking care of their families as well as handling their business.  You know the brothers that we rarely hear about in the news and more often than not rarely make it to the pages of contemporary fiction.  But Johnson flips the script with Bittersweet.<br />Nathan is the oldest brother, and a minister.  But first he's a man who has to wrestle with his human side.  Temptation is front and center in his life regarding one of his  parishioners and he must do penance and prayer double time if he's to remain true to his vows.  Victor, the middle son, is the brother who's lived the thug/street life; he's so different from the other brothers that one wonders if he had the same mother and father as his siblings.  While Victor is rough around the edges and at times straight up ghetto, he still loves his daughter and is far from a dead beat dad even though his ex-wife often makes it difficult for him to share in his daughter's childhood.  Clifford, the youngest brother, is a loving family man with the wife from hell. Demetria is all about her and nothing else matters except her happiness by any means necessary. If there was ever a character you loved to hate it was definitely Demetria.  Can we say sista needed a serious Beatdown?<br />While spouses may come and sometimes leave the Matthew Brothers know there is always one women who will always be their for them.  The brothers were raised by a single mother whose abiding love and constant support held them together when circumstances threatened to tear them and their lives apart.<br />Johnson has written a compelling and poignant novel with Bittersweet.  Bittersweet is a story about black men who love their families including their spouses, children as well as their Mom. These brothers are conscientious about their responsibilities and committed to making the world a better place for their families.  So when obstacles come their way they don't run and hide but step up to the plate and handle situations like a man rather than a boy toy.  Each brother faces crises and drama that make him go deep within himself to find the strength and courage to succeed in spite of the adversities that land in his path.  These characters demonstrate that Good Black Men do still exist and Black Love is still alive and abounding.  If we're willing to give each other a chance there is hope that any relationship can survive.

Forster takes us into the world of Marge Hairston, newspaper owner extraordinaire and the mother of three adult children.  Marge Hairston has always had to be the strong and independent matriarch of the Hairston family.  For years her life has revolved around her position as the owner of the Woodmore Times (North Carolina's most influential African American newspaper) and the three children she raised alone after her husband's death.  So when Marge finds herself feeling a little more tired than usual she finally succumbs to her better judgment and goes to visit her family doctor.  She is shocked to learn that she is terminally ill and only has a brief time to get her affairs in order.  The first order of business is which one of her three adult children will take over the family business.<br />Meet Drogan, Marge's oldest child and only son, who's handsome but oftentimes manipulative while he constantly thinks only about his well-being.  The second child is Cassie, Marge's oldest daughter, who appears to suffer from 'me-ism.'  Sharon, Marge's youngest child, seems to be the most levelheaded and rational sibling.  Sharon is the peacemaker of the family.  She sees the best in everything and everybody almost to a fault.  It is Sharon, who gives up her professional career in order to take over the day-to-day running of the Woodmore Times and to lead the newspaper into the next millennium.  True to expectations, eyes roll, fingers snap, necks turn, 'tudes mal-adjust and sparks fly as the baby of the family steps forward to handle HER business.  Not only are the siblings at odds with each other, but they're also at odds with their mother, their spouses and their world.  Will their cherished close relationships survive?  Will time heal all wounds?  Will they be able to forgive, forget and reconcile?<br />When Twilight Comes by Gwynne Forster is a commendable departure into the mainstream fiction arena.  Forster writes an engaging and touching story  although at times I felt that the story got ahead of itself.  Additionally, in the first few chapters I kept wondering what the big rush was.  Why did decisions need to be made in a split second?  I kept thinking will a day or two or even a week be too much to ask for when you have to make a major decision that will impact the rest of your life?  These points aside, When Twilight Comes is still a book that I would recommend to others.  Fans of Forster will especially enjoy her mainstream debut novel.

I kept thinking will a day or two or even a week be too much to ask for when you have to make a major decision that will impact the rest of your life?  These points aside, When Twilight Comes is still a book that I would recommend to others.  Fans of Forster will especially enjoy her mainstream debut novel.  Forster has piqued my interest with When Twilight Comes and I plan to test the waters again by reading her next romance novel titled \\"Once In a Lifetime\\" which is due out in July 2002. <br />Yasmin <BR>APOOO BookClub	2002-05-22

In Between Lovers, Dickey introduces us to three individuals intertwined in a troublesome threesome.  No Name wants Nicole.  Ayanna wants Nicole.  And Nicole wants BOTH of them.  Between Lovers is told primarily from the standpoint of the male narrator, who the reader quickly realizes has no name, so we simply refer to him as \\"narrator, no name, or him.\\"  His presence and personality is so strong and felt so immensely throughout the book that quite honestly he needs No Name because without him there wouldn't be a story.<br />Between Lovers greatest strength is its character development of primary as well as secondary characters.  These are characters that you feel and as such you laugh with them, cry with them, shout at them, scream at them, talk about them and just plain want to slap them sometimes...okay maybe a lot of times.<br />Between Lovers might easily be Dickey's most complex and ambitious storyline to date.  When I initially read the first few chapters I wasn't drawn into the story.  In fact, I set the book aside, for a couple of weeks, before I picked it up again.  I'm glad I gave it a second chance.  The more engrossed I became with the storyline the more compelling and alive the story became for me.  The tension and competitiveness of the storyline was so realistic and believable that I felt as thought I was right there living in the midst of the characters.<br />Between Lovers probably isn't for everyone.  But for those who like a refreshing reading or a change of pace from Eric Jerome Dickey then this is a book to add to your reading list.<br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClub	2002-05-15

The protagonist, Richard Whelan has it all.  He's a Harvard Grad and is the National Security Advisor to the President.  He's living large in the national's capital, has a nice ride and a trophy lady on his arm...oh did I mention that she was white?  So what could go wrong?  Everything when he's picked up for Driving While Black and framed for a murder as well as various security breaches that he didn't commit.  Whelan's, high-powered friend, a Black Female(of course), Bettina, comes to the rescue to help him out of the demise that he faces.  Bettina must help keep him alive and safe in order to stop a nuclear detonation that someone is hell-bent on setting off.<br />Blowback is a well-written and believable novel that's spookily scary as it rings true of real life events going on in the world today.  Fullilove appears to have a background in the story he writes, and, if not, he has done a superb job researching the topics for the storyline.  The narration is tight and taut, the plot line complex, intriguing and thrilling. My only disappointment with the book was that the non-stop action took away from character development; Blowback is definitely a plot-driven book.  That aside Blowback is a page-turner.  This is a one-night, do not-put-it-down read.  If you like books that involve governmental conspiracy, betrayal, and cover-ups then add Blowback by Eric James Fullilove to your to read list.<br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br />APOOO BookClub	2002-05-15

It's always an enriching experience to read a sophomore novel from an author whose writing shows growth.  Murray is one such author!  From Chapter One she quickly roped me into Anya's story and I didn't let go until the very last page.  Anya's life was filled with romance, intrigue and faith.  It was faith which helped her to keep going after enduring a brutal tragedy.  The characterization of Joy was strong and I especially liked how Murray showed us the depth of Anya's character via her relationship with her family(especially her grandmother and cousin), her fianc&eacute;e who we all loved to hate and Anya's life as a professional/career women who was making significant strides as an African American woman in  a predominantly male dominated profession.<br />Joy is a book about love, hate, trust,  and betrayal with a great lesson in forgiveness and faith.  Murray shows up how Anya uses her faith in God and the love of her family and friends to recover after a vicious attack by a stalker.  At times, Anya did seem a little two perfect, but I especially liked that her story was positive and plausible.  Murray presents Anya's strong Christian values in a compelling manner without sounding preachy and yet allowing the reader to enjoy a good story. Joy by Victoria Christopher Murray is a good read which I recommend to others who want to experience a good book  while strengthening their walk with the Lord.<br />APOOO BOOKCLUB	2002-02-09

Realistic with Strong Characterization	When You Look At Me is a bittersweet and emotionally charged debut novel from Undra Biggs.  Tamlyn Blake is an underage, unwed single mother who is forced to move out of her parent's house and live on her own after having two children out of wedlock.  She's a high school dropout, a welfare recipient and living in one of the worst inner city projects.  Along comes a potential suitor....Hassan Colbirth.

Even though Tamlyn appears to be just another welfare mom, she and Hassan really come from different worlds and one has to ask the question...\\"Will their relationship be able to last in spite of their different backgrounds\\"?<br />When You Love at Me is an impressive debut novel from Undra Biggs.  Biggs gives a realistic and emotionally honest portrayal of what can happen  when a smart, middle-class girl risks it all in the name of passion or lust which she  unfortunately mistook for love.  The hard-knock reality is that it was not an easy pill to swallow when Tamlyn  make the same mistake twice and it appeared that her family had turned their back on her.  However, Biggs also shows that with persistence, sweat, tears and determination one can still grow up to be all they can be.  My only disappointment with the novel was the ending which seemed a little too reminiscent of a fairy tale.  That aside, I really enjoyed this provocative and poignant storyline.<br />When You Look at Me is a fast paced, engrossing and compelling read with a significant social message from an author with a fresh new  voice.  Biggs has shown that she's a name to be remembered and I look forward to future novels from this talented author.<br />APOOO BOOKCLUB	2002-02-09

Based on a friend's recommendation, I decided to give Finding Mabeka by Alex Pate a chance.  What an impressive and remarkable novel.<br />Can you imagine a situation where you haven't seen your father since your childhood, but yet he's written a story about his life with you and your mother for the entire world to see?<br />Childhood is supposed to be filled with everything nice, sugar and spice, two parents and a secure, loving environment.  Even though Makeba's parents argued often,  Makeba never imagined that she would be the product of a broken home.  Ben Crestfield wanted to write; writing was his first love.  His wife, Helen, wanted him to have a job which offered security, benefits and a steady paycheck.  When Helen's love starts to become overbearing, Ben decides that he must escape so in the middle of the night he kisses Makeba and says good-bye.  While Ben said he was leaving his wife, he promised Makeba that he wasn't leaving her and that he would always be there for her.  A promise that he would find impossible to keep.<br />Crestfield vowed that he wouldn't be another AA male statistic...you know father who leaves home never to return to check up on his children  or see that they're surviving physically, emotionally or financially...you know those deadbeat dads that leave mothers to become single parents and children in broken homes.  So what happen to make everything go so wrong?<br />Fast-forward a decade later, Makeba is a young lady and Ben is a published writer.  Imagine Ben's surprise when he's at a booksigning promoting his book and he looks up to see a young lady asking him to &quot;sign it for Makeba Crestfield&quot;.  Suddenly and without warning, Ben is forced to confront his past when he comes face-to-face with the daughter he abandoned so many years before.<br />Finding Makeba is a remarkable novel about father-daughter relationships, fatherhood, forgiveness and redemption. Pate expertly weaves the story of Ben and Makeba as he alternates chapters with Ben's story and excerpts from Makeba's journal. Finding Makeba is a creatively crafted story about a familiar topic told in a refreshing and engrossing manner.  I like that Finding Makeba was told with emotional honestly and that the father was presented in a positive light.  Ben Crestfield really wanted to do right by his daughter because even though he no longer wanted to be married to his wife he still cared deeply for his daughter and due to circumstances beyond his control he was forced to abandon her.  I really enjoyed Pate's writing style, tone and point of view and I look forward to reading other novels from this talented author.<br />APOOO Bookclubes chapters with Ben's story and excerpts from Makeba's journal.

Near Perfect the semi-sequel/follow-up to Nothing But The Rent  by Sharon Mitchell grabbed me from page one.  I recall that I didn't really care for Nothing But The Rent and was a little skeptical about reading a sequel so I was pleasantly surprised when I was drawn into the read so quickly.  I've read all of Mitchell's book and I must say that she continues to show growth as a writer with every book as each book from her is better than the previous one.<br />Mitchell reunites us with Roxanne Steele who appears to have the &quot;perfect life&quot;-phine and loving husband, luxurious and large home, money in the bank, great job and all the  material possessions she could ever want.  However, she is still unfulfilled in one area of her life and that is being a mother.  She's almost obsessive about having a child to round out her happy home and perfect life.  Unfortunately, her idyllic life will be turned upside down by a tragic event.  It's at that junction in the road that she's slapped hard in the face regarding her husband and her marriage.<br />Roxanne's friends and mother rush to her rescue to help her pick up the pieces and move on but it's Linc, her handsome and protective friend since childhood who helps her to move on and in a new direction.  As Roxanne journeys forward, we ache, we cry and then finally we smile again and we rejoice as Roxanne discovers that life and living is near perfect at best.<br />Near Perfect is a wonderful relationship novel that combines fine writing with suspense and intrigue.  Mitchell's tone was engaging, warm, friendly and heartwarming as she allowed the characters to bring the story to life.  I must admit that she really threw me for a loop regarding Jamal's character as I was caught completely off guard.  However, once I got over the initial shock that twist just added more to the compelling nature of the storyline for me.  Near Perfect is an endearing story about love, friendship, family, committment, trust, betrayal and redemption and I highly recommend this novel to others.ption and I highly recommend this novel to others.	2002-01-25

Lee Paige saves Porter Stockton's life and unbeknownst to her it's love at first sight for Porter.  Porter neglects to get Lee's personal information and thinking he will never see her again he is surprised when she shows up and later accepts a position with the Philadelphia Record.  Lee is strong-willed, independent and definitely into solely Black on Black dating and so she's surprised and hesitant when Porter approaches her.  Eventually she lets down her guard and decides to date Porter except it's a secret and no one she knows can find out.  What Lee assumes will be nothing more than a passing fling blossoms into a full-fledge relationship which is complicated by love and race.<br />Meeting of the Waters (MOTW) is a term for a smooth blending but love and race matters rarely run a smooth course...whether it's internal or external interference.  In the case of Lee &amp; Porter it will be internal and emotionally exhibited via insecurities, anxieties, uncertainties and instability.  MOTW is one of the most realistic and convincing novels about interracial relationships that I've had the pleasure to read.  Unlike many interracial books which focus on the family structure or the life of the biracial child, McLarin choose to focus on the relationship of the couple and delve deeply into their psychic.  We witness up close &amp; personal Lee &amp; Porter's  relationship evolve and their raw &amp; gritty feelings emerge.  We're face-to-face experiencing Lee's anxiety's and Porter's colorblindness.  MOTW was a very candid read with strong characterization.  At times, I wondered if it was an autobiography and if I was reading about the author's life because the situations and actions were so believable.<br />Meeting of the Waters is an intriguing and provocative sophomore novel from Kim McLaurin.

Alex Pate is back and once again gracing us with his lyrical, eloquent and poignant writing style.  West of Rehoboth is set in the `60s and is about one summer in the life of 12 year old Edward Massey.  Every summer the Masseys traveled to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware to escape the heat, gangs and mean streets of Philly.  Edward's parents believe that Rehoboth with its idyllic beach resorts and slower pace is a safer environment for a young AA male child in the early `60s.  But is it really?  While Rehoboth Beach definitely seems to move at a snail's pace, its still below the Mason-Dixon line where Blacks are still relegated to subservient roles.  The environment is one of a slow furnace that simmers, cooks slowly and is ever ready to explode because of the extremely depressing racial climate.  It's home of Aunt Edna a respected business woman and Uncle Rufus who Aunt Edna makes sleep in the shed out back.  Young Edward, who's an avid Agatha Christie fan, has decided this is the summer, that he puts his sleuth skills to work, and finds out who is the real Uncle Rufus.  In the process, Edward unknowingly will place his own life in danger as he discovers that Rufus is just one of many AA males who've been beaten down by the system and the times...who's encountered a life of violence, hate, frustration and much disappointment.  But in spite of it all, Rufus has a story to tell and one that hopefully can teach Edward a few things about life and growing up as an AA male in this land of the free and the brave called America.<br />West of Rehoboth is a wonderful read with strong character development.  Young Edward and elderly Rufus jump off the pages and into your heart as you read this poignant and engaging story.  This is a book that's told with emotional honesty and as such sometimes it made it difficult for me to read in one sitting but the suspense kept me quickly turning the pages.  I will admit I was a little disappointed in the ending because I was expecting something different, and as such the ending would make me rate the book a 4.5 but because I thoroughly enjoyed other aspects of the book I rounded up to a 5.0.  There are some books that touch you in such a way that its hard to describe with words; West of Rehoboth is one such book for me.  This is a book that got under my skin and became a part of my spirit.  Maybe its because I could relate to the time-frame and mindset of the early 60s since I was also coming of age then.<br />Pate is an author with immense skills and talents and I look forward to reading future releases by him.

After one rejection letter too many for his latest literary masterpiece, Monk decides to change his approach and jump on the contemporary \\"ghetto fabulous\\" bandwagon, under the pseudonym Stagg R. Leigh with a story called My Pafology which he later shortens to an offensive four letter word beginning with a F.  Much to his chagrin, he becomes an overnight success, receives a six-figure book advance and a ... million dollar movie deal.  Soon Monk's alter ego seems to take over his life as he tries to remain on the downlow and not expose his true identity.  In addition to maintaining a secret identity, Monk must also deal with family issues such as a mother with Alzheimer's, a brother who's gay and a sister who runs an abortion clinic.  Everett successfully pulls all the plots together and has one anxiously turning the pages to see what Monk is going to do next and what is going to be the outcome of his \\"scheme\\".<br />Erasure is a riveting and poignant novel.

It's a provocative storyline that's a parody and commentary on the current crop of \\"ghetto fabulous\\" fiction that continues to sell because it usually offers tons of entertainment rather than information or enlightenment.  Erasure is a must read for anyone who wants a change of pace, insightful reading and a provocative storyline.

Growing Up all Mingus Browning ever wanted was to belong, to feel normal and secure in a semi-perfect family.  Now all grown up as a mature adult everything appears to be okay in her professional life as a successful lawyer, however, her personal life continues to stay in a rut due to one heartbreak after another.  As she sits depressed over the breakup of her last boyfriend, she receives a phone call from her oldest sister, Eva.  All hell breaks loose when Mingus learns that her father has left her white mom for another woman...a black woman no less.  Mingus was unprepared for the dissolution of her parents 35-year marriage or the fact that life as she knew it would be ever shattered.  Mingus is torn as she struggles to do right by her mom, although she's always been closest to her father, Carl.  As Carl pulls away from Mingus the hole he digs might be too deep to ever repair and the lives he shatters will never be the same again.<br />Resurrecting Mingus is a well-written, candid and poignant debut novel from Jenoyne Adams.  Its a tale about growing up in an interracial family.  A tale of secrets, deceit, betrayal and identity issues. The Browning Family truly makes you wonder how one family can appear so normal on the outside yet be so dysfunctional on the inside.  As the family is engulfed by the affects of adultery, the bond seems to ravel as we discover secrets that have been hidden for over 30 years. One of the greatest strength of Adams writing is the character development and her ability to transition seamlessly between characters as she allows them to each tell their crucial side of the story.  The reader is allowed to witness up close and personal the emotional side of the Browning Family.  There's Mingus,  the successful younger daughter who's only wanted to be loved and to belong.  She couldn't understand why her mother seemed to prefer her sister Eva over her.  Mingus' mom, Ellen, struggles to understand why her marriage collapsed.  Seems she was more concerned about loving her husband than she was about loving herself.  Mingus' father Carl confronts his many mistakes and owns up to a few of them.  Mingus' older sister, Eva probably  the least understood member of the family.  As the story climaxes and comes to an explosive ending, Eva was the person who appeared to have no redeeming qualities and an individual that you loved to hate.<br />Resurrecting Mingus is appropriately titled as familial and personal events force Mingus to reevaluate her relationship with her parents as well as her feelings about her biracial identity.  Resurrecting Mingus is a craftily written, riveting and poignant novel. Adams gives a new and different voice to a interracial marriage and the affect that it has on kids even when they're grown.

Afterall, Ruby was just as likely to smile at you as she was to kill you and bury you for crossing her.

I was a little skeptical about reading another book about the sorority experience, because in the past, the books I read didn't appear to target an audience beyond 18-24 years of age.  So I was pleasantly surprised that Walking The Line by Althea Hughes was an engrossing and compelling page turner which I finished in one sitting and it was a really good story.  Hughes provides a realistic and accurate portrayal of the sorority experience but more importantly it could have been about any experience.  After close examination of the main character, Charisma(aka Charis) Alexander she is literally walking a very fine line between following her dreams and pleasing herself or following the steps of others and pleasing them.<br />Charis is forced to make many decisions through her coming of age process...one of the most crucial decisions at the moment is whether or not she will jeopardize her 4.0 GPA by pledging her senior year of college.  If it were left to Charis she would postpone pledging any sorority forever...afterall what's the big deal?  Well, to Charis mother it's a very big deal.  Afterall, the women in Charis family are all Rho Kappa Delta sorors with a family legacy and history that &quot;pressures&quot; all female relatives to become RKD sister.  Kyra , president of RKD, knows of Charis' family legacy and coerces Charis into pledging.  What ensues is a rollercoaster pledging experience with a cast of characters who will have you LOL, shaking your head, screaming out loud and wanting to give a few folks a breakdown.<br />On a serious note, Hughes writing/message does more than entertain.  Hughes provides a three-dimensional view of Charis so that we see her making decisions regarding her future career, her trifling boyfriend, negotiating peace among her divorced parents and really coming to self-realization about who is Charis.  Also the secondary characters represented duality.  Kyra and Briana are polar opposites, as were Randall and Sean, and Charis's parents William and Anna.  But Charis seem to always be in the middle of all of these relationships.  In the end, Charis' realizes that she must follow her own moral code, she must follow her heart and create her own path through life.<br />Walking the Line is far more than initiation, pledging and hazing it's about growing up and making your own decisions.  Thanks Ms. Hughes for a wonderful and insightful debut novel.<br />I look forward to  more creatively crafted and refreshing storylines from you in the future.s William and Anna.

When you're eleven years old you still look forward to summers spent hanging out with friends, swimming and staying up late trying to hear snippets of grown folks conversations.  Unfortunately, Belly wouldn't have the luxury of learning to swim from her best friend, 13 year old Teeny who is pregnant and being sent away to have her baby.  Rather than spending a lonely summer in her rural, small hometown of Lambertville, Va, Belly decides to visit her Aunt Rachel and Uncle Avery for a few weeks.  A visit, Belly wasn't initially looking forward to until she heard that she would be able to take piano lessons from Miss Ophelia.  Miss Ophelia is a childhood friend of Belly's Mother and Belly is hoping that she will learn somethings about her mom from Miss Ophelia.  Miss Ophelia and Belly do become friends and it is during their friendship that Belly learns that Uncle Avery is having an affair with her piano teacher.  What ensues after that is much more than Belly bargained for and forces Belly to grow up quicker than she anticipated.<br />Miss Ophelia by Mary Burnett Smith is an enchanting and intriguing debut novel.  The storyline has a superb plot, awesome characterization, wonderful pacing and vivid imagery.  The characters are engaging and memorable including the secondary characters.  Who can forget Uncle Willie!  What a delightful character full of wisdom and insightful lessons.  Everyone should know an Uncle Willie.  Miss Ophelia was a sad, sweet and funny read filled with humor, subtlety and sensitivity.  I enjoyed this book immensely and especially liked that it was told in the voice of eleven year old Belly. It's a wonderful story that provides great insight into small town living and family secrets....as seen through the eyes of a child.	2001-11-10

Ottey which intertwines the lives of three women into an engrossing tale of friendship, relationships, lies, deceit, secrets, domestic violence, infidelity and suspense.<br />While Ottey writes about three women and their relationships with each other as well as their male significant others, the story is really Rose's.  It's Rose's story that compels the reader to continue reading this almost 400 page book into the wee hours of the morning.  It is Rose and Donovan's relationship that will have you screaming and wanting to jump into the pages to shake some sense into Rose and to give Donovan the beatdown of his life for being so insensitive and abusive.  Donovan preys on young girls and he elevated his manhood and self-esteem by marrying Rose when she was only 16, pregnant with his child and a high school dropout.  Rose's idyllic marriage quickly turned into a living hell as she witnessed her husband have one two many affairs and one two many  kids to go along with the multiple affairs.  Rose desperately wants to get away from Donovan but nothing is beneath Donovan when it comes to keeping Rose dependent, barefoot and pregnant if necessary.  The horrific acts that Donovan commits against Rose are at times so inhuman that one has to set the book aside for a moment and take a breather before moving forward with the story.<br />Sandra Ottey has written a heart-wrenching yet moving and riveting debut novel.  One of her greatest strengths and weaknesses is the character development of Rose and Donovan, however, Laverne and Wendy's stories really paled in comparison...they were more secondary characters vs. characters on equal footing with Rose.  In fact, if their characters weren't included the story still would have been a compelling one.  Although, I didn't like the ending for Rose's character.  I almost felt like she was proclaiming independence but she was still depending on a man to help her make it through the rough spots.  I would have preferred if Rose moved on and became an independent woman who could stand on her own two feet without necessarily having the opposite sex around if she stumbled.  Additionally, I felt the ending was a little rushed and had a few loose ends...but then maybe Ottey is going to grace us with a sequel.  Overall, I really enjoyed the author's writing style.  I liked the vivid imagery and descriptors as well as how she blended life on the islands with life stateside.  I look forward to future books from this author.rough the rough spots.

Originally  when I picked up Gal, I thought it was going to take me back to the `30s or `40s.  Gosh was I surprised to find out that the author was born in 1961...she's around my age!  As I read her story I was appalled and thought the atrocity of her situation shouldn't have ever happened.  Where was the extended family?  Why didn't someone...anyone intervene?<br />Ruthie Bolton, aka Gal, was born in the impoverished Hungry Neck section of Charleston.  Ruthie's mom was a 13-year old teenager  and  she never knew her father.  Tired of her step-father abusing her, Ruthie's mother left home and Ruthie, and never returned to claim her.  Ruthie's step-grandfather, Clovis Fleetwood, while an honorable enlisted Navy man was a mean, vicious, brutal, selfish, jealous and unloving family man.  Because Fleetwood  though Ruthie's grandmother was cheating on him he brutally attacked her and left her for dead while her granddaughter and children  watched.  Ruthie's life would be pure hell after her grandmother's death and would quickly spiral into one of poverty, abuse, neglect, humiliation, and later in her teen years include stealing, drugs, alcohol, pregnancy, and an early marriage which ended in divorce.  Only after Ruthie meets her second husband, Ray Bolton,  and his family will she be shown love, support, understanding and compassion.  And it is then as an adult that she realized that her family and childhood were not normal.<br />Gal is a heartwrenching but touching and poignant story. It's a story of overcoming obstacles and excelling in spite of adversity.  It's a story of what one is able to accomplish when one has the love of a family.  It's a story that I recommend to everyone but especially those who need the motivation to move beyond a horrible past.  Ruthie's story is one of pain, humiliation, courage and ultimately love.  Ruthie's life is a miracle and a triumph.  Thank you Ruthie Bolton for sharing your story.	2001-11-10

A Life for a Life by Ernest Hill is a poignant and touching fictional novel which reads like a true story.  The storyline evolves around an unlikely bond between an African American father and the young African American teenager who killed his son.<br />Henry Earl is a very special and unusual man.  After his son and only child is murdered while working at a convenience store by D'Ray Reid, Earl decides to befriend the young D'Ray and become his mentor.  While D'Ray is imprisoned it is Henry Earl who becomes his only visitor and his biggest champion.  When young man D'Ray is released from prison it is Earl who gives him a place to stay and Somethings that D'Ray needs...a home, forgiveness, understanding and love.  As another reviewer stated, the relationship that developed between D'Ray Reid and Henry Earl was nothing short of miraculous.<br />A Life for a Life by Ernest Hill is a well-written book but one that's hard to fathom.  As a parent, who loves her children dearly, I find it hard to believe that anyone would be able to form a bond, a friendship, a kinship with someone who killed their child especially their only child.  Therefore, the more I read this story the more implausible it became for me.  Unfortunately, in real life, I wouldn't have as much empathy, love or forgiveness.  Maybe that's the lesson that Hill was trying to teach us.  This aside, A Life For a Life is a universal read with a social message.  I recommend this book to parents and children, students and teachers as well as anyone who likes a provocative and controversial storyline.	2001-11-10

California Cooper is an excellent writer my only disappointment is that I didn't discover her books until this year.  Cooper is known primarily for short stories but the Wake of the Wind is a novel and although she's writing out of her element/norm, the Wake of the Wind is still a well-written and compelling read.<br />The novel takes place in the period just after the Civil War.  Lifee and her husband Mor search for land they can own and on which they can raise a family.  As with any story dealing with slavery, racism, prejudice and events at the end of the 1800s that impacted African Americans, the Wake of the Wind can be a riveting and heartwrenching read.  However, the reader is compelled to finish the story because of the life lessons that Lifee and Mor teach us.  We learn that education is the key to survival/success, that with love and support we can survive enormous obstacles, that Black family unity and Black love do exist and that its important to pass on these values to our kids.  The Wake of the Wind was a heartwarming, hard to put down, passionate story about love for spouse, children and community.  As always, Cooper manages to enlighten, educate and entertain with her writing style.	2001-11-08

Stigmata weaves the stories of three women blessed with a powerful vision but cursed by a shared legacy of slavery, pain and struggle. Lizzie inherits a trunk and a quilt from grandmother.  She believes she can feel the history of her family in them.  Lizzie becomes determined to learn the truth of her past in order to clear the path for her future.  She becomes so engrossed in her quest that she begins to physically experience the painful past through episodes, dreams, memories, visions and reincarnations.  All of this is distressing to her parents so they commit her to a mental hospital. However, as the novel progresses there's also a sub-story about Lizzie and her mom; by the end of the novel what Lizzie had learned about the lives of her ancestors puts her in a position to help bring healing to her mother.<br />Told through a series of flashbacks to various time periods and interspersed with scenes from Lizzie's present and past, this book is complex and at times confusing and hard to follow.  In spite of this flaw, Perry manages to pull off a powerful and imaginative debut novel which is refreshing and creatively crafted. Stigmata is an engrossing tale that will stay with you long after you've read the book.	2001-11-08

Naylor does a stellar job of giving us a &quot;classical novel&quot; with a complex plot which includes doublings and foreshadowings and the folk tale combination. It's a contemporary love story, a timeless generational saga and tale of the supernatural.  The storyline spans two worlds.  One is the southern island Willow Springs, inhabited solely by the descendants of slaves a place with its own rules and exempt from many of the racist laws of the mainland.  The other world is New York City with its millions of people and what seems like madness everywhere.  The two worlds meet when  Ophelia aka Cocoa(Willow Springs) and George(New York City) meet and eventually fall in love and get married.  Of course, it was the intervention of Mama Day who brought them together.  I loved Mama Day the nearly 100 year old great-aunt who helped to raise Cocoa. Mama Day  was said to know  the working of roots, herbal cures and could summon lightning with her walking stick...uum  some thought she could even make lighting strike in the same place twice. Mama Day was wise beyond her days and was said to know the true story of &quot;the great, grand Mother&quot; Sapphira Wade, who in 1823 persuaded her master to deed the island to his slaves and supposedly bore him seven sons in just a thousand days...yeah right she had 7 sons in 2.7 years...hmm...that's definitely supernatural. Anywho then Sapphira Wade went onto to kill her master before she vanished in a burst of flame.  And since that event there's been a lot of 18 &amp; 23 going on an enigma of an island called Willow Spring.  But while Mama's Day world is steeped in superstition and the supernatural, George's world is one of logic, the present and city life. And unfortunately because George cannot believe what he can't understand the two worlds will clash for him.<br />Naylor's writing is ambitious and complex yet smooth, fluid and compelling in Mama Day.  Naylor expertly explores and effects several kinds of reconciliation:  the rural past and the urban present; myth and history; individuals and communities; faith and logic; the living and the dead.  Naylor provides much insight and wit regarding how we should live but most importantly we take away &quot;everybody wants to be right in a world where there ain't no right or wrong to be found.&quot;  The characters are colorful and sometimes reminiscent of folks we know. I loved rereading this book because there was so much more I discovered the second time around. Gloria Naylor takes a romance and infuses it with the magic,mystery and tragedy that accompanies true love. MAMA DAY has strong political tones, lively social commentary, and yet still manages to warm the heart. I will probably read this book again and again as it's quite simply a great book!effects several kinds of reconciliation:  the rural past and the urban present; myth and history; individuals and communities; faith and logic; the living and the dead.

Lena McPherson, the protagonist of the story, is the hand that everyone in Mulberry, GA depends on physically, financially, emotionally and socially.  Lena seems to have it all-the latest car, a thriving business, beautiful clothes, a fancy home, community status and so many people who depend on her call her &quot;the hand I fan with&quot;.  But Lena's life is strangely empty.  Lena lacks the love, comfort, support and companionship of a man, and so Lena and a friend perform a magic ritual designed to &quot;call her up a man&quot;.  And a man Lena receives in the form of Herman(ie Her-Man) a ghost over 100 years old.  Herman is the perfect man and helps Lena to understand/learn that she can give all she has to give and still have love left over for others.  But do the townsfolk appreciate the new Lena or are they put off by the makeover and to what extent will they go to show Lena how they feel about the changes that she has made.<br />Due to mixed reviews, this book sat on my bookshelf for two years before I finally decided to read it. Aside from  some parts of the story which were overwritten/too overly descriptive(i.e. Lena's house, Lena's clothes, Lena's shoes..et al) I really enjoyed this story.  While Lena was the subject of the story, Ansa was really speaking to all women.  In The Hand I Fan With, Ansa teaches us that as women it is important to explore the issue of how one lives as well as how one loves. She wants the reader to see beyond the clothes Lena wears or the car Lena drives, and see  how  women, can live a full life on this planet. How we live a spiritual life in the midst of plenty or in the midst of deprivation. How we reach the balance of duty to others and self-fulfillment. How attachment to things and fixing and doing saps us of the joy of living. How it is possible to be a mother without giving birth or without formal adoption. For this is a woman's story of giving too much to others without thought for self. It is the story of how many women live our lives in a rush of accumulating and sacrificing. It's a story of self-realization and the journey to change.<br /> I must admit I'm sorry I listened to others as I missed out too long on an intriguing and delightful read.  Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  It was a story that I wanted to read in one sitting, but the story was so erotic and delectable that I decided to read it slowly and savor it for as long as I could because this was one story I really didn't want to end.  Sometimes you can't believe what you hear or read you just have to pick up a book for yourself and see if you like it.  The Hand I Fan With was that book for me.

Rhythms'  is a wonderful read told in an engrossing and compelling manner while crossing racial, social, gender and class lines.  Hill brings the character to life and the imagery is so vivid and graphic that the reader feels like she is right there in the midst of the storyline.  These characters were so believable and you felt them whether you liked them or loved to hate them.  Your emotions run the gamut with Rhythms...I felt  sadness, anger, frustration, fear, sorrow and was happy that in the end I felt joy and happiness and even cried tears of joy .<br /> Rhythms is a story which reinforces the power of love and forgiveness among mother and daughters.  It's a story which  is an intriguing and spellbinding saga spanning three generations.  It's Hill's most ambitious storyline to date and her writing just keeps getting better and better.

Its a story that should be read by everyone as it shows that this is still America and with a little faith and  belief in self we can all rise above our circumstances if we look ahead rather than looking behind us.  Antwone Quenton Fisher was a statistic waiting to explode!  As he said, &quot;Statistically, given the sum of my circumstances, I was probably the most likely candidate to have ended up behind bars.

All of this coming from a child who was never invited to be a part of anyone's family/world when he was growing up.

The Family Curse is a drama-filled and wickedly entertaining debut novel from Magdalene Breaux. Imagine the year is 1919, your name is Margaret, you're going to be 22 in a few months and you're still unmarried. Oh and did I mention that you live in New Orleans, LA where the lighter you are the better your chances of finding a mate...because after all folks were still quite ignorant and color-struck during those days and they hadn't heard of the saying &quot; Black is Beautiful. I'm Black and I'm Proud.&quot; Anyway, I'm getting a little ahead of myself...back to the story. Along comes a man, by the name of Raymond Marshall , who's expressed more interest than previous beaus so with the help of your mother, Pearl, and sister, Martha, you decide to prepare a feast fit for a king...after all you heard that the quickest way to a man's heart was through his stomach. And since time is running out winning over Raymond Marshall requires drastic steps! In fact, you want this man so badly that any food your family couldn't buy your sister sneaked from the home of the white folks that she worked for.<br />The long awaited day comes...your youngest sister Freda, the baby of the family and the favorite because of her fair-skinned, long, light brown hair and blue eyes...is nowhere to be found...until dinner time. Right before your eyes...you can't believe it...Freda is flirting with your man and he ain't even stuttin'' you! In fact, he's too busy flirting right back with your sister. What you didn't realize is that your baby sister, Freda had used voodoo to reel ole Raymond into her net. Freda put a powerful spell on Raymond and shortly after they're married. However, no one wished them blessings and sensing the animosity of the town, Freda and Raymond, decided to move and start anew in another town.<br />Unfortunately, Freda doesn't realize that drama would follow her even in a new setting. She failed to realize that just as she had used witchcraft to seduce Raymond she would have to continue to exercise it in order to keep him. But while she's busy trying to keep Raymond and her family intact someone is busy trying to destroy them. Due to the sins of the mother that Sunday in 1919, Freda and Raymond's offspring would be cursed for the next three generations.<br />The Family Curse is a spellbinding and suspenseful read. The first couple of chapters were a little confusing and choppy but once you got past them the story quickly took off and kept you engrossed as you tried to figure out who was out to get the Marshall clan. Just when you think you know who and what is causing the tragedies that impact this family the plot suddenly twists in an unexpected direction...and that's when I threw the book against the wall!

God Don't Like Ugly is a compelling and engrossing novel from first-time novelist Mary Monroe.  Monroe takes us into the world of an overweight, shy, fatherless, insecure and lonely girl by the name of Annette Goode who's being sexually abused by the elderly boarder(Mr. Boatwright aka Buttwright) who lives with Annette and her single mom.  Sexual abuse is a harsh subject to read about and an even harder pill to swallow.  When it goes on for years and years one starts to question why and where was the mother when all of this was going on. Maybe the mother assumed that because Mr. Boatwright was an elderly man, with a peg leg and a church-going man that Annette would be safe in his care.  Afterall he did have some good qualities...uum they were too insignificant to mention and didn't make up for the fact that he was a perp.  Fortunately, Annette found a friend, Rhoda who she could share her secrets and dreams with.  Rhoda was everything that Annette wasn't.  She was attractive, slim, outgoing, daring and came from a middle-class family.  There was no Buttwright around to secretly molest her. Rhoda was also revengeful and very overprotective of Annette. Rhoda had the courage to stand up to Buttwright and do the things that Annette was afraid to do.<br />This book is not only about surviving molestation, but it is about life and growing up in the 1960's and 1970's.  Thank goodness there were some laugh out loud moments which made up for the sadness of the sexual abuse which went on for over a decade.  One of Monroe's greatest strengths is her character development.  The characters were so well developed they practically jumped off the pages!  The cast of colorful characters included folks with names such as Scary Mary, Pee Wee, Flo, and Viola just to name a few.  Additionally, GDLU was so vivid and graphic that the imagery appeared lifelike.  Along the way Monroe gives us surprising and shocking plot twist and turns to keep us rapidly turning the pages.  If I could change anything about the book it would probably be the ending...the story seemed to drag with the last 50 pages;  I'm not sure they were necessary.  That aside, Mary Monroe's writing style is fresh and captivating and I look forward to future reads from this talented author.ange anything about the book it would probably be the ending...the story seemed to drag with the last 50 pages;  I'm not sure they were necessary.

Too Beautiful For Words is a well-written, riveting and poignant debut novel from Monique W. Morris.<br />The storyline opens in  the late 60s/early 70s; Morris introduces us to the streets of  Oakland where prostitutes, pimps and drug dealers roam from sunrise to sunrise.  On a bright, sunny day, Peaches, a young impressionable teenager meets up with the likes of Jesus, a well known pimp.  Longing for attention, Peaches, mistakenly believes that Jesus loves her but in reality he turns her out sexually and then puts her on the streets as his #1 prostitute.  When Peaches becomes pregnant with Jesus' child she seeks a better life for herself and her young son, Jason.  Unfortunately, trying to get away from Jesus would cause her more than she ever suspected.  Young Jason watches what happens to his mom  and subconsciously he stores it in his memory bank until a later date when Jesus will have to pay up for the havoc he invoked years before.<br />Too Beautiful For Words is a sad, devastating and heart-wrenching story about what happens when you're in the fast lane, running with the big dogs, in the mean inner-city streets.  A common theme running throughout the story is &quot;Love Don't Love Nobody&quot; not even blood relatives.  Morris presents  a raw and realistic look at  what happens in the underground world of  pimps, prostitutes, lascivious sexual escapades and drugs.  Morris' character development is excellent as she gives us characters that make us cry, others that fill us with hate and yet others who make us think.  One of those characters who made us think was Chinaka, a former Black Panther who had befriended Peaches.  Just as Chinaka tried to rescue Peaches, 20 years later she sets her sights on Jason, who is looking to get into the family business. Will Chinaka have too little to offer too late or will she be successful in breaking the vicious cycle that threatens to take Jason to an early grave?<br />It's been a few weeks since I read this book...but it seems like only yesterday.

Have you ever read a book where the entire time your emotions were on overdrive and you just wanted to jump into the story and beat some sense into the characters?  Well, if you enjoy fast-paced, drama-filled, highly charged reads then look no further than The  Ties That Bind by Electa Rome Parks.  This is a book where you definitely want to slap the heck out of the  Husband &amp; Wife Team.  After only one month of knowing each other, Brice and Mia decide to marry each other.  Mia, 22 years old, is a hopeless romantic at heart, who's seeking her Black Knight in shining armor.  Brice is anything but...physically he's 8 years older than Mia...but emotionally he's too possessive, controlling, jealous and abusive.  Nothing will stop him from &quot;tapping that behind&quot; when he feels like it.  Christian, Brice's friend, is on the outside looking in and he doesn't like what he sees.  Will his love for Mia help her to get out of a bad situation or will Christian's life be threatened because of Brice's insecurities?<br />The Ties that Bind is a compelling read about love, abuse, deceit and betrayal.  As I read the story I felt a lot of anger, rage, pain, frustration and outrage...all while hoping only for the best where Mia was concerned.  I wanted Mia to wake up and I wanted to Brice to get what was due to him...yes I wanted revenge in a big way!  Electa Rome Parks has written an engrossing...albeit disturbing story...which sometimes read more like real life rather than fiction.  My only disappointment with the story was that my emotions weren't 3-dimensional; I wish I would have experienced more joy, happiness and smiles and laughs as I read The Ties That Bind.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the author's writing style and I look forward to future novels...hopefully tho' the next one will be a little more upbeat than this one.

One day, while visiting a girlfriend's website(book-remarks.com), I happened upon this little book.  The description whet my appetite and made it sound like a story I would enjoy.  I quickly ordered Cameo Appearances  and as soon as I received it in the mail I crawled into a comfy chair to begin  this intriguing and suspenseful read.  I'm happy I discovered this book and the author as this read definitely met my expectations.<br />The story opens in 1978 and we're introduced to the Belmont family. It was the year of  Lomita Belmont's 30th birthday and in honor of that milestone event her young sons, Sylas and Ian along with the assistance of their father had prepared a modest dinner, baked a cake and cleaned the house, in preparation of the surprise celebration for Lomita.  This was the first time that Lomita's birthday had ever been acknowledged by her family.  Her husband, Lendon always forgot and the boys were too young to remember.  For Lomita-- a gentle, loving, nurturing and kindhearted soul-- who sacrificed much so that her family could have more, never really expected anything in return. So she treated her birthday as tho' it was just another day.  Unfortunately, the morning of that day in 1978 would be the last time that the Belmont men would ever have Lomita return home.<br />For years, Lendon wondered what happened to his wife on that night in early October.  The police never found a body, nor did they find any evidence of foul play .  Rumors circulated that Lomita could no longer tolerate her abusive husband and took on a new life in another state.  Some believed she was abducted, possibly raped and murdered, because all who knew her knew that she would never abandon her boys.<br />After Lomita's disappearance, Sylas was  forced to literally raise his brother and himself, while  maintaining a high GPA and picking up the pieces for his abusive, gambling father.  Fortunately, the Belmont boys would be befriended by the LaRues family.  The LaRues' were a wealthy family who sponsored three underprivileged boys, who had excelled academically during the school year, but couldn't afford the tuition for summer camp.  Sylas, Ian and the LaRue's son, Trenton would hit it off and establish a friendship that would span their childhood and into adulthood.  But adulthood would bring different challenges and drama.  And as the men united on one Thanksgiving Day  they would bring their excess personal baggage, along with their respective families as well as a few &quot;guess who's coming to dinner&quot; characters...to make for an event never to be forgotten.<br />Cameo Appearances is a fast-paced read that was creatively crafted with just enough plot twists and turns to keep the pace moving.  It was an entertaining and exciting read that I finished in one sitting.  I'm glad I discovered this author and I hope to see more books from this talented writer.ealthy family who sponsored three underprivileged boys, who had excelled academically during the school year, but couldn't afford the tuition for summer camp.

If 6 Were is an intriguing and suspenseful mystery read from Jake Lamar that I stumbled upon one cold, winter day.  With a cup of hot chocolate, mild incense and soft music playing in the background, I cuddled up with this book and allowed  Lamar  to take me  into the world of para-militancy, college politics, the  world of the CIA/FBI and taboo issues such as incest, S&amp;M and interracial dating.  As I read and consumed this book, I quickly realized that If 6 Were 9 was not an ordinary read.  The more involved I became with the read the more I felt that the mystery was just the backdrop for Lamar's cultural and political views. The storyline had so much going on that,at times, I wondered what was the focal point. It seemed as tho' every time I was on track regarding the mystery, Lamar would throw in some quirky, satirical element that unfortunately made me skip a beat.  While the basic premise of the storyline was &quot;Who Killed the White Girl&quot;...the story so often veered often the beaten path that I was left wondering exactly what was the point .  All-in-All, the story was suspenseful, the characters were colorful, and the plot twists and turns were surprising; however, I just wished it was a little more focused.  Lamar appears to be a skilled and creative writer so I will check out other books so that I can hopefully gain a better assessment of this writer's style.	2001-10-19

Promises Beyond Jordan is an intriguing and suspenseful sophomore Christian Fiction novel from Vanessa Davis Griggs.  The prologue quickly captured my attention as I  tried to figure out what mystery character--Lena Patterson had to do with the characters of Theresa Jordan, Theresa's parents, George Landris and Johnny Mae Taylor.  By Chapter One I was already hooked just from the opening line of &quot;Have you ever loved someone that you never had?&quot;  I questioned why, with only nine days before his impending nuptials to Theresa Jordan, did the Reverend George Landris leave his fiancee with that statement as he rushed off to a hospital in another state to be with another woman by the name of Johnny Mae Taylor who the dear Rev. claimed was only a friend.<br />As Theresa waited for Reverend Landris to return she had the opportunity to ponder and stew whether or not  he really loved her, but her quest for answers would have to wait as she was rudely interrupted by the arrival of the family's long-time friend Lena Patterson...a woman who Theresa despised but who knew Theresa better than Theresa knew herself. And while Theresa was questioning George's motives and desires within the week Theresa would experience some escapades that would leave her hair as well as everyone else's standing on edge...and this is only the beginning of what will happen as we travel into the new year with these characters.<br />Promises Beyond Jordan was a wonderfully written book.  I was a little hesitant about reading this book because I had heard mixed reviews about the author's first book which initially I chose not to read.  Well, let's just say that word of mouth and reviews are just opinions and sometimes we have to pick up a book for ourselves to see whether or not it suits our fancy.  I'm glad the author contacted me and asked me to read this wonderful book...it was a page-turner, engrossing, compelling with well-developed characters and a fluid, smooth storyline.  I liked how the author interwove the lives of the primary characters and placed them in real and believable situations. I especially liked the angle that Davis Griggs used to portray the minister; it was refreshing to read about a pastor who led by example and was a man of strength and integrity.  I liked that Promises Beyond Jordan was a wholesome read without much profanity or lewd sexual scenes yet the author still managed to pen a story that kept me on the edge of my seat as I uncovered shocking plot twists and turns that made me LOL, wanna slap someone and then in the next second want to hug someone.  Vanessa Davis Griggs gives us a spirited and drama-filled read with Promises Beyond Jordan.  I really enjoyed the author's writing style and plan to go back and read her debut novel The Rose of Jericho so that I can determine for myself whether or not I like it.thor interwove the lives of the primary characters and placed them in real and believable situations.

The Haunting of Hip Hop is a small but powerful little fictional book that reads like non-fiction.<br />Harry &quot;Freedom&quot; Hudson has the Midas touch and creates hip-hop success with every collaboration and production.  One day he decides that he must have a certain house in an old Harlem neighborhood...although the house is old and run-down it seems to be calling his name. There are rumors that the house is haunted, however, Freedom isn't fazed and he requests that his lawyer, Ava Vercher, do research to purchase the house.  Ava has heard about the house being haunted as well, so she decides to enlist the help of her childhood friend, Charles to go and check out the house.  When Ava and Charles enter the house, they are unprepared for the group that meets them.  Lo and behold, the house is truly haunted and ...these &quot;spirit memories&quot; include Ngozi, an African drummer whose life was brutally interrupted by slavery; Bella, a singer murdered by her white gangster lover; and Johnny, a boy who was killed by his father. Ngozi wants to pass down his beat--which contains the love that has gone out of rap music--to Freedom, while Bella just wants revenge. However, all of the spirits are waiting for Freedom to arrive so that they can take him under their wings.<br />The Haunting of Hip Hop was a fascinated and intriguing read.  I sat down with this book on a rainy afternoon and became so engrossed by it that I was finished in a few hours.  I enjoyed the symbolism of the drum and the tie to rap music. I liked how there was an ancestral tie to the present, and how the materialism and exploitive spirit of Rap was being haunted by the past. However, I was a little disappointed that after Freedom entered the house the pace of the story slowed down and sort of fizzled out.  Additionally, I didn't like how Freedom's character transpired.<br />Overall,  Haunting of Hip Hop is a fascinating and powerful little book from Bertice Berry.  I recommend this book as well as Redemption Song for your reading pleasure.s Redemption Song for your reading pleasure.	2001-10-19

Some Sunday continues the story of Sandy Hutchinson, as Johnson-Hodge revisits the lives of Sandy and her three best friends, Martha, Britney and Janice.<br />As the story opens, Sandy is still battling life without Adrian and while she's wary of love she realizes that she's still alive and that life must go on.  But will she succumb to Adrian's brother, Winston or will she give handyman, Randall a chance? In the meantime, Sandy's friends are experiencing their share of ups and downs in the game of life as they dare to follow their hearts but maintain their wit.  Brittany is dealing with being a stay at-home mom and wife, and while she has everything she's ever wanted, financial woes have her second guessing whether or not it's the right time to be thinking about increasing her  household.  Janice is dating the man of her dreams, Cliff(Sandy's brother), but  her insecurities are quickly becoming demons and might overtake what's left of her relationship.  And Martha is still the ultimate career woman but  as the biological clock ticks, she realizes that she wants more and wonders if her current beau, Miles, is the ONE.<br />Once again,  Johnson-Hodge does a wonderful job of inviting us into the lives of  her characters and having the reader witness up, close and personal the conflict, challenges and decisions that  each character will experience as they determine their futures and as they face new challenges, new lessons and new loves on the never-ending journey called life. However, I must admit that  I  had mixed feelings about Some Sunday. I so thoroughly enjoyed Butterscotch Blues that I really didn't want a sequel...I wanted well enough left alone.  On the positive, I liked that Some Sunday seemed to provide more balance and attention to the four characters and that it was everyone's story rather than just Sandy's.  However, I didn't get the same warm, engaging, riveting, poignant feel that I experienced with Butterscotch Blues.  While each character had grown,  they were also more gritty, edgy, sarcastic and sometimes the friendships weren't even warm or inviting. But then I guess the hard knocks of life sometimes has a funny way of creeping up on you and knocking off the rose-colored glasses.  As a reader, I'm glad to have had the privilege to read both Butterscotch Blues and Some Sunday...but...now I'm ready for something different from this talented and creative writer.  I believe that Some Sunday has finally brought closure to Sandy and the girls and, as such, I anxiously await and look forward to new characters and storylines from Ms. Johnson-Hodge.nant feel that I experienced with Butterscotch Blues.

Maxine Claire's debut novel is a beautifully written coming-of-age story about a young woman who struggles to overcome her past  while enduring the decisions that she must live with  in the present and moving forward to shape a better future.<br />October Suite is primarily the tale of  October Brown and her relationship with her sister, Vergie and the two elderly aunts who raised the girls after their father murdered their mother.  October has always been independent, smart and strong-willed, in fact she renamed herself October simply because she liked the name. The story begins in 1950  where we meet October Brown as  a twenty-three-year old who's living away from home for the first time.  She's a Negro(we were Negroes then) living as a single, first-year teacher, in Kansas.  Times were different then.  Negro Female Teachers couldn't marry and they definitely couldn't have children out-of-wedlock.  So when October is abandoned by her married lover after he discovers that she's pregnant, in order to get her life back on track,  she has no choice but to move back home to Ohio with her aunts and her older sister.  After the birth of her son, she's numb and suffering post-partum depression. Believing that she wouldn't be a good mother and knowing that her sister has always wanted a child, October decides to give her son to her sister Vergie and her husband.  October moves back to Kansas for breathing room and to start over;  eventually  her broken heart mends and she moves on and starts dating again.  But as the years move along she realizes that something is missing and decides that she wants her son back.  The resulting conflict that arises threatens to tear apart the two sisters as they both search for what is right for October's son, David.<br />As October struggles with her sister, her life is further complicated as a sub-plot is brewing which involves a confrontation with her parent's violent past.  Set against the backdrop of life in the 50s, segregation and  midwestern values, October Suite is a complex-yet easy to read and understandable storyline as well as a  lyrical and eloquently written story.  It's a timeless tale that has universal appeal that moves at a slow but powerful pace.  The beginning was a little slow and it took me awhile to adjust  to the author's writing style but once I did I was in for a wonderful read.  Interspersed with a spiritual, although not a preachy flair, October Suite is a story about family, love, sisters, forgiveness and redemption.  October Suite is a stellar debut novel from Maxine Clair; it's a timeless literary read that would make for a wonderful book group selection.idwestern values, October Suite is a complex-yet easy to read and understandable storyline as well as a  lyrical and eloquently written story.

Upon his arrival home, after a quite stressful day of law school finals, David  Jackson is puzzled to find an invitation to a family reunion in Suffolk, VA.

David decides to put the issue on-hold, but it keeps haunting him as to why .  After talking to his surrogate father/mentor, he decides to accept the invite and a clerkship with his father's friend, Judge John O'Brien, who coincidentally also resides in Suffolk, Va.<br />David and his wife are surprised at what they find in Suffolk, VA.  It seems that integration and the 21st century forgot about the AA in that area.  &quot;Colored&quot; Folks still live on the other side of the tracks in primitive shacks or trailer homes and the two races(blacks &amp; whites) don't mingle or fraternize with one another.  Of particular concern to Lisa, David's pregnant wife, is that the Jackson's in Virginia are all dark skin.  David's parents, as well as David, are fair-skinned.  Lisa wonders just what exactly will her child look like and why do  David and his folks look so different from their other relatives.  What David and Lisa found out will rock both of their worlds!<br />M. C. Beamon has penned a suspenseful and intriguing debut novel!  Dark Recesses is a compelling and riveting read which captures the reader from Chapter One. Beamon vividly and descriptively takes us through a past filled with secrets, lies, deceit, murder and cover-up.  If I could change anything about the book, I would request that the author investigate another cover.  I had Dark Recesses for more than six months but everytime I looked at the cover I kept putting the book back on the bookshelf.  Only after a girlfriend told me that she read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it did I decide to pick it and read it once and for all. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really enjoyed this book!  The storyline was excellent with shocking plot twists and turns, colorful characters, vivid imagery,  and good dialogue.

The story includes all the ingredients of a wonderful read: suspense, drama, memorable characters, vivid imagery, sharp and witty dialogue, and strong writing. The Justus Girls were four African American girls from blue-collar families who resided in inner city Philly during the `50s/'60s.  The Girls-Peaches, Jan, Sally and Rachel/Roach later known as Rasheda-- were so close and did everything together that they decided to form a drill team during their childhood and they made a vow that they would always be their for one another. Unfortunately, as they grew up they  would also drift apart.  As the story opens, three decades later, the remaining friends are gathered at the funeral of Peaches who has been murdered.  They're surprised at how time and distance caused them to loose contact with one another but they promise to rekindle their friendship and find out the truth about who killed Peaches.  But in the process they will also rediscover each other and learn that the bond they established years ago might have been slightly cracked but it was never really broken.<br />The Justus Girls was a poignant and heartwarming read.  I enjoyed how Lambright navigated us back into time and how we lived each girl's life via a series of flashbacks.  We witnessed  how their futures were shaped by alcohol, promiscuity, the husbands they choose, the dreams they pursued, and long-held secrets that each of them were afraid of being exposed. These characters truly jump off the pages and into your life. Lambright weaved a tale so revealing about friendship and supporting each other that for a moment I thought this was my life story she was talking about. The Justus Girls is probably one of the best written, best developed, best plot twists and turns storylines that I have had the pleasure to read by a new author in quite sometime.  This novel just touched me on so many levels...and I liked that it wasn't overwritten.  Lambright set up scenes and situations and gave you enough information to wet your taste and satisfy your need for details without going overboard. I think folks who remember growing up during the late 50s/60s will really enjoy this book cause it takes you back to when it was a different world from what you know today...when folks truly cared about one another and everyone in the community felt like your family.  I look forward to more novels from this writer as this book was da bomb and off the hook good! I can't say enough good things about this book so I will just close by saying...pick up a copy today and curl up with it.

I read an excerpt for the first few chapters which left me wanting more so I knew I had to read the rest of the novel to see how the story would end.  Johnson introduces us to brothers Marshall and Malik who were separated during childhood and would go on to become very different individuals.  E. D. Johnson has written an intriguing tale of national conspiracy and fraternal deception. As you  roam the pages with Marshall and Malik, Johnson will take you inside the scintillating environment of the entertainment industry and the Black paramilitary underground. Johnson will introduce us to divas, drama, drugs, death as well as music, madness, mayhem and murder.<br />Johnson will take us on one rollercoaster after another as we twist, dip and turn through this suspenseful read.  As I mentioned earlier it was the intrigue and suspense that enticed me and made me want more of this novelunfortunately the characterization left me hangingI felt like there were too many loose ends which didnt make any sense and which werent tied up.  Maybe a sequel is in the works but right now I feel like I was  just left hanging.  Additionally, I felt the book went overboard with the stereotypical portrayal of African AmericansI know there are some folks who think that all African Americans are lazy, slothful and unintelligent, however, I dont like being portrayed or leaving that impression with anyone.  On a positive note, Johnson does provide insight into the world of glitz, glamour and politics and his writing makes you want more.	2001-08-14

As Colleen is coming to terms regarding her lover, her mother contacts her and wants to be a part of her life...but will Colleen allow her mom to re-enter her life?<br />A Fool's Paradise by Nancy Flowers Wilson was a soothing and mesmerizing read.  The story starts off slow but quickly builds and readers want to know how the characters resolve the issues in their life.  It was a story that made me smile and cry; a story that spoke to my mind, spirit and soul;  a story that will stay with me long after I've finished the book.  I really liked Ms. Flowers vivid and descriptive writing; I felt like I was in Jamaica right there living with these memorable characters.  I liked the realism and tension of the various situations and didn't feel that she gave us drama just for the sake of it.  I liked that almost everyone learned something from their actions and behavior-both young and old alike.  Even though I didn't agree with Donovan's actions, I felt the love and fear that compounded his decision and I understood why he did what he did.  On the other hand, I wish the author would have delve a little more regarding Anne-Marie and her mother's relationship...what was the underlying reason as to why Anne-Marie's mother didn't like her?  I liked that their were positive male role models, fathers who were right there taking care of their families. The reoccurring themes in the book  were real...the search for parents love and acceptance, mother-daughter relationships, sibling rivalry, male/female relationships and father-son relationships.

That Faith, That Trust, That Love  by Jamellah Ellis is an excellent debut novel  and a wonderful addition to the Christian Fiction genre.<br />Marley Shepherd appears to have it all...good looks, a wonderful fiancee, and a great job as an attorney at a prestigious law firm.  So what's wrong with the scenario that follows?  As the story opens, An extravagant party  is being held to announce Marley's engagement to Gerrard Shore,  the son of one of Atlanta's prominent African-American families.  With more than 200 family and friends present to celebrate the occasion why does Marley feel unhappy?  And, why, only two weeks after the engagement party, is the &quot;happy&quot; couple meeting with a relationship counselor to determine what's wrong with this relationship?  (Hmm...sounds like disaster ready to happen.  Run quick.  Forget about marrying Gerrard Shore because he's not as perfect as he appears to be.)  Feeling disillusioned and downcast, Marley seeks advice and solace from her mom, Pam and her grandmother, Ma Grand.  Unfortunately when these two women aren't busy sparring with each other, they're embattled in their own bitter world of turmoil and are not the role models that one would seek when it comes to matters of the heart.<br />When Marley's family and friends suggest that Marley try attending church to strengthen her walk with God she initially shies away as she remembers the hypocrisy of the churches that she's attended in the past.  It seemed that all of the churches that she visited previously were so busy being about everything except God and as such it had caused her to lose faith in the institution as a whole.  So when Marley was invited by her secretary, Evelyn, to attend Gilead's Balm, a relatively small church,Marley was surprised when she found herself  being inspired by the message and longing for a personal relationship with God.<br />Ellis shows that Marley will still encounter trials and tribulations, however her faith, trust and love in God will help her to walk by faith and not by sight when the storms of life come her way.  As Marley begins and continues in a closer walk  with God, and her spiritually increases, others are able to see the positive changes in Marley's life.  Marley's faith and her trust in God will be tested immensely as she shares a life threatening situation with her mom and realizes that the only person she can truly rely on is God.<br />Jamellah Ellis has written an heart-warming and emotionally rich novel.

Initially, one might  be daunted by the thickness of the book...but make no mistake by delay reading this book...cause it is truly a page turner...in fact the writing was so compelling that I tried to read this book in one sitting and almost succeeded.  The story is well-crafted with a good storyline; realistic and dimensional characters; vivid imagery and shocking plot twists and turns.<br />In spite of better race relationships today,  it is still often surprising to hear of an African American and a Caucasian being good friends more or less business partners.  So, of course, this was even more surprising and suspicious when Hosanna Clark(an African-American woman) and Gilda Rosenstein(a Jewish woman) decided to embark on a friendship and business venture in the 1940s.  As many would predict, the business would take off and be successful, however, Gilda would disappear along with the assets.  Hosanna would be doubly betrayed:  financially ruined and emotionally bereft.  Although, Hosanna would make a go at it as a solo entrepreneur, she would never achieve the fame or status that she deserved and years later, when she passes away, her small cosmetic company dies with her.  But Hosanna leaves behind a daughter, Matriece,  who is determined to right the wrongs suffered by her mother by taking  on a mission to collect her mother's debt.<br />What You Owe Me is a story that spans 50 years and introduces one to the lives of Gilda and Hosanna as well as their offsprings.

Campbell exposes us to the themes of friendship, education, absentee parents, interracial relationships, parent/child relationships...but resounding throughout all of the themes and relationships is &quot;what you owe me&quot;.  In the end, Campbell shows that understanding, acceptance, forgiveness, and reconciliation  are necessary in order to come to terms regarding troubles of the past and to heal from the  wounds of yesterday.<br />Pick up What You Owe Me by Bebe Moore Campbell today!

Lolita Files is back with an edgy and daring new novel titled Child of Goda saga of a Southern family tormented by a legacy of shameful secrets.  Files latest heroine is Ophelia Boten, a young woman who must confront her familys past before she can extinguish the curse that threatens her future.<br />Set mostly against the backdrop of a small, country town named Downtown, TN, Child of God shows the sordid secrets binding one family over four decades.  The story opens with the death of Ophelias son, baby Hamlet, who is the lone casualty of a mysterious fire.  However, the reader quickly discovers that this is the first of many tragedies  throughout the book. Similar tragedies that keep repeating over and over throughout the generations.  As Files carefully weaves us forward and backward in time with this family, we discover a multitude of secrets and sinsincest, voodoo, rape, homosexuality, drug addiction, murder and suicides.  Before Ophelia can find true love and share it, she must unravel the intricate relationships, mystical ties and forbidden passions that have tormented her family over the years.<br />Child of God is a fast-paced and suspense-packed read and shows Files ability to tackle different storylines and tell a good story.  However, readers looking for more of the sistafriend relationship of Reesy and Misty will be disappointed with Child of God because this is truly a different read and probably more in line with Blind Ambitionalbeit a darker story than any of her stories to-date.  Child of God is a storyline filled with lots of violence, brutality, tragedy and anguish.  The storyline has a Jerry Springish feel and mentality with far-fetch and over-the-top situations that might make some folks want to throw the book against the wall and leave it there.  Those  who enjoy lots of drama with a soap-operaish type  style will love this book.  Aside from some of the loose ends such as Lays behavior and Lay and Sukies relationship which I never quite understood,  I enjoyed the colorful characters, vivid situations,  poignant dialogue and riveting storyline.  I look  forward to future books from  Ms. Files.ip which I never quite understood,  I enjoyed the colorful characters, vivid situations,  poignant dialogue and riveting storyline.

The Seasons of Beento Blackbird is a wonderfully written debut novel from Akusia Busia( aka Nettie from the Color Purple).  Ms. Busia transports us across continents and cultures as she provides us an emotionally charged and thought provoking read about a very sensitive and taboo subject. Polygamy, One Man, Two Wives--A Disaster Waiting to explode.<br />Seasons is the tale of a very ambitious man and the intriguing web he weaves when he allows himself to fall in love and marry two women on two different continents. Solomon Wilberforce is a smart businessman with admirable, altruistic traits as well as a successful author of children stories about African culture/ history who writes under the pen name Beento Blackbird.  Solomon lives his life compartmentalized into seasons.  During the winter months, he lives in the Caribbean with his first wife, Miriam, who is 9 years older than him and who has always loved him since the day she delivered him as a midwife.  During the spring, Solomon travels to Ghana and spends his time with young, second wife, Ashia.  Although Solomon is sharing himself, each wife is aware of the other, and endures the arrangement.  However, all partners will soon come to realize that the relationship of sharing will be more complex and emotional than either of them ever imagined.  The summer/fall periods are devoted to writing and he spends that time in NYC where his literary agent, Samantha(Sam) only has eyes for Solomon and she tries to convince Solomon that she can do for him what two wives can't.  Solomons life runs smoothly until he's forced to return to NYC to deal with the death of his father which immediately sends his world into a tailspin and forces him to make some hard decisions about his future and his wives.<br />Busia delivers a very complicated love story in a breathtaking and thought provoking manner.  Her writing is descriptive and vivid as she \\"takes you there\\" you can see the beautiful colors of the island, taste the rich ethnic foods, hear the ocean, smell the rain, and feel the anger, pain, tension, sadness, joy and love of the characters.  While Solomon has his faults, for the most part he's a decent man and you share his anguish as he comes to realize that some of the decisions he made were in poor judgment.  The two wives are compelling and realistic characters, although at times I wanted to shake some sense into both of them and tell them to forget about Solomon and move on with their lives.  In the end, I was happy to see that both ladies made decisions that they could live with.  Seasons is an enchanting and skillfully crafted book with thought provoking situations.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a refreshing read and a lively discussion.rich ethnic foods, hear the ocean, smell the rain, and feel the anger, pain, tension, sadness, joy and love of the characters.

Cane River is a fascinating and intriguing historical debut novel from Lalita Tademy.  As Tademy tells the story of her family history she transports the reader back to the early 1800s, to an isolated, close-knit rural community on Louisianas Cane River.  Tademy takes historical fact and mingles it with fiction to create a vivid and dramatic account of what life was like for the four remarkable women who came before her.  Beginning with her great-great-great-great grandmother Elisabeth, this is a family saga that spans from the early days of slavery through the Civil War/Reconstruction and into a pre-Civil Rights South.  Cane River is not just another novel about the injustice of slavery but is the saga of real, flesh and blood women making hard decisions and facing the consequences.  Tademy tells a moving story about the females on the maternal side of the family who came before herSuzette, Philomene and Emily. She writes about the intimate relationships that each of these women had with white men and how children were conceived from flat-out rape, to calculated financial arrangements, to real, if forbidden and dangerous liaisons. Each of the four women in the book approached life differently and handled relationships to the men and children in their lives very differently.  Cane Rivers major female characters were all born into slavery, but even so, each made distinct choices regarding how she was going to live her life.  Each women fought to keep their family intact and to gain a better life for their children.  Via Cane River, Tademy also dramatizes the roots of turmoil within the African American community regarding the  issues of skin color.  As I read the story of Emily who was very color struck and a strong believer of &quot;bleaching of the line&quot;I was often saddened and upset by her actions.  While I didnt condone Emilys actions, Tademy provided enough insight that I was able to understand why Emily held the beliefs that she did.  If there was anything I could change about Cane River it would be that the stories of the main female characters(Suzette, Philomene, Emily) were told from the first person rather than the third person perspective. By writing in the first person, the storyline could have had more dialogue and less narrative which sometimes was a little dry.<br />But that aside, Cane River is still a well-written story and a wonderful tribute to the authors ancestors.  Tademy provides the reader with a touching and poignant story about the lives of four strong women challenged by their lives as slaves, women, mothers and daughters.  The storyline  is an emotionally rich and heart wrenching story with real characters that will stay with you for years to come.  Im glad that this book was chosen as an Oprah Book of the Month choice as all folks need to read Cane River in order to understand that there is another perspective to slavery that needs to be told.  More importantly, I hope this book becomes one of the QBR 100 Essential Black Books and that it will be considered a must read for high school and college literature courses.there was anything I could change about Cane River it would be that the stories of the main female characters(Suzette, Philomene, Emily) were told from the first person rather than the third person perspective.

I Wish I Had A Red Dress is Pearl Cleage's sequel to her best-selling debut novel What Looks Like Crazy On An Ordinary Day.  Looks Like Crazy was Ava &amp; Eddie's story but in Red Dress, Cleage's focuses on Ava's widowed sister, Joyce Mitchell.  Cleage's takes readers back to Idlewild, Michigan which was once a popular resort community for affluent African Americans but is now decaying, however, the ordinary folks who live there are still working to overcome dysfunction and reclaim their lives.<br />Joyce, continues to work at the center she founded The Sewing Circus and Community Truth Center(which has been affectionately dubbed &quot;The Circus&quot;) as a social worker counseling young black women, many of whom are the product of single parent homes and many of whom are single mothers.  Although Joyce has her work, her family, her friends and her town...who does she have to take care of her intimately and passionately as only a lover can do?  Five years after Mitch's tragic accident, time is still standing still in the romance department for Joyce.  While she has her memories, daydreams and self-pleasures none of those can take the place of a muscular, hard, dark and handsome African American male.  Joyce knows that something is missing and that sometimes you really need the real thang...but sometimes Joyce is just afraid.  Afterall, her father passed when she was sixteen, her mother committed suicide on her wedding night a year later, her son got hit by a car walking home from school when he was six and her daughter didn't make it to her first birthday.  After all the other tragedies, Mitch was always the one constant in her life and now he was gone.  Opening her heart and chancing love was an endeavor that Joyce wasn't sure she was ready or willing to undertake at 40something.<br />As the story opens, Joyce has to put thoughts about relationships, love, desires and her personal needs on hold, because first, she must meet with state legislatures to secure their votes to fund the proposal she worked on the last three months regarding &quot;The Circus&quot; program.  While Joyce is busy focusing on the girls and funding, her friends, Bill and Sister are busy playing matchmaker.  Over dinner, Sister introduces Joyce to Nate Anderson who has just moved to the area to work at the local high school as a guidance counselor.  Nate is a sensitive, understanding and supportive gentlemen and he touches emotions in Joyce that have long been suppressed but as fate would have it... there's much drama with the babydaddy of one of Joyce's girls that keeps Joyce from focusing on self and backing away from Nate.  Will Nate be there to weather the emotional/mental storm with her and help her to realize that decent and loving African American males still exist and that if she lets her guards down and opens her heart she might just have a recent to purchase and wear that daring little red dress?<br />Pearl Cleage has once again created a storyline with remarkable and memorable characters, however, readers looking for Ava might feel a little slighted as I Wish I Had a Red Dress is truly Joyce's story.  In fact, I was a little disappointed that Ava wasn't given more presence in Red Dress and was only mentioned in passing.  I like Joyce...she's the responsible, stable, older sista who's on a mission to help the less fortunate...all good qualities...but I missed the feistiness and wit of Ava.  On an up note, as with &quot;Crazy&quot;, Cleage's writing once again inspires and enlightens as she shows us that life is about taking chances, taking risks, embracing the past but letting go, moving forward and embracing life.

JJ Murray gives us a delightful and entertaining debut novel about the interracial relationship of Renee and Jay.  When Renee is stranded in the blizzard of the century the last thang on her mind is falling in love.  She is more interested in eating and was happy that if it must happen at least her car slid and got stuck in front of Luchesi's restaurant.  Enter Jay Anthony Luchesi's to the rescue.  Jay has had a crush on the chocolate honey since high school and it's love at first sight when Renee is stranded in front of his restaurant.  For Renee &quot;what's love got to do with it&quot; all she wants is a nice meal, the last thang on her is mine is a man, especially a &quot;goofy white man&quot; who believes in love at first sight.

Murray weaves hilarious sub-plots and gives new meaning to &quot;colorful characters&quot; as we journey with Renee and Jay in an unlikely courtship.<br />Renee and Jay is a refreshing and witty look at interracial relationships that rings true to life.  I was hooked from Chapter One and I enjoyed how the writer developed the relationship of Renee and Jay.  Although, Murray sometimes falters by focusing too much on &quot;my people&quot;, constanting referencing body odors(Jay's...what was up with that), and sometimes the AA female characters appeared overly stereotypical.  For example, when Renee wasn't complaining about body odors or constantly saying &quot;my people&quot; she was coming across as too sharp-tongued, attitudinal and with a significant chip on her shoulder.  Sometimes I wondered how Jay even wanted to be around her more or less in a relationship with her.  Shirl-Renee's mom was sometimes so over the edge that I lost all credibility where she was concerned.  And then their was Renee's, loud mouthed friend, Collette who gave new meaning to the word &quot;sistagal&quot;.  These situations aside, I was pleasantly surprised that a white boy could tell a story from a sister's perspective and he didn't do too shabby a job.  With Renee and Jay, Murray gives us a romantic, sensitive, engaging and humorous look at relationships across black&amp;white color lines.  Renee and Jay is a page turner and will have you swiftly turning the pages as you anticipate the next twist and turn in the storyline.  The storyline was so engrossing that I finished the book in one sitting.  If you're looking for a refreshing, change of pace read then check out Renee and Jay by JJ Murray.  Oh but I must warn you this book is highly controversial and not meant for everyone...but for those with an open mind you will enjoy it for what it is...a fictional novel.r.

Kimberla Lawson Roby fan's will be happy to know that she's back with another drama filled saga that touches nerves and emotions and that rings true of real life situations. It's a Thin Line is dedicated to anyone who has ever taken care of an ill or elderly relative, any woman who has ever experienced domestic violence and to everyone who has ever concealed a deep, dark childhood secret.<br />Lawson-Roby introduces us to siblings Sydney, Gina, Rick and their mother, Delores.  When Delores suffers a debilitating stroke,  it requires the helping hands of her 3 adult kids to assist in her recovery.  As the wear and tear of taking care of a sick parent takes its toll the bond that once held the siblings together quickly disintegrates.  They might share the same bloodline, but the similarity ends there as we get to know these 3 very different siblings.  True to birth order, Sydney as the oldest is the most responsible sibling; Gina as the middle child has a hard time realizing that she can't please everyone and she can't make everyone happy; and Rick is portrayed as the weak-minded, indecisive younger brother.  As such, Sydney is left to shoulder most of the burden of taking care of her mom, since Gina is dealing with a physically abusive husband, and Rick is agonizing over what appeared to be a small/petty matter...whether or not he should marry his long-time girlfriend, live-in fianc&eacute;e.<br />It's a Thin Line is a book that makes you think about what you would do if you were in the same situation as the characters.  As always, Lawson-Roby continues to give us a compelling story with memorable characters and one that will stay with you long after you've read the book.  There were interesting sub-plots and the storyline could have ended up going in any number of directions, however, it appears that Lawson-Roby decided to focus on domestic violence.  What a roller coaster ride that was; I felt like I was suspended in mid-air on an emotional roller coaster as I read Gina's story.  In fact, Gina's story tended to overshadow the other characters and I was slightly surprised that it dominated the storyline until the very end. It would have been nice to have deeper relationships with the other characters, as well, especially since they each had equally interesting sub-plots.  All In All, I believe that true Lawson-Roby fans will feel that It's A Thin Line was definitely worth the way.a's story.

But what they didn't envision were the bumpy curves at every turn.  The wedding day is eventful with hitches galore and a clear indication of what is yet to come during the first year of marriage.  From the wedding day delay, the reader feels that Drew and Betty's marriage will be a rollercoaster ride filled with more mid-air suspension than dips. Drew and Betty quickly realize that staying together Forever is more than simply saying I Love You or I Do.  Situations, circumstances and people threaten to tear them apart as they try to hold on to a tumultuous relationship that they hurried into.<br />Betty's sidekick, best girlfriend, Jacqui continues to be a business savvy professional woman.  Her restaurant Jacquetta is a big hit.  However, Jacqui's personal life is crying out for love and commitment.  Always a bridesmaid and never a bride, as her biological clock begins to sound like a bomb ticking away and time running out, she wants more.  Unfortunately, her current beau, Stephan isn't sure that commitment is what he seeks.  In the process, Stephan experiences a tragedy that makes him rethink what's most important in his life and whether or not it should even include Jacqui.<br />Forever is a well-written and satisfying sequel.  I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it better than Until...and I really enjoyed that book!  McCann gives us mature characters that jump off the page and into our lives as we live vicariously through them for a moment.  The secondary characters were equally impressive and included Drew's mom-the woman any daughter-in-law could easily learn to hate and Blue...a man of much wisdom and knowledge.  Every man should know an elderly friend named Blue.<br />As the storylines intertwined, I quickly turned the pages to see what would happen next.  Although Forever is not a mystery...there was much suspense and intrigue as we witnessed events in the main characters' lives and wondered what effect those situations would have on their relationships.  All I can say is pick up this book and experience it for yourself.  I believe you will be pleasantly surprised as well.ledge.

Breathing Room,Patricia's Elam's debut novel delves into family &amp; secrets, friendship &amp; strife, redemption &amp; forgiveness, tragic &amp; hope.<br />Breathing Room is an emotionally rich and powerfully written story about two middle-age, middle income, professional women coming to terms with self and struggling with the consequences of their actions.  Norma &amp; Moxie have been friends since college and have always been there for one another no matter the circumstances. Although parenthood, marriage and professional careers might sometimes be more than they can bare, their love and respect for each other has always weathered the storm, until Norma decides to stray and embark on an illicit path. Moxie, full of self-pride and self-righteousness can't seem to control her judgement or impression of others when they dare to be different from her.  As a result, she finds herself at odds with best friend, Norma, as well as, her teenage daughter, Zadi.<br />Breathing Room is a story that grows on you quickly as you experience the sub-plots and twist and turns.  The beginning was a little slow until I reached a comfort zone with Ms. Elam's writing style; however, the more I read the more engrossed and caught up I became.  I liked that Breathing Room captured the essence of so many middle-aged, middle-income, professional women who're striving to do it all but sometimes fall short. One of Ms. Elam's greatest strength and sometimes weakness was the character development; at times I did not feel the main characters were created equally.  While Moxie often got on my nerves, as I thought she took everything to the extreme, I felt like I personally knew her and that she was a sista I could kick it with.  On the other hand, after I finished the book, I didn't quite feel that I really knew who Norma was.  I knew her professionally and I knew her as a wife...sort of...but I didn't understand her feelings as a mother. I didn't really know much about her earlier background or her emotional makeup.

Marcus Major is back with his hilarious and entertaining second novel titled Four Guys and Trouble.  Major's fresh and witty voice once again captivated me and held my attention 'til the very end.  This book was such a delight to read that I finished it in one sitting.<br />In Four Guys and Trouble, Major introduces us to four young and very successful AA men who have much drama going on in their lives.  Fraternity brothers (til the end) --Ibn, Colin, Dexter and Michael are bound by &quot;frat&quot; and by their love for &quot;little sister&quot; Erika aka Bunches.  When Erika's older brother died the fraternity brothers promised him that they would help Erika's grandmother raise her.  Erika is now grown, pursuing a promising career as a doctor and seeking her independence from the brothas...but they're not really trying to hear that.  The brothas are as different as night and day but when it comes to Erika they have a vested interest and share the same creed/modus operandi--no male is going to get close enough to Erika if any of them can help it.  Now mind you these brothas don't quite have their own personal houses in order...which is probably why they take such liberty in keeping the brothas who're interested in Erika in check and at bay.<br />Take Ibin, he's the eternal player; he's been living with his girlfriend, Tiffany for more years than some folks have been married but he has some extreme double standards.  He figures since he showers Tiffany with expensive things such as a big house, fine jewelry, designer clothing and a nice ride that he can come and go as he pleases (uum he doesn't have a clue when he strolls in at 3:00am and Tiffany asks him to drop his pants...you will have to read the book just to experience this hilarious scene).  Tiffany, of course, feels differently and she would give up all the material possessions if she could just be Ibn's one and only.<br />Colin is in love with Stacy but is she really in love with him?  Colin is a guy who appears to have come out of his mother's womb with &quot;dominate me/control me&quot; written over his forehead.  He's a good guy who it seems that everyone he's ever dealt with has stolen his heart and messed over him...uuummmm...including his mom.  When will he ever learn to stand up to Stacy?  Or will he find someone else who reciprocates his feelings?<br />Dexter appears to be a very religious brotha...at least a praying brotha.  But why?  Did I hear someone call &quot;Daddy Dexter?&quot;  But Dexter isn't married, I wonder if that prayer had anything to do with him becoming a father.  I wonder if he's really happy about becoming a father.<br />Michael is spending time with a former college friend who had quite a reputation when she was in school.  Seems she's changed; she appears to have gotten saved in the last few years.  And now rather than screaming &quot;oh god, oh god&quot; in the bedroom she's busy praising the Lord and trying to save her man.  But will she hold Michael's interest?<br />While the boys are busy figuring out their lives, Bunches is growing up and moving on.  She's falling in love and there's nothing they can do about it...or can they?<br />Four Guys and Trouble is a hilarious and entertaining look at friendship, loyalty, love and contemporary relationships.  The characters are colorful and the dialogue is sharp and witty.  Major paints a right-on observation about contemporary relationships.  There are situations that will make you laugh out loud (lol), say &quot;no they didn't go there&quot; and others that will have you actually feeling empathy with the boys as they face soulstirring events.  Major is back and his writing is strong (although at times the language might be a bit offensive/too candid for some).  If you're looking for an entertaining, fast paced, vivacious page turner then I recommend Four Guys and Trouble for your reading pleasure. Yasmin M.

Sandra Jackson-Opoku writes from a narrative perspective but with a lyrical and metaphoric voice. While the central focus of the storyline was Hot Johnny...to know the intricacies of Johnny was to know the women who loved him, shaped and molded him during his lifetime.<br />Women such as:  Destiny-the insecure wife who lacked confidence and self-esteem and as a result was filled with much insecurity, which would threaten to destroy her marriage.  Daughter -the daughter who didn't know exactly who her dad was until he showed up needing a priceless favor one day.  Grandmother - the wise ole grandmother who sees all and knows all while directing Johnny as he takes uneven and unassured steps.<br />Johnny's women were from all walks of life and came from all over the world. Interesting women that could be anyone of us. It was interesting reading Hot Johnny because although he had a multitude of women in his life I never thought that he was a dog...in fact his character was very likeable and the women helped me to explore and better understand him.<br />Hot Johnny was a well-written, poignant and impactful storyline. It was a refreshing storyline brimming with contemporary issues which are rarely explored in fictional writing such as female genital mutilation, sickle cell anemia, incest, lesbianism, older women/younger men, American gang violence/ African tribal warfare.<br />Sandra Jackson-Opoku's writing style is fresh, honest and lyrical. Her metaphors and heartwarming way of unveiling the characters, events and storyline attest to her talent and skills. If you seek a storyline with unexpected twists, much substance and depth then check out Hot Johnny and the Women who loved him by Sandra Jackson-Opoku.	2001-04-23

Sewell introduces us to characters, Nina Epps and Richard Vincent, who are at crosswalks in their lives and wondering if they should come up for air from the tumultuous relationships they've been submerged in for the greater part of their adult lives or linger in despair hoping that circumstances will change. In a surprising twist of events, Richard and Nina's paths cross and a friendship ensues that could lead to a brighter future for these two Taken For Granted souls.<br /> Sewell gives us a remarkable and complex novel that is entertaining and original. We're introduced to colorful/intriguing characters, scandalous and titillating subplots and a riveting story of betrayal, revenge and tragedy. Taken For Granted is a page-turner that captured my attention from page one and held me until the last page. Earl G. Sewell writes about events that shake our foundation and gives us characters that jump off the pages. While there were some typos/grammatical errors in Taken For Granted, none of these were major or significant enough to get in the way of the storyline. I can't wait to read other books from this talented and upcoming author.	2001-04-16

Reinventing The Woman (RTW) is Patty Rice's long awaited sophomore novel. The reader is introduced to Camille Foster, a young, intelligent, attractive, single woman who is in search of self. We journey with Camille as she seeks to find SELF in the form of -esteem, love, respect, worth, reliance, acceptance, awareness and discovery. Camille has spent the last 27 years of life trying to live up to everyone else's expectations especially those of her parents and her boyfriend of seven years, Evan. In journeying with Camille we discover a mother who hated her so much that she even managed to turn her father, Wade, against his own flesh and blood.  And then theirs Camille's boyfriend, Evan,  (yes boyfriend...not even a husband) who lacked self assurance so much so that he took out his frustrations on Camille by verbally and physically abusing her on a regular basis. One beatdown too many sends Camille running for security, shelter and solace to the only other place she's ever really known...home. Home seemed safe enough since the house she grew up in was now occupied by her sister Mel and her nephew Benjamin. But then mysteriously (or not) her mother Catherine--who has been living in the Carolinas since the death of Camille's father Wade--decides to show up and stay indefinitely with Mel, Camille and Benjamin. Why? And if that isn't enough her mother decides to help Camille get a job with her best friend, Nora, who ironically runs a self-help center. Why? Moving home actually brings Camille face-to-face with the unknown. Demons, lies, deceit, secrets and blackmail run amuck and everyone seems to be aware of what's going on except for Camille who slowly starts to unravel the puzzle and tries to find herself.<br />RTW is a story with a lot of promise and much potential. The premise is sound and interesting but somewhere along the way things become juxtaposed and somewhat unreal. Even though, I often wondered whether Camille would ever become a stronger woman, at least she stayed true to character and I felt I could identify with her; by the end of the story I understood her actions and motives. The secondary characters on the other hand to include Mel, Catherine, Nora, Dawn, Will, et al appeared so superficial that I often wondered &quot;who are these people and why are they acting so strange?&quot; I think if these characters had more depth and substance maybe I would have understood them and actually felt something for them. Instead all I had were questions of &quot;why?&quot; As I read, sometimes I felt the transition from character to character or scene to scene wasn't smooth; it's like I was just plopped down into another setting without much headway or reasoning. I oftentimes didn't feel that the course was smooth or fluid...it was as thought situations just happened...characters just appeared...the writing style just changed...and I was just there in the midst of confusion and lack of direction or focus.<br />Needless to say, I was slightly disappointed in Ms. Rice's sophomore novel. The subject matter was fine; however the way it written was another matter.  I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Rice's debut novel and I expected more of the same cleverly crafted and creative storyline in RTW. What I got was something entirely different and at times I wondered if the same person wrote these books. I'm still a fan of Patty Rice's and I hope to see her back on track with future novels that are engrossing, page turning and captivating.stayed true to character and I felt I could identify with her; by the end of the story I understood her actions and motives.

Can I get a witness...what sista has not had a bad hair day and made a snap decision to cut it all off...and then after it was gone wondered if she had done the right thang? I know I've been there...done that and been back again. However, does my hair define or tell the complete story of who I am? I hope that I'm not as shallow as that and that my persona is defined by so much more than my hair.<br />Nappily Ever After by Trisha Thomas was witty, humorous and a refreshing look at AA woman and the issues we face on a daily basis which are sometimes complicated by hair that won't behave. Creating a storyline around hair was simply unique and different ... however, upon closer observation the hair dilemma was really a symptom and not the problem.<br />The main character, Venus appears to have it all...a good job, good man, good friends, good income, good home...but then one day she decides she wants a change...and decides to begin with a new hairstyle. Yes, she decides to get rid of the long, chemically relaxed hair that keeps her glued to the hair stylist chair every week or two just for maintenance. At a MINIMUM of $30.00 per style it's an expensive habit to support. And of course, her hair stylist isn't too happy that she's considering that option..you know the one of I don't need you anymore. Now what hair stylist would be; most of them like that we're slaves to their chair and that some of us will wait several hours or longer just for them to grace us with their presence and do our hair. Mind you we're paying but we have to wait at their beck and call.<br />So when Venus decides to break loose from the hair/salon bondage she realizes that there are other shackles that she needs to let go as well...including the 6' plus, live-in honey, lover of the last 3 years named Clint...and did I mention that he was even a so-called good catch...yes the brother Clint was a soon-to-be fully licensed doctor. Clint's problem was that he wasn't ready for commitment with Venus; afterall he figured there was another alternative rather than offering a marriage proposal. Which left Venus with no other choice but to dump him. After lonely nites and days, Venus questions whether or not she has made the right decision and whether she should allow the noncommittal Clint back into her life. After all was he really that bad...loneliness will sometimes take us to desperate measures and make us rethink our best decisions. However, the getting back might not be as easy as Venus envisioned. As we experience the antics and scenes of Venus' whirlwind life without Clint and with Clint we see an evolution of sorts as Venus gains understanding of the new Venus and that its not really the hair that matters but the person beneath the crowning glory.<br />Nappily Ever After is a well-written debut novel; Thomas delivers a witty, funny and sensitive coming-of-age novel. Trisha Thomas is a talented newcomer and I hope to see more works from this sista!

Terry is back and gosh did she meet my expectations!<br />A Day Late and A Dollar Short (DLDS) is a tale about family secrets, tragedies and triumphs. Go with McMillian to Las Vegas and uncover the story of Viola and Cecil Price and their four adult children. Viola is the matriarch and the central character of the storyline, however the story is told in the first person voice of each of the six main characters. McMillian hits close to home for many with this storyline which provides a very believable and realistic look at families. While the Prices happen to be African American, actually their situations and exploits are colorblind and could easily represent any family.<br />DLDS touches on issues of sibling rivalry, adultery, unplanned pregnancies, drug and alcohol abuse, rape, incest, and homosexuality. Dysfunctionality abounds and no matter what the gender of the character or whether the character is a major or minor player they are all flawed for the most part (except for maybe Ms. Loretta).<br />As I read DLDS I encountered love and hate, joy and sorrow, happiness and anger. There were some LOL scenes, some scenes which made me grit my teeth and other scenes which made me shake my head and say...&quot;uumph, uumph, uumph&quot;. DLDS is an excellent book that's well written  and includes in-depth character development along with unexpected plot twist and turns. Terry is back and she's on her game!

There are some books which are so powerful that they leave you speechless and awestruck.  Sugar  is one of those books with its powerful message, vivid imagery and rich characters.  Quite simply, Sugar is a stunning debut and an outstanding novel by Bernice McFadden.<br />I knew that I was in for a good read based upon the first sentence...&quot;Jude is Dead&quot;....in fact, the first paragraph/chapter is one of the most poignant and riveting storylines that I've ever had the pleasure to read!  The intensity of the situation was chilling and felt to the bone as I was transported to another time and place that was Sugar's world.  McFadden mesmorized us as she told us Sugar's story...On a hot, summer day circa 1940s, Sugar exploded into the small town of Bigelow, Arkansas.  A town filled with much tragic, many secrets and plenty of small town gossip.  A town that didn't look favorably upon or welcome a single woman who they considered to be loose, lusty, sexy and maybe after their men. But their is one woman who strays from the narrowminded path to befriend Sugar and what initiates as unlikely develops into a strong friendship.  Pearl, is old enough to be Sugar's mom, but Pearl knows what shoes Sugar has walked in.  Pearl know's loneliness, heartache, a shell waiting to be cracked as well as two souls searching for friendship, love and understanding.  Pearl &amp; Sugar's friendship gives the other hope and the other confidence to experience and share the happier, carefree moments of life.  Theirs was a  cherished friendship and one that the reader experienced vicariously. Through Pearl and Sugar we learn of a kindred spirit due to a tangled web weaved many years ago and as the story unfolds so do we.  Sugar was just AWESOME!  As I became more absorbed in the story it was hard to tear away from reading...so I gave in and read it in one sitting. Sugar was well-written, refreshing and a change of pace. McFadden is an author to be reckoned with and one who will (hopefully) become a household name. McFadden has mastered the art of writing with an ole' school/classic style but yet a contemporary flair.  Her writing is timeless and should be around for years to come.

Butterscotch Blues by Margaret Hodge is a multi-dimensional relational novel which details Sandi's(the main character/protagonist) life with family, friends and new beau Adrian.  Butterscotch Blues was painstakingly emotional but oh so compelling, well crafted and a page turner from the onset so I was able to read this wonderfully told story in one sitting.  So many thoughts ran through my head as I watched the relationship of Sandi and Adrian unfold and experienced heart-wrenching, soul stirring situations that made me wonder &quot;could I express that type of unconditional love if I were in the same  situation&quot;. I liked that Sandi's character had dimension and depth and as such we were able to see her beyond just her beau; we lived with her through sisterfriend and familial relationships.  Girlfriends that we knew...and could call our friends...Brittany(the overweight sister who's the last one to  usually have a man), Martha(the sisterfriend who only dates men with big pockets/wallets)and Janice(the friend who always has to have a man-any man-even a piece of man is okay).  We're up close and personal with Sandi and Adrian's families as we explore issues of betrayal and skin color divisiveness in the AA community.  Butterscotch Blues is a complex story filled with crafty dialogue, vivid imagery, realistic situations, well-developed characters and plot twists and turns; it's a story of hope, love and living each day to the fullest.  Ms. Hodge is truly a wonderful storyteller as Butterscotch Blues is a story that you live and experience long after you've read the book.

Once again Bernice McFadden is on the scene and takes us to a place which vividly surpasses our wildest imaginations and makes us question whether The Warmest December is fiction or real life.  Step Into Kenzie's world, where you discover a childhood lived in fear with an abusive and alcoholic father, Hyman Lowe aka Hy-Lo.  Imagine Kenzie's childhood where most days were filled with sadness, pain, anger, harm and too many issues/situations that a child shouldn't  have to live with.  And then come full circle to One Warm December, where Hy-Lo/the Teflon man  lay dying in a County Hospital, very much alone, estranged from family and himself.  It starts on one cold winter morning, Kenzie is drawn by some unbeknownst force (maybe it was compassion, maybe it was pity for an old man who could no longer harm her) to take two buses daily to the hospital to be at the bedside of whats left of Hy-Lo.  Hard-living had taken its toll on him and he was now a simple shell of the man he used to be:  a man who was like Teflon and took to the bottle every day of his life to stifle out any emotions that tried to leak through when he was sober...which wasn't often.  He was a man who was so horrible,  that at the age of 5, Kenzie  would start hating him and everyday of her life she would wish he was dead.  A man who was like Teflon because he didnt allow anyone to get close enough to close the hole in his chest or the space near his heart.  As Kenzie visits Hy-Lo and sits and waits for death to have its way with her father, she reminisces regarding yesteryears, and the memories of the past are filled with  years of pain, hurt, abuse, anger and sorrow brought on by the wrath of Hyman Lowe.  The wrath affected all of those who lived in Apt. A5: Della, the timid and scared mother; Malcolm the growing and daring only son; and Kenzie the only girl child.  The trials and tribulations that this family experienced were so hauntingly and depressingly realistic that I pondered whether the storyline was fictional or factual.  As I read, always lurking in the back of my mind was whether Hy-Lo was abused as a child by an alcoholic parent.  I wondered if this was a generational issue and one that would take Malcolm and Kenzie to break the chains that appeared to shackle this family daily24/7, 365 days a year, for more years than I care to remember.  The Warmest December is well-written and the subject matter is fierce and intense.  The writing is vivid, graphic and yet lyrical; told in a storytelling fashion as only McFadden can do with supreme justice.  As I read, oftentimes, I wanted to rush the story and get to the end so that I could quell the pain that I was experiencing. The message/storyline was so powerful that I was unable to read this book in one sitting; incidents would happen which would force me to set the book aside and come back at a later time.  I couldnt give up reading this book though and there were times<br />when I wanted to; but then I would be drawn back because I wanted to know if my questions would be answered. Turning the pages of The Warmest December  was sometimes emotionally hard but it was also hard not to turn the pages.  I knew the answers lied deep within and I was determined to read until the very end to find out what made Hy-Lo tick and to discover whether Kenzie could end what appeared to be a vicious cycle.  In the end, I discovered that &quot;Some stories start out happy, go bad in the middle, and end up happy at the end.  Still others start out bad, get worse, and still end up happy in the end.  Hy-Los story started out bad, curdled up and soured in the middle, and ended up worse but for Kenzie there was  still hope for change.  Kenzie finds what she needs to sweep away the pain, open up the windows, and air out the hurt; letting in some joy and patching  up that space  near her heart; she learns how to apply a fresh coat of pain and move on with her life.&quot;  I'm happy that I stuck with the Warmest December because I truly found closure in the midst of the Lowe's Family storm.

Ms. Hill did a wonderful job in developing the  characters as we can see a little of ourselves in at least one of them; these were women in their late 30s/early 40 facing real life situations...some of them situations that we all face on a daily basis.  Women from all walks of life can closely identify with the crossroads or transitions that each of these ladies faced.<br />Regina-appeared to have it all a good husband, good job, wonderful home but happiness and inner peace appeared to be lacking.  All her life she did what others told her to do..she was the proverbial good gurl. For years, Regina  put everyone-husband, mother, children, friends-before herself  but gradually overtime she snaps out of her stifling existence and awakens to find herself. Regina is really the only one who sees things for what they are  and when life starts to fall apart for those around her...they realize that Regina was just always herself and that she didn't play games and she  accepted you as you were.  Victoria-scarred by evil sisters, her mom and society always felt that she  wasn't good enough because of her skin color. She overcompensates and appears  to be together on the outside but step inside and you see an individual who  has low self-esteem, and is full of fear, insecurities and inner turmoil.  Toni-realized that she couldn't help her illiterate and unemployed family in  the heart of the Deep South but she succeeded in her mission to become a social worker and a darn good one.  The only problem was while she was out saving all of mankind she forgot to include her husband and her son.  Will she be able to save her marriage and her son?<br />If I Could captured my attention and my heart; its an inspiring piece for  anyone who looked up one day and thought If I Could...I Would.

We're introduced to black and married mortician Issac Shaw and white teenager Annie Parson who's a runaway and is at the funeral home to inform Isaac that he's the father of her unborn child.  All within a matter of minutes, Annie gives birth but dies during childbirth.  Isaac must decide what to do with Annie's body and also come up with a plan to pass off baby Eugene Shaw as his adopted son.<br />The deep, dark secrets of that night and the Shaw Family come full circle 30 years later...the setting has changed slightly though but the characters are only moments away from exploding.  The Shaws now resided in Detroit, MI where Isaac is an up and coming politician and in pursue of the mayor's title.  Eugene, Isaas and Annie's baby boy, has grown up and somthing just isn't quite right; he's being tortured and persecuted by demons from his past.  Demons which might overtake him and claim his life...and a serial killer is born and on the loose in the streets of Detriot.  Seems that someone is out to murder those individuals that are perceived as Oreos, black on the outside, but white on the inside.  Enter front and center, Detroit Homicide Lt. Mary Cunningham--a sister with many person issues--who's also tormented in her own right--but she's also in charge of the troops and capturing the elusive serial killer.<br />Sterling Anthony's debut novel is a respectable tale that successfully develops a family sage sub-plot that cleverly ties back to the main storyline.  Anthony provides messages regarding race, politics and society without being preachy; the storyline is fresh and provides an intriguing tale of dysfuntionality, murder, crime and deception.  Overall, the storyline captured my attention and held my interest, however, I felt letdown by the ending.  Loose ends were tied up...but maybe just a little too crisp and the serial killers reason for killing was never really explained. It would have helped to have the Parson Curse fully explored, detailed rather than mentioned briefly in passing; especially since this curse was so crucial to the climax.  Yet still, Cookie Cutter is a quick, fast paced suspenseful pshychological thriller and Anthony has already shown that he has the potential to be a very successful author in this genre.es an intriguing tale of dysfuntionality, murder, crime and deception.

I am an avid fan of books by Tananarive Due as she is a phenomenal and talented writer.  I highly recommend that you read The Between prior to reading MSTK and then of course you have to read MSTK to witness Ms. Due's growth as a writer.<br />The Between introduces us to Hilton James and his family.  As Hilton grows older, his life seems to unravel, and it seems he's falling apart and those around him can't dare save him.  Hilton experienced a traumatic event during his childhood that continues to haunt him and recently appears to be negatively impacting him and his relationship with others.  It seems that his grandmother saved him from drowning when he was a kid, but she perished in the process.  As we travel with Hilton through his world we are led into a complex maze that appears not to let go once you're in it.  The Between is a hauntingly, beautiful debut novel which requires your patience and attention to detail in order to absorb and comprehend this somewhat ambitious and complex storyline.  You're immediately drawn in Hilton's world as you delve into the madness and experience life from Hilton's perspective.  You're frightfully afraid for Hilton's family as the madness jumps off the pages and into your life.  You fall in love with Hilton's family and want to take them to safe cover as you scarily explore plot twist and outcomes that result from Hilton's actions in his efforts to protect his family.  The Between's storyline was quite compelling so you automatically turned the pages to see what would happen next; however I must admit that the ending left more questions that answers for me.<br />Once again, Ms. Due gives us a solid suspense plot, voice to a loving middle-class African-American family, well developed characters, vivid situations and writing that touches all of our senses.  I especially like that Ms. Due gives us a genre that is not often explored by AA authors and her storylines are always fresh and unique!  I highly recommend The Between and My Soul To Keep as I think that as long as you keep an open mind and read the books in order you will enjoy both of these books immensely!that Ms. Due gives us a genre that is not often explored by AA authors and her storylines are always fresh and unique!

Shoe's On The Otha Foot(SOTOF) is yet another relationship novel filled with more of the same, typical storyline.  It's the story of Leslie, an independent, spirited 21 year old, who decides against her better judgment to explore her womanhood and lose her virginity to Benjamin, her latest but much older(35 years old) beau.  Benjamin seems to be a good BMW until we discover he's living with another woman and his teenage son.  Rounding out the cast of central characters is Rachelle, cousin and good friend of Leslie's. Of course, Rachelle has her own drama going on as she is divorced with three kids and is juggling two men at the same time.  SOTOF appears to be loosely crafted and as though someone decided to transpose their journal into a novel.  The scenes/situations/characters do not offer a fresh perspective or unique storyline.  On a positive note, SOTOF tries to present each character with at least some redeeming quality(I walked away liking all of the characters) and the drama did not appear far-fetched or over the top.  If you're looking for a book that's an easy, quick read(I read the book in one setting) then this might be the book for you.  If you're looking for a storyline with more depth and substance than you might need to search a little further.	2000-12-13

The storyline evolves around Georgia Barnett an up and coming television news reporter in the Windy City.  In pursuit of the perfect story and awesome rating points, Georgia pursues a harrowing story of gang violence and a missing child in inner-city Chicago. During the course of a week, Georgia finds herself in the midst of serious drama and a potential relationship with detective Doug Eckart.<br />Details At Ten displays Joe's crafty writing style, however, the storyline was slow in developing and not as fast-paced and action-packed as I prefer my mysteries.  The story was told more from a reporter's angle and sometimes this aspect interfered with just plunging in and enjoying the storyline.  All In All, the storyline was realistic and became more suspenseful toward the end.  Fans of Yolanda Joe's who enjoyed This Just In will also probably enjoy Details At Ten as both books seem to focus on broadcast media.	2000-12-07

Mind you this book had been sitting on my bookshelf for almost a year and I wasn't overly enthused or anxious about reading it but there was just enough information on the book jacket to entice me regarding what I hoped would be a light, quick and entertaining read.  Good Hair lived up to the challenge!  I really enjoyed this book...and was pleasantly surprised.  The story is told in first person from Alice, the protagonist, point of view.  It's the story of a most unlikely romance between Alice a hard working, first generation college educated sista who falls for Jack the  by-product of an upper middle class, privileged AA family and a third generation doctor.  Along the way we really get to know Alifce and the story seems almost autobiographical in nature as we journey with Alice from her childhood through the present as she struggles with day-to-day encounters and tries to find herself in the midst of it all.  The storyline was spiced with pointed insight regarding contemporary issues such as spousal abuse, incest/sexual abuse, suicide, homosexuality, betrayal, self-esteem as well as caste issues among AAs.  Good Hair was grammatically well written and the storyline flowed, however, at times, it also felt like a casually plotted storyline with sketchy characters,sometimes stilted dialogue, and a multitude of loose end situations. I believe that the storyline had the potential to be even better if (1) greater character development was displayed beyond Alice's character;  I especially would have liked to hear Jack's point of view vs. being told about him from primarily Alice's perspective; (2) stronger ending...I was really disappointed in the ending which seemed trite and predictable.  Then again the ending did leave room for a sequel.  Overall Good Hair was a good read and it held my interest so much so that I was able to finish the book in one setting.  Ms. Little's writing style piqued my interest and I will also give The Itch-her sophomore novel- a chance.that I was able to finish the book in one setting.

Looking for a book to pick you up and make you laugh and one that presents AA males in a normal, realistic perspective...then look no further than Lookin' For Luv.  This debut novel from Carl Weber is witty, entertaining, easy to read and filled with realistic characters and situations.  Lookin' For Luv is the story of four AA men who work together and who are all looking for love via 1-900-BLACK LUV.  The storyline is told from the AA male's perspective and combines comedy, drama, romance, dating during the '90s and contemporary issues to form a compelling and well crafted tale.  Everyone who's ever been in the dating game can relate to at least one of the colorful characters in this book.  These characters provide antics and situations which keep you LOL(laughing out loud), ROTF(rolling on the floor), hollering out loud and talking to the book...&quot;no he/she didn't go there&quot;.  My favorite character was Tyrone gosh was this brotha smooth with his 10 Rules to Satisfy a Woman; and my least favorite character who had absolutely no obvious redeeming qualities was Maurice.  Yes I thoroughly enjoyed Lookin' For Luv and highly recommend it for a chance of pace...if you want to laugh a lot then pick up this book today...you won't be disappointed.  Okay you might be disappointed with the epilogue...I didn't think it was fair to one of the characters and was oh so cold...and the cover could use some work.  The couple portrayed(on the cover) makes it seem that Lookin' For Luv is only for a very young audience but the characters are relatable to anyone including those folks who are in their 20s or their 50s.  BOTTOM LINE:  I still really really really like Lookin' For Luv and am looking forward to future novels from newcomer Carl Weber.	2000-11-30

If you're seeking a hysterical, somewhat entertaining novel which includes situations and characters that are wicked, sinister, outlandish, far-fetched, over the top, and unpredictable then search no further than Voodoo Love by Sonia Caulton.  The story is about the Bad, Ugly, Dark and Neurotic side of marriage as portrayed through the relationship of Darika and Keith. Experience the tumultuous relationship of Darika &amp; Keith, an upper-middle class AA couple, living large in the Nation's Capitol City. While the storyline adds the element of \\"voodoo\\"  as a twist this is still yet another relationship novel of somebody doing me wrong...and oh are the characters in this book manipulative, devious, unstable and just plain crazy.  I kept looking for someone to have some redeeming quality but it just wasn't obvious.  Given the nature of the characters it was hard to see them as anything other than one-dimensional; it appears that all of the lives revolved around who was sleeping with whom.  Men and Women engaged in extramarital affairs as easy and as frequently as they took a daily shower.  Drama, Drama, and More Drama along with over the edge, sometimes far-fetched plot twist&amp;turns unfortunately could not save a book that needed serious editing. Voodoo Love actually had the potential to be so much better if more attention had been paid to the editing/proofing process. Hence, the low rating.  I could live with the less than believable and unrealistic plot because Voodoo Love is fiction; however,turning pages quickly to overlook grammatical errors is ridiculous and unacceptable. Hopefully future books from Ms. Caulton will include more attention to the small details and will be better written.	2000-10-05

Father Found is a provocative, riveting and emotionally chilling sophomore effort by RM Johnson.  The story is graphically violent and not for the weak of heart that faint easily; this is not a warm, fuzzy book.  In Father Found we travel down the mean-streets of Chicago with Zale Rowen who's on a mission to reunite every child with its father.  The mission isn't a bad one but its one that's to the expense of everything else in Zale's life including his health, relationships with others and mental well-being.  Zale and his partners, Frank and Martin, utilize measures to reunite fathers with family members which are sometimes ruthless, questionable and in some instances just downright violent. Zale justifies his actions by his past; Frank justifies his actions by his past, and Martin well he is just so confused and mixed up that he fits in with the other two dysfunctional characters.  Johnson does a superb job in providing vivid imagery and scenery to help the reader witness the actual acts that occur throughout the book as well as the emotions of the key characters.  These men were filled with so much rage, anger and conflict that sometimes one had to put the book aside and shake off that negative feeling before continuing on.  Father Found was very well written and was raw, gripping and intense along with being very violent, dark and depressing. The plot twists and turns were shocking and emotional and oftentimes left you aching in the pit of your stomach. In the end, Johnson tried to leave us on an upbeat note but it might have been too little, too sugar coated and too late.  I recommend this book to all that enjoy excellent writing no matter the subject/title; books that challenge you emotionally and books which are insightful and hard-hitting.	2000-10-04

I started this book and didn't think about doing anything else until after I read the last page.  What a whirlwind week in the life of Hollywood heroines!  From the prologue, I was hooked and glued to the pages trying to figure out \\"whose child is it\\". File takes us into and behind the scenes of Hollywood with AA movers &amp; shakers. The reader is right there experiencing the dreams, disappointments, and secrets of Desi, Bettina, and Sharon. But let's not forget about secondary characters Meredith and Devin who added much spice and drama to the storyline. The storyline has a little bit of everything for every body-love, lust, power, politics, money, backstabbers, manipulators &amp; schemers-and you will turn the pages quickly to see what's going to happen next.  Blind Ambition is my favorite book by Ms. Files; her writing does continue to get better &amp; better.  However, I have to admit that I too was slightly disappointed in the ending(everything was a little too neatly wrapped up) and I was big-time let down/disappointed/upset when I discovered the identity of the anonymous character in the prologue.  I figured out the identity about half way through the book and I was so disappointed that it was that particular character!  When you read the book you will understand why. That said I still recommend Blind Ambition for an entertaining afternoon read.  Blind Ambitions is well-written with a plausible storyline, good character development, vivid imagery, and off the hook plot twist and turns that will catapult you right over the edge and have you laughing out loud and talking to the characters.

The gritty characters and real-life situations are what make Fed Up such a page-turning and interesting read. Fed Up  was filled with shocking and surprising plot twist and turns, which at times seemed over the top and out in left field. Along the way we encountered a host of taboo and sensitive issues which added drama and spice to the storyline. Fed Up will keep you turning the pages, hoping the time wouldn't fly so quickly, and when the last page is read you will be satiated.

Til' Death Do Us Part is a compilation of 15 short stories above the good, bad, and the ugly of relationships.  I requested Til' Death as a Birthday Gift and was looking forward to reading it because I like short stories.  I really enjoyed several of the stories; especially, Change of Hearts which was the sequel to Fed Up With the Fanny.  This story alone was worth the cost of the book.  Unfortunately, I was slightly surprised and disappointed that the writing was not as taut, refined, or polished as previous works by Franklin White.  For some reason, I feel like I was reading the rough draft for a debut novel. I was disappointed that as I started to feel a number of the stories they ended very abruptly.  Also, I would have liked a more diverse group of characters; most of the characters appeared one-dimensional or from the same background. The middle class/professional set didn't appear to be represented in this book.  I like White's work, and, although Til' Death Do Us Part wasn't my favorite book by White, I did enjoy that this was a book of short stories that could be read at anytime and I could read the stories in any order since this wasn't a novel.	2000-09-28

Some books are entertaining and  devoured for the moment; other books are savored and last for a lifetime.  The View From Here is a book that will stay with me for years to come as it  is an emotional and soul stirring story regarding Anna Anderson Thomas and  the unconditional love she has for her family.  The View From Here is  uniquely and creatively narrated by the protagonist Anna's, unborn child.  Anna is married to mean-spirited and broken down JT; this union has been  blessed with five sons and JT is satisfied with the current size of his  family.  Within a bleak situation in the economically depressed setting of  a small Mississippi town, the Thomas' are barely making it when they  discover that Anna is yet again pregnant.  Not looking forward to feeding  another mouth, JT promises the unborn child to his older sister  Clariece...and therein lies the dilemna.  I was emotionally wretched and  drained and moved to tears as I read the mental abuse that Anna suffered at  the hands of her husband and wondered &quot;why&quot;? The View From Here  is the story of any women who has had to stand up for herself and make  tough decisions which would impact her spouse, her children and her  self-preservation when the going got tough.  The View From Here is the  story of any woman under immense pressures, struggling to survive and to  ensure the unity of her family as she battles the obstacle course of  everyday living.  This story shows how a woman named Anna possesses strong  strength and determination and how she keeps faith to the bitter end and  turns the situation around for good. Rather than running away or cowering  to the demons that be, Anna stood up for what was right, what was true,  what was just in the moment of adversity. As the story poignantly and  provocatively climaxed I cheered for Anna as she stood her ground and did  what was right for her spiritual and emotional sanity! The View From Here  is an unforgettable tale about family, adversities, and the events that  shape our lives and our souls.  In spite of hardships, poverty, tragedies  and despair, The View From Here portrays the richness of life when one has  hope, courage and determination.  It's a poignant and touching portrayal of  family life that's full of love and the determination of a mother to keep  her family intact against all odds and obstacles.  The View From Here is  exquisitely and superbly told by Brian Keith Jackson.  This is an author to  be reckoned with and I look forward to reading Walking Through Mirrors and  future novels by this very talented new author.er spiritual and emotional sanity!

The View From Here is  exquisitely and superbly told by Brian Keith Jackson.  This is an author to  be reckoned with and I look forward to reading Walking Through Mirrors and  future novels by this very talented new author.	2000-09-13

My Soul To Keep (MSTK) by Tananarive Due is one of the best books that  I've Read in 2000!  This book was just awesome and included all of the  elements of a good read. MSTK was well written, scripted with a vivid  imagination and creativity and included a strong storyline, great character  development along with cliff hanging plot twists and turns.  I must digress  for a moment and admit that I had MSTK on my &quot;To Read List&quot; for  two years but was a little reluctant to read it because of the genre. Once  I committed myself to reading MSTK, I found myself really getting into this  book and the storyline; I ravenously turned the pages and became so all  consumed that I didn't want to put the book down. MSTK engrosses you in the  tale of David/Dawit the immortal who will do whatever is necessary to  maintain his family, the love of his life wife Jessica, and Kira his young  daughter.  The plot grabbed me from the beginning as Ms. Due had a  wonderful way of telling the story and taking one back into time.  Once Ms.  Due had your attention she took you back periodically to help you  understand How Dawit/became David. I felt that I was actually back in the  various timeperiods depicted in the book and actually waiting to travel  back to present day. Due weaves Past with Present in the telling of MSTK  and in doing so she provides the reader with enough background information  to keep the reader on the edge of the seat while adding depth and giving  substance to the storyline. MSTK keeps the reader fully immersed and  satiated until you have finished the last page. There is so much to absorb  and enjoy in MSTK that no one can really tell you about it; MSTK is a book  that you must experience in order to receive the full scope, the full  meaning of the story. I plan to read MSTK again...hopefully a little slower  this time so that I can SAVOR AND DIGEST the small details as well this  time. Ms. Due combines a fine blend of history, science fiction, and drama  to make the story riveting and to hold your interest from beginning to end.  I recommend MSTK as an excellent read for everyone and I can't wait for  the sequel...I know David/Dawit is still out there and I can't wait to hear  what he's been up to since I last read about him.make the story riveting and to hold your interest from beginning to end.

I've had Chocolate Star since it was first released but never got around  to reading it until now...and gosh was I pleasantly surprised.  Ms.  Copeland's debut novel was very well written with in-depth characters and a  plausible storyline.  Once I started reading Chocolate Star it was  definitely a page-turner and a book that was hard to put down.  Ms.  Copeland took us into the lives of four rags to riches characters whose  lives were all intertwined as the result of Topaz the female character.  Topaz...what a character! This chile' worked it and could have any man she  wanted and definitely was an attraction for Germaine, Sean, and Gunther.  Each of these men would either break her heart, steal her heart or never  leave her heart.  Chocolate Star allowed one to escape into the world of  the rich and famous...albeit while money provided access to gourmet foods,  travel to exotic locations, all the drugs you wanted when you wanted them  and shopping, shopping, shopping, shopping and more ...it definitely didn't  provide happiness. Each chapter was devoted to a different character and I  liked reading the in-depth characteristics of each individual.  I felt like  a fly on the wall eavesdropping on the lives of some of Hollywood's  greatest stars.  Okay...you knew some \\"buts\\" were coming.... My biggest pet  peeve with the book was the constant reference to skin color.  Why did  EVERY character have to be described in detail according to their skin  color (mocha brown; deep, deep chocolate; vanilla almond)?  After awhile it  became a big nuisance.  I can imagine what people look like I don't  necessarily have to know what shade of black they are since we all come in  so many color variations anyway.  Additionally the inference that you  couldn't be a star unless you were into drugs was annoying as well as the  frequent mention of brand names.  Also, I couldn't believe that once Topaz  became a big star that the tabloids/media never discovered her secret past.  This alone is unbelievable in today's world.  Fortunately, the pet peeves  were neutralized a little by accepting that Chocolate Star was a portrayal  of life in Hollywood where folks aren't always real and tend to be a little  superficial. Aside from the \\"stuff that was unbelievable or that I could  live without\\" the book was good and held my interest to the very end. If  you're looking to escape with a book this summer then check out this one...I  believe you will be pleasantly surprised. I know I was.s alone is unbelievable in today's world.

I was looking for a change of pace when I ran across this little book.  Pride and Joi by Gay Gunn is a remarkable love story!  It is the story of  Joe Pride and Joi (Martin) St. Marie.  Joi is torn between accepting the  love of her soulmate who will take her as she is or trying to love someone  who can give her all the material wealth but can't satisfy the fire in her  soul.  Joi and Pride captured me because it was well-written, the  characters had depth, the plot was plausible and the writing style was  breathtaking.  While reading about Pride and Joi, I felt like I was swept  off my feet and taken into a romance fantasy that ended with a fairy tale  ending.  Along the way I feel in love with Pride and Joi and hoped that  they would work out issues, differences, and keep other folks(who were not  so well meaning)out of their business! And while I thought that the ending  might be predictable the twist and turns that were added along the way  pleasantly surprised me.  If you're a romance reader and looking for a good  romance novel or even if you don't like romance novels but are in the mood  for a good love story please read Pride and Joi.  You won't be  disappointed!	2000-08-14

Tyree provided an in-depth view about the realistic  situations that young girls encounter in the streets of Urban America.  Tyree did a good job of speaking from a female perspective especially that  of a young female.  I enjoyed reading about Tracy's escapades, RaRas  vulnerability, and Jantel's dedication.  I felt like I was back in the  day...only it was doing the 70s.  Even then, teenage girls were interested in  dating, flyy clothes, and guys with money and bad rides.  Although I must  say that Tracy and her friends took it to a different level...a more gritty,  street smart and immoral level.  (As such, It leaves me to wonder what I  will be store for in 2010 when my daughter comes of age and begins to  date).  While I didn't like the boyfriend flavor of the week theme, because  it became a little redundant after the third boyfriend, I did enjoy  watching Tracy mature with time and realize that there was more to life  than being flyy. I saw Tracy as a spoiled youngster exploit into the teen  years with much attitude, a vain personality, a materialistic girl, and  sexual desires to boot.  But then I also saw Tracy experience an awakening  and as a result the love for self.  While Flyy Girl was primarily Tracy's  story there were secondary characters who were essential to the story along  with their sub-plots.  I enjoyed reading about Tracy's parents although I  was disappointed in the actions of her father toward his family  and to  some extend the things that Tracy's mother allowed Tracy to get away  with(ie expensive gifts from boys and no questions asked.  However, given  that the parents had their own set of issues I also understood their  imperfections and realized that even as a parent I too will make mistakes.  Flyy Girl provides insight regarding the issues that young teens face as  they try to live in the fast lane and world of easy money; provides a good  explanation of how young women think and how young boys act; and has a  message that's worth hearing.  I believe that every mom should purchase  this book to share with her daughter when she becomes of age.explanation of how young women think and how young boys act; and has a  message that's worth hearing.

There are a few books that leave an impression months afteryou've read them and The Coldest Winter Ever is one such book.  Not because TCWE was necessarily a literary masterpiece but rather because it was riveting, engrossing and must read for all.  Although fictional in nature people like the Winters and the Santiagas of the world do exist.  It's the story of the rise and fall of Ricky Santiago's family told from the main characters perspective.  TCWE is set in Brooklyn, NY and is narrated by, Winter, so named because she was born on the coldest day ever to Ricky Santiago a drug dealer and his 14 year old wife.  As one of Brooklyn's top drug lords Santiago kept his family(immediate and extended) on top and provided the best of everything for them even thought they lived in the projects.  When he decided to move the family to Long Island the threads that loosely held this family together quickly began to unravel. After Winter's Dad, Santiago, is arrested and imprisoned in life for selling/trafficking drugs, Winter must face the challenges of making it on the streets of New York with no education or skills; of course she refuses to give up the lifestyle she's become accustomed to and the heinous acts that she commits along the way are unforgiving, stupid/dump, cutthroat and leave little room for compassion. Even thought she ended up being homeless she could still spend $5,000 faster than most people could spend $5.00.  Winter's main concern was always about her looks and finding a man with money to take care of her in a lifestyle that she was accustomed to. Winter was raised on money, street smart principles but with no values or morals; heck even education wasn't important as long as one had good looks and money...didn't matter if it was drug money.  But as much as one chooses to dislike Winter, one can't help but learn what life is like growing up as the child of a drugload. TCWE was told in a RAW and engrossing manner.  Initially it appeared that Sister Souljah was glamorizing the drug scene but as the story unfolded and developed and one went deeper into the plot the RAW TRUTH came through Loud and Clear. It's a book that I recommend to parents and teenagers and anyone who wants to better understand the psychological mindset of those who live for the moment without a care in the world.  ENDs glamorizing the drug scene but as the story unfolded and developed and one went deeper into the plot the RAW TRUTH came through Loud and Clear.

It took me a month<br />to finally finish this one.

Dickey has done it again with a well-written storyline; witty, sassy and humorous dialogue; vivid characters and multi-plot twist and turns. Liar's Game is set in the  familiar setting of Los Angeles and Dickey's graphic descriptions do  justice to the City of Angels...I felt like I was right there partying,  working and walking the streets of LA with the characters.  Liar's Game  revolves around Dana and Vince two lonely hearts looking for Mr. and Ms.  Right in of all places a nightclub.  We're quickly submersed in their  relationship as they proceed feet first into a quick move-in/living  arrangement and engagement...and as time moves forward the relationship  plunges into DRAMA, DRAMA, and more DRAMA with both parties being at fault.  Past lies, sexual partners, videotapes and secrets in the closets are  busting at the seams and busting loose. Of course, the storyline would not  be complete without twisting sub-plots involving the usual suspects of best  girlfriend and best male friend along with ex spouse and ex significant  others.  All of who add flavor and spice to the storyline. I was as  engrossed in the secondary characters as I was the main characters. The  characters were all so real; I knew these people.  As such my emotions ran  the gamut as I experienced betrayal, heartbreak, revenge, seduction,  redemption and oh-so-sweet real love via the Liar's Game. Liar's Game is a  fast-paced and easy to read novel filled with much substance and insight,  and brimming with intense, honest emotions.  Yes this was an excellent read  for me and now that I've gotten my Dickey fix for 2000 I can sit back and  anxiously await what's in store for 2001.	2000-07-28

Written In Red Ink by Kieja Shapodee is an intense, dramatic story filled with twists, in-depth characters, and perilous situations.  Kieja uses  vivid and shocking dialogue, poignant details and an emotional storyline to  pull you into the world of Emily Bennett.  Told from the main character,  Emily's perspective, Written In Red Ink is about Emily's life.  It's about  her relationship with her elderly mother (Lenora) who hates Emily but Emily  doesn't understand why; Emily's relationship with her husband Richard who  loves her as much today as he did the day he married her-however will  secrets from Emily's past destroy what they've built; Emily's relationship  with her daughters...especially the oldest Daughter Lisa who's rebellious and  battling her own demons; Emily's relationship with her sister friend  Annette who picks wrong man after wrong man but desperately wants a loving  husband and family; Emily's relationship with her therapist who's help she  needs to unravel and discover the truth of her  past.<br />Shapodee's  descriptions, dialogue, and characters were so vivid and graphic that I  felt like I was living with Emily Bennett and her family.  My emotions ran  rampant and I felt Emily deeply; I felt her pain, her joy, her sorrow, her  anger, and her hatred.  From Chapter One Lenora's venom was spewed all over  you!  You were so angered by her actions that you immediately wanted to  side with Emily in your dislike for this unmotherly individual.  You knew  that you had to continue to read and to read fast to understand the root  behind the hatred.  Written in Red Ink is engrossing, engaging,  suspenseful, and intriguing. The riveting drama will have you prematurely  anticipating the next page and anxiously awaiting for the sequel...as we hope  that we will be hearing from the Bennett family again.  I highly recommend  this book.	2000-07-27

However,The Jones Men is a short,  quick, easy to read story and also a well-written novel which chronicles  the lives and times of drug dealers in a major city during the `70s.

The  neighborhood where she met Jason, the boy who would become her first  sweetheart, the boy who she would lose her virginity to and become pregnant  by, the man who would later become her husband and yet through it all would  not be able to satisfy her sexual cravings, sexual indulgence, sexual  desires, sexual needs.

As Zoe's addiction becomes overbearing,  all-consuming and life-threatening she seeks professional counseling.  It  is via professional counseling that the secrets of the past come rushing  forward...secrets that Zoe was unaware existed in the corners of her brain,  secrets that help shape Jason's actions as well as secrets that Zoe's mom  felt were better left in the past.

BD is the story of Verdi and Johnson, Verdi and Rowe, Verdi and extended family poetically and lyrically told in a breathtaking manner!  I finished this  book in a day and was saturated with so many feelings that it was over two  weeks before I was able to pick up another book.  In fact, Blues Dancing is  by far the best book that I've read this year and the only book that I've  read twice in a VERY LONG TIME.<br />Blue's Dancing is vividly and lyrically  written and is an unforgettable story about love, betrayal and faith.  For  the last twenty years, Verdi has composed a quite life with her former  professor, Rowe.  He takes care of her and makes her feel good albeit over  time the relationship becomes increasingly stifling and controlling at  times.  All appears fine until Johnson returns to town.  Johnson, the boy  from the streets of Philadelphia who captured Verdi's heart when the two of  them were in college.  Johnson the boy who taught Verdi to love heroin and  then wanted out of the relationship when the heroin consumed Verdi.  With  Johnson's reappearance, the ground beneath Verdi begins to shift, and Verdi  must discover the only person who can save her-herself.<br />I like Ms.  Whetstone's ability to tell an engrossing and provocative story.  Even  thought the story spanned the 70's and 90's and switched back and forth one  barely noticed because of Ms. Whetstone's excellent writing skills and  writing style.  The characters were well developed and had depth including  the youngest cast member Sage.  You cheered for Posie and one wanted the  best for her; Rowe was the character that everyone loved to hate.<br />  Blues  Dancing touches all of ones senses as it is alive with scent, sound, sight,  taste and touch.  Whetstone wraps us in emotions so acute that we can  almost taste Johnson's sadness, smell Verdi's innocence, and touch Rowe's  manipulation.  Whetstone's descriptions are rich with imagery so vivid that  one can readily visualize the scenery and the characters lives as they  stand on the brink of crumbling.  Once you've read Blues Dancing you'll  change  your mind about some of the current genre out there by AA authors  and say wow...CAN WE HAVE MORE WRITING LIKE THIS...no broken English, mature  and educated AAs, characters with depth, substantial storyline, plots that  build and get better, excellent writing skills, and the list goes on but  read it for yourself and form your own opinions.

Set in the foothills of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, A Long Way from  Home is a multigenerational story of slavery, freedom, and the  indestructible bond of love and family, witnessed through the lives of  three memorable African-American women:  Susie, her daughter Clara, and her  granddaughter, Susan.<br />A Long Way From Home by Connie Briscoe while  fictional is  based on Briscoe's female ancestors who were house slaves at  Montpelier, the plantation of Dolly and James Madison.  Because the book  details the lives of women who were house slaves vs. Field slaves one is  provided a different perspective on an often overlooked group of people who  did exist...and it appears had different ideas about slavery and freedom.  Which to me is not farfetched or any different from what many of us  experience today.  Even though we can leave...we often stay in situations  such as relationships, jobs, etc. because of the security they provide.  We're often times afraid of the unknown and as such seek comfort and a  false sense of relief from that which we know.  Additionally, A Long Way  From Home showed that subtle divisions existed among country slaves and  city slaves, American-born blacks and  African-born blacks.  So while  people of color were slaves not all of them acted the same or even thought  the same.<br />A Long Way From Home graphically recreates the life of slaves  and owners and is a poignant, and powerful story  told from a different  perspective.  Once I started reading it, I was able to finish the book in  one setting as the story was well-written, the characters were believable,  and the storyline provided a stirring account of the everyday lives of  slaves before and after the Civil War.  The only disappointment was the  ending ...I wonder if a sequel is  forthcoming?	2000-07-10

And oh...does  she need her hair braided...no problem I  can even do the sistas  hair!&quot;<br />Pardon me is this a brotha who's talking like this? Why...Yes  My Dear.  A Brother by the name of Myles.  Myles is a refreshing male  protagonist in this plot. You see He's Looking for commitment but the  aloof, evasive, noncommittal female protagonist Marisa is a whole mess and  another story.<br />Marcus Majors does a good job of taking us through the ups  and downs of modern day romance via Myles and Marisa and the secondary  characters.  The storyline was well written, the dialogue was sharp and  witty, and the characters were believable.  I especially liked Myles older  brother, Amir, who always had something to say about everything but at the  same time when it was all said and done the brotha still knew how to treat  and keep a lady and  he was there for brother Myles.  My only  disappointment with Good Peoples was that I never felt that I really knew  Marisa.  What made that Latino-African sister act the way she did....I wish  her childhood had been explored more.  Oh and yeah the ending was  predictable, however, the story was easy to read, entertaining, and kept  moving so the ending didn't  bother me ...too much.<br />Marcus Majors has a  good, first novel debut!

I like John Sanford's work and as such I really tried to like Easy Prey.  In fact, I even  listened to the audiobook twice, but it was still as confusing the second time around and as convoluted.<br />The story's premise  is that Silly Hanson gives a wild, raucous, drug infested party which  Alie's the Supermodel attends.  While hanging out at the party Alie'e is  murdered along with another woman who true to Sanford's style is found in  the closet. Almost everyone close to Alie'e is a suspect until one by one  someone begins to murder them.  Luca Davenport as usual is on the latest  case to solve the crime and figure out whodunit.  Other than murders  everywhere and a very unlikely, out of nowhere perpetrator, and sup-plots  involving Luca Davenport's multitude of women...the plot is fairly weak if  you're listening to the audiobook version.  While Davenport is a big boy  and should have a lady friend/main squeeze in his life ...does he need so  many?  Seems Davenport spent more time juggling women friend than he did  trying to solve the murder mystery.  Additionally, It was almost impossible  to keep up with all of the characters and it seemed that when you started  to even remotely become curious or concerned about one of the characters  they were quickly replaced by an equally undeveloped new character.<br />While  I found Easy Prey somewhat interesting/entertaining, the second time  listening to the audiobook, Easy Prey alone wouldn't be enough to make me  like or purchase future Sanford/ Luca Davenport series. Previous books such  as Certain Prey and Mind Prey were so much better with storyline, character  development and suspense, hang on to your hat plot twisters.... I will  continue to purchase Sanford's books, however, I will probably read the  reviews before I run out and buy the next book.  Also For first time  readers, to get a better idea of just how good Sanford is with the  Davenport series, I would recommend that you read a couple of Sanford's  previous works or wait until the paperback comes out before purchasing Easy  Prey.evious works or wait until the paperback comes out before purchasing Easy  Prey.	2000-06-29

Please note that this review refers to the abridged audiobook version and as such the book version might be different.<br />Worst Fears Realized starts off with an  interesting and compelling plot; a plot that captured my imagination and  one that I thought would be impossible not to listen to in one sitting.  The storyline is as such...next to being killed in the line of duty, a cop's  worst fear is that a convicted felon will one day be released from prison  and seek revenge. It appears that someone whom Stone Barrington and Dino  Bacchetti put away years ago is stalking them and out to kill everyone  close to them.  By process of elimination, Barrington/Bacchetti narrow the  list of suspects and zero in on a perp by the name of Herbert Mitteldorfer  aka Herbie.  Herbie was sentenced to life imprisonment for killing his wife  in a crime of passion; however there's a catch with Herbie as the sole  suspect.  You see when murders happen it seems that Herbie is nowhere  around because he's still in prison at Sing Sing.  Barrington/Bacchetti  don't let up on there hunch and they continue to suspect Herbie but proving  and catching Herbie will take them on a wild cat and mouse chase with plot  twists along the way and a cast of supporting characters and  suspects.<br />Speaking of character's ...Barrington is quite a character  himself and as such I found it sometimes hard to take him serious as a  private detective.  Barrington is written as a pseudo-James Bond character  who enjoys the finer things of life and he's distracted along the way by  fine dining, fine wines,gourmet foods, purchases of armored luxury cars and  small cottages in Connecticut; the company of potential Mafia Godfathers  and a stream of women at his beck and call.  Given the number of female  love interest it was hard to keep up with them as they went through  Barrington's revolving bedroom door and the most pathetic character was  Arrington...a former love interest who's now married but apparently still has  eyes for Barrington.  In regards to Arrington her character did not appear  to be well developed.  In the audiobook, she didn't appear until  mid-stream...  Maybe, Woods better described Arrington in the book version or  even previous books, however, in Worst Fears Realized she just suddenly  appeared without explanation and her actions were childish/juvenile.  Maybe  real women do act like that...I just haven't met any of them.<br />Worst Fears  Realized wasn't one of the best mystery/thrillers that I've read but the  pace was fast, the storyline was entertaining and humorous, the plot  included interesting twist and turns along the way, and the climax while  predictable was satisfying....a former love interest who's now married but apparently still has  eyes for Barrington.

She along with her husband of ten years,  Bill Happgood and Joan's son Matt have an idyllic life in rural New  Hampshire.  That is until Joan has to care for her mom, Emily Moore who's  elderly and suffering from Alzheimer.  Emily changes everything for the  family when her house catches on fire by accident and she has to move in  with her youngest daughter,Joan,and her family.  Emily continues to live in  the past and pines for her oldest, perfect and beautiful but dead daughter  Cynthia.  Emily unfortunately has never liked Joan or Joan's brat Matt, and  when strange things begin to happen Emily blames it all on Matt. Matt soon  discovers that with Grandmother Emily come secrets of the past that are  painful, haunting, deathly, and destructive.  Nightshade is a definite  page-turner as Saul takes us into the taboo territory of child abuse,  incest, and mental illness and brings the storyline to a frightening and  terrifying climax.<br />I listened to the abridged audiobook for Nightshade  and I was immensely engrossed in the tale as told by Lee Meriweather.  Lee  Meriweather was superb as a narrator and I must say that Nightshade has got  to be the best book that I've ever listened to via audiobook.  In fact, I  was so drawn into the story and suspense that I couldn't stop listening to  the tape because I had to know what was going to happen next.  Murders were  happening all over the place and bodies were stacking up.  Evidence was  pointing to one person but I just felt it couldn't be that person.  Who was  it then?  Maybe it was that person?  Why were these things happening?<br />Nightshade is the first novel by John Saul that I've had the pleasure to  read.  I like Saul's writing style, and was captivated from page one,  because Saul delivered a story that kept me turning the pages/listening to  the audiobook until I heard the end of the story.  Nightshade is a must  read/must listen to book for 2000.  This is one thriller/suspense novel  that will not disappoint.

Yes, earlier reviews which stated that the editing was poor, the writing was sloppy in areas, the character development was shallow and contrived, the storyline/plot included erroneous information, was sometimes  convoluted, and included unbelievable situations, etc. are TRUE.  However,  In spite of these shortcomings, I still enjoyed this novel.  Maybe it's  because it was my first Alex Cross mystery and as such I had no comparison  point or maybe it's because I was looking for an entertaining, easy to  read, quick start psychological thriller which I could read in one sitting  and feel satisfied when finished.  As such Pop Goes the Weasel was an  entertaining and fast paced novel for me.  I was hooked from Chapter One  with the car chase scene...a fast-paced, hold on to your seat, wild ride  through the streets of DC.  When the cops caught up with the speed-demon he  menacingly replied...You can't touch me. My name is Geoffrey Shaffer and I  have diplomatic immunity because I'm a British Diplomat...oh what a  weasel!<br />Pop Goes The Weasel, protagonist, Alex Cross, detective with the  DC police department, is on a mission to find the weasel who is responsible  for a series of Jane Doe killings in Southeast DC but of course, trying to  prove that Shaffer is the killer will take on a number of plot twists and  turn to include Cross himself, Cross'family members and especially Cross'  fianc&eacute;e Christine.<br />I enjoyed reading how Pop Goes The Weasel storyline  developed around diplomatic immunity, the members of the Four Horsemen, the  kidnapping, Patsy Hampton, the trial, the weasel's family, the weasel's  doctor.  I liked Patterson's easy to read writing style; I liked that the  writing was graphic and vivid; I liked that the story had it's own chilling  suspense aspect and the chapter lengths while short were not a problem for  me.  The storyline captivated my interest most of the time; however, for me  the Weasel was a more intriguing character than Cross or his family.  The  villain had depth and was well developed; the villain's storyline was  interesting, and the villain kept me guessing as to what he was going to do  next.<br />Of course, the book also offered some disappointments/shortcomings  that need to be mentioned: --Christina's Kidnapping--This aspect of the  story was never fully developed.  After a year had passed she was barely  mentioned and one was left wondering whether she was dead or alive.  --The  Cross' kids--I never felt like I really knew these characters; maybe they  were fully explored in previous books however, very little was mentioned  regarding them in Pop Goes the Weasel.  For example, I had no idea as to  how old these kids were; I thought the son was older but then someone  eluded to the daughter being older. --The ending was totally unbelievable--  While fiction can be mindlessly diverting it doesn't have to be  farfetched.<br />Overall, I found Pop Goes The Weasel to be entertaining, fast  paced, exciting, a good read and a page turner from the standpoint of how  the story was going to conclude.  My appetite has been whet for other  Patterson books; I definitely plan to read other Patterson books especially  previous works such as Cat and Mouse and Jack and Jill.is family.

I purchased this book on a lark and I thought it would be a mindless, light, easy to read fluffy overview of the fashion/modeling industry.  Quite Honestly, what I got was so much more.  Read Between The Lies is an  intriguing story about the struggle, hard work, and determination of three  beautiful and ambitious women, each of whom has a secret to hide.  Characters include Gabrielle Donovan, an up&amp;coming model; Stephanie  Bancroft, Gabrielle's friend and an employee of Wilcot &amp; Associates  Publicity Agency; Felicia Wilcot, owner of Wilcot&amp;Associates.  As the  storyline progresses we are drawn into the plot as each woman tries to find  herself via unexpected and riveting plot twisters and turns. Woolridge does  a splendid job of interweaving the lives of the three women to create an  engrossing, intriguing, and entertaining tale.<br />Read Between The Lies is a  book with a message far deeper than the glamour of the fashion/modeling  arena; although a fictional novel Read Between The Lies addresses  contemporary issues in a realistic fashion and is captivating on so many  levels. Frequent-Written issues such as abandonment, adultery, envy,  coupled with a skillful blend of new topics such as African American  History, work relationships, race, ethnic references, social status and  class, give the book a contemporary sophistication and add substance to a  freshman novel.  Literary-a mundane issue-is addressed in such an  intriguing manner that it elevates the read while also adding depth to the  characters and the storyline.<br />I enjoyed this first time novel by Lori  Woolridge.  &quot;Read Between the Lies&quot; is an enjoyable read and had  everything that I look for in a good novel-compelling and cleverly written  storyline, excellent character development, refreshing writing style, and a  powerful message that kept me turning the pages long into the wee morning  hours.	2000-06-13

While Skin Deep initially starts off from Nina's perspective it  quickly becomes apparent that Skin Deep is just as much Ahmad's story.  Nina -a sista who was raised by AA parents but who looks white and as such  others perceive her as white until she sets them straight; Ahmad-the  handsome, intriguing and recently released ex-convict and struggling single  father who  won't give Nina the time of day...and she wants to know  why.<br />Chapter One starts off with the relationship of Nina and her fianc&eacute;e  Derrick...as such I thought this would be another one-dimensional  relationship story. However, Nina has a dream that keeps re-occurring and  it is soon revealed that one of the reasons she's with Derrick is because  she's afraid of what the nightmares might reveal if she doesn't wake up in  time ...and from that point I was hooked!  I needed to know what was this  sista hiding...what was she afraid of...why couldn't she sleep by herself...? How  Did Ahmad Fit Into Her Life?  What Secrets was He Hiding?

Damaged by Bernadette Connor was required reading for a book club; due to the subject matter, Damaged was not a book I would have picked up on my own...Afterall I thought how could someone take such a sensitive, depressing social issue and write it in a fictional manner and still keep the reader  interested? To my chagrin, Damaged was far from predictable or mundane. I  became so engrossed in this spellbinding, psychological thriller that I  couldn't do anything else until I finished the book; I read this book in  one setting because of the suspenseful subplots and the plot twisters.  The  writing was so vivid and lurid that you actually felt as thought you were  right there with the characters.<br />Bernadette Connor's debut novel,  Damaged, a page turner from Chapter One, does not allow the reader to  retreat or escape from the disturbing topic of child abuse.  With its  backdrop of drug abuse, surrogate families, prescribed medications,  unexpected happenings, Connor's dives head first into the heinous social  issues involving the well-being of our children.<br />Connor's novel pulls the  reader into the fragile and scarred existence of Adrena, who was  horrifically abused at the age of 10. Per the review from the back  cover  &quot;Adrena Reynolds is the teen-age survivor of years of child abuse,  culminating in a brutal rape that leaves her filled .................&quot;<br />Damaged was well-written, with a solid storyline and  subplots/plot twisters that test a gamut of emotions and leaves remarkable  memories.  Connor leaves the reader to ponder if Adrena's demons will  ultimately destroy her.<br /> &quot;Damaged was a riveting tale of love and  hate, tragedy and hope&quot;.	2000-06-08

Based on a recommendation of a friend, I recently read Casting The First Stone by Ms. Lawson-Roby which I really enjoyed.  As such, I thought I would go back and read Ms. Lawson-Roby's other books and started by reading  Here and Now.<br />Here and Now is a heartwarming/heart-tugging tale of the  lives of two women who are not only sisters but also good friends.  Ms.  Lawson-Roby takes us through the ups and downs of living for each sister,  Marcella--a single mom who's trying to raise two kids and Raquel--the  married sister who's trying very hard to conceive.  Predictably, each  sister finds it easier to see the blessings for the other sister and wish  that they could have a life(in some ways) more like the other.<br />Here and  Now was predictable in reference to Raquel's lives; while Ms. Lawson-Roby's  research was excellent and the details flawless, I've dealt with the real  life issue of infertility and Here and Now did not enlighten me. Along with  the infertility issue and the sub-plots which inevitably ended in  tragedies, Here and Now  was a very EMOTIONAL book. Since Here and Now was  the second book that I've read by Ms. Lawson-Roby, I've come to realize  that Ms. Lawson-Roby generally writes books that have messages or tackle  real life, serious social issues.<br />Unfortunately, Here and Now kept  tackling issues but didn't really bring any sunshine until the story was  almost over and as such the tragedies/downs of everyday living just became  a little overwhelming.  The novel's compelling turning points were at the  VERY end of the book and by then it felt like Ms. Lawson-Roby had run out  of steam but wanted to end on an upbeat note. I will continue to read Ms.  Lawson-Roby's novels, especially since I really enjoyed Casting The First  Stone; however, after reading Here and Now I will brace myself regarding  future books. ...Because if Here and Now were not fiction, I would have  been very depressed.	2000-06-03

Picking Up The Pieces was about friendship, growing up, the consequences/rewards of decisions and was centered around the lives of two sista friends-Senida and Maya. A girlfriend read this book and recommended  that I read it; Once I started reading page one I was hooked!  Talk about  ACTION-PACKED...I just couldn't believe what Senida-who was supposed to be  a successful, topnotch, up and coming attorney-- had gotten herself into  and continued to get herself into as the book progressed.  Of course, just  when I thought Picking Up The Pieces was becoming a little long, a little  slow, a little predicable ...GOSH did Sungee throw me for a curve ball and  WOW...was I not ready for it! Picking Up the Pieces is Sungee's first novel  and it was as hilarious as it was serious.  The sub-plots and characters  were engaging and the storyline was easy to follow.  If you're looking for  a book that starts off with a bang, I DEFINITELY recommend this book but I  must caution you that if this book were a movie it would probably be rated  RR due to the amount of slang, profanity and sexual scenes; and you might  be a little disappointed with the ending.  However, if you're looking for a  provocative and  entertaining book filled with plenty of DRAMA, DRAMA,  DRAMA AND MORE DRAMA, a book that will make you laugh(especially the  outrageous church scene) and  even think then...Pick Up This Book!	2000-06-03

Whoever said there's nothing like the love of a mother ...hadn't met Terry to get his perspective...that is a Father's Perspective.  The Shirt Off His Back is told from Terry the main character's perspective. Terry is a  single dad who's been raising twin daughters since his  ex-girlfriend/Catherine called him from the hospital to say &quot;come and  pick up the girls before I put them up for adoption&quot;.  Now some 10  years later, Catherine is back in town and she wants custody of the girls  and will fight dirty if necessary.  The Question is why does she want the  girls back after all of these years?<br />First-Novelist, Parry Brown did a  wonderful job in writing an engrossing novel, as well as a novel that was  refreshing and a change of pace...NO MALE BASHING HERE.  This Time,  Catherine, a female character was the villainess of the story and the  character that everyone loved to hate!  (I must say that when  &quot;Hurricane Catherine&quot;  came through...you knew there was the  potential for destruction to be close behind).<br />I must digress for a  minute and say that...I thought it was interesting(and sad) to read review  where folks found the characters unbelievable/unreal and someone even  suggested that Ms. Brown make future characters more ghettoish so that they  would have more appeal.<br />People, People, People, this is a New Millennium  and Black Folks like The Cosby Family do exist outside of the television  box.  There are some AA who are making well over six figures, driving  luxury cars, vacationing in Europe, who only associate with folks on their  socioeconomic level and who don't want any thing to do with the ghetto.  Not because they're &quot;uppity&quot; but because they just have no roots  there.  Just because we're all the same race doesn't mean that all folks of  color like the same things.  While everyone doesn't have the material  successes of Terry/Jackie/Roland/Mercedes/Catherine/Mama C there are a  number of Folks of Color Who Do.  Okay,The Twins might have been a little  unreal..LOL... because I don't know any kids who behaved as well those  girls; but given that this was a book of fiction that was okay as well.<br />Additionally, I enjoyed reading a book where males were shown in a  positive light, everyone had a legitimate job, the kids weren't in trouble  with the law and even Mama C had it going on as a real estate mogul.<br />However, I would be remiss if I didn't question....(1)What's up with all  the brand-names?  All folks of color are not into brand names and as such  the name dropping got in the way at times; and(2) Given that Mama C had  made it as a real estate mogul what was up with the hard to understand-hard  to read-broken English that came out of her mouth....LOL.

After hearing and reading all of the reviews of a &quot;must read&quot; book, I sat down on a rainy day and did just that.  I like a good literary masterpiece as well as the next person, however, I must admit that  sometimes I read books just because I need to escape the realism of  day-to-day living and I don't want to think too hard regarding the book  that I'm reading.  Having said that,  I must admit that while The  Maintenance Man(TMM) was not a masterpiece, it was entertaining,  captivating, fast paced, easy to read and as such I was able to read in one  sitting.  I liked the storyline-hey this gigolo had it going on and there  were some erotic scenes included in the book-and as such it held my  attention to the end of the book; the book was drama, drama, and more  drama...also liked the subplots and that all kinds of characters were  included.<br />This book fell short of five stars due to the following:  Â·  Writing Skills---self published or not, grammatical/typographical errors  are a pet peeve in any book. Â· Character Development---More Character  Development Was Necessary; There were opportunities to expand upon  Malcolm's character, especially his prior background.  Â· Writing  Style--Disappointed by the abrupt ending; I was also disappointed that  there was no closure to the story of Ariel and Chris.<br />Overall, MM isn't  for everyone.  If you're looking for a quick, easy read and a story that  allows you to fantasize/escape the mundane daily living and that doesn't  necessarily have a message then read MM ....just for the fun of it and  don't worry about the bad reviews!<br />Remember this book is FICTIONAL and  NOT EVERY BOOK HAS TO HAVE A MESSAGE IN ORDER TO BE A GOOD BOOK!	2000-05-31

Preconceived Notions is the story of a young lady by the name of Imagany who comes of age and blossoms from a child to a young adult. It's Imagany's story and tells of her running from a bad childhood to Fisk University  where she meets and dates an older gentleman by the name of Anthony until  younger, college enrollee Elliott comes along and sweeps her off her feet.  However, before she can truly become involved with Elliott she must deal  with the demons of her past including her parents and former lover Anthony.  In the meantime, Imagany's younger sister Zarbree is lurking in the  background and crying out for help but Imagany is too involved with her own  life to realize that her sister is seeking help.  Where Were the Parents...  as it shouldn't have been Imagany's job to protect her sister but rather  her parents.<br />Preconceived Notions was good and the writing was skilled,  however, the storyline left me with a lot of mixed emotions.  I was  troubled that given everything that happened to Imagany that she could move  on without scars from one relationship to another; I was also disturbed  that abuse was detailed in-depth but never really addressed via  professional assistance. For me, Preconceived Notions  was 100 pages too  long.  I didn't realize until I read other reviews that this was supposed  to be a romance novel.  In fact, the long excerpts on Imagany's and  Elliott's relationship/romance got in the way at times and I skipped over  those parts to see what would happen with Leslie &amp; Anthony, what was  going on with younger sister Zarbree and to see if Imagany's parents would  be ever be explained.  I never really understood the parents and don't  think they were well developed.<br />Preconceived Notions a story about  romance, abuse, family dynamics and friendship was a major undertaking for  any novel and for me it was hard to focus on the romantic side without  being overwhelmed by the abusive situations.  While the storyline was  good...I just felt that the book moved in too many directions and as such  it left me with mixed emotions.<br />Preconceived Notions was a good  first-attempt novel and I look forward to other books from Ms. Williams.ust felt that the book moved in too many directions and as such  it left me with mixed emotions.  <br />Preconceived Notions was a good  first-attempt novel and I look forward to other books from Ms. Williams.	2000-05-31

The story is told from Toni's viewpoint.  Toni is the oldest of four children,  and as the eldest she feels responsible not only for her six-year daughter,  but the going ons of her siblings and parents as well.  Sheer Necessity  exhibited balanced relationships/situations  and showed both sides of the  AA family-the bad as well as the good.  I especially enjoyed and welcomed a  book that tackled the positive side of the AA family and what we're willing  to do for the ones we love; Sheer Necessity also showed the love of a  husband and wife together over 40 years and the sacrifices they made to  keep their family together.<br />Ms. Mitchell has definitely grown as a writer  and I was pleasantly surprised by the improved writing skills/style versus  her first book. Sheer Necessity was well-written, (most of)the characters  were well developed, the dialogue was crafty and the storyline was  realistic and believable. I enjoyed the sub-plots and how they were  smoothly interjected and interweaved through the fabric of the main  character's story. My only disappointment was that the younger brother was  not more developed; I keep wondering why was he included as I did not find  him necessary to the story's plot. Overall, Sheer Necessity was a welcomed  change of pace/genre, represented a Good Portrayal of A Black Family in the  New Millennium and a great second novel attempt by an up &amp; coming new  author.	2000-05-31

His sister, Shreese is carrying on in a scandalous love affair and  his mom is back on the scene for his wedding and to rekindle the fire with  her husband and a mother-dear relationship with her now grown children.  Of  course, we can't forget Gregory's male cronies who bring a new meaning to  the word dysfunctional or Adrian his fiancee who &quot;has more skeletons  in her closet than a haunted house.&quot;<br />I enjoyed When All Hell Breaks  Loose and Believe that as Ms. Spencer matures/grows as a writer  so will  her writing skills; HOWEVER, as a first time writer she's included all the  elements which make a book entertaining....crafty/vivid scenes, witty  dialogue, interesting characters... and managed to tell a predictable plot  in a humorous manner.  Additionally, Ms. Spencer was able to tell the story  from a male perspective and add sub-plots that smoothly fit into the  storyline.<br />I agree that Ms. Spencer writing reaches folks who probably  wouldn't think of picking up a book for pleasure; however, When All Hell  Breaks Loose even had some of the 40-something, love to read crowd  LOLROTF(laughing out loud rolling on the floor)....and that suits me just  fine.<br />If You Want To Forget About the Responsibilities of Today and Don't  Take Yourself Too Serious Then Check Out Ms. Spencers book.	2000-05-31

I read it in one setting over a year ago and have been recommending it to all of my friends--young and old. Please, Please,  Please is the story of the ULTIMATE BAD GIRL, Babysister. Babysister is a  20-something sista' who's all about self...self-centered, self  gratification, self-absorbed, self determination, lack of self control,  self-absorbed, selfish and who's a character that would make you want to  slap her silly if only you thought it would help; but you know it won't.  Babysister is so bad, and her escapades are so out-of-the box that you find  yourself going &quot;should I kick her butt or laugh&quot;...and in reading  the book you will experience both feelings. As the storyline goes... Seems  that Babysister was spoiled by her dad at an early age; of course, because  Dad spent so much time, love and money on Babysister that did not  ingratiate her with her older brother Malcolm; not that Babysister seemed  to mind. Since Babysister was used to getting her way and everything she  wanted or desired as a child, she assumed that life would continue that way  indefinitely and didn't even think about changing as an adult. Afterall,  who said that Darren, her best friend Deborah's boyfriend was off  limits...especially when she wanted him. Of course, Devious Darren was  tempted and wondered if he could tangle with both Babysister and Her  Friend/His Girlfriend Deborah.  Afterall, there was just something about  Babysister that he had to have...but the question was could he hook up with  Babysister without hurting Deborah? So What if he did? If Deborah was  unfortunate to get hurt in the meantime so be it.. because she was so naive  that she would take him back no matter what...or would she?<br />As I  mentioned earlier, I read this book almost a year ago. However, as I sit  writing this review and remembering details of Babysister's antics it's as  though I only read this book yesterday. The storyline was exciting and  memorable, the dialogue was witty and the characters had depth. The main  characters were familiar and easy to understand as well as the supporting  characters including Babysister's dad, girlfriend Lisette, brother Malcolm  and especially Sharice--Malcolm's Afrocentric girlfriend. The book is RAW  in that it doesn't present the most positive aspects of the AA community or  relationships and a few brothers were upset because of the male bashing;  however, I do not believe that Ms. Swindle's intent was to write a  historical piece or even a social commentary on the AA community but rather  to provide a FICTIONAL NOVEL which offered a change of pace, and was  lighthearted, entertaining, hilarious, (somewhat)controversial and a novel  that would have folks reading and talking about it for months(years) to  come.

We got the Black Family, The Black Church, The Black First Lady, and The Prominent Black Minister and Now Can I Get An Amen! Casting The First Stone is a story about comtemporary issues that affect the family and the church  today and portrays a realistic as well as and behind the scene view of the  church.   Tanya Black, the wife and First Lady of the story, is torn  between keeping her family together or moving on and severing the ties to  her husband, the minister Curtis Black.  It seems the good Rev. Black has  had a few too many dalliances and he seems to be changing from a loving  husband to someone Tanya used to know.  In fact, Rev. Black has become so  enthralled with himself, lust, power, greed and wealth that he appears to  have forgotten why he became a minister in the first place. Casting The  First Stone was wonderfully written and the storyline/plot depicted the ups  and downs many couples face when one partner decides to seek there own  agenda and does not consider the needs/feelings of the rest of the family.  Ms. Roby did a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life in the  minds of readers.  She included characters that were relatable and ones you  could easily identify with.  Situations were included which tested all of  your emotions and made you cry, laugh, seek revenge, and get upset but also  made you keep turning the pages to find out the ultimate outcome. My only  disappointment with Casting The First Stone, was that Ms. Roby did not  explain Rev. Curtis Black more.  I wanted to know more about what made him  tick and why he did some of the things he did.  However, I also realize  that in real life there a number of Curtis Blacks who act the same way.  No  Ryhthm or Reason but Just Because. Casting The First Stone is a books which  shows that all of us have flaws and faults and none of us are exempt.  And  sometimes even the best of us fall to temptation(The First Lady--Tanya  included); however there are always consequences or rewardsassociated with  what ever decisions we decide to make.	2000-05-23

Casting The First Stone is a story about comtemporary issues that affect the family and the church  today and portrays a realistic as well as behind the scene view of the  church.  Tanya Black, the wife and First Lady of the story, is torn  between keeping her family together or moving on and severing the ties to  her husband, the minister Curtis Black.  It seems the good Rev. Black has  had a few too many dalliances and he seems to be changing from a loving  husband to someone Tanya used to know.  In fact, Rev. Black has become so  enthralled with himself, lust, power, greed and wealth that he appears to  have forgotten why he became a minister in the first place. Casting The  First Stone was wonderfully written and the storyline/plot depicted the ups  and downs many couples face when one partner decides to seek there own  agenda and does not consider the needs/feelings of the rest of the family.  Ms. Roby did a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life in the  minds of readers.  She included characters that were relatable and ones you  could easily identify with.  Situations were included which tested all of  your emotions and made you cry, laugh, seek revenge, and get upset but also  made you keep turning the pages to find out the ultimate outcome. My only  disappointment with Casting The First Stone, was that Ms. Roby did not  explain Rev. Curtis Black more.  I wanted to know more about what made him  tick and why he did some of the things he did.  However, I also realize  that in real life there a number of Curtis Blacks who act the same way.  No  Ryhthm or Reason but Just Because. Casting The First Stone is a books which  shows that all of us have flaws and faults and none of us are exempt.  And  sometimes even the best of us fall to temptation(The First Lady--Tanya  included); however there are always consequences or rewards associated with  what ever decisions we decide to make.  With Faith and Committment, We Can  Turn Around Any Situations And Start Anew.ociated with  what ever decisions we decide to make.

Something Extra by first time novelist Patty Rice is well-written, and OUTSTANDING! The story unfolds when David enters Genie Gathlin's life and the Gathlin theory is tested and fails; Genie does the unthinkable she  falls in love.  The Gathlin theory says that you date only married men and  you use them and leave them.  Unfortunately, David was a much married man,  facing mid-life crisis and his own insecurities that he brought along  baggage that even Genie couldn't surmise. As I became engrossed in the  story I wondered how a young woman of only 25 could be so cynical about  relationships! The storyline was well developed and as the story unfolds we  learn about the tragedys and demons of Genie's past that contribute to the  person she is today, why she does what she does, and in doing so we gain a  better understanding and experience empathy regarding Genies actions. As  for David, while I didn't admire him I gained a better appreciation of why  someone in his position would make the choices he made...he was just  insecure. I liked Ms. Rice's style and how she was able to pull the  storyline together while interweaving sub-plots and other characters.  I  especially liked how characters were forced to look deep within themselves  to overcome the demons of the past and move on in a more positive  direction. Something Extra is yet another book about relationship woes,  however, Ms. Rice was able to present the subject matter in an unique,  provocative and humorous fashion. The  Plot Line isn't different but the  manner in which the story is told and unfolds is.<br />As stated in the book  review &quot;Somethin' Extra is a smashing debut novel that is sure to  establish Patty Rice among the ranks of today's best-selling fiction  authors. &quot;	2000-05-23

The story's main characters are Vance &amp; Artise and Ethan &amp; Tasha.  Vance is the brother who seriously loves Artise but he has a slight problem  with a wandering eye, and ended up in one two many affairs and got caught.  Artise is the sister who stands by her man(Vance) and doesn't pass judgment  because she knows the man upstairs will deal with Vance.  Ethan is Vance's  best friend who has commitment-phobia and after jilting his former  girlfriend(Tasha) he now only dates WWK(women with kids) because he doesn't  have to worry about falling in love with them. Tasha was Ethan's former  girlfriend who moved on to a older man who she thought could provide her  the love she needed.<br />I must admit that it took me a while to get into the  storyline because it appeared to be so predictable...just another  problematic relationship tale.  However, was I ever in for a pleasant  surprise as Mr. White was able to bring the story to life with a few smooth  twists and adventures that included an unplanned pregnancy, political  corruption, a very tragic and emotional incidence and some strange  eroticism...all which kept you rapidly turning the pages to find out what  was going to happen next.<br />Although preachy at times, I liked that Mr.  White wanted to leave us with a positive outlook on black love and  relationships.  I especially liked the Stubbefields, an elderly AA couple  who had been married over 60 years and who still shared a romantic  relationship based on love, respect, compassion and passion!  I also liked  that Mr. White dealt with other relationships such as the mother-daughter  relationship between Artise and her mom; the surrogate father/son  relationship between Vance and the Stubbefields; the best friend/sister  friend relationship with Artise and Tasha; and the surrogate  mother/daughter relationship with Artise and Melba.<br />Cup of Love is a book  about love, passion, understanding, forgiveness, and redemption and leaves  you feeling good and believing that Love can conquer a multitude of sins.erstanding, forgiveness, and redemption and leaves  you feeling good and believing that Love can conquer a multitude of sins.	2000-05-22

All of Me is the story's heroine--Serpentine's Life Story.  It's the story of a sister who appears to have it all a great job, beautiful home, sexy boyfriend, and loving family.  However, Serpentine has struggled with a  weight problem all of her life and she's tried almost every conceivable  diet in an attempt to lose weight.  But then the societal lables and  stereotypes associated with being overweight start to burden Serpentine and  negatively impact how she views and feels about herself.  When all hope is  gone, Serpentine does the impossible and resorts to an attempted suicide.  After a bout in the hospital and numerous counseling sessions with a  doctor--who appears to be all wrong to counsel her--Serpentine is back in  the world and coming to grips with the fact that it's ultimately up to her  to make her own happiness and to either accept herself as she is or to make  the changes necessary for her to move forward.<br />I liked Ms. Berry's  writing style because it was descriptive without being over-written.  The  opening caught and held my attention because I wanted to find out more  about why someone would become so depressed regarding their weight that  they would consider suicide.  True the story appeared one-dimensional in  that it focused primarily on Serpentine's weight and the baggage that she  carried as a result of her weight, however, substance and depth was added  to the storyling via memorable, unique and entertaining friends and family  members.  Yes, Ms. Berry appears to have taken an attempted suicide  lightly, and the high school reunion incident seemed childish, but they  were all believable.  These incidents were apart of Serpentine's character  and were real from her perspective.<br />All of Me Is Definitely Not For  Everyone; however, it is a heartwarming, witty and inspiring story for  anyone who's ever had a weight problem(even a slight one) or struggles with  weight and it's impact on one's perception.  The only disappointment I had  with the book was that Serpentine did not appear to have found true  self-love because she was still seeking the diet of the day.<br />All Of Me  represented a welcomed change of pace from the problematic,  romance/relationship novels typical of many aa fiction genres today.  If  you would like a plot with a different focus/concentration then check out  All of Me.ad  with the book was that Serpentine did not appear to have found true  self-love because she was still seeking the diet of the day.  <br />All Of Me  represented a welcomed change of pace from the problematic,  romance/relationship novels typical of many aa fiction genres today.

Sweet St. Louis was about Four Central Characters in the game of love and romance.  Anthony(Ant) Poole, was a young and bored auto mechanic, who stumbled upon Sharron Francis, an ordinary girl from Memphis, Tennesee, who  worked at an ordinary job at the St. Louis Interrnational Airport and  Sharron was in search of a serious relationship with the right brother.  Complimenting Sharron and Ant were their good friends Anthony who just  couldn't grow up and Celena the over cynical, over protective, extremely  negative roommate from hell. The book was filled with typical situations  such as Ant getting with another young lady Diane for a &quot;booty  call&quot; and Ant/Tony ending up on the wrong side of the law.  The  storyline/plot was not only slow and boring but was definitely predictable  and one that someone who hadn't read the book could finish for you.  Mr.  Tyree tried to add depth by including secondary characters such as  Sharrons's dad, Ant's mom, Ant's boss Paul, and one of Sharron's  co-workers(a child with a whole bunch of drama going on).  However, the  four main characters were so stereotypical and there wasn't enough  substance to the secondarey characters to balance the main characters.  Maybe my expectations were too high; however, I found the main characters  to be very immature and unlike anyone I know today or even knew 20 years  ago.  The story was over-written and probably 200 pages too long as the  speech was repetitive and redundant.  I wish I Had Something Different To  Say and Something That Had Not Already been said however, Sweet St. Louis  just left a sour taste for me. The only reason I felt compelled to finish  reading Sweet St. Louis was because I wanted to give him the benefit of the  doubt and I kept hoping that the book would get better. I had heard so many  good things about Mr. Tyree's books and thought I would enjoy reading them  since many had compared him to the likes of EL Harris, Eric Jerome Dickey  and Mike Baisden.  Unfortunately, Sweet St. Louis was void of substance and  shallow.  Mr. Tyree, I know that you are a well respected author, however,  if you want to keep this reader coming back and perceiving your novels as  page turners you will have to spend more time developing the storyline  beyond the ghetto-mentality they seem to possess.  I read fiction to escape  not to be reminded of headline news.  Sweet St. Louis appeared to lack  effort to be interesting....maybe a little more time between books would  help. However, since I have Single Mom, I will read that and give Mr. Tyree  one more chance before I write him off because everyone deserves a second  chance.rtunately, Sweet St. Louis was void of substance and  shallow.

Warm Hands was the first book that I've read by Margaret Johnson-Hodge and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  Her storytelling was poetic, yet easy to read and comprehend.  Initially, I thought Warm Hands  was just another typical AA relationship book.  True enough, Warm Hands  does include some of the same characters...you know them: Vincent--Mya's  committment phobia boyfriend; Mya's Dad--who has chased everything in a  skirt and cheated on Mya's long-suffering Mom;<br />Mark--Mya's brother who  doesn't know the meaning of love.  In fact, &quot;Love wasn't a part of his  vocabulary, life, plans or manhood he liked the mother of his son but  seriously hooking up with her was out of the question&quot;; Uncle  Brother--Mya's uncle who left his wife of 42 years for a younger women by  the name of Kay-Kay was was 20 and also pregnant by Uncle Brother; and then  comes along Jeff who's everything a black man should be and the man that  Mya's ready to marry until Vincent comes back on the scene.  Mya mistakenly  accepts Vincent's amourous behavior as love and confesses to Jeff and calls  off the wedding.  After leaving Jeff for Vincent, and coming to the sad  realization that Vincent was only on a &quot;bootie call&quot; and not  looking for a long-term commitment, Mya steps back and starts some much  needed soul searching and mind cleansing.  What we're left with is a  stronger, more independent, self assertive Mya. The primary message of Warm  Hands is that while every female wants to be loved by a man, in order to  give love and be loved, a woman must first love herself and once she does  that she's fine with the direction that her life might take and more  accepting of others. Warm Hands offers a welcomed and fresh perspective vs.  the current genre of problematic relationship books that are available;  check it out and be pleasantly surprised at what you might just discover  regarding yourself!	2000-05-17

In  fact, the excerpt chapter I read didn't do enough justice for the entire  book.  The book was so captivating that I stayed up late reading the book  and took it to work to read the next day during my breaks and lunch hour.  I finished the book in  four hours.
