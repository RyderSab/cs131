He wrote the following in \\"The River War,\\" memoirs on the campaign to avenge the murder of Gordon, retake the Sudan, and finish off the Khalifa, the Mahdi's successor.<br /><br />\\"The long and glorious defense of the town of Khartoum will always fascinate attention. That one man, a European among Africans, a Christian among Mohammedans, should by his genius have inspired the efforts of 7,000 soldiers of inferior race, and by his courage have sustained the hearts of 30,000 inhabitants of notorious timidity ... is an event perhaps without parallel in history. It may safely be predicted that no one will ever write an account that will compare in interest or in detail with that set forth by the man himself in the famous \\"Journals at Khartoum.\\" The brief account has delighted thousands of readers in Europe and America. Before the first of six parts into which the Journals were divided is finished, the reader has been won. Henceforth he sees the world through Gordon's eyes. With him he scoffs at dilpomats, despises the Government...<br /><br />The last words of Gordon's journal -- 'Now mark this, if the Expeditionary Force -- and I ask for no more than two hundred men -- does not come within ten days, the town may fall; and I have done my best for the honor of our country. Good-bye.'<br /><br />Henceforth Gordon's perils were unrecorded.\\"<br /><br />Not quite. Rudolph Slatin the Austrian officer appointed Governor of Darfur and who converted to Islam to motivate his troops before finally surrendering to become the prisoner of the Mahdi, the man whom the religious Gordon could not forgive for denying his God, survived to write his own memoirs, \\"Fire and Sword in the Sudan,\\" in which he decribes how the severed head of Gordon was brought to Slatin before being taken as prize to the Mahdi.<br /><br />From the time I first learned of General Gordon's famous stand to the death, I wondered why he did not choose the blow up the palace, himself inside, rather to submit to the fanatic Mahdi, who had the nasty habit of forcing his foreign captives to convert to Islam, something unthinkable for Gordon. [Greek nuns in the Mahdi's hands converted and even married priests to avoid sexual violation. The Pope would throw fits, remarked Gordon.] In his journals Gordon writes that he did consider blowing himself up with his close servants as a way to avoid what he was convinced would be a long period of captivity and abuse. He decided to stand his ground because the other option smacked of suicide, which does no one any good, and because that \\"might be seen as trying to take my fate out of God's hands.\\" Thankfully his death was immediate, not what he had anticipated. Remarkable thoughts which demonstrate the greatness of the man.<br /><br />This review from the 1885 London first edition, available at reasonable price today.stand to the death, I wondered why he did not choose the blow up the palace, himself inside, rather to submit to the fanatic Mahdi, who had the nasty habit of forcing his foreign captives to convert to Islam, something unthinkable for Gordon.

Beware the well-intentioned mistakes of our ancestors. The following is from \\"The River War,\\" Churchill's first hand account of the military campaign to \\"retake\\" the Sudan from Islamic extremists --<br /><br />What enterprise that an enlightened community may attempt is more noble and more profitable than the reclamation from barbarism of fertile regions and large populations? To give peace to warring tribes, to administer justice where all was violence, to strike the chains off the slave, to draw the richness from the soil, to plant the earliest seeds of commerce and learning, to increase in whole peoples their capacities for pleasure and diminish their chances of pain --- what more beautiful ideal or more valuable reward can inspire human effort? The act is virtuous, the exercise invigorating, and the result often extremely profitable. Yet as the mind turns from the wonderful cloudland of aspiration to the ugly scaffolding of attempt and achievement, a succession of opposite ideas arise. Industrious races are displayed stinted and starved for the sake of an expensive Imperialism that they can only enjoy if they are well fed. Wild peoples, ignorant of their barbarism, callous of suffering, careless of life but tenacious of liberty, are seen to resist with fury the philanthropic invaders, and to perish in thousands before they are convinced of their mistake. The inevitable gap between conquest and dominion becomes filled with the figures of the greedy trader, the inopportune missionary, the ambitious soldier, the lying speculator, who disquiet the minds of the conquered and excite the sordid appetites of the conquerors.  And as the eye of thought rests on these sinister features, it hardly seems possible for us to believe that any fair prospect is approached by so foul a path.e the sordid appetites of the conquerors.

As we now see frightening signs of such faith-based extremism in its early forms beginning to take hold in the United States and we watch Europe engulfed in a clash of civilizations, it is in the interest of every world citizen to understand the phenomenon for what it is. Since September 2001 I have noticed more than the usual level of abuse of the phrases, \\"By God\\" and \\"Wallah.\\" It seems we are convinced whatever fleeting thought passes through our heads is a lightning bolt sent from upon high.<br /><br />Sir Winston Churchill understood fanaticism. The following is from his book \\"The River Wars\\":<br /><br />\\"Few facts are so encouraging to the student of human development as the desire, which most men and all communities manifest at all times, to associate with their actions at least the appearance of moral right. However distorted may be their conceptions of virtue, however feeble their efforts to attain even to their own ideals, it is a pleasing feature and hopeful augury that they should wish to be justified. The sufferings of a people or class may be intolerable, but before they take up arms and risk their lives some unselfish and impersonal spirit must animate them. In countries where there is education and mental activity or refinement, this high motive is found in the pride of glorious traditions or in a keen sympathy with surrounding misery. Ignorance deprives savage nations of such incentives. Yet in the marvelous economy of nature this very ignorance is a source of greater strength. It affords them the mighty stimulus of fanaticism. ... It [fanaticism] gives men something which they think is sublime to fight for, and this serves them as an excuse for wars which it is desirable to begin for totally different reasons. Fanaticism is not a cause of war. It is the means that helps savage peoples to fight. It is the spirit that enables them to combine -- the great common object before which all personal or tribal disputes become insignificant. What the horn is to the rhinoceros, what the sting is to the wasp, the Mohammedan faith was to the Arabs of the Sudan -- a faculty of offence or defense. It was all this and no more ... Those whose practice it is to regard their own nation as possessing a monopoly of virtue and common-sense, are wont to ascribe every military enterprise of savage peoples to fanaticism. They calmly ignore obvious and legitimate motives. The most rational conduct is considered mad. It is, perhaps, an historical fact that the revolt of a large population has never been caused solely or even mainly by religious enthusiasm.\\"<br /><br />So it is that men like Churchill can become great statesmen. They understand the tools by which populations are manipulated. The next time someone makes a pitch to you about your \\"desire to belong to something greater than yourself,\\" at least recognize the tool at work when you don your uniform, reach for your wallet, or offer up your sons and daughters as cannon fodder to ingrates on both sides of the gulf.ine -- the great common object before which all personal or tribal disputes become insignificant.

The battles at the Faid Pass, Kasserine Pass, El Guettar, and Cassino and Anzio, and on to the Po Valley no doubt inspired many other boys to military service. Harry Yeide's outstanding research and his skills as a writer mean more to us than he probably realizes. The author notes a 1943 report to General Omar Bradley that the men of A/701st TD \\"stuck it out to the bitter end and were utterly fearless\\" in their first combat action in North Africa, where they lost 7 killed, six captured, and 42 missing in action. My copy has a place of honor next to the treasured folded flag, the telegram which notified Dad's mother of wounds received at Anzio on 17 March 1944, and the Purple Heart I so naively played with as a boy, not realizing that with a slightly different arc of a single piece of shrapnel, I would never have been born.<br /><br />Sir Winston Churchill wrote after his campaign in the Sudan, \\"Those who read the story, and still more those who share the dangers, of a campaign feel that every incident is surrounded with a host of possibilities, any one of which, had it become real, would have changed the whole course of events ... We live in a world of ifs. What happened is singular; what might have happened, legion.\\" The Tank Destroyers all learned that lesson well.	2005-08-29

After reading \\"Arabian Sands\\" a few days ago, I felt I had to learn more of his life. \\"The Life of My Choice\\" has many parallels to \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\" and was so captivating that I had to read it in one sitting. T.E. Lawrence noted that \\"self-knowledge unfitted me for leadership.\\" Thesiger puts that same sharp sword of introspection to his life. His observations on Lieutenant Colonel Orde Wingate and his thoughts on T.E. Lawrence are among the highlights of this book, as are his thoughts on Islam and Christianity.<br /><br />A son of privilege, son of the Minister of the British Legation in Addis Ababa, the author fell in love with the people of the wilderness, and always found his heroes and soul mates among the harshest tribes in the most forbidding territories. He acknowledges that some of his big game hunting exploits don't go over well 50 years afterwards, but takes care to explain the realities of the situation. He obviously has a strong feeling for the underdog in any fight, not something to be taken for granted in a highly decorated battlefield veteran.<br /><br />Thesiger's detailed account of the League of Nations standing by and watching the Italians brazenly use mustard gas on tens of thousands of Ethiopian soldiers and civilians reminds us of our own cowardice during more recent crimes against humanity.<br /><br />In this age when we are in such great need of heroic figures, I have no knowledge of a single leader of Wilfred Thesiger's caliber alive among us. Then again, Thesiger insisted on not living inside his own society, not seeking to be known by anyone other than himself. No doubt he must serve as the model for more than a few yet to be discovered British and American heroes now posted in remote and dangerous places.<br /><br />Surely one lesson to be taken from Mr. Thesiger's life is that we should live the lives our souls demand of us, consequences be damned. Mr. Thesiger realized as a young man that his path was a lonely one.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Fire and the Sword in the Sudan\\" by Colonels Rudolph Slatin and F.R. Wingate to any reader of Wilfred Thesiger. Slatin was held prisoner for 12 years in the Sudan during the 1880s and early 1890s.path was a lonely one.

The author is a man in the fine tradition of T.E. Lawrence, a man who resigned from the British Political Service in the Sudan to rejoin the service as a contract officer not eligible for pension on the understanding that he would only be asked to serve in the wilderness. He served in the S.A.S. in the Western Desert, but makes only one oblique mention of that mission in this text. See Thesiger's autobiography \\"The Life of My Choice\\" for the broader picture of this unique life.<br /><br />Wilfred Thesiger writes, \\"I went there with a belief in my own racial superiority, but in their tents I felt like an uncouth, inarticulate barbarian, an intruder from a shoddy and materialistic world.\\" I wonder how many men among us today would agree with Thesiger's deep belief that \\"even today there are experiences that do not need to be justified in terms of material profit.\\"<br /><br />One passage, if even remotely true, bodes ill for our crusade to spread democracy. \\"Arabs rule, but do not administer. Their government is intensely individualistic, and is successful or unsuccessful according to the degree of fear and respect which the ruler commands ... Focused on an individual life, their government is impermanent and liable to end in chaos at any moment ... To these tribesmen security can be bought too dearly by loss of individual freedom ... Here the evil that comes with sudden change far outweighs the good.\\"<br /><br />Wilfred Thesiger closes by writing that leaving the remote Bedu world with which he was obsessed, The Empty Quarter, was to him an exile. It was in the stimulating harshness of an empty land that he found satisfaction. When he began to lose courage in an \\"intolerable\\" state of thirst, hunger, and fear for his life, he asked himself, \\"Is there really anywhere else I would rather be?\\"<br /><br />I have met one solitary Beduwi in my life, a man imprisoned, caught up in a great tragedy. I regret that I had not read Arabian Sands before that meeting. Not that I could have helped, but I would have understood that in his eyes I was a more pitiful creature than he, \\"for he was Bedu and Muslim, and I was neither.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Fire and Sword in the Sudan\\" to anyone interested in anything Wilfred Thesiger has written.

After reading this work detailing the 1870s [mis]adventures of the legendary Charles M. Doughty, one comes to understand much better why T.E.Lawrence so admired the Bedu and mistrusted the Arab city dweller. Doughty's \\"travels\\" really amounted to being \\"driven\\" through hostile lands occupied by \\"fanatics,\\" continuously handed off from one group of outlaws and thieves to another.  \\"I found in them an implacable fanaticism,\\" wrote Doughty. \\"All their life is passed in fraud and deceipt.\\" Sacred oaths, swearing in the name of God out of mere habit, traditional mores of protecting the fellow-traveller in one's charge honored mostly in the breach. One friendly Arab acquaintance along the tortured path tells Doughty, \\"I hope that your life may be preserved: but they will not suffer you to dwell amongst them! You will be driven from place to place. As many among them as have travelled, are liberal; but the rest, no.\\" Abdullah el-Kenneyny advised Doughty, \\"I am even now in amazement! that in such a country, you openly avow yourself to be an Englishman; but how may you pass even one day in safety. You have lived hitherto with the Bedu; but it is otherwise in the townships.\\"<br /><br />Early on, the strange language seemed humorous and distracting, but it soon grows on you. \\"Give me a hand\\" becomes \\"Lend me a grip of thy five.\\" Robbed, stripped, insulted, the intrepid Doughty gives the evil-doers the back of his hand as often as he dared, many times with his hand on a revolver hidden under his robes. One bluff carried off successfully against fellow travellers, who were sworn, of course, to defend him -- \\"By the life of Him who created us, in what instant you show me a gun's mouth, I will lay dead your carcasses upon this earth.\\"<br /><br />Occasionally some paragraph seems to be the obvious inspiration for a like passage in Lawrence's \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\\" an exquisitely detailed description of how a camel comes to a halt and lies down being one of the most obvious examples.<br /><br />A major feature of this work is the great care taken by the author to use and then explain the Arabic vocabulary for places and things unique to the Arab culture. Each and every page is peppered with these terms. There is a fine glossary, praise God, the Merciful One!<br /><br />The first half of this collection of selected passages from the massive original work will give readers warm feelings for the Bedouin and sweet dreams of wandering amongst them at peace with God and nature. The second half will likely wipe out any such urge. Civilizations still clash, 130 years later. Extremists rear their ugly heads on both sides of a vast chasm.

Erik Saar's book is a very breezy, informative read, and seems to me to accurately reflect the duties, skill levels and personal attitudes of military linguists and interrogators and the atmosphere of two American prison facilities I have seen.<br /><br />The scenarios in the prologue brought many smiles to this reader, a former Army and Air Force linguist trained 30 years earlier than Saar. I had to chuckle when reading the reader reviews critical of Saar's Arabic language skills. An incredibly difficult language, much harder than the languages of Southeast Asia which fell to me and my generation. Saar tells us in his book that he had his fair share of trouble during language training. Who did not? I've had very brief and disappointing experiences inside one of our prisons in Iraq and another in Afghanistan, and never once saw an American who could interrogate at a professional level in Arabic or Pashto, not one. There must be a few out there, but they are rare creatures. We are doing the best we can in a war for which we were almost totally unprepared. I'm hoping that one of the brilliant Titan ethnic Iraqi or Afghan naturalized American citizens who carry the heavy interpreter burden will write his own memoirs about the trials and tribulations of assisting in these interrogations. These interpreters and native speakers have stories that will knock your socks off when compared to those told by young interrogators. The contract interpreters hold the true key insights into our by now well-recognized failures in the war on terror, and our failure to investigate their reactions disappoints me deeply. Saar does mention these contract linguists, and clearly has learned much from his association with them.<br /><br />I see nothing in Saar's story that rings untrue. The spotless reputation of the FBI in regard to prisoner handling and enlightened interrogation strategies is still intact, and I would hope that any American who reads the internal FBI complaints which came out of Guantanamo has come to accept by now that our efforts have fallen short of the mark. [They always do fall short in many ways; perhaps that is easier for us older and more jaded veterans to recognize and admit.]<br /><br />The appendix of \\"Inside the Wire\\" is a good collection of key policy documents which help us understand some of the origins of this debacle.<br /><br />Erik Saar leaves me with the impression that he is a fine young man with a good heart, naive in the best and most traditional American way, expecting our actions in an ugly environment to match our declared American ideals and way of life. Sad to say, wars are not humane endeavors, precisely why we should undertake them only as last resort, so as not to bring ourselves down to our enemies' level. My personal feelings are that we would serve the long term goals of the United States much more effectively by treating these prisons as political reorientation facilities, viewing any information obtained as secondary to our primary goal of demonstrating by unfailing example to our prisoners what the American people truly stand for.<br /><br />Any military prison is a complicated environment which arouses instinctive animal passions, reflexive brands of patriotism, bigotry, religious convictions both radical and reasonable, and deep-seated feelings of what is fair play and what is beyond the pale. Don't look for \\"heroism\\" in our interrogators or guards. Saar shows great insight into all of these diverse factors, and gives us detailed observations of the best and the worst of us at work at Guantanamo. Heroism in prison is reserved only for prisoners. Our prisoners who survived the abuses of the Vietnamese communists are our best example of that. The best any interrogator, interpreter, or guard can do is to remain human.<br /><br />Erik Saar has made a contribution in the best way he could, and I admire his efforts and his service to our nation. I highly recommend \\"Inside the Wire\\" to anyone who understands that a sense of compassion and fair play is a prerequisite to being able to call oneself an American at heart, not merely an American by accident of birth.is a prerequisite to being able to call oneself an American at heart, not merely an American by accident of birth.	2005-05-05

The author's ability to draw apt comparisons to similar situations and conditions faced by our fathers in North Africa during WWII brings a rich sense of history and perspective. We see that the familiar black humor of our warriors is something in the American genes which will never fade.<br /><br />Strange how long ago this initial round of \\"major combat\\" seems. \\"Unexpected\\" consequences cast a long shadow. The understated and dignified Afterword reminds us that military planners had predicted U.S troop levels would drop to 30,000 by September 2003. Hopefully the old adage that what does not break us only makes us stronger will apply to today's Armed Forces. More than a few of us cringe at the phrase \\"broken force\\" which occasionally comes up these days.<br /><br />The descriptions of both Lieutenant General Wallace and Major General Petraeus are nothing short of inspirational, and bring to mind the strength of character and blunt-spoken manners of General Grant.<br /><br />To me at least, General Eric Shinseki has emerged as the most exemplary general of the entire story. His warning, \\"Beware the twelve-division strategy for a ten-division Army,\\" reminds us of his professional insight and personal courage. If General Shinseki were heading off to the State Department or the World Bank today, we would be sending a message to the world that we learn from history. Instead, we await more of the unexpected while we ponder new strategies to recruit more brave young men.

My favorite is the following scene of the hero being called from his cell for interrogation, not a normal subject of amusement these days. The attitude of our prisoners, seized in the war on terror, does not differ greatly from Svejk's --<br /><br />They came to take him away for questioning. And so, mounting the staircase to the 3rd Department for questioning, Svejk carried his cross up on to the hill of Golgotha, sublimely unconscious of his martyrdom. As he came into the office, he said,\\"Good evening to you all, gentlemen.\\" Instead of a reply, ... someone stood him in front of a table, behind which sat a gentleman with a cold official face and features of bestial cruelty, features of the criminal type. The interrogator gave Svejk a bloodthirsty look and said: \\"Take that idiotic expression off your face.\\" \\"I can't help it,\\" replied Svejk. \\"I was discharged from the army for idiocy ... I'm an official idiot.\\"<br /><br />Back in his cell, Svejk told all the detainees that this kind of interrogation was fun. \\"They shout at you a bit and finally they kick you out. In the old days, it used to be worse. If a chap was only thrown into a dungeon he felt as if he were reborn. Nowadays it's fun being locked up. It's true it's a bit far to the interrogation room. You've got to go along three corridors and up one staircase, but on the other hand it's a clean and lively corridor. No one need be afraid that in the office they'll tell him, \\"Well, we've considered your case and tomorrow you'll be quartered or burnt, your choice.

The wisdom in the off-hand in combat comments of the \\"common\\" citizen soldier far exceeds the hash cranked out by most scholars of war. Anyone who has ever worn the uniform will recognize the attitudes and scenes, time and place altered.<br /><br />This is a WWII oral history which does not romanticize war or minimize the faults of our own nation. The heroism of these men was extraordinary. The feats of courage described so frankly and brutally were those of realistic men not motivated by propaganda or careerism.<br /><br />One can only wonder how much those racial attitudes persist today, though there is no doubt that what does remain inside our forces has been pushed deeper below the surface. On the other hand, substitute \\"haji\\" for \\"negra\\" and follow today's soldiers [of any race] around for a few moments to discover that our latent racial bias always finds some way to push back to the surface. Some would no doubt argue that this is part of a necessary process of dehumanizing the enemy to enable our young soldiers to kill. Only 60 years have passed; one wonders if we have really changed our nature so much that we are qualified to \\"train\\" the Iraqis and Afghans how to bridge their own ethnic and tribal divides. Go to our Southwest Asian bases today, and watch the long lines of \\"host country\\" nationals filing past us every morning and afternoon, not a glance or a word exchanged between us. One of the men in \\"Patton's Panthers\\" noted that the only time the black man was sent to the front of anything, bus, train, or battle, was when the white man did not want to be there. Our allies of today cannot help but feel the same way, I suppose. Plenty of bias, both racial and religious, on both sides of today's war, perhaps more than usual.	2005-02-14

Purple Sun is a relaxing winter evening read that draws you in quickly.<br /><br />The young Kentucky Marine in this novel reminded me immediately of the 1960s Pulitzer prize winning newspaper article which told the true story of another Kentuckian, a soldier boy known to his loved ones as \\"Little Duck,\\" coming back home to the mountains for burial.<br /><br />The disappearance of Purple Sun's Marine Corporal Billy Kern brings to mind the disappearance outside of Da Nang of another Marine, Bobby Garwood, and his eventual reappearance. The many years of all consuming doubt about the fate of a soldier missing in Vietnam makes one think of the case of McKinley Nolan, another troubled man who never came home. And if the fate of Corporal Kern seems strange, Nolan's true life fate would be at least as shocking. Disappearing among the enemy in Vietnam, Corporal Kern had much better luck than Humphrey and McKay had with the Khmer Rouge in 1970.<br /><br />Lots of memories, some relevant, many just humorous and personal, will no doubt reappear when anyone who has ever worn the uniform in any capacity reads this intriguing work of fiction. Those of us now jaded and well past being able to call ourselves middle-aged realize that fiction is all there is anyway, and at times fiction carries more impact than what we imagine as truth.<br /><br />T.E. Lawrence wrote that no man in history has ever recorded the complete truth about any action in which he has been involved, and cautioned his readers that they must read between the lines of his book \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\" to find their truth. Many veterans will find their experiences appearing between the lines in Lawrence McAuliffe's fiction. Inside these pages, someone will no doubt find the bones upon which to frame his own \\"true life\\" memoirs of whatever war he happened to fight.	2005-01-23

Our intellectual side never ceases trying to understand the beast that lies deep within every human.<br /><br />The chapter entitled \\"Manufacturing Difference\\" touched me most. Today we invent sterile legalistic terms like \\"person under control\\" [PUC] and \\"enemy combatant\\" [EC] to replace \\"prisoner\\" to avert our consciences from the denials of due process. Labels are just as important to us as they are to \\"evil doers,\\" it appears. The self-imposed and external pressures that influenced the behavior of Khmer Rouge interrogators are described in some depth, and help explain our own recent failures and abuses.<br /><br />The chapter \\"Power, Patronage, and Suspicion\\" is rich with fascinating examples from post Khmer Rouge Cambodia. Upon reflection, we see the same instinct to curry the patronage of powerful political figures is alive and well in today's America. Once again, we start off studying what we assume is a more primitive society only to end up shining a light upon our own human failings. Somehow our own faults are held deeply submerged, probably because of the same instinctive self-defense tools which the \\"perpetrators\\" employ when asked, \\"Why did you kill?\\"<br /><br />The leaders of genocide always appear to me to be simple power seekers who have an instinctive sense of the tools of human control. Strange how the \\"godless\\" Khmer Rouge and the Taliban \\"student seekers of God\\" were so alike. I cannot stare into the vacant eyes of one without thinking of the other. The common perpetrator hides within each of us under the label \\"cowardice.\\" As David Chandler explained so well in his own masterful work on S-21, when men attach themselves to a bureaucracy they place themselves in a \\"state of agency\\" which allows them to do evil for self-interest and self-preservation while evading their own conscience in the process. One who finds himself obedient and \\"moveable\\" in terms of his principles is a prime candidate to find in himself the perpetrator of shameful acts.<br /><br />Along the path of this penetrating study, Alexander Hinton has done a wonderful job annotating the twisted Khmer Rouge terminology which still never fails to send a chill down my spine.<br /><br />I read \\"Why did they kill?\\" trying to use it as a mirror to see if I could recognize my own face.

Lawrence	Books	5	102	102	N	Y	Almost as eloquent as Lawrence himself	Dr. John Mack's study of Lawrence is one of the most absorbing reads I've ever enjoyed in my lifetime. As Irving Howe wrote, \\"What finally draws one to Lawrence, making him not merely an exceptional figure, but a representative man of our century, is his courage and vulnerability in bearing the burden of consciousness.\\" The impact that the trial by fire in Arabia appears to have had on his post-war life is shocking, and teaches us once again not to envy our great heroes. Lawrence wrote of General Allenby that great men cannot be judged by ordinary standards, anymore than the sharpness of the bow of an ocean liner can be judged by the sharpness of a razor. After reading \\"A Prince of Our Disorder,\\" I recognize now that Lawrence was probably thinking of himself while writing those kind words about his former master, asking that he not be be judged by his hidden afflictions, torments, and self-doubts, all the while laying out those same imperfections for all the world to read. Lawrence warned us,\\"The documents are liars ... No man ever yet tried to write down the entire truth of any action in which he has been engaged.\\" No man is truly capable of understanding his own subconscious motivations, but I doubt that anyone has ever struggled harder than Lawrence to achieve self-understanding. We will have to try to read between the lines, learn what we can, and apply that knowledge to enrich our own poor lives.<br /><br />So sad for all of us that our leaders are not of the same  introspective type. Dr. Mack comments in his introduction that \\"The destructive leader, and the eagerness of a large segment of the population to identify with him, comprise one of the central threats -- if not the greatest threat -- that faces human society. There is perhaps an increasing unwillingness to entrust our well-being and our lives to individuals and characters we do not understand and whose ultimate purposes we are ignorant of.\\" Let's hope so.<br /><br />Jeremy Wilson's massive biography \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" may better satisfy military readers interested in extensive contemporary document citations, and includes much more detail on Lawrence's Cairo years.

Military interrogators have been rarely used during the last 30 years, most going through an entire career without ever performing the job in the field, even fewer ever fluent in the language of the prisoner. Little practical field experience remained in the military system when the current war on terror began, the outstanding officers of the FBI, CIA, and DEA having had much more opportunity to be actively employed. One young soldier has taken it upon himself to write up what he saw in his niche, and the work has much redeeming value once the reader fights through the author's ego. His experience tells us a lot about our state of readiness. The facts on the shortage of interrogators and their lack of language training were especially stunning.<br /><br />Some of the author's opinions do have great appeal, and he expresses them well. I too hate the old interrogator's argument that I have heard so often in the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal, the statement that illegally coercive methods \\"just do not work.\\" If spoken from experience, then the interrogator has already broken the law; if not, then he is just guessing. Whether or not illegal methods work is totally irrelevant. As Americans we do not employ such tactics, period. Trying to lean over the line is also not something to be condoned, but it must be granted that the boundary is not a clear one and never will be. In the end each man has to live with himself and with the courts. No interrogator can expect much sympathy or admiration from either the American public or the courts once he finds himself in a jam; the job is a thankless one, and the interrogator will unfortunately more often be perceived as a thug rather than a soldier. Most were drawn to the field by the desire to learn foreign languages, not by some drive to impose their wills on defenseless captives.<br /><br /> The \\"truth\\" will show up in history someday, as it did with the Vietnam era interrogations. The reports will be critically examined by scholars. Human rights experts will gain access to the former prisoners and have their say. The prisoner memoirs, oral and written, will remain behind. Many of the prisoners will have their own chance to pose as heroes and tell tall tales of their bravery while in the hands of the \\"infidels.\\" Perhaps the officers of other government agencies will share their memoirs as well. In Afghanistan and Iraq, most of the prisoners will be back on the streets before the outcome of the war is determined.<br /><br />Update: Tim Golden's excellent series of reports in the New York Times on crimes committed during the early phase of interrogation operations at Bagram are essential reading and provide insights not available in \\"The Interrogators.\\" Fortunately, the methodology and attitudes [including so-called \\"monstering\\"] hinted at in this book were subsequently eliminated and do not in any way whatsoever represent the facility as it was operated in late 2004.

Whether or not a reader has the same take on the history of the POW-MIA issue as Bill Bell, most will be able to acknowledge that he took the issue to heart in a very active way. His commitment to the study of the languages of the region set him head and shoulders above the vast majority of NCOs and certainly all of the officers who were assigned to work the issue, and those linguistic skills for the most part served him very very well. Unfortunately, by the time Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia began to open up and the many years of almost hopeless interviews in refugee camps came to an end, the &quot;issue&quot; had devolved into a series of highly-publicized scams and silly bureaucratic turf struggles between bureaucracies with no missions, and inevitably was exploited by the odd politician or three. We ended up not serving the missing or their families as well as the naive among us would have expected. What was once a sacred cause degenerated into a comfortable meal ticket for many of those &quot;involved,&quot; but in spite of all that, Bill often took stances which he knew would bring him his fair share of abuse. If anyone made an honest effort for an extended period of years, Bill did. Those that have hung on for decades sitting idle at the trough have much to answer for. Bill Bell was active in the pursuit of his life-defining mission, and that alone makes his writing worth our time and our respect.	2004-07-03

Seven Pillars of Wisdom is fascinating from cover to cover. The book is on some levels Lawrence's study of himself as much as a history of the battles in which he was involved. He writes, \\"Any protestation of the truth from me was called modesty, self-depreciation. It always irritated me, this silly confusion of shyness, which was conduct, with modesty, which was a point of view... I was not modest, but ashamed of my awkwardness, of my physical envelope, of my solitary unlikeness which made me no companion, but an acquaintance, complete, angular, uncomfortable, as a crystal.\\" This type of introspection is most uncommon in a military man.<br />Not a squeamish soldier, Lawrence was once forced into a situation in which he executed a murderer, and on another occasion he authorized \\"take no prisoners\\" after the Turks conducted one of their numerous brutal atrocities. But there were some things even Lawrence recognized as boundaries of civilized behavior best not transgressed. In the final chapters he explains why he thought better of his initial inclination to kill several petty warlords who were participating in and would in the future likely betray the Arab Revolt -- he did not want to teach his Arab followers that \\"precautionary murder\\" was a legitimate part of political struggle. One is left wondering what he would have to say about today's politicians who promote \\"preemptive defense\\" as a legitimate strategy and standing policy. At least Lawrence's terminology was far more honest and direct.	2004-01-24

I imagine it takes most students a while to adjust to what at first seems to be very strange and tiny scribbles.] Most Arabic entries seem fully voweled, so I do not see the need for the English phonetics that another reviewer demanded.

A very detailed and fascinating first hand account of the action on Tang Island, this work should be read along with Ralph Wetterhahn's \\"The Last Battle.\\" Though both accounts are spell-binding, I still cannot really fathom why everyone sailed away after the battle when it became known that three young Marines had been inadvertently left behind on the island during the nighttime withdrawal under fire. Something ugly happened here, not yet fully explained.<br /><br />2014 Update -- Investigations in 2014 by the Vietnamese press show that 513 Vietnamese civilians captured by Khmer Rouge naval forces on islands near Phu Quoc in early May 1975 were taken to Tang Island were they were eventually killed. Documentary evidence of Chinese advisors having been posted on the island was also discovered. A 2009 memoir by PAVN General Pham Van Tra details PAVN action, which he commanded, that re-took the islands and captured 800 KR naval personnel in the process. A separate memoir by a former Vietnamese ambassador to Phnom Penh details late 1975 negotiations between Nguyen Van Linh (Muoi Cuc) and Nuon Chea for an exchange of the 513 civilians for the KR prisoners taken by Vietnam. Vietnam returned the captured Khmer Rouge soldiers, but the Khmer Rouge failed to keep their end of the deal, and the 513 died on Koh Tang.	2003-08-12

While I've read this book many times over the years, my most recent reading struck me hard. The description of the May 8, 1970 meeting between Henry Kissinger and a number of his friends and personal advisors from Harvard did not seem especially interesting in past years, but jumped off the page this time around. Thomas Schelling told Kissinger that after the invasion of Cambodia the group no longer had faith in Henry or the Nixon  administration's ability to conduct foreign policy, and would have nothing further to do with Kissinger. The group pointed out that the invasion could be \\"used by anyone else in the world as a precedent for invading another country, in order, for example, to clear out terrorists.\\" Another section recounts Arthur Schlesinger Jr. quoting a historian's recollection of the Romans -- \\"There was no corner of the known world where some interest was not alleged to be in danger or under actual attack. If the interests were not Roman, they were of Rome's allies; and if Rome had no allies, the allies would be invented.\\" Shawcross also notes that in 1964 the US condemned Britain for assaulting a Yemeni town used as a base by insurgents attacking Aden. Another chilling touch is the mention of Lincoln's reaction when he was advised that the President could invade a neighbor if necessary to repel invasion -- Lincoln replied, \\"Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect, after you give him as much as you propose.\\" Lincoln's famous speech given as a young man in the 1830s in which he remarked that all the armies of Europe could not forcibly take a drink of water from the Ohio River and therefore \\"... if this great nation is to ever die, it will be from suicide\\" rings more true than the words of today's politicians proclaiming the right to declare preemptive war.<br /><br />An excellent summary of the events that overtook Cambodia, \\"Sideshow\\" has much more to offer to us today as we try to figure out how we reached this turning point in our history and recall how badly things can go wrong whenever we deviate from the principles upon which our nation was founded.history and recall how badly things can go wrong whenever we deviate from the principles upon which our nation was founded.	2003-07-19

There are several true gems in this memoir, the most remarkable being the scene in which he personally warns Kissinger of the dangers of top secret access, this just prior to Kissinger's taking the National Security Advisor position. Ellsberg warns the good Doctor that those with access to highly classified information go through a transformation process which eventually leads them to think that anyone without the same access is a simpleton not capable of judging policymakers. They stop listening to outsiders and eventually turn themselves into morons. Sound familiar? A follow-up scene shows that Kissinger did fall victim to that syndrome at least on occasion. Perhaps the same may apply to Dan Ellsberg. He assumed that once the public saw what he saw in those \\"secret\\" papers the world would turn back on its axis. Ellsberg may not have realized that \\"the people\\" have always known the key secret -- the \\"great leader\\" will stop at nothing to remain in power and his men will do anything to keep their jobs.  [See the final paragraph of David Chandler's book \\"Voices from S-21\\" for the best explanation I have seen about how men rationalize the evil they do by placing themselves in a \\"state of agency\\" to a bureaucracy to which they cling for survival.] The \\"secret\\" is as old as man himself, and never changes. Only those on the \\"inside\\" imagine themselves brilliant by virtue of their access to the details of age old political power schemes. The quotes from the Oval Office tapes of Nixon's \\"frank\\" reactions to Ellsberg's plot to publicize the McNamara study are wonderful, laughable, and a great joy to read. Would today's Oval Office tapes really be any less satisfying?	2003-06-02

He writes, \\"Even when the choreography of the armies is understood ... we crave intimate detail of individual men in individual foxholes ... The dead resist such intimacy ... but history can take us there, almost ...

Alongside the well-captioned photos is a collection of sample writings in the Thai, Lao, and Khmer languages. Not a mention of war here, thank God. A restful and loving work which I have poured over hundreds of times since I bought my copy in 1975. It never fails to bring me peace, and it is remarkable that the peoples of the region have retained their culture despite the tragedies that have befallen them.

One cannot help but wonder what our current Secretary of Defense will write when his time comes. One has the feeling that the subtitle of McNamara's retrospective, \\"The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam,\\" will be a good starting place for that \\"sequel.\\" McNamara writes, \\"We were wrong, terribly wrong. We owe it to future generations to explain why.\\" Americans today will have to decide whether or not we have actually learned our lessons and are now more wise than the last generation, more able to predict the tragedies that will arise during and after today's war. Anyone who recalls the Kissinger scheme to achieve \\"a decent interval\\" while bugging out of Southeast Asia will likely recall Eric Von Marbod comparing the logic of that process to that of \\"a man who impregnates nine women in the hope of getting a baby in one month.\\" How can one not think of Afghanistan, Iraq, (and now Iran) without thinking of the Vietnam era? Despite all the criticism directed at him, the author reflects great credit upon himself and the country by even attempting to set the record \\"straight.\\" One can indeed be wrong even when totally convinced one is \\"acting in the principles and tradition of this great nation.\\"  How could we have slipped out of Vietnam if we had really believed in the domino theory used to justify that war? What will become of the \\"nexus of WMD and terrorism\\" that is today's rationale for preventive war? As we watch to see how we extricate ourselves from the war on terror, there is much to be learned from the old political schemes of Robert McNamara's era. Recent remarks by Secretary Rumsfeld in the wake of heartbreaking setbacks in Iraq indicate that he may indeed have begun to learn that more frank our leaders are with the people, the more chance of success we have. Then again, given past misjudgements, Rumsfeld should get his Medal of Freedom now, along with a pat on the back from a grateful nation, and an usher to the door.	2003-03-29

Since I met the author in Chiang Mai a decade ago -- when he somewhat reluctantly described his experiences as a prisoner inside the infamous Khmer Rouge M13 prison camp commanded by \\"Douch\\" and gave me a copy of the safe-travel pass written for him by a North Vietnamese officer during the first of Bizot's many brushes with death -- this was the one great book I impatiently awaited. As it turns out, \\"The Gate\\" is far more powerful than I could ever have imagined. Readers will find it painful to read through their tears, but will be unable to lay the book down. As John Le Carre writes in the foreword, \\"Now and then you read a book, and, as you put it down, you realize that you envy everybody who has not read it, simply because, unlike you, they will have the experience before them.\\" The brilliantly written introduction shows how little the world has changed since the historic disaster in Cambodia. In contrast to many Frenchmen, Bizot saw the Americans as allies in 1970, but recognized an \\"inexcusable naivete\\" in the Americans, and he comments, \\"I do not know what to reproach them for more, their intervention or their withdrawal.\\" As for the French government of that day he comments, \\"... fear of appearing to support the Americans so froze minds that nowhere in Europe were people free enough to voice their indignation and denounce the lies (of the Vietnamese and Cambodian communist revolutions).\\" In one of his verbal duels with his interrogator, Bizot questions the insane logic of the revolutionary, asking if the Khmer Rouge cadre did not see that the revolutionary line was just a trick constructed using basic Buddhist traditions to deceive the people and itself, just as it used the name of Sihanouk as a mask. For me there will never be another book quite like Bizot's to come from a Westerner. Bizot is a man who lives life his way, thinks his own thoughts, follows no man or no government blindly. A true citizen of the world. Fortunately, Cambodians have recently started writing their own stories, and it will truly take river of ink to record the horrors they have experienced. New books by the Documentation Center of Cambodia (dccam.org) go into great detail on the barbaric tortures used at camp M13 and at Tuol Sleng, tortures which even Bizot could not have dreamed of at the time he was held there.ed writing their own stories, and it will truly take river of ink to record the horrors they have experienced.

Evan Gottesman's three years of field work in Cambodia with the American Bar Association Law and Democracy Project gave him an exceptionally solid base from which he launched this study of the history of the PRK and SOC regimes. His use of documents dug out of the National Archives is, as David Chandler has remarked, &quot;masterful.&quot; His interviews with the former holders of power provide fascinating insights into the minds of key personalities seldom reached by Westerners. The epilogue is chock full of understated, reasonable, fair, and on-the-mark assessments of the reality on the ground in Cambodia today -- &quot;Cambodian democracy often seems an abstraction...Although the methods of control have changed, the personnel governing the country remain largely the same ... (they) have accepted a new level of political discourse, but they do so only to the extent that it does not jeopardize their power.&quot;  Life and work in Cambodia as a lawyer would frustrate all but the most idealistic of men. That Mr. Gottesman came away with such a patient and objective look at Cambodia says much about both his character and his intellect. This book is a must read for our new generation of &quot;nation builders.&quot; It will allow them to bring to bear a better sense of time scale regarding their grand plans to democratize the world, clearly a task for multiple generations of good men like Evan Gottesman, not one to be attempted by one or two four-year administrations of ambitious politicians.	2002-12-30

Those who already read Thai or Lao will require a mere two weeks to learn the beautiful Khmer writing system. The programmed reading texts are already out there (Huffman, Tonkin), but sadly, the necessary audio tapes to accompany those texts are not.

His assessments of the generals on both sides, many of whom he knew intimately from the Mexican war, are priceless. I think the one I like best was of General Warren -- \\"His difficulty was constitutional and beyond his control. He was an officer of superior ability, quick perceptions, and the personal courage to accomplish anything that could be done with a small command.\\"<br />General Grant also never lost the ability to make fun of himself (a lost art among today's leaders?), recalling being mocked by a stablehand who had seen him prancing in his uniform shortly after being commissioned. Perhaps that is why in his prime Grant so often wore a simple private's shirt with his proper insignia of rank.<br />The anecdotes from his conversations with President Lincoln are unforgettable. So are stories from the war with Mexico, when long-range Mexican cannonballs came into his lines at such shallow angles that his men could open ranks to avoid the bounding projectiles. The language of the day - \\"reducing\\" the enemy \\"works\\" with great \\"execution\\" -- adds to the enjoyment and reminds the reader of today's \\"collateral damage\\" military jargon.<br />Grant, great lover of a good cigar, comments on his observations from the war with Mexico that people smoked tobacco more when it was an expensive item they they did later when the price was much cheaper.<br />Where are such men today?

There are good arguments both for and against each of several sketchy accounts of Sean's alleged execution.  The focus of this book, however, is the impact of the life of the father on the psyche of the son.  Meanwhile, others drawn to the mystery continue to pursue the facts of what happened to Sean and his friend Dana Stone. How unfortunate that the Vietnamese government has never come forward with the facts in its possession on the fates of any of the ten international journalists captured in the same area during early April 1970.  What outdated political sensitivities could possibly justify the damage done for over three decades to the surviving families and friends of these brave journalists?<br />It is encouraging that other recent works including \\"The Eagle Mutiny\\" by Richard Linnett and Roberto Loiederman and \\"The Last Battle\\" by Colonel Ralph Wetterhahn have attempted to focus on those left behind on the battlefields of Cambodia.  Perry Deane Young's \\"Two of the Missing\\" is a great account of the disappearance of his colleagues Sean Flynn and Dana Stone.

While most of the arguments about the goings on inside Cambodia during the DK and PRK eras are now dated, readers can still learn much from &quot;Cambodia 1975-1982&quot;. Early into this book, Vickery very cleverly uses passages from Bun Chan Mol's excellent book &quot;Chareut Khmer&quot; to catch off guard those readers who assume crimes against humanity in Cambodia began in the DK era. That passage alone makes the book worthwhile.	2001-09-03

The aftermath of the American retreat from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia is most easily marked by the \\"reeducation camp\\" boom in the region. Many Vietnamese prison memoirs have been published in the United States, but unfortunately \\"My 1632 Days\\" is the only one I've seen in English. Americans don't enjoy reading of our failures and defeats, so few will bother with Tran Tri Vu's exceptional work on the fate of our former allies. That is our great loss, and the equally great gain of the Vietnamese communists. Readers of Vietnamese will find \\"Thep Den\\" by Dang Chi Binh and \\"Dai Hoc Mau\\" by Ha Thuc Sinh to be two of the best Vietnamese prison memoirs. As Nguyen van Thieu once said, \\"Being friends with the Americans is more difficult than being their enemies.\\" Perhaps so. Pham Quang Giai's 1987 satirical and sarcastic look back at the re-education camps entitled \\"Lan Cuoi Ben Anh\\" (Last Time at Your Side) includes imaginary exchanges between the ghosts of a Vietnamese camp cadre and an inmate who died in the camp system. In one scene the Vietnamese communist cadre tells the hapless inmate \\"Just you wait! Before long the Americans will change their position again and see us as not their enemies but as their friends. They'll love us even more than they loved you.\\" Pham Quang Giai clearly saw the future! The Lao seem not to have written on their experiences in the \\"seminar camp\\" system copied from the Vietnamese. Few Cambodian prisoners survived to write anything at all, but David Chandler's \\"Voices From S-21: Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison\\" tells their stories for them. Two new books by the Documentation Center of Cambodia (dccam.org) tell the stories of both the victims and the perpetrators of these acts of terror committed by the \\"victors\\" of the Southeast Asian \\"conflicts.\\"	2001-08-11

This is a group which suffered some of the worst treatment dished out in the Vietnamese communist re-education camp system. Readers of Vietnamese should seek out the lengthy memoir \\"Thep Den\\" written under the pen name Dang Chi Binh, which covers the recruitment, training, missions, capture and imprisonment of one of these operatives.  Sadly, when some of these men arrived in the refugee camps of Thailand during the late 1980s they had trouble convincing the officials screening them for refugee status that their far-fetched backgrounds were indeed true. That some small measure of financial compensation has finally been provided to this group by the United States government is a welcome gesture, but no gesture will erase the guilt of those responsible for dispatching these men to certain death or imprisonment.	2001-08-05

The nitty-gritty battle details will naturally cause argument among those who had the honor of participating in the battle, but the description of the battle just sets the stage for the final act, the withdrawal without all hands accounted for and the strangely unexplained failure to cordon the isolated island until the fate of those left behind could be established without doubt. That live Marine prisoners could possibly have been allowed to be moved off the island seems  shocking.  Much of the information in &quot;The Last Battle&quot; will come as a surprise even to those Americans who thought they understood the Mayaguez &quot;incident&quot; and the action on Koh Tang. These same waters off the Cambodian coast claimed American lives several times during the Khmer Rouge era. The newly-published book &quot;The Eagle Mutiny&quot; by Linnett and Loiederman tells the story of mutiny aboard an American munitions ship during 1970 which culminated in the death of one of the mutineers (Clyde McKay) and another US Army deserter (Larry Humphrey) at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. Khmer Rouge naval forces under the command of Meah Muth, the son-in-law of Ta Mok, went on to capture four Americans (James William Clark, Lance Macnamara, Michael Scott Deeds, and Christopher Delance) and five other Westerners off the Cambodian coast during 1978 and sent them to be tortured and executed at the infamous Tuol Sleng prison in Phnom Penh. Meah Muth and Ta Mok as well as KR executioner-in-chief Duch (who has admitted killing the Americans at Tuol Sleng and claims to have disposed of the bodies on the personal order of Nuon Chea) have just this week been named as top candidates for an international tribunal on other crimes against humanity. Perhaps then these stories, like the aftermath of most wars, never really come to a full conclusion. What is certain is that Colonel Wetterhahn has once again performed beyond the call of duty. His efforts should serve as an example to all those involved in what the nation proclaims to be the search for &quot;the fullest possible accounting&quot;, and hopefully those that disagree with the author's conclusions on the fate of the lost machinegun team will be motivated to travel to Cambodia and investigate for themselves.

A remarkably well-told story of the tortured life of Jim Thompson. Strangely enough, the worst of his pain came after release, not during his long years of imprisonment and torture at the hands of ignorant and brutal Vietnamese cadres. Tom Philpott makes no effort to paint anyone involved in this tale heroic in the idealic sense, but lets both the witnesses and facts speak for themselves. Some of the harsh words spoken by former military &quot;comrades&quot; will shock readers. I suppose every American wants to be a hero in some way, and perhaps we even envy those who have reached that exalted status. This book will make us all think twice about that dream. Here is one hero with whom few would exchange places. The price was obviously far far too great for Jim Thompson and his family, though one comes away knowing that he would have done it all over again had he been called to do so.	2001-07-11

After falling into the custody of Mam Sabun, a Khmer Rouge district chief, their fates become confused with those of Sean Flynn and Dana Stone, the most famous of the American journalists who disappeared in Cambodia during the 1970-75 era of conflict. This work is a valuable addition to Tim Page's ongoing research to resolve the fates of those who remain &quot;unaccounted-for&quot; in Cambodia. Roberto Loiederman's stunningly detailed account of life aboard the the ship make this story one which anyone who loves the sea will find spellbinding.

Originally published in 1970, this 365 page guide to the Khmer writing system has it all -- Part I is a formal introduction to Khmer, somewhat loaded with the terminology of the professional linguist but not overdone in that regard.  Part II consists of a well-designed series of programmed step-by-step exercises which will quickly put the Khmer writing system within the grasp of any serious student.  Part III is a beginning reader, composed of short cursive script passages with accompanying vocabulary lists.  Part IV is a 2,000 word glossary.  All the Khmer script is in the same crystal clear cursive script, even more useful to students than the now-available Khmer laser fonts. Own this work along with Derik Tonkin's smaller format, almost pocketbook-size guide, and you are in business.

Several groups of journalists of various nationalties were captured in this same area during the same week Sean and Dana disappeared.  Not one of these missing men has ever been &quot;fully accounted-for&quot;, though reports relating to them still frequently emerge from surviving eye-witnesses of the chaos on the battlefields of Cambodia.  Richard Linnett's &quot;The Eagle Mutiny&quot; explains how difficult it can be to sort out these reports of Americans held prisoner in Cambodia.  Two more of Young's colleagues, Tim Page and Zalin Grant, are still actively seeking the true fate of Flynn and Stone.  The author and Walter Cronkite appear in Tim Page's documentary film about the case, entitled &quot;Danger at the Edge of Town&quot;.  The answers most likely lie untouched in the musty archives of an uncooperative Peoples Army of Vietnam, too late for Dana's wife Louise, who died several years ago never having received the answers she longed for, buried alone, without Dana at her side.  Louise deserved more.  The Vietnamese government can do better, and so can ours.  Readers of this story will be left with the hope that &quot;You Are Not Forgotten&quot; is not just a slogan on a flag flown at the post office, but a heartfelt pledge by a government and a people.  What is clear is that Perry Deane Young saw his duty to write the story years ago.  An unforgettable read!	2001-03-12

Other accounts of the incident generally focus on the well-intentioned but misinformed US military action on Tang Island, the confusion surrounding the hectic night-time withdrawal under fire, and the fates of those three young enlisted Marines left behind alive on the island to be killed days later while the US administration was basking in its own deceptive public relations spin on its &quot;victorious release of the hostages&quot;. Excellent reading which will be especially meaningful to those who participated in the rescue, to the families of those lost in the incident, and to all those who lost loved ones in past wars. Colonel Ralph Wetterhahn's newly-released &quot;The Last Battle&quot; reveals the terror and horror of the true end of the Mayaguez &quot;incident&quot;.  Readers will likely also want to study Richard Linnett's &quot;The Eagle Mutiny&quot;, which deals with the bizarre case of the March 1970 mutiny aboard the Columbia Eagle in the same waters off the Cambodian coast.  The former Khmer Rouge naval forces commander involved in both the seizure of the Mayaguez in 1975 and the capture of four other Americans sailing the coast of Cambodia in 1978 has been named recently as a candidate for a possible international tribunal related to other crimes against humanity not related to the deaths of the seven Americans.	2001-02-26

Forwards are by the Dalai Lama and Dith Pran.  The reader cannot help but wonder what &quot;repatriated&quot; Cambodians who once resided in the camps would have to say today.  Was that chaotic mass repatriation back to troubled Cambodia truly a United Nations success story, or was one misery simply exchanged for another, with the victims conveniently moved out of sight, or is the truth somewhere in between?

A French citizen marries a Khmer Rouge cadre in France, then follows him through China back to Cambodia after Pol Pot came to power.  The only story like this to have yet been told, the author provides insight into the daily routine of fear and insecurity within the world of the Khmer Rouge.  One scene describes Ieng Sary giving a speech during which he waved his copies of the &quot;confessions&quot; forced from the regime's &quot;internal enemies&quot; at an interrogation center later known to the world as S-21.  Readers who want to know more about S-21 from the perspective one of the few surviving prisoners should read Vann Nath's &quot;Cambodian Prison Portrait&quot;.  David Chandler's &quot;Voices from S-21&quot; is the definitive work on S-21, the site where thousands of Khmer Rouge cadre were toruted and killed.  &quot;Beyond the Horizon&quot; has been published in French, Khmer, and English, and thereby also serves as a great language learning tool for students of things Cambodian.  Laurence Picq is indeed fortunate to have escaped both S-21 and the grasp of her twisted and paranoid husband, who also survives.  An upcoming book by Richard Linnett, &quot;The Eagle Mutiny&quot;, will tell the story of two Americans who died in their bizarre efforts to be accepted as members of the Cambodian revolution.  &quot;Beyond the Horizon&quot; is simply remarkable, truth far stranger than any fiction.	2001-01-22

Even more rare than his impressive intellect is David Chandler's collegial approach to his subjects and his fellow researchers.<br /><br />The 2005 publication in the Khmer language is a beautiful piece of work done in a very crisp and legible Khmer font. The set in both English and Khmer will make the best study aid ever available for students of Khmer and for native speakers studying English. Very encouraging to see the American Embassy in Phnom Penh and the Van Waveren Foundation assist with funding this project. [publishing@khmerstudies.org & [...]	2000-06-24

Nationalists saw  collaboration with the French as &quot;repugnant&quot;, but then so was  &quot;giving the nation ... over to a future ruled by Ho Chi Minh, Vo  Nguyen Giap, and the Indochinese Communist Party&quot; who were then  murdering nationalist leaders in Hanoi and along the Red River.  Giap's  role in the purge of the nationalist Dai Viet and VNQDD needs to be kept in  mind by those who tend to accept as fact the popular communist myths woven  around its leadership figures.  &quot;In the Jaws of History&quot; is  perhaps best read along with Bui Tin's memoirs &quot;Following Ho Chi Minh:  The Memoirs of a North Vietnamese Colonel&quot;.	2000-06-10

One of the earliest (1986) accounts from the survivors of the Pol Pot regime, &quot;The Stones Cry Out&quot; seems to have set the style and standard for another more recent child's-eye perspective on the same era,  &quot;When Broken Glass Floats&quot;.  The minute details of everyday life,  not abstract poltical assessments, form the basis for our childhood  memories.  The author's account carries an unvarnished realism which draws  the reader into her film-like image of daily life under threat of  starvation and execution.  This is probably as close as a reader can come  to the truth of events in Cambodia during 1975-79.  Oral histories such as  &quot;The Stones Cry Out&quot; are perhaps the best way for survivors of  human rights abuses to indict the perpetrators.  Sadly, tribunals driven by  international politics are unlikely to have the same impact as the simple  testimony of a victimized child.  Highly recommended reading for all those  with an interest in human rights, Cambodia, and Southeast Asian culture.	2000-06-08

Twenty-nine essays compiled by Dith Pran, each written by a Cambodian who was still in childhood when Cambodia fell into Pol Pot's hands. Ben Kiernan ties the collection together so well in his introduction: &quot;Children had to work like adults. Adults, given instructions like children, were treated like animals.&quot; As Kiernan notes, Pol Pot's efforts to build his twisted revolution on the backs of these children certainly backfired! The accompanying photos of the contributing authors and the details of their successful new lives in America will make any American recognize what a 'promised land' our country still remains. In so many many ways America has failed the Cambodian people, but most of those fortunate few who reached our shores have made successful lives for themselves and their families. The difficulties confronting those who remain in Cambodia today are seemingly insurmountable. As has been said so many times, every Cambodian has a story to tell, and a river of ink could not describe their nation's suffering. Dith Pran has once again served his people proudly with this touching collection.	2000-06-06

We children of WWII veterans are now coming to grips with our own mortality.  We recognize that we do not measure up to our fathers, for we never faced the staggering challenges which formed them into the men they  were.  No matter which service and unit flags your father served under, no  matter which campaigns he fought, you will find much pride in reading  &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, and celebrate your father in the same way  that James Bradley honored his by writing this wonderful work.	2000-05-20

After suffering through years of either bombast or glowing assessments by authors with ideological axes to grind or diplomatic masters to serve, readers get a genuinely honest and professional assessment from an observer  who carried no intellectual &quot;baggage&quot; to Vietnam.  The best work  on Vietnam since Bui Tin's memoirs. What a shame that the current US  administration could not be so realistic.  The true motivations of the  leaders of the &quot;former&quot; communist regimes in Vietnam and Cambodia  are more easily understood through Robert Templer's brilliant work.	2000-05-16

Told in an unusually vivid style, &quot;When Broken Glass Floats&quot; provides a striking new perspective even to those readers already hardened from study of events in Cambodia during the Pol Pot regime.  The scenes of  the evacuation of Phnom Penh, family separation, slow starvation, and the  deaths of members of the author's immediate family materialize as if on  film.	2000-04-08

The failed American military involvement in Laos presents a tough target for any researcher, but Dr. Castle successfully negotiates the obstacle course to gain access to and declassify critical documents which form the foundation for this valuable look back on an episode in danger of being  forgotten.  Well-documented interviews with key players of the time fill in  many but not all of the gaps.  Those readers more interested in the  personal impact on the families of those lost in action during this failed  campaign will find Castle's follow-on book &quot;One Day Too Long&quot; a  more direct fit to their needs.	2000-04-03

The author goes to great lengths to reveal all, even aspects which he knows many readers will find personally unflattering.  This work is an emotional one totally different in tone from his colleague  Robert Sam Anson's more hard-edged but equally distinguished work on the  same subject, &quot;War News&quot;.  Unable to shake his admitted addition  to seeking both the truth and personal fame in pursuit of same, Swain  abandoned the love of his life for what became yet another hostage  experience in Africa.  His more recent brushes with death in East Timor  show that his one-track obsession with his vocation remains intact.  All  those who once lost their hearts to Southeast Asia will see a little of  themselves in Jon Swain's realistic and accurate self-portrait.  A valuable  work by a charming an complex man widely admired by his colleagues in the  field and by his readers around the world.	2000-04-02

The rarest of gifts -- a credible account from a Vietnamese communist cadre! Bui Tin has done a great service to all of his countrymen, regardless political faction or religion. His assessments of legendary Vietnamese cadres, including Ho Chi Minh, Le Duan and Le Duc Anh are stunningly frank. Those interested in Vietnam or Cambodia should place this title on the top of their reading lists. There is simply no other work of its kind, although we can always hope that another courageous figure will follow in the author's footsteps.	2000-03-30

Total honesty is most frequently received as a slap in the face.  Unfortunately, the recipient can never seem to understand how richly-deserved or well-intentioned the painful gesture might be.  The  &quot;powers that be/were&quot; in Cambodia, the United Nations, and the  United States State Department, will only react with anger at the sting of  Henry Kamm's assessment of the current state of affairs in Cambodia. But  even that reaction would be an improvement over the past.  &quot;The  insouciant Khmer smile that continued to beam when there was nothing to  smile about&quot; infected UNTAC, US diplomacy, and the international  community immediately upon arrival in Cambodia.  As Kamm aptly puts it,  &quot;UN officials stationed in the poorest countries of the world share an  understandable inclination to work themselves into a constant state of  determined optimism about their mission&quot;. The modern American  &quot;politician diplomat&quot; is no different than his/her UN counterpart  in that regard. Readers of &quot;Why Vietnam Invaded Cambodia&quot; by  Stephen Morris will perhaps reach their own conclusions as to why only  Vietnam will remain secretly pleased at Cambodia's fate.<br />Henry Kamm has  made a major contribution with this remarkably blunt, decidedly angry work.  Anyone interested in Cambodia should take Henry Kamm's words to heart.	2000-01-27

Worth the price just for the detailed account of the conduct and aftermath of the less than totally successful $2 billion United Nations effort to bring peace and democracy to Cambodia.  Becker's account of the December  1978 killing of Malcolm Caldwell is riveting.  Her incorporation of the  personal stories of victims of the Pol Pot regime's Tuol Sleng  extermination center helps readers better understand the atmosphere of  those terrible days.

A scholarly analysis of the history behind the 1978-89 Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia, followed by the author's brutally frank assessment of the consequences.  As the author states, a final assessment  is premature, but recent events do indeed cause the reader to wonder how  long the Vietnamese will continue to be pleased with the tactics of its  &quot;clients&quot;.

Ten of their colleagues, including Sean Flynn and Dana  Stone, were captured in the same vicinity one month previously.  None of  the ten were ever accounted for.  Highly recommended reading to those  interested in the fates of the many journalists lost in Southeast Asia.  &quot;War News&quot; by Robert Sam Anson is the only similar account known.  Readers will want to review &quot;Requiem&quot; by Tim Page for a  photographic tribute to these brave journalists to whom we are so indebted.	1999-12-24

A place where guilt or innocence is irrelevant to the task at hand. \\"Voices from S-21\\" is an in-depth study of extensive archives of S-21 \\"death confessions\\" interwoven with stunning interviews of surviving Khmer Rouge cadre who try to explain how and why they carried out the orders of the \\"Upper Brothers\\". David Chandler's meticulous research sets the stage for his thoughtful, scholarly, and compassionate analysis of this horrorific Cambodian tragedy, and places the brutal acts that occurred there in international historical perspective. With \\"Duch\\", the former S-21 commander, now in detention awaiting an agreement on an international tribunal on crimes against humanity during the Pol Pot regime, \\"Voices from S-21\\" is most timely, and will be an invaluable resource to human rights advocates around the world.<br /><br />This book served in some ways as an inspiration to Ysa Osman, a young Cambodian Muslim researcher at the Documentation Center of Cambodia, who in September 2002 published \\"Oukoubah - Justice for Cham Muslims under the DK Regime.\\" The author profiles 13 Cham Muslims who were held at S-21, including one of the most vicious interrogators on the staff who was eventually himself executed there. Using biographical material in their confessions, this ambitious reseacher tracked down surviving family members and neighbors for the full details of how each prisoner was arrested and an overview of DK genocide against Muslims. Highly recommended for readers of \\"Voices from S-21.\\"<br /><br />Updates -- The 2005 DVD version of Pan Rithy's film \\"S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine\\" is an equally brilliant look at S-21. Two surviving prisoners and numerous former KR cadre assigned at S-21 discuss the insanity and barbarity that once filled S-21 and the its associated killing field at Choeung Ek. The 2005 book \\"The Chain of Terror\\" by the impressive young scholar Meng Try Ea of the Documentation Center of Cambodia provides an inside look at the horrors of the KR Southwestern Zone's prison system.k \\"The Chain of Terror\\" by the impressive young scholar Meng Try Ea of the Documentation Center of Cambodia provides an inside look at the horrors of the KR Southwestern Zone's prison system.	1999-12-08

Readers should refer to Professor David  Chandler's upcoming &quot;Voices from S-21&quot; for further insight into  the how this prison came into existence.	1999-12-07
