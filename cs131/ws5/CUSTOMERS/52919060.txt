(Baby Blues Scrapbook No. 11)	Books	3	0	6	N	N	This series is starting to run out of steam	I have all the previous 10 Baby Blues albums and would give every one of them five stars. But judging by this very uneven collection, the authors are starting to run out of steam. The problem is that the older Zoe gets,  the more she encroaches upon the territory which rightly belongs to Calvin  and Hobbes. Perhaps a well-timed retirement would be the best solution	1999-04-19

A small team of police investigators probing the disappearance  of a journalist stumble across evidence of a huge drug smuggling ring based  in Azerbaijan. The atmospherics are superb and every page reeks superbly of  authentic corruption. A must-read	1999-03-29

The idea of maverick KGB and Foreign Trade Ministry  officials trying to bring down the West on their own is tantalising but  unfortunately the author doesn't quite manage to pull it off. The  characterisation is weak at best and the ending dissolves needlessly into  bloody murder and mayhem rather that probing the deeper implications of the  plot.	1999-03-18

A series of nasty murders threatens to scupper  the opening ceremony and panic sweeps through the region amidst rumours  that the angry spirits of the local nomadic Nenets people are taking their  revenge for the destruction of their traditional homeland by the oil and  gas industry. The book is sometimes marred by some rough and ready  translation from the Russian (and some abominable proof-reading) but is a  must-read.

The authors, both of whom  were born in the Soviet Union and know it inside out, use a real incident  to build up a gripping picture of quite how dissolute Moscow was in the  1980s. Anyone who enjoyed Gorky Park should buy this book, which is much  better	1999-03-06

But the book veers off course towards the end, after Stalin's death, when Knight tries to persuade  us that the mass murderer was in fact a closet reformer who proposed  freeing many of the prisoners he himself had incarcerated and wanted a more  relaxed line with East Germany.

In the 1980s Yuri Druzhnikov decided to find out the  truth behind Pavlik Morozov -- allegedly killed by relatives in the 1930s  for informing the authorities that his father was hoarding grain -- and  produced this stunning book. By talking to Morozov's mother, neighbours and  some of the police investigators on the case he builds up a very different  picture from the public myth. To say too much more would betray his  conclusions, but it's safe to say that here is another of those books which  no self-respecting historian of Stalinism can afford to ignore.	1999-02-27

Like virtually no other work I've read on the subject it brings home quite how anarchic life  was for many people and how the ludicrously inhuman way in which the Soviet  Union was run helped crush the population's soul. Anyone interested enough  in this topic to probe further should also read &quot;An American Engineer  in Stalin's Russia&quot;, which is almost as good as this work.  Andreev-Khomiakov's greatest talent is his ability to wriggle right into  the psyches of the opposers and the opposed to produce a graphic  explanation of what was so wrong with the Soviet Union in the 1930s. He  also produces enough anecdotes to show how some people can retain their  most human qualities at a time when everyone around them is descending into  brutality. I say again -- this is a quite extraordinary work. Buy it now!	1999-02-24

Forget the talk of five-year plans, the controlled economy, Stakhanovites and anything which might suggest the economy ran on  organised lines. Witkin spells out with fascinating clarity the  extraordinary extent to which anarchy ruled and is especially good on the  back-stabbing venal managers who were so keen to promote their own  interests that they did huge damage to the enterprises where they worked.  The flowery passages on Witkin's unhappy love life are less interesting but  do not really detract from the power of the work as a whole. Michael Gelb  deserves a reward for uncovering such a crucial memoir.	1999-02-23

But for me the best section was the one which covered Luck's imprisonment in Soviet  Georgia after the war, which was curiously moving and gave a very good idea  of what it must have been like for the countless hundreds of thousands of  defeated Germans packed off into the Soviet hinterland.	1999-02-12

Reynolds  fills page after page with the exact starting locations of the German  forces but it's no better than gibberish because without decent maps the  reader has no chance of deciphering what on earth is going on.

Perhaps  the NSA got to this author too, since after the first 100 pages we had  already been introduced to about 150 acronyms, plenty of mini-biographies  of the many NSA staffers involved and virtually no interesting facts. A  recent article in the IHT said that the amount of intercepts each day could  fit into a block 20 yards wide and 10 yards high. If you imagine how much  must have been produced since the early 1950s it is very disappointing to  find none of it in the book.	1998-09-01

I have never thrown a book across the room in frustration at the vapidity of the plot as much as this one. Neanderthal must rank as one of the worst books ever written. My two-year-old daughter could do better. The idea of not one but TWO tribes of Neanderthals inhabiting the same small area of Tajikistan is bad enough, but to wrap up the plot with the gentle, peace-loving apes killing off the homicidal strain with the help of a few errant human beings is farcical. Appalling. Abysmal. The thesaurus empties before me as I pick every single synonym in the &quot;atrocious&quot; category. This book is an insult to the intelligence and shame on the film studio which bought it. One wonders how far the author would have progressed down the road to publication without his high-level contacts. This may sound unduly cynical, but I can see no other explanation for this alleged thriller ever making it into print.	1998-01-20
