The babies were all male, all healthy, under 3 months old, and apparently all neglected or unwanted. The local police have given up. Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte is called in after a fifth baby goes missing, and this time, the mother is killed. Of all the cases he's worked, this one has him entering a foreign world of infants. He calls in an assistant on this one, Police Constable Alice McGorr for a little female insight.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It was a treat to see Bony working with a partner. But the domestic side is never allowed to overshadow the mystery. It's not at all warm and fuzzy, just a pleasant change and setting for this book. Highly recommended and worth searching for.<br /><br />CMB	2005-09-14

William Tyndale is widely regarded as the \\"Father of the English Bible.\\" Before his time, the Bible was only available in Latin. Common folk were not expected to understand the word of God. They were expected to get all their scriptural knowledge directly from the Church, who would them tell them what it meant. Seeking to know for themselves was heresy. Tyndale thought such practices were contrary to the will of God. He sought to make the Bible available to the common man in his own tongue--English.<br /><br />It's hard to believe today, with the number of translations of the Bible out there, that at one time having a copy of the Bible in English would mean your death. The book opens with several people being burned at the stake for having a few verses in English. Sadly, it ends more or less with the death of Tyndale. But he had begun something that couldn't be stopped. Just a few years after his death, The Great Bible was in every parish in England--and it was in English. He was a man that filled a unique mission on earth.<br /><br />This book will really make you appreciate how fortunate we are to be able to have the word of God.	2004-11-02

So when he's asked to represent a client being sued for divorce, he unhesitatingly says no. But it's a lot more complicated than that, as the wife is accusing the husband of forcing her into \\"unnatural contact\\" with another man. The actual case he's asked to represent is for slander. The wife is using the defense of truth. Antony and everyone else realizes that his client hasn't much chance of winning, and that this case will resolve the divorce case.<br /><br />At first, Antony is reluctant, but agrees to represent the man as a favor to a friend. But when he comes to believe in his client's innocence, he starts poking around. Then everything changes when the wife is murdered.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book a lot. The characters were great.

His mother was being blackmailed, and rather than ask for help, she killed herself. The police think that Roger has tracked down the blackmailer and killed him. Roger says the man was already dead.

Somewhere in this infernal journal she hoped to find a key that would provide entry to Harriet's will.<br />She learned of 2 ruined romances--one accidentally deleted, the other deliberatley erased. She followed the diarist's painful passage from blithe young girl to bitter old woman. What was in the lines saddened Susan. What was between them terrifed her.

It begins with his service during the terrible famine in Ethiopia in the 1980's and continues until his release from his assignment as a member of the Quorum of the Seventy assigned to the Africa West Area.<br />I really enjoyed this book. It was a fascinating story. It sure made me appreciate the great blessings I enjoy as a member of the church living in the United States. The first chapter is mostly quotes about the plan of the gospel, and I think, slows the book down. These would have been better placed at the end.<br />The book includes many of Elder Pace's talks, including his address in General Conference of April 2000. The pictures are wonderful. My favorite was the picture of Sister Pace talking to a woman who was carrying a sewing machine on her head! Now, that's ingenuous.

Hall Nightingale Series Edition)	Books	3	10	10	N	N	My least favorite so far	I really love Miss Seeton, so when I found this one I snatched it up, since it is hard to find. But what a disappointment. It really seemed like the author just took all the previous characters and sort of pushed them into situations to see what happened. Miss Seeton and Lady Colveden are still recognizable, but Sir George is a buffoon, nothing like he is in previous books.<br />The plot isn't very strong. The descriptions of Miss Seeton's drawings, which are, after all, key to the whole book, are not very detailed and don't really even resemble her previous drawings.<br />Then there's the shipboard romance between Delpick and Mel Forby. Where did that come from? It doesn't belong at all. There's never been a hint of that in previous books.<br />In my opinion, Heron Carvic was really the best writer of this series. As the creator, he really knew the characters best. Hamilton Crane (Sarah J. Mason) does an excellent job of making the stories timely without losing the flavor of the period in which they are set. Her characterization is right on, too. But Hampton Charles, whoever he is, never really seemed to understand the series. Just a disappointment. Diehard Seeton fans will still want a copy of this one, but everyone else might as well forget it.	2003-11-25

I enjoyed this British mystery, which centers largely around Parliament's House of Lords. That was interesting, since I know nothing at all about how it works or waht they do there. The plot was pretty good too, although the ending didn't really wrap everything up the way I expected and there was no real climax to speak of.<br />My main complaint was the characters. I didn't really like anyone in the book, except perhaps for the policeman assigned to solve the case. The book centers around a woman, &quot;Jack&quot; Troutbeck, who is elevated to a peeress. She immediately jumps into controversy by supporting the traditional English hunt, which animal rights activists are trying to outlaw. She ropes in a reluctant friend to help on her campaign, Robert Amiss. Although he's out of work and in India looking for a new job, he drops everything to come help her out. Soon the action picks up, with a terrorist attack in Parliament and peers dropping like flies.<br />Jack is abrasive and coarse. She's independent enough, and occasionally funny, but not often enough that I could really stand her very long. Amiss comes off as a wimp (he admits it himself several times during the book) and I wondered why he would even stick around since Jack took him for granted during the entire book.<br />I was not impressed at all by the characters and I sure won't be reading another one of these books.	2003-11-21

Then, of course, Samson finds himself back in business.<br />Picking his way through a maze of intrigues, lures, and lies, barely surviving the aggravation of the hostile police, confronted within an hour by two murderers, narrowly escaping death by scissors, Samson wonders if it isn't time for him to hand up his gumshoes and learn an honest trade.<br />Through sheer wit and guts, Samson comes out on top by getting to the bottom of the most tatnatlizng and entertaining puzzle yet devised by Michael Z. Lewin.<br />Hope this helped. I hate it when I want to find out more about a book and Amazon doesn't have a thing.<br />CMB	2003-11-14

Marric writes the best police procedurals I've ever read. His books are all about Scotland Yard. The characters repeat throughout the series. I enjoy that, because you can see the characters evolve over the years and watch relationships develop.<br />The book revolves, however, around George Gideon, Commander of Scotland Yard. Gideon is the heart of the police force. Not a single man is unworthy of his attention. He is briefed and ready on every single case.<br />I just love these books!

Just when he was getting used to the new dog, a mockingbird shows up that seems stuck on the song Yankee Doodle. Work isn't much better, since a string of odd crimes has the Homicide Squad baffled. A con man was shot in a car and manages to scribble the word &quot;Jewels&quot; before dying. An old woman was killed in some sort of voodoo ritual. Another old woman running a boarding house was killed. The crimes just keep piling up.<br />I like these books, but they do have a few problems. One is that the author tries so hard to make each character an individual that they wind up being more like stereotypes than real people. Another is that they are really dated. This was published in 1969 and slang and cultural trends have changed a lot in over 30 years. Still, it's a good read for anyone who likes police procedurals.	2003-10-21

And not some everyday crime, but an ambassador's wife shot to death right in the middle of a reception at their own house.<br />Sir Edward Ironmonger, sent to the US from the fictional Caribbean country Tampica, was devoted to his beautiful wife, Mavis. But many had reason to want the woman dead, some because they were incensed at the interracial marriage, some because Mavis was so stupid that she was likely to ruin Ironmonger's career, and some because of past love affairs likely to come back to haunt them. Since the crime took place at the embassy, Ironmonger's seizes the chance to avoid calling in the DC police (he's in the middle of delicate negotiations with the US Navy and doesn't want the US involved in the crime scene) and asks for help from Scotland Yard.<br />I'm not sure how plausible that is, and various other points seem prett unlikely. But I like the mystery and the characters enough to go along with it. The story moves quickly. The Tibbets return again and again to the Caribbean in this book, The Coconut Killings,  and Angel Death. This is the first in the Caribbean series, followed by the others in that order.	2003-10-02

But someone must take notice when her dead body is found in the art building.<br />There are lots of suspects: the headmaster herself, the art teacher and her patron, the goddaughter and the nephew of the victim. Scotland Yard, in the form of Inspector Pollard and Sergeant Toye, must untangle all the motives and see who the real murderer is.<br />I enjoyed this book. I like the English mysteries. The setting is completely foreign to me, since I know nothing about private (or as they call it, Public) school. But I liked it anyway.	2003-10-02

But first she has to solve an important clue--the bride quilt, embroidered with little multi-colored bees.<br />I really liked this mystery.

Anthony Maitland's good friend, Jeremy Skelton, decides to produce a restoration play by Sir John Cartwright. Another good friend, Meg Hamilton, is set to star. But before opening night, a series of mysterious warnings, ghostly voices, and accidents, has half the cast believing that the playwright's ghost is opposed to the play. When one of the actors breaks his leg and another is nearly gassed, Meg and Jeremy ask Anthony to investigate. But even Maitland is too late to prevent a murder. The question is, who want to stop the play badly enough that they are willing to kill?<br />I really liked this book. I found it at a library sale and I was very excited because it's one I hadn't read before. I really like Woods' books and I wish they were in print. It's not the best, but it's still really good. If you can find a copy, it's worth buying.	2003-10-02

Inspector Henry Tibbett is in Switzerland at an internation conference on drug smuggling. His wife Emmy came along to enjoy all the parties and the shopping. But their trip become a lot more serious when a participant in the conference is murdered and Henry becomes the only suspect. They are both drawn into a bewildering swirl of social activity among the upper classes while Henry fights to clear his name. He makes time, though, for a little flirtation with another woman, and between the crime, the woman, and the social scene, he's soon in real trouble.<br />I enjoyed this one, but not as much as some of her other books. I didn't like the addition of the other woman, although I can see why it was important to the plot. Moyes brings back characters from Dead Men Don't Ski, which is fun. A good book, but not her best.	2003-10-02

One, a local charity group is sponsoring a drive to buy wheelchairs for children, Two, The construction of the channel tunnel is inspiring a visit to France, and Three, Mrs. Blaine and Miss Nuttel (the Nuts) have a visitor. Guess which topic is generating the most discussion?<br />All seems quiet on the Miss Seeton front, at least, and the book is deceptively crime-free for the first half or more. But murder eventually strikes, and all that peace and quiet is bound to come to a spectacular end. It's enough to put Anglo-French relations back 20 years!<br />I really enjoy this series. I love Miss Seeton and her crazy neighbors crack me up. Really funny.	2003-10-02

But Marigold has a secret. Miss Seeton decides to help the girl, and chaos naturally ensues.<br />A very funny book. I really loved the ending.

Wealthy Lord Charlton decides to alter his will, leaving everything to his missing nephew whom he hasn't seen since the boy was a baby. Simon Warwick was adopted after his parents were killed in an Air Raid, and taken to America as a one-year-old. But no one knows the name of his parents, where he is now, or what his new name is. It seems almost impossible to find him, and when Lord Charlton dies before the missing heir can be found, his lawyer is stuck.<br />But 2 men show up, each claiming to be the missing nephew. Before the lawyer can validate the claims of either one, one of the men is dead.<br />Enter Chief Superintendent Henry Tibbett. He must uncover the backgrounds of both heirs, the dead man and his rival, who is now suspect number one. He thinks he has it all figured out when a jaw-dropping plot twist changes everything.<br />I really enjoyed this book. I probably would not have given it 5 stars because I did guess the identity of the murderer quite early, but the book is really two mysteries, the identity of the murderer, and the identity of Simon Warwick. And the the latter involved a plot twist I have never before seen in a mystery book and it may still be unique. Even if someone else has used it, I am sure that this is the first time it was ever used, and it will blow you away. Wow! Wow! Wow!	2003-09-17

This one, unlike some Dead Men Don't Ski and others, really does start about as a vacation, but before long, he's interested in the recent drowning of local sailor Pete Rawnsley. Something about the death just doesn't sound right to Henry. He's also interested in recent jewel robbery in the area. Before long, another murder convinces him that the two are related. Now the question is, can he save Emmy from being the next victim?<br />I enjoyed this book a lot. You don't have to be sailor to like it, but if you knew something about boats (I don't) you'd probably enjoy it more. I still really liked it. I like the whole series and I wish that more of Moyes books were still in print.	2003-09-17

Mason, a bookie, had made it big and wanted entry into country society. He was determined to buy the Manciple home, Cregwell Grange. But the owner, Major George Manciple, will not sell. So when Mason is shot leaving the Manciple home, the villagers don't have to look very far for the murderer. Not that they don't sympathize, since none of them like Mason either. But Tibbett still has to get to the bottom of it all. It's not easy, since the Manciples have their own ideas of conversation and he has a hard time even getting an account of the murder, with George seeming determined to be considered chief suspect, Violet chasing every thought that comes into her mind, Aunt Dora refusing to wear her hearing aid, and the Bishop treating everything as a crossword puzzle.<br />This is the funniest of the Tibbett books. I love the Manciple family. They come back later in Twice in a Blue Moon and I must say, they age very well. I love this one.	2003-09-17

Patrons in the pub did see the murderer--a man wearing a false beard and dark glasses. Newly promoted Superintendent Henry Tibbett is puzzled by the murder, but even more puzzled by a friend's request to investigate the deaths of two elderly politicians. His friend is convinced the two men, both members of PIFL, a mythical division of the UN or something that solves minor border disbutes, were actually murdered. Henry is not convinced, since there appears to be no logical motive. But he investigates anyway, and soon, finds a link between the death of the crook and the deaths of two men involved in an African border dispute. Two beautiful sisters, one an employee of PIFL and one a frequent visitor to the pub where the man was murdered, know a lot more than they're saying. Henry follows the clues to Holland, accompanied by  his wife, Emmy. Emmy should have stayed at home, though, because she become involved in the final confrontation with an international criminal determined to escape one more time.<br />I enjoyed this murder. The plot is really  hard to summarize and probably sounds quite confusing, but it really works out quite well in the book. The pace is a little slow, but once the characters get to the Netherlands it proceeds very quickly. I really like Patricia Moyes. Henry and Emmy are great characters. If you like old-fashioned mysteries without a lot of graphic violence or sex and not as dark as  many modern writers, I think you'd like this book. I am only sorry it's not in print.	2003-09-17

When a letter supposedly from the dead man to his &quot;Dorothy darling&quot; is discovered in his pocket, she become the chief suspect. But this is not a good time for a corpse. She's right in the middle of writing a religious play and fears the publicity would kill any career she might hope to have in serious religous writing.<br />So when the Detective Club next meets, her friends all decide to help the police by discovering the identity of the dead man, so the police can find who really killed the man and leave their friend alone. But it doesn't work like that. The evidence all points to a possible connection between the dead man and the writer that even her friends can't deny.<br />The other writers all give up after Dorothy finds out what they're up to. Only Agatha Christie hangs on, and before long, the two women are in a desperate race to save the lives of the next victims. But as the deaths mount up and the police ask more questions, the two greatest mystery writers of the age are almost outwitted by a determined killer.<br />I enjoyed this book. I didn't really know much about the life of Dorothy Sayers and I enjoyed finding out more about who she really was. I love Agatha Christie and I liked reading about her. Another thing I loved was reading about their fellow members of the Detection Club. It made me want to read more of their books.<br />My main complaint is that the identity of the murderer become obvious too early. I couldn't believe that either of the women took that long to figure it out. And the police aren't really that dumb either. It wasn't that believable. But it was fun. If you're a fan of either writer, you will probably enjoy the book, but it's certainly no substitute for the real thing.	2003-09-17

It also has maps on each page showing where the snake lives. One minor problem, it uses a lot of technical terms like \\"Fossorial\\" and \\"Riparian\\". But (I discovered after my fourth trip to the dictionary) it has a glossary in the back.<br />However, one major problem. There is no clear indication which snakes are poisonous, which are a little dangerous to humans, and which are harmless. This is a big drawback. I want to know without having to read through the text for a clue if the snake that just entered my tent is going to kill me or not. Some of the time it doesn't tell you even in the text, as in some of the rattlesnakes. Of course, you assume that rattlers are not exactly friendly, but a clear symbol or icon would really help. So would a section letting you know what to do if you've been bitten by a snake.	2003-05-23

I've been getting a little tired of the series anyway, but I thought this might really be something different, something fun. It wasn't nearly as good as I had expected. These tales are slight at best, and mere sketches at worst. I was hoping for something meaty with some depth. Even she wanted to write some short stories, did they have to be this short? I don't really understand the whole point of this book. I think the idea was to just present some sketches that portray a certain mood, and if that's what you're looking for, you may enjoy the book. There are some good stories. I liked the one about the blacksmith and the story of the horseradish ship. But both could have been developed a little more. The opening story was pretty pointless, in my opinion. Altogether disappointing in almost every way.	2003-03-15

Not as a victim, and certainly not as the bad guy, but as the one delivering the million and a half dollars in ransom to the Swiss bank where the terrorist group known as Black Tuesday will pick it up.<br />Poor Thatcher. He likes a quiet life. But nothing goes his way. The ransom is picked up by a blond packbacker who immediately disappears. The terrorists remain quiet, but it takes weeks before the victim reappears. And when he does, the questions just become louder. Because the victim was the major figure in an important oil drilling contract for the North Sea in Scotland. His company wins the bid and are just beginning to get things ironed out when someone plants a bomb in his car. Then it turns out that he had never been kidnapped in the first place. So what happened to all that ransom money?<br />I always like Emma Lathen's books, but since they are out of print, they are hard to find.

But the one who has the hardest time making the change from army life to civilian life is Alex.  As happy as he is to be home with Anna and their baby, he's jumpy and suffers from nightmares. He's also unsure what he wants from the rest of his life. Bobbi is unsure who she wants to marry!<br />Meanwhile, back at home, LaRue goes through some changes and Beverly discovers dating. Bea and Al have some changes to face too.<br />I really loved this book. I have to admit, my knowledge and understanding of WWII is not very strong. But I was really drawn into the stories of this family, and through them, the whole history of the war. I think every major aspect of the war was touched on in some way. I really rejoiced with the whole family when everyone was reunited. Even if you're not LDS, I think you would enjoy this series.

Two of the investigating officers ar dead, \\"accidentally\\" it seems, but Coffin suspects murder. A bizarre fire yields another body, apparently the wife of one of the dead officers.

This books imagines that Prince Eddy, engaged to marry the late Queen Mary of England, never died. In fact, he did, and she married his brother, King George, the parents of the current Queen Elizabeth. (I think) It's a good thing they put a pedigree chart in the front, because I couldn't keep all these imaginary people straight and I had to keep referring back to it. I suppose the main reason for writing it like this is that the writer can imagine his own royal family instead of having to deal with the one we've got. But I was rather confused. I think the author should have decided to write either a straight mystery based on real people, one based wholely on imaginary people, or an alternate reality book. Instead it's a mix. The characters were well drawn but the mystery was a little unclear and the whole thing was confusing. Some of the relationships were a little unbelievable too.	2002-09-30

Michael Innes's mysteries are sophisticated and quirky. Anyway, it was pretty good, then I got to the ending and wow! What a surprise! I had to give it 5 stars.<br />Appleby's neighbor, Carl Carson, has a loopy wife and lots of money troubles. He decides the only way out of his problems is to arrange for the kidnapping of his son. One problem--He doesn't have a son.<br />If you've never read an Appleby book, this might not be the best place to start, but it's still great.	2002-09-20

The main character is a woman, Ms. Tree. She's a private investigator looking into some violence against abortion clinics.<br />I didn't like the format, I didn't like the characters, I didn't like the plot. But hey, you  may love it.

I thought a good clean romance would be great. Well, it is clean. But it's boring and annoying too. Christy whines too much. She's always feeling sorry for herself about the slightest thing. She just seems so young and immature. I don't understand her attraction to Todd either. He doesn't treat her very well at all. She should have dumped him! Being a good Christian does not mean being a doormat.<br />I see that everyone else just loved this book. This makes me think that I am really not the target audience. If you are looking for clean Young Adult romance, you may enjoy it. But if you are looking for a romance with fully developed and compelling characters, this is not it.	2002-08-15

Are they just too trendy? I am a Mormon, and I was bothered by that whole angle. What purpose did it serve, really? Just to show that some Mormons are wierd religious fanatics. Well, so are some Catholics, some Baptists, some Adventists. But you knew if Fremont was crossing the country on a train, it would have to run into trouble in Utah, and rather than get rescued by a normal, average Mormon family it had to be the fundamentalist self-styled prophet who claimed she had been sent by an angel to be his fifth wife.<br />OK, got that out of my system. All that aside, I was still disappointed by the book. Like another reviewer said, the bad guy was sort of tacked on at the end. There was no hint that he was even around. Where did he come from? I liked bringing Mei Ling back. That whole spiritual angle could have been played up a little better.<br />Overall, a disappointment. I read the next one, Beacon Street Mourning, and it was better, although still not as good as the first two in the series, which were really outstanding.	2002-07-16

Four years later, his mother gets a call she swears comes from her son, saying he's fine. Henri Castang, former French police officer, agrees to investigate. So far, so good. But then it turns out that the grandfather of the little boy was a former SS agent who had a illegitimate child with a Czechoslovakian woman, and of course, that explains the kidnapping.<br />This plot was really far-fetched. The characters were unbelievable and flat. But the really awful part was the writing. I can accept a thin plot if the characters are interesting and the writing is good. But it was very frustrating trying to read this. I gave up after 6 chapters and just skimmed through the rest. The writer puts in whole conversations without identifying the speakers. He treats thoughts and words the same way. The characters, especially Castang, will carry on two conversations, one real and one imagined, at the same time. I had no idea what was going on. I will not read another one of these books.	2002-06-19

The book is organized by course, salad, soup, pizza/pasta, etc. Each tip is accompanied by at least one recipe. There's a lot of great ideas I never thought of. Some are pretty standard, like using evaporated milk to substitute for cream, but she also suggests using roasted eggplant or garlic to replace a lot of the fat in recipes. I'm not really working on getting rid of all the fat in our diet, but my husband and I are trying to replace a lot of the animal and dairy products with more veggies. Cutting out dairy alone has helped me lose almost 20 pounds. But even if you're a confirmed dairy/meat eater, there's still lots of ways to cut the fat in this book. I really recommend it.	2002-06-07

My cat recently had kittens, and this book was no help at all. It has no section on pregnancy, only a very small section on breeding your cat for profit. Well, this was purely accidental, but I still wanted some help on caring for her during her pregnancy and labor, as well as some tips on caring for the kittens. It doesn't have anything like a section on kitten developmental stages. When do they eat solid food? When can I separate them from their mother? When should I get her fixed so we don't do this again? It also didn't have much on caring for sick or injured cats. What it did have, and I really didn't need, was a section on teaching your cat tricks. Hello! She's a cat, not a dog. I don't really need to teach her tricks. Of course, if you are interested, then this book may help. But it didn't have what I was looking for at all.	2002-06-05

Melissa Craig decides to go on a writer's retreat and gets mixed up in a murder. The victim was the much disliked owner of the school hosting the retreat. There were a lot of twists and turns in the plot, but I had a hard time understanding why it took everyone in the book so long to figure out what was going on, when I already had it figured out. But I will admit that I was surprised by the final identity of the murderer at the end. I'm willing to read the next one by this author, but I wish that writers would really surprise me a little more often.	2002-05-31

When Kate moves into a new neighborhood, she decides the time has come to start a baby-sitting coop and get back into the workforce. She enlists one other mom and one mom wannabe to help her out. But she finds her calling takes up all her time, and meanwhile, baby-sitting is turning out to be more than she bargained for.<br />I really liked this book. Every mom I know has felt inadequate sometimes (Or maybe a lot of times.) But that's pretty normal. Being able to laugh about it helps a lot.<br />Although I enjoyed this book and laughed throughout, I kind of had a problem with the end. The idea that some mom could explain her bad relationship with her son as a lack of hormone-triggered bonding at birth was a little hard to swallow. I don't know that Kidd actually believes this, but it seemed a bit much. The whole message of the book is that motherhood is a combination of what you do and who you are, so the ending seemed a little inconsistent to me.	2002-05-24

The Paradise View ward could be any ward of the church, but especially one here in Utah. The funeral scene is about the funniest thing I've ever read. It's reassuring to know that we all feel inadequate in our callings, feel lonely at home sometimes, and that every smiling face in church on Sunday masks a lot of problems inside.  But if we can laugh about it, we're ahead of the game. Every Mother's Day I remember the brother who decided to give all the moms frozen TV dinner instead of flowers. Didn't work.<br />If you think Mormons don't have a sense of humor, you need to check this book out. Best of her books so far.	2002-05-24

Ever wished you had magical powers? What would you do with them?  Well, the message of this book is that we should all try to help each other get along, even if we have magical powers. The kids love their neighbor, because she's friendly and nice. There are a series of books about the witch and they all involve fairness, friendliness, and good humor. Even when the witch confronts prejudice and gets angry, she doesn't get mean. She solves the problem in the nicest way possible.<br />These books are written by the author of the Clifford books, and just like Clifford teaches us about being good neighbors and getting along, these books have the same message. And they use magic as well! Pretty cool.	2002-05-24

I like Faith Fairchild, although her gourmet attitude gets kind of annoying sometimes. I mean, reading about her life is like reading about a foreign country. But it can be very entertaining. But this time  out, all we got were leftovers. It seems like the writer is getting tired of the Boston area and decided to cast around for more interesting backgrounds.  We've done Paris, done Norway, done the coast, now it's time for NYC.  Problem is, she left all the other characters we care about behind.  By setting this book before Faith got married, all we hear about is her parents and sis (OK, kind of interesting), a boyfriend we know she didn't marry, and a friend we never heard of before. She didn't even include a epilogue that wrapped everything together and brought it back to the present. I was really disappointed.	2002-05-19

He frequently goes to the post office with me. But the book itself has plenty going for it.  It's a sweet, simple book.  My son loves it. The text is very simple, the pictures are simple. I think that is a major part of its appeal. Not every book has to have complicated pictures and complex plots. But it's cute, has a nice ending, and my 5 year old liked it.	2002-05-13

I wasn't really crazy about that one, but I love discovering new authors, or new to me, so I read this one too. I should have stopped when I was ahead.<br />The \\"plot\\" involves the disappearance of a reclusive elderly couple following a bad storm. The local police almost immediately suspect the son and a former neighbor. Just when the investigation is getting rolling, a detective steals a script of the neighbors autobiography. (Which would be against any police procedure) The next 150 pages are that book! What's up with that? If you wanted to write that book, write that book. I was expecting a detective story. It was very frustrating and disappointing. I am going to avoid this author in the future.	2002-04-29

But after two Coast Guards are murdered, the Prince of Wales sends them to investigate. It doesn't take long before they realize that smuggling in involved. With the help of Rudyard Kipling, they soon realize how many secrets the seemingly quaint and quiet town is hiding.<br />I enjoyed this book in the series.

This book starts from the basics and covers everything. My cat is expecting kittens and I'm very nervous about this whole thing. The book told me just what I needed to know about how to care for her and the kittens. It has cat first aid, a symptom chart for when your cat is sick, and tips on choosing a cat. It has it all. A great book for the cat owner, and a great gift for a friend.	2002-04-29

Somehow they catch fire and burn to death. How did it happen? The police are satisfied it was a freak accident, but the couple's daughter doesn't believe it. She hired ex-CID detective John Webber to find out what really happened.<br />After such a bizarre opening, it takes good, solid detection to find out the identity of the killer. I found the story and characers very interesting, but sometime the story moved a little slow. I skipped around during some of the descriptive parts. Although this story is old and out of print, if you do come across it, you may enjoy it. But it wasn't so great that I'd recommend scouring the used bookstores until you find it.	2002-04-29

What could be wrong? Miss Lemon is worried about her sister. She is housemother at a student boarding house.  Odd thefts are occurring and she's worried. Poirot soon catches one of the thieves, but it's obvious there's something sinister going on.<br />I liked Christie's take on the college scene in England. The students are many and varied, but each well-written. As always, she give plenty of clues. But as always, you don't know which clues are the important ones.<br />If you like Christie and haven't read this one, I really recommend it.	2002-04-29

My son was really worried about the cat having an acupuncture treatment.<br />That said, it was a very helpful book. We just adopted a stray and now she's having kittens. I really wanted some insight into cat behavior and cat care. A lot of the alternative treatments described in here seem a little far-fetched. I think they could help humans, but I'm not taking my cat in to the chiropractor. That said, if YOU would take your cat to the chirorpractor, this book would be very helpful. It also covers basics like house training, nutrition, and health disorders. The book is divided into sections and colorcoded for each one. It's very easy to follow and understand.<br />Great book for cat owners;, however if the alternative treatments are not something you'd pursue, you may just want to check it out from the library like I did.	2002-04-29

Inspector Quantrill discovers a connection to the Rectory. But just who killed the man and why?<br />I liked this book at first. The opening was promising. But too soon we were presented with too few suspects. The whole explanation of crime was a little far-fetched and I found the end disappointing and vague. We find out the identity of the murderer, but the motivation was weak and never explained to my satisfaction.<br />I expected more.	2002-04-29

He was in love with her adopted sister. She thought she'd never see him again. But when things changed and he came back into her life, she loved him more than ever.<br /><br />I liked this book.

That's overdone, I think.	2002-04-29

We just adopted a stray, and although I had cats as a child, I found out that I really didn't know much about cat care or cat behavior. I found this book very interesting. But it wasn't really informative. Most questions are answered in a page or less. I recommend it as a quick read, but unless you really love cats or love reading about them, I would recommend you borrow it or check it out from the library like I did.

Her characters are interesting and her plots are each different. But that's sort of the problem. Some of her characters, like Judith's mom in the B&B series, are a little TOO interesting. I get awfully tired of Judith and her mom arguing. And some of the plots in that series are kind of off the wall. I mean, I like my mysteries to have some surprises in them, but too much is still too much. I was really unimpressed with the latest one I read.<br />That's why I was interested in exploring this series. And this one is more to my taste. There are some eccentrics, but mostly it's just small town life on a believable scale. Of course, like Judith, Emma Lord has her share of romantic problems and kid problems. But I enjoyed this one a lot more than the B&B ones.	2002-03-04

Sometimes when you hear everyone tell you how great a book is, it doesn't meet your expectations. This book wasn't perfect, but it was a good book that involved you in the characters right away. I could hardly put it down.<br />The book is at its strongest when it focuses on Officer Stacey and Christina. Their stories were the most compelling and the most interesting. Most of the characters were well developed. But it bogged down a little when we got involved in all the secret identity stuff and conspiracy. But still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a good thriller but is getting a little tired of the same old authors.	2002-01-22

She's independent, strong, and happily married. That's a nice combination. We also have a lot in common, since I was born in Texas and live in the West right now.<br />This book finds Benni and her husband Gabe on a trip to meet his family. Benni's husband is the silent type, and she soon discovers that she doesn't know as much about him as she'd like to. There's a murder (of course) and Benni can't help getting involved (also of course). Benni is having trouble bonding with her in-laws when she suspect them and everyone else of being involved in murder. Gee, my in-law trouble are so normal. Anyway, lots of fun.

I was wrong. This book is dark, depressing, and not very engaging. Robin Light is taking over her dead husband's pet store. He died, not from a nice heart attack, but from a cocaine overdose. That sort of sets the tone for the whole book. I know some people like their mysteries to explore the darker side of human nature, but I just want to be entertained. I finally gave up. I skipped ahead so I know whodunnit, but really, by then, I didn't care.	2001-10-20

For one thing, she's already used the community school idea in her book, A Quiche Before Dying, and with much better results. You'd think they would ban her from the school after that one!

I love this story of a baseball playing dinosaur and the free-spirited family who take him in. By the writer of George Shrinks. The families are very similar in spirit. Such a great book!	2001-06-16

This is a great book to teach kids what happens when you break the rules. Arthur's mom tell him he can't play his new computer game while she's gone. But the game is really cool, and he doesn't mean to play it, exactly, just show it to Buster. But, as you might guess, things don't work out that way. Arthur is convinced he has broken the computer. D. W. worries that they will now be homeless, and it will all be his fault. But Mom is able to fix the computer and they all learn a lesson about following the rules.<br />As a Mom, I wish I could be as fair and calm as Arthur's Mom. She never yells or freaks out. She just grounds Arthur from the computer. And he admits that's fair, which my kids probably would not do. This is a great story about a very common situation. Kids and parents will relate to this one.	2001-06-11

I did too, but not solely for the reasons they did. Chicken pox that only lasts a week? Come on! But the main problem this created in my home was that when my kids came down with chicken pox, they pulled this book out. Uh-oh! They wanted crazy straws, and a back rub, and every other special treatment that Arthur received. But it was reassuring for them to see that chicken pox is very common, and even Arthur survived. At least I got them to try the oatmeal bath!	2001-06-10

My favorite has always been Cinderella. When I read this book, I was &quot;enchanted.&quot; Haven't you always wondered why Cinderella kept being so nice to her stepmother and stepsisters? This story explains it all. I loved the character of Ella. She's not your typical princess, who waits to be rescued. She's independant and brave. My daughter got this for me for Christmas because she knew how much I loved it. It's a great one to read aloud as a family.	2001-06-10

His characters are believable and human. This is one of his best. He can take characters from completely different backgrounds and make you really interested in them. I also love the way he weaves the subplots together into a beautiful tapestry. Charlie Trumper is one of his most colorful and rich characters. This is a great one. It is really long, but once you get into the story, you won't want to put it down.	2001-06-10

I love the way the four men bond together to get revenge. Together they come up with some incredible schemes and yet they manage to pull them off, while the reader roots for them every step of the way. I love the surprise twist at the end.	2001-06-10

She was so outrageously funny. She got away with all kinds of nonsense and had the most amazing adventures. So when I read it again, as a parent this time, I was happy to find that they were just as good as I remembered. My 8 year old laughs and laughs at Pippi. This is a great book to read aloud. My favorite part is Pippi's hilarious tall tales about people she has known. A Classic!	2001-06-10

We had been talking about Egypt and they loved hearing this version of the story. There's no fairy godmother, but the god Horus intervenes in the form of a falcon. And there's even a happy ending. I liked the historical fact at the end of the book.	2001-06-06

It was so obvious that Tommy Lee and RAchel would get back together, I kept waiting for them to get it over with. Rachel's main hesitation was Tommy Lee's reputation (which I can understand) and worry about what everyone would think (which I couldn't). RAchel's dad comes off as such a jerk, I couldn't understand why she even cared about his opinion. The story never quite built up the suspense or romantic tension it needed. Not as good as some of her others.	2001-05-17

The main twist of the story is found in a Poirot short story, \\"The Mystery of the Cheap Flat.\\" I'm not sure which was written first, but it worked better with Poirot. The heroine is along the lines of Tuppence. In fact, there is very little original matter in the whole story. It's still a fun read, great for killing an hour or two. I read it during my daughter's soccer practice. But I don't really recommend it unless you're just really bored. Agatha did it so much better!	2001-05-17

Many of the other reviews already said it, what a waste. They should have kept it a play. After all, I've read &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; and &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; as plays, and enjoyed them. But this was so painfully drawn out. The characters were one-dimensional, Poirot was a cariacture of himself, and I guessed the murderer before anyone even died! I didn't give it one star, because it would probably be better if you've never read any Christie, and didn't know the difference.	2001-05-17

I know that these are co-authored (to a big extent) by Charles Osborne, and it shows. The story opens with a man entering a house to find a woman standing over the body of her dead husband. He covers up for her. There are lots of twists along the way, but I had the whole thing figured out halfway through the book. I know sometimes you can guess the ending and still enjoy it, but halfway through? I was expecting so much more. Still, it's the best of the Christie/Osborne books so far. Too bad that's not saying much.	2001-05-17

I think it's great to get her interested in history, so this series about young LDS girls from the past promised to be a great idea. This is the first book I bought from the series. My daughter likes it a lot. Sadie is young girl from Pleasant Grove Utah in 1856. Her parents are struggling to teach their children good values and to live their religion. After her parents go to General Conference in Salt Lake, Sadie is left to run the household and take care of her brothers and sisters. It's a lot harder than it sounds! I think this book will make girls appreciate how different pioneer life really was.	2000-09-20

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Great for young readers	My daughter got this book as a birthday present from her grandma, and it's been a big hit. Marigold, a little bunny, has a day of fun with her Grandma. They buy Marigold a new hat, they feed the ducks, they go out to lunch, and get their picture taken. One of the lessons of the book is found in the story at the coffee shop. Marigold wants the lunch to be just wonderful, but she gets the hiccups, spills her drink, and forgets her table manners. She feels bad, but Grandma assures her that she is always wonderful. What a great lesson! Just what every Grandma is supposed to say about their grandchildren. I can really recommend this book, especially if your child has a special grandma.	2000-09-20

He doesn't get up until everyone else has left. Finally his family forgets  about him and move out, leaving him behind. Walter sets off to find them.  He winds up on his own island and makes friends with some frogs. He tries  to teach them math and reading, but since he never got up in time for  school, he gets most of it wrong. He decides to go back to school and finds  his family again. Walter finally learns to be independent and responsible.  I liked this book as a child and it is one of the first ones my oldest  daughter read on her own. A lot of fun.	2000-09-17

This has something  for beginning to advanced cooks. The first chapter covers definitions.  What's the difference between dice and chop? How do you braise? All covered  in this book. It also covers how to plan menus and shop, what the  well-stocked kitchen needs, how to store foods. It covers food additives  and nutrition as well. But the most useful chapter, I think, is the one  that's called &quot;How much of What.&quot; How many egg whites or graham  crackers make one cup? How large a roast do you need? It goes by weight,  volume, and serving size. This book is very helpful.	2000-09-16

You know, from  the famous poem by Robert Service? Okay, maybe not a FAMOUS poem, but a  good one. In this funny story, the Grub-and-Stakers decide to act out the  play in the hopes of winning a literary competition. Naturally, things  don't go as planned, and someone winds up dead. I really like Alisa Craig  and I wish her books were more available. I really recommend this one.	2000-09-16

She  doesn't notice that it's missing until she bites into a fresh loaf of  bread! My son likes Mr. Fixit and Absent-Minded Mr. Rabbit.
