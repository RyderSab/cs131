I have read all of Judith McNaughts books, and I have to say this has got to be the worst one. Usually there is a big build up and anticipation of the two lovers getting together. That is missing here. All of the characters are underdeveloped and I didn't really get why Sloan was so attracted to Noah, and the story of Paris and Paul is never gone into in detail so how did their relationship develop? To me Noah's sister Courtney is more interesting than most of the major characters. I hope in the future Judith McNaught returns to her old writing style. I'm sure some of the characters from this book will be the focus of other books, so lets hope their stories are more interesting than Sloan and Noah's! But if it's a quick read you're after this one is it.	2003-02-02

A wonderful story about barnyard animals who have just as much trouble getting their offspring to bed as some of us parents do. First the animals mix up all their beds and then they try to put bedtime off again with requests for more stories, water ,and wee wee( my sons favorite page). I loved all the adorable nick names and different ways of saying goodnight.  This is sure to become one of our favorite bedtime stories and may even provide us with some new bedtime riturals(sp?). The illustrations are beautiful as well and capture the emotions of the animals perfectly.	2001-12-06

Instead of making a loaf of bread the little red hen is making a pizza and no one will help her. The pictures in this book are really interesting, they look like they were all formed from paper cut outs and there are lots of other abstract things going on in the pictures as well to discuss with your child.  What my son and I love most about this book is that he can help tell the story. He loves the repetitiveness of the story and this book teaches children a wonderful lesson about sharing. I can't say enough good things about this book!	2001-12-05
US	52579788	RRCY056FDAVVI	0440224829	940363725	Granny Dan	Books	2	1	1	N	N	A disappointment	I was really disappointed afer reading this book, it sounded so good reading the dust cover. I found this story of Danina and her lover Nikoli lacking in many areas.  First this novel starts out with Danina's Grandaughter discovering letters of her recently departed Grandmother.  The book then begins telling Danina's story, although a letter format is not used here. Also this story is lacking a lot of historical detailing that would have given more substance to the storyline. Finally there are too many personal details missing here. I found it really hard to want these people to be together, there was no chemistry between them. The book abruptly stops and leaves out details about what happens to Danina after arriving in the United States. I personally wondered why Danina's daughter was descibed in the manner she was.  This book would have been great if it had been about 300 pages longer.	2001-12-05

Just be forwarned that you cannot read too many of Dean Koontz's books in a row or you will become bored. All Koontz's books seem to follow a pattern; A guy ,a dog, a best friend, sometimes a girl and something very creepy.  I have not read any of Dean Koontz's novels in many years so I found this book refreshing and I also like the first person format that he used. I found this to be a very fast read. I am looking forward to reading this books sequel, SEIZE THE NIGHT.	2001-12-05

I found out about this book from reading the short story version in Good Housekeeping magazine. I am so glad I went out and purchased the full length novel. Latita Tademy wrote this  novel based on her own family history. This novel is about the lives of 4 african american women each of who hopes for the lives of their children to be better than there own was. It starts before the civil war and takes us up to 1936. This is a very engrossing read which teaches of the lives of slaves and how they were taken advantage of by the white creole planters. It is also an amazing story of love and family. Read this you won't be disappointed!	2001-06-02

This novel is one of Danielle Steel's worst. The writing is so basic that at times it sounds like it was written by a 10 year old. There is absolutly no depth to these characters. At the begining of this novel you really want these two to be together but by the end I found Joe very dislikable and wished he'd just leave Kate alone. How many times can you be burned before you learn not to touch fire? Most of this novel takes place during the first 15-20 years of their relationship and then all of a sudden at the end of a page Ms. Steel skips ahead 17 years??? We totally are ripped off of the supposed happy ending. However I don't think I could have stood another chapter of this book but maybe I would have liked Joe more. Read at your own risk.	2001-05-23

I too wish I would have read the reviews of this book before purchasing it. This is the story of a happy family; Mom, Dad, 3 sons, and a daughter. They are a happy family until their daughter is raped and it tears the family apart. This story is partially told from the view of the youngest son and  partially from the third person which can be confusing at times and I felt I never gained any compelling insight from the sons view so why bother? I'm sure there was major symbolism going on here but this book was so boring I didn't even bother to think about it.The characters were never fully developed so I found it hard to really like any of them and it seemed when the author did start to go into some character depth she'd go off into some small inconsequential detail that had nothing what so ever to do with the rest of the story. I have to admit this book was taking me so long to read and it was so horrible that I skimmed the last hundred or so pages just to be done with it. One major point in this book seemed to be that this family was so important; THEY WERE THE MULVANEYS. Who Cares!!!!!	2001-04-09

It's about the Elm Street Kids Club selling lemonade to raise money to rebuild their clubhouse.  They decide to chart their progress to see how they are doing by using a bar graph.  This book teaches children how to use a graph and the concepts of more and less. The illustrations are also enjoyable,  showing the kids dressed up as lemons to market their lemonade stand.  My son is 2 1/2 and enjoyed the story. I can't wait to be able to use this as a math lesson.  There is also a sections at the end of the book that discuss using a bar graph in different ways to help your children learn.	2001-03-09

This book is about one  familys search for the perfect bed when all the children decide to sleep with their parents; something all parents can relate to. I loved the illustrations in this book, they depict a truer vision of day to day life in a family with many kids.  Not only do all the children decide they like their parents bed but all the family pets sleep there too. I thouroughly enjoyed this book and do not believe it to be only for co-sleeping familys since we do not pratice that arrangement.	2001-02-27

I've found that reading Danielle Steel novels you always learn some valuable information even if the story line does not always ring true to life. But hey, isn't that what romance novels are all about? The heroine always has money,or stumbles on to it and things generally work out in the end.  There's great information on abuse here and hopefully a few women have been saved by this. Despite some of the other negative reviews this book got, if you love Danielle Steel or romance novels you'll like this book.	2001-02-26

Books	5	10	11	N	N	A &quot;Must Read&quot; for new parents	I normally don't like self help books, but I purchased this after my sister-in-law recommended it to me. I was pleasently suprised to find this book offers down to earth, realistic advice.  I was suprised to find out that most parents only spend 7 minutes of quality time with their children a week. Yes, a WEEK. Catch your children being good and let them know it is the message of this book.  It also offers some good examples of what to do if your child is behaving in certain ways.  It covers childhood from begining until the very turbulent teenage years. My son is a very active 2 1/2 year old and I have been using Mr. Severe's advice for about 2 weeks and have already seen improvement.  I intend on reading this book several more times in the years to come.  Thanks Sal!	2001-02-24

I purchased this book while shopping and it was something my son picked up and I could not get him to put down. It is, however, one of the best truck books we own. Each page shows a large picture of a construction vehicle with an acurate description of what each vehicle does and which parts do what. There are also picture insets of certain important parts and each vehicle at work. My son usually has to take this book to bed and it keeps him entertained until I can get to him in the morning. If your son or daughter love trucks this is a definate &quot;MUST HAVE&quot;!	2001-02-21

It is told from the perspective of the big bad wolf. I read this to my 2 1/2 year old and I doubt I will be reading it to him again until he's a little older. This book is geared more for older kids and adults. I found some of the concepts hard for small children to understand; comparing eating a little pig to us eating a cheeseburger. Most of the illustrations are very cute but some of them are a little abstract. This is very entertaining for the appropriate age group.	2001-02-21

This is a delightful story of a little boy who gets a fish and doesn't listen to Mr. Carp ( the pet shop owner) who tells him how to feed the fish. Of couse the little boy doesn't follow directions and finds out that bad things can happen when you don't follow to directions. Even though this book is over twenty years old the illustrations are not outdated. Great for anyone, but especially for kids who want a pet.	2001-02-16

When I started reading this I wasn't so sure if I liked the content  or if my son would like it. It was a hit! There are lots of colorful, interesting illustrations and little comments from animals witnessing the lady expanding as she eats each animal.

The last 150-200 pages however, made me change my mind.  This is the story of 5 strangers coming together out of different cicumstances and change each others life for the better.  About 250 pages of this book could have been eliminated and it would have still told the same story.  Ms. Pilcher is way too descriptive of everything. This does give you a very good idea of how it would be to visit with english or scottish friends. I've been there 3 times and it brought back warm fuzzy memories.  This book is not bad, its just too long and drawn out and not all the story lines are brought to a conclusion, I guess we're left to draw our own conclusions. Be prepared to skim the text a little if you want to get to the end!	2001-02-13

I got this book for my son when he was about fourteen months old (he's now 2 1/2)  He has loved it from the begining. First because it was about garbage trucks and then because of its entertaining repetitiveness. Soon we would hear him shout &quot;Stop! Mr. Gilly emptied all the cans from behind the doctors office&quot;. Now he can practically read this book to us by looking at the pictures. Great fun for the whole family!	2001-02-08

The characters were  interesting and enjoyable but the story took a long time to get to the  point, which WAS interesting once it finally got to the point.
