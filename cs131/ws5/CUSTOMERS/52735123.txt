Next to Maya Angelou and Iyanla Vanzant, Dr. Elmore has written several books that actually and authentically help African-American men and women understand each other better.  There are cultural differences that are not apparent to many other races about Black Love and relationships.  Black men and women have historically gone through hell both in the world and with/because of each other.  Dr. Elmore helps build a bridge of understanding that goes beyond someone just stating, Respect your Woman or Respect your Man.  He actually discusses it and then gives plans of action for (in this case) a Black man to start relating to, loving, respecting, protecting, and nurturing his Black Woman... Young and Old Black Men need this book! Please don't be discouraged-you can learn to love your Black Woman in a way that is WONDERFUL for the both of you! Nuff Said...  -ed-	2000-11-03

Sometimes a person wonders how did their parents or grandparents ever get together! This book was one of the FIRST of the truly HELPFUL books in the Iyanla Vanzant, Maya Angelou, Dr. Ron Elmore tradition!

The best way to look at Miles is as if he was a diamond just dug out of the earth.  Only a select few truly KNOW what a GEM he was-the rest of us have to find  out through good people like Quincy. Sometimes realizing how accomplished a  jazz musician, composer, and artist that he became may shock people.  I  like to think that he survived, thrived, and bloomed like a tree or flower  that lives in the concrete jungles of the city...  Many people still do not  realize that we are all part of a larger universe and the way we view  things are the sum total of our experiences-both bad and good.  I am  personally a big FAN of MILES-I have his CD's and art as well as LD's or  videos of him.  I always hated how he was commercialized-it was so hard to  see him in concert.  Quincy helps the reader to know Miles as if it was the  reader hangin' with Miles instead of Quincy.  Thanks Quincy-God Bless you  for puttin' TRUTH down about Miles.  Too many people took pictures and sat  on the periphery and expounded drivel about how they knew him. He is a  human being with good and bad sides.  I still and always will remember him  for the GREAT VOICE of his playing.  God Bless you Miles!<br />Peace	2000-04-19

After reading the first reviewer, I beg to differ with that person's viewpoint.  ESO is a great book that has never enjoyed much critical acclaim and this book talks about techniques from it and recommends it in their very GOOD reading List in the back! I think the reading list alone would make the cost of the book reasonable! In this age of Sex for Dummies and such, it is good to know that an old and trusted friend, confidante, counselour, and even tittilator like Playboy would come up with a tasty buffet of ideas,tips, tricks, skills, techniques, and just fun stuff on the issue of love and sex! Sometimes you just have to go with your instincts and keep an open mind! They also give kudos to the Good Ladies at Good Vibrations! I wonder if the reviewer ever tried any of the suggestions?
