Curl up with a hot cup of tea and this book and I swear in less than 2 hours you'll be thinking about marriages today and wondering what your friends do behind closed doors.  See, I picked up this book knowing full well that one of my good friends is having an affair.  When I read this book, I could not help but see her situation duplicated many times over by other women.  My friend is not a bad person although others would beg to differ just based on her actions.  Like many of the women in this book, she doesn't want to hurt her husband.  She just wants some attention and romance and perhaps she never grew up. I really don't understand why she does what she does but I can tell you this - based on what I have read in this book: she is not alone.  Affairs are becoming increasingly common among women in suburbia today.  Women don't talk about it much even with each other.  This is a hard look at the girl next store.  Highly recommend for a book club read - it will definitely open up group discussion!	2005-09-23

This book is a very easy breezy read (took me an evening at best). I liked the fact that the main character (Sarah) wasn't desperate for boyfriend (a typical chick lit theme).  Sarah's problem ceneters more on not having a job and really not willing to settle too much when it comes finding one. She'll make do and pay her bills but she doesn't really compromise who she is and I found that to be very refreshing. I wouldn't say Sarah has the best set of priorities out there - she whine alot about the 12 on her metro card, not having and money, etc... but she goes out an awful lot for someone who is living lean! I was out of work for 6 months right after Sept. 11th so I could really identify with the whole job search aspect of this read.  It wasn't heavy reading - rather enjoyable for an evening read or rainy day read. I wouldn't purchase it though...	2005-09-01

This book did not contain any really unique ideas to speak of.  Topics such as elopements, theme weddings, surprise weddings, adventure and destination weddings are certainly given coverage in other wedding related books.  I will give the author points for having better research information available to her readers though.  For example, there are a number of web sites and actual places listed for further reseach if so desired.  The time tables that the author provides are also fairly accurate.  The book provides very basic insight on how to deal with common objections that people will encounter when toying with the idea of a non-traditional wedding. The bottom line is that it's your wedding and in the end only you can decide how to handle family/friends objections.  The advice is merely a guide that spans about 2 pages so don't expect too much.  I personally would not purchase this book as it does not really offer any real money saving tips or insider info that could not be found elsewhere. The book is definitely geared to smaller, more intimate wedding celebrations (less than 100 people).  Worth taking out of the library for research purposes if you think that a smaller non traditional wedding is for you.	2005-08-26

I really enjoyed this book and I don't even have kids.  If you would like to get a Father's Day gift for a new dad or if you happen to know a man who's about to become a dad then I would definitely recommend purchasing the AUDIOBOOK version of this.  Most men don't have the patience to read so I could see them enjoying the effortless listening aspect of the audio version.  I read the print version and I really liked it. Paul talks about the decision to have a child and the whole pregnancy journey from the male perspective.  Let's face it, there are lots of books written for women on the subject and this is probably the only one I have ever seen written for men by a man.  Women will enjoy reading too b/c I think it gives some insider perspective as to how a man views having a baby.	2005-08-26

If you like the TV show then you will probably like this book.  <br /> <br />I'd definitely recommend the audiobook over the paper version b/c it's all about the delivery! Do be forewarned though that there is so profanity in the book.  It's not used flagrantly but if that sort of stuff offends you, you may want to take heed. If you buy the audioversion then just don't listen to it with the kids in the car unless you want them to repeat the bad language - it's promient enough for them to pick up on it. This is a very quick read and if you have kids you will certainly appreciate many of the stories that Ray shares with his audience.  They are very funny. Worth purchasing.	2005-08-26

I didn't love this book but then again I didn't hate it either. I'm just not into the whole \\"goddess\\" concept.  I tend to be of the belief that a bride is no better or special than any other woman out there. This book had a lot of great ideas for individuals who are looking to incorporate cultural traditions into their wedding ceremony.  I would probably buy this book if I were looking to have something along those lines.  The book has a very spiritual air to it and the section on vows is well written.	2005-08-26

A co-worker lent me the audio disc version of this book and I have to say it was not nearly as bad as some of the reviews on here would lead you to believe.  This book is a very basic primer on the excuses you will inevitably hear from men over the course of your single life. For each excuse the answer is the same: he's just not that into you, so move on!  It contains lots of common sense and is fairly humorous at times.  I would liken it to male version of THE RULES.  Many other reviewers have made snide remarks as to what type of women fall for these lame excuses instead just realizing that the guy isn't into them.  Look, there are a lot of excuses that women will put up with and many reasons why (low self esteem, hope springs eternal, desperation, etc...).  I cannot say that in the entire course of my dating life I too did not fall prey to some of these excuses. This book gives you the brutal honesty about why he hasn't called, showed you respect, showed up period, etc...It's harsh but effective.  We women have a tendency to live in la-la land when it comes to our relationships and this book sort of snaps you out of it.  I'd love to force some of my friends to listen to it just so they could finally \\"get it\\".  If you liked the Sex in the City  storylines, then you'll probably enjoy this book.  Some of what brought the star rating down was the condescending tone of voice the authors had on the audio version.  I really didn't need to hear their self affirming tones telling me I'm a \\"foxy lady\\". Blech!!! They really could've used a better editor.  Not everyone who reads this book suffers from low self esteem (deluded reality perhaps).  Overall worth purchasing.  Could possibly be used for single women's book group if you set some clear guidelines for the discussion.	2005-08-22

It has helped me to find a lot of interesting places for my guests to stay and see as well as help me to locate a reception site.  Some of the weblink info is incorrect and/or not up to date and is the primary reason I did not give the book 5 stars. I would have an expandable map as well.  One thing that I will tell you about the Poconos that the authors don't mention is that the overall cost to vacation in the Poconos is surprising less than you would think.  In fact, in researching potential wedding sites I have been finding packages for 5 hour wedding ceremonies (not inclusive of alcohol and site fees) around 40-60 dollars per person. This is unheard of in the Northeast.  Additionally, hotels and lodging are either on par or less than what you find in other NE areas.  One bad thing I have encountered in researching the Poconos is that many of the places to eat/drink/stay are woefully behind the times technologically speaking.  Very few websites exist considering the amount places you could go and also many of these places do not have internet capability for the business traveller.  Then again, the Poconos are typically where you go to get away from the rush of city life. The culture is very laid back and the people are among the nicest you could hope to meet.  Definitely worth purchasing in conjuction with a map if you are serious about finding the best the area has to offer.	2005-08-21

I think that the idea for the plot was fairly original and the writing was brisk enough to make me want to keep reading despite the bizarre and dark content overtones.    <br /> <br />The story is about a man (Mark) who reunites with his crazy ex girlfriend (Caro). Caro is supposedly very beautiful and it is this beauty that makes men do crazy things for her.  Mark is a relatively normal guy who keeps finding himself mixed up in a web of violence due to his relationship with her.  It turns out that when Mark and Caro first parted ways, he was devasted to the point where he did not know how to really be a man let alone how to be a \\"bad\\" man -- to put it mildly: Mark was a wimp.  Over the course of the novel, Mark gets beat up, humiliated, married, chased by the law, and stalked by a psychotic lovestruck killer.  It's a lot to handle for your average 23 year old.  Caro asks Mark to kill people for her because they have wronged her in some way.  He realizes that the idea is crazy but somehow the bodies end up dead.  I won't spoil the story by telling you how.  Suffice it to say that if you are into dark Brit Lit, this may be right up your alley.  I would like to point out that the author works Nick Hornby's name into his story at least 20+ times and this is sort of like a much darker version of High Fidelity.  I have no inclination to read anyting else by this author in the future and this book wasn't a total waste of my time, it just wasn't my style. Worth taking out of the library.  Then ending may surprise you.	2005-08-18

I love the fact that there are loads of great reviews on here for this book and many of those same reviews cannot even remember the correct names of the characters.  Honestly, how can you pen a 5 star review and get a detail like that wrong? 5 star to me = something memorable, something worth your time. Now that my vent fest is over - here's my review: <br /> <br />I really liked the plot. I found it to be refreshingly original.  It centers around 4 people from very different backgrounds all of whom are intent on killing themselves.  Somehow they all end up atop the Toppers House on the same evening and all of them want to jump.  It's a bungling scene in which none of them actually jump.  Instead, they form a little group of friends despite having nothing in common other than the desire to end their own lives.  Hornby seems to have an accurate handle on depression as a subject matter and he is quite capable of writing in the masculine and feminine voice. Most of the book was shocking funny for such a dire topic. So, what didn't I like about this book? I did not like the fact that background information on the characters was at times altogether missing or came late.  Case in point: Maureen.  I have no clue as to how her son came to be in his vegetative state.  I \\"get\\" why she'd want to end her life - I'd just prefer a little more background.  My rating of the book is based primarily on the ending.  I hated it.  No loose eneds were tied up.  The story just sort of stopped. It was like having a blackout occur in the middle of watching the season finale of your favorite sitcom.  Up until the ending I enjoyed the book quite a bit.  I don't see how anyone could say it's better than High Fidelity. I certainly did not think so but I suppose that's a matter of preference.  I could see age being a definite factor in that opinion though.  I read this as part of a book club and would not recommend it as a book club read if you plan on having a \\"serious\\" discussion: namely the resolution of conflict, etc...	2005-08-18

It's gossipy, trashy at times, and it's sort of fun to read.  I found myself very interested in the characters lives and could see how the author tried to make these women easy to relate to. Many of the situations covered are situations that I see happening among my married friends.  I liked the fact that the book wasn't so much about the actual reading group rather what goes on outside of it and how those pieces forge friendships over time.  Honestly, I didn't read the book to find out about reading groups.  If I wanted to know what a reading group was like then I'd join one! I saw a fair amount of reviews that commented on the amount of characters as being confusing.  I could see their point. The author could have easily cut 2-3 characters out and it would not have made a difference. Additionally, I thought that the storyline with Clare and Cressida was a wee bit obvious.  I guessed it early on and I feel that it could have been done better - less typical if you will.  I also see that a lot of reviewers commented on the authors own marital situation - many were miffed that she is married to someone in the publishing world.  Hmmmm.. I just don't think that's very fair.  People aren't mad at Mariah Carey for having once been wed to Tommy Matolla (like taht's the only reason she has a music career) and I think it's along those lines.  I feel the author has talent and a pulse on what women today find interesting.  Women shouldn't be so catty in response to that.	2005-08-16

Having read (and enjoyed) the authors first book, I had great expectations for this one.  The plot (albeit typical chick lit) seemed good but that is where the good ended.  I hated the fact that the main character was named \\"Girl\\" and that the main male characters in the book were named \\"Buster\\" and \\"Guy\\".  Please! It's no wonder young women today have identity issues. Now, I understand why the character had no real name - I realize that the authors wanted women to identify with her - to show her as an \\"every woman\\" but it was just awful.  Girl was a very weak character. She can't stand up to anyone really and waffles around life.  Her 14 year old brother Jack had more oopmh to him! I just didn't get where this story was going so I jumped book about 80 pages or so in.  I wouldn't recommend it as even a library read.  Save your  time, money, and fuel by not even making an effort to read it. If I could give it no stars then I would.	2005-08-11

The book explores the role of the wife in society from a historical perspective and does a very good job illustrating how tht role has changed over time.  I think I found the book interesting because I was able to compare my views on wifedom and marriage to the views my mom has.  I have to say that being a 30 year old woman in 2005 that my perspective on my life as it relates to marriage is dramatically different than the perspective my mother had when she married my father.  Back in the 1960's, there weren't the career options that exist today.  There were very clearly defined roles and expectations.  I think that after having read this book I can still see how society is relucutant to rid itself of those same roles - they are merely masked or contorted so that they appear different.  Women today are told they \\"can have it all\\" and back then it was \\"this is all you get\\".  Well, women really can't have it all and that is presenting a host of new issues for them to deal with.  The reference material in this book is very good and numerous examples were selected to support each theory presented.  A very interesting read for both married and unmarried individuals.  I would also recommend this book as a book club selection because I can definitely see women talking about this in depth - from the heart.	2005-08-11

Don't walk down the aisle without it!	I saw this book in the bookstore and decided to road test it from the library prior to buying it.  Not only does it come with a money back guarantee, but it really does live up to all the hype it's gotten (hey what other wedding book have you seen featured on Oprah??).  The book is pretty well put together and has an excellent chapter on wedding dress purchases. They give loads of info on several designers that you simply will not find in other wedding books. I started my dress shopping this past weekend and lo and behold ran into at least 2 of the \\"scams\\" they cited.  Most brides are not stupid or naive like other reviewers have (rudely) commented.  Brides (unless it's the 2nd go around) are inexperienced.  You wouldn't tell a 1st time pregnant woman she's dumb just because she doesn't quite \\"get things\\" You'd chalk it up to inexperience.  This is the same thing.  I am very well educated and I have learned lots from this book.  I can easily say that hands-down it is the best wedding book on the market in terms of value added tips, cost of purchase, and overall wedding related scope.	2005-08-10

It can help you better understand why certain people are the way they are and quite possibly how you can better interact with them. The book had lots of interesting tidbits such as pilots are usually first born and used car salesmen are typically last borns.  The author spent a lot of time talking about his own kids which I could care less about and he plugged his other books a bit too much considering he didn't really present loads of scientific info - primarily opinions based on his \\"observations\\".  The book was interesting though and I would recommend it to people with children or who work with children.  Take the book out of the library instead of buying it b/c it's not worth the overall selling price and you'll probably only look at it at best.	2005-06-08

I won't go into detail on the plot synopsis - it's in loads of other reviews. The plot was very unbelievable.  Stupid cryptographers and horrible character dialogue made me want to throw the book out the window.  This was Brown's first attempt at a novel so I can't fault him too much because he really has come a long way.  The book is definitely NOT worth purchasing unless you are at a garage sale and see it for a quarter or less.  I read it on vacation and regretted I wasted my time with it.

This book has hideous reception suggestions such as using your parish CAFETERIA to host your event.  Using olives as an \\"appetizer\\", having a fake foam cake, having an amatuer dj who plays \\"for free to get experience\\" and many other bad ideas. Words cannot express how bad I thought this book was.  I actually called another woman and read her a few quotes to get her opinion and she laughed so hard she actually cried.

When it became quite certain that these apologies were not forthcoming I grew resentful and angry.  This book helped me to understand the different types of apologies (false versus real) and why some people are incapable of apologizing. The book was very interesting.  It explored the concept of apologies in historical and cultural settings.  I cannot say that this was an incredibly exciting read because it wasn't - it was very matter of fact and rather dry.  What impressed me was the manner in which the author laid the foundations for his theories and then provided realistic dialogue that one might encounter.  I think I may have learned to apologize better and if for nothing else I now know why \\"Sorry seems to be the hardest word\\"(according to Elton John at least).  I would actually consider purchasing this book.  It has a nice cover and would look good on a nightstand or side table (very Pottery Barn-esque) -- plus the content is pretty decent.	2005-04-15

Yes, he lives a privilged life but we shouldn't fault the man for being successful.  I suppose if we all had the same free time we just might consider doing something as kooky as reading EB cover to cover. This is not the type of book you read for the quality of the writing.  You read it to laugh (and maybe learn some obscure trivia -- exception being \\"Blue Moon\\" for which the entry was incorrect).

Believe it or not I went 12 years without having a kitchen in my apartment.  Meals were regulated to eating out a lot or relying on friends for a decent meal. This book will tell you what basics you need to stock a kitchen with.  From pots and pans to basic pantry items this book has you covered.  Some of the recipies are a little odd but others are quite good and overall worth a try just so you can get some practice in. I already knew how to cook some things so I wasn't in awful shape, but the mom tips really came in handy. I actually learned a few things from those.  The book is also pretty useful when it comes to making vegetarian meals for others.  I have a few veggie-headed friends and it was easier to use these recipies rather than make them something else or order a pizza to compensate. I think that this book is very good for men who can't cook at all.  In fact, I would highly recommend it. If you need to leave your husband or boyfriend to his own devices for a few days then you may want to leave this book lying around. Worth purchasing.

At first glance this book looked like a really fun read.  Cute cover and catchy concepts it seemed like it would something right up my alley.  I was very wrong.  The book talks all about the sort of girlfriends that one may want to have or hope to have over the course of her lifetime.  That's all fine and dandy (not to mention obvious) but does anyone really need to read 200+ pages of the author's fond memories of her friends? Is it necessary to suck up to Oprah right in the dedication and then barely mention her in those 200+ pages? I also did not appreciate the cheap marketing ploy that involved the author plugging her stupid pajama line.  I don't think that the author imparts any true words of wisdom and I seriously doubt there is much for anyone to gain by reading this book.  You could do better things with your time like perhaps watching Thelma & Louise, A League of their Own, Beaches, Steel Magnolias, etc.... Don't waste your time or money on this.

Jacob Green is a good Jewish boy.  He goes to Yeshiva and tries very hard to love his crazy orthodox family.  His relationship with his father and brother are central to the story line and the author (Braff) does a pretty good job of detailing the angst, loyalty, love and other emotions that Jacob experiences.   Jacob's father Abram is a bit nutty.  All about appearances and obsessed with Judaism in general he is a very hard man to love. His rage and control issues destroy ultimately destroy his relationship with his wife and as a result she leaves him for another man.  Jacob is the golden child of the family.  The quintessential middle child - he does not like fighting or disagreements and is a peacemaker at heart.  Jacob looks up to his cooler older brother Asher and wants to be like him - unafraid.  Asher just wants to move away from his family and lives for the day he goes off to college.  Throughout the course of the novel the reader watches the brothers grow up and grow away from their father.  Poignant and brutally honest at times, this novel makes you think back to the days when you were a kid.  You remember the fierce loyalty to your family and the insanity they may or may not have caused you.  I think that this would be a good book club read for those of you interested stories about the family dynamic or stories with Judaic undertones.   I would like to comment on the fact that both this book and the movie \\"Garden State\\" (Joshua Braff's brother Zach starred in and I think wrote it as well) really led me to believe that the Braff Brothers had a rather tumultuous childhood.  Incidentally, as a side note I really did not like \\"Garden State\\" because it came off as crazy meets crazier.  This book had some nutty elements to it but it was at least believable and much easier to relate to.	2005-03-30

This book was not that great although certain parts of it were very funny.  If you like euphemisms then Carlin has some excellent observations that will make you laugh out loud.  Some of the book was very strange and not funny at all - in particular the parts where he talks about certain uncles and the traits they have.  It's like Carlin had a random musing that he found funny and decided to use it as filler space.  I did not care for his commentary on domestic violence - something that is never funny no matter how you look at it.  I wasn't a big fan of Carlin's America bashing either mainly because he makes his living primarily here in the States.  If it's so awful he should go elsewhere and reject the profits of us idiots.  As far as the religious commentary is concerned, it wasn't that bad really.  I could see how individuals who are very devout would be offended, but then again the title and the book cover should clue those folks in that maybe the book isn't for them.  Overall, the book isn't worth buying although I'd be interested in hearing the audio version if there is one.	2005-03-30
US	49437470	R11INW6IYAOEIE	0767912268	873187256	To Have and To Hold	Books	1	3	6	N	N	and to throw out the window	I see a great many 4 and 5 star reviews out there and cannot help but wonder if these people read the same book I did.  This novel was by far the worst Jane Green novel to date.  The story is about a woman named Alice who finally manages to snag the man of dreams (Joe).  Alice had known Joe since she was a young girl and had quite the crush on him.  I am not going to mince words here -- Joe is a pig.  He is the type of man that you instantly detest --phony and philandering to the core.  The only reason he marries Alice is so that he can have a \\"suitable\\" wife.  Alice is demure but has potential.  In time, he molds her into a good trophy wife - she cooks, is gorgeous, and is steadfastly loyal.  Despite this, Joe cheats on her left and right and without any true remorse.  Alice hears rumors of his infidelities but needs to see it with her own eyes in order to believe it.  Due to Joe's indiscretion with a fellow co-worker he is forced to transfer his job from London, England to Connecticut, United States.  It is here that Alice begins her transformation.  She starts to develop a sense of self. The plot really wasn't bad but the manner in which Green dragged out the story was just too much.  Does the reader really need 350+ pages of Joe cheating? Are 350+ pages of Alice's stupidity really necessary? Trust me, that far in you start to get repulsed by the characters.  Yes, Alice was quite sweet, but you want to slap her silly for continually being an idiot.  When she finally catches Joe cheating by snooping in his email you almost want to shout \\"DUH!!!\\"   What really made me mad though was that Green kept this up for over 350 pages and then very quickly decided to wrap it all up in 5-6 pages.  It was like a bad movie trailer or like when you watch a show in which they give follow up snippets at the end.  This one is not worth your time, your effort, or money.  I'd go so far as to say that you shouldn't even waste the gas driving to the library.  It was really that bad.  Watch a Lifetime movie instead.  It'll be much quicker and it's pretty much the same predictable stuff.	2005-03-21

The story centers around a woman named Ellie and her relationship with her mother in law. Ellie marries Dan  - a mama's boy if ever there was one!  Dan's mom (Linda) is the epitome of a \\"bad mother in law\\" -- she's nosy, thinks her son is God, plus she's \\"always\\" right. I didn't like the fact that Ellie spent the majority of the book whining about Linda.I think the reader can easily grasp the fact they don't get along - there was really no need to keep stating the obvious.  What I did like about this book was how it showed the transition of single woman to married woman and then to a mother.  I felt that this was relatively true to life. I enjoyed reading about Ellie making friends and gravitating towards certain women for certain reasons.  I enjoyed the theory of women in triangular relationships (something I think most women can identify with).  I wasn't particularly keen on the story line that involved one of her best friends sleeping with her father in law - I mean that was a bit over the top.  Overall it is worth taking out of the library.  I also think that this is a pretty good selection to use for a book club reading. I don't recommend giving this to a bride to be or newly married woman (it's a bit mean spirited to do that as some of the content is not that upbeat).	2005-03-18

I could hardly believe that the master of mystery himself penned such a poorly written novel.   The story line was so utterly predicable and awful that I am quite certain the only reason it sold any copies was due to the author's name.  This ladies and gentleman is clear cut example of why authors should stick to what they are good at and not go venturing into unfamiliar territory.     The main character Jennifer is a workaholic widow who lost the love of her life in a freak surfing accident.  She turns to her grandmother Sam to get her through that particularly tough time in her life and when Sam falls into a coma, Jennifer returns to the town where she spent her childhood summers.  While staying in Sam's house Jennifer comes across some letters that are addressed to her but were sealed and never sent.   When I say come across I don't mean she just stumbled upon them -- they just \\"happened to be\\" lying on the kitchen table and that begins a series of one too many coincidences for this reader to take.  Jennifer \\"happens\\" to hook up with an old neighbor (Brendan) who just \\"happens\\" to be dying of some rare form of cancer.  Of course, Brendan has experimental surgery and miraculously ends up fine.  Over the course of the novel Jennifer reads the letters that her grandmother wrote to her and she learns that her grandmother had an affair (oh the horror!!!).  Sam tells her granddaughter of the romantic interludes she and her lover shared and all the while refuses to divulge her lover's identity in her letters.  Sam eventually comes out of her coma (shocker) and her lover's identity is finally revealed in time. The revelation is nothing exciting though Patterson seems to think it is. The whole book was relatively predictable, use of the feminine voice was awful, and overall this book is not worth reading. Patterson should stick to mystery and intrigue. Leave the mushy stuff to Nicholas Sparks......	2005-03-17

Clay vows not to be changed by the money (millions) he makes but this is not to be.  Most of the book centers around Clay making lots of money with relative ease and then spending it in an obscene fashion. Slightly thrilling although I felt Grisham belabored the moral lesson of greed (preach, preach preach)...There's a bit of romance in the book though Grisham could have left that out and you'd still get the point. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book -- just take it out of the library. This is not one of his better novels but it'll pass the time at least.	2005-03-08

The story centers around young Willie Traynor who becomes the owner of a small town Southern newspaper. As with all small towns, news travels fast and when a horific murder is committed, the news spreads like wildfire.  Justice is demanded and small town grievances and bullies are all the talk of the town.  The last juror is really someone who Willie befriends during the course of the novel.  Less about law and more about small town life in the deep South.  The law that is referenced is obviously well reserached and the author makes note of what he cites as intentional discrepancies.  I happen to like the thrill of Grisham's earlier novels better than this one.  It reminded me too much of A Time to Kill really.  I'd recommend taking this out of the library and would suggest it as a good in flight read in lieu of a movie.	2005-03-08

I typically do not read stories like this, but a neighbor had lent it to me and I figured I'd check it out.  The plot isn't bad, but the dialogue is another story.  The writing was so unbelievably awful that I had to fight myself to finish it.  Phrases like \\"God damn, Oh god, etc...\\" were repeated over and over again. I got really sick hearing about Tess's cute freckles and Jimmy's movie star looks/sex drive.  The majority of the story line between Tess and Jimmy has them arguing over a one night stand.  It was 300 + pages of pretty bad writing.  I'd strongly recommend taking a pass on this book. Not worth your time unless you are looking to take a mini-break from Harlequin romances....	2005-02-28

The author does an absolutely amazing job using the feminine voice and perspective.  I was very impressed! The dialogue and mental chatter that the main character Laurie has is just so raw and real.  It is not at all chick lit or fluff - which is what you would probably expect given the cover design. Laurie is a jaded wedding photographer. Having suffered her own heartbreaks in life, she spends her time capturing the wedded bliss of others. She wonders what becomes of all the happy couples that she takes pictures of and she sets out to get answers.  She does follow up work on her clients -- sees if they are still married 10 years later.  She interviews adulterers, wife beaters, widowers, battered women, etc.. Reading this book was a look at the private pain others have endured. Sometimes life isn't happily ever after and this book sets out to show that. It's not all doom and gloom though. This book deals with finding love in hard world.  Letting go of fears and continuing to believe in love; not a fairy tale love, but a real, true love that transcends the self. Highly recommended.	2005-02-22

The story revolves around 3 women who are all intertwined in one way or another. It begins with Gemma - an Irish girl who had her boyfriend (Anton) \\"stolen\\" away by her best friend Lily. Gemma is a special events planner who must deal with the breakup of her parents marriage when her father leaves her mom for a considerably younger woman.  Then the story skips over to JoJo.  JoJo is a literary agent who is supposed to resemble Jessica Rabbit (why this is supposed to seem sexy I can't fathom but I digress...) JoJo is a supposedly strong and self assured woman who is having an affair with her boss.  Most of JoJo's story revolves around her relationship with her boss/lover Mark and it's easy to get frustrated by her actions.  JoJo isn't really the most likable character...but then again you have poor sweet Lily to fall back on.  Lily is a balding author who used to be Gemma's best friend until she fell in love with Anton and they became a couple. Reading this made me want slap these women for their actions.  Gemma needed to get over her ex boyfriend Anton, JoJo needs to realize that she has commitment issues, and Lily just needs to get a backbone.  It is interesting to see how all of their lives merge at one point or another.  I wasn't a big fan of the story line because it reminded me of stuff I went through in high school.  Not a bad read but certainly not one of Keyes best...	2005-01-31

Did you ever wonder if something with your child was slightly amiss? Did you ever wonder if your child's behavior was developmentally on par with other children? This book discusses the autism spectrum in detail. It is not overly complicated to read and is perfect for those who want things broken down simply and succinctly. When people think of autism they tend to think of Rain Man. In reality, autism has many different levels - the spectrum.  This book contains very helpful charts for parents (particularily first time parents) who wonder if their child is developing normally. It is helpful for parents who don't even know what questions to begin to ask their child's doctor. Fascinating subject matter even if you do not have a child that is affected by an autism spectrum disorder.	2005-01-25

This book was better than I expected it to be, but then again I was not expecting all that much. Like other reviewers have noted, this is not a factual read.  It is what I like to call a \\"theological fantasy\\".  Characters are based on real individuals and events albeit loosely at times.  The story is told from Sarah's perspective and the male author does a very good job using the feminine voice.  I'll be perfectly honest in letting you know that I did not even know that it was a male author until I had finished the book - I simply had not read the author bio nor had I noticed his picture on the book jacket. The only thing that I really did not like too much about this book was that the author -at times - made Sarah seem incredibly self centered and vain (bordering on conceited).  Worth taking out of the library if you are interested theological fantasy.	2005-01-22

I read this book awhile back and I actually liked it enough to give it a decent rating.  The book itself is closer to a 3.5 but you know there are no half star ratings allowed.  I am normally not a big fan of parable type stories, but I liked this one because it encouraged managers to become ACTIVELY involved. This is the biggest problem that I have seen in corporate work enviironments - managers are seldom involved.  They tend to delegate.  They typically don't jump in and help. Regarding the \\"choose your attitude\\" approach,  I think (from a managerial perspective) it is best to control it. As a manager, one should strive to mainatain as close to a postive attitude as possible.  If they fall short of that, it is their responsibility to control it when things get bad. I am not the biggest fan of \\"playing\\" on the job.  I have worked in a few  organizations where a play day was instituted.  I felt like this was re-living kindergarten, but most of my non managerial employees really seemed to enjoy it.  Worth taking out of the library if you are a manager who is looking to motivate your team.  Hey, when all else fails.. go fish!	2005-01-19

The contents are base at best.  This is stuff that you probably should have figured out when you got your first job.  I see all these 5 star reviews and I can't help but think that they must be written by people I would absolutely hate to work for: the butt kissers, the do nothing management types and the general cluseless.  Let's face, if you need a parable about mice to help you understand and adapt to the corporate work environment then you will wind up in one of 2 camps: the ra-ra managers who eat this stuff up or you'll be the sucker who works for them. I giving this book 2 stars on the basis that the author managed to write more than 20 pages on what should only have been a paragraph at best.	2005-01-18

I read this book many years ago when I was in college and would recommend the paperback version to anyone who is looking for some answers in life.  The overall theme of the book is how to deal with procrastination.  Many of the questions that we face on a daily basis are easily answered if we just make the effort to look within.  This book is light hearted but not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to make changes in your life and be open to facing some hard truths that you may not have known about yourself.  Don't be intimidated by the size of the book --close to half of it is really one page motivational quotes.  Most of the content is common knowledge but the goal of reading the book should be how to apply the knowledge.  Perfect for any age and an excellent gift for those into self improvement.

When I was in my early 20's I suffered terribly from anxiety.  I could not sleep for more than 20 minutes a night and was a walking mess to put it mildly.  Friends and family members kept telling me to snap out of it and traditional therapy really didn't help much either. I ended up purchasing Ms. Basset's tapes from her infomercial and shortly thereafter purchased this book as a supplement.  The book is not as good as the tapes but if you can't afford the tapes then I'd recommend giving the book a chance.  If for nothing else the book will comfort you with the knowledge that anxiety is not a dirty little secret, you aren't crazy and you can do something about your problem.  Within 5 weeks of working on the techniques Ms. Bassett discusses I was able to get myself off of medication that I needed to sleep, be able to drive on major thouroghfares (I was terrified of this previously) and was able to finally respond to people who kept telling me to just get over it.  Obviously this book is not for everyone.  I think it is best geared to those individuals who are just learning about anxiety (as I was at the time). When you are faced with an anxiety disorder I'll be the first to tell you that anything is worth a shot.  You have nothing to lose other than the anxiety itself. Worth taking out of the library if the purchase price is to much for you.	2005-01-17

I picked up this book mainly out of curiousity because  good friend of mine is contemplating divorce and I thought that the content might prove beneficial.  I was very impressed. For starters, I really respect the distinction of the author Sam Margulies.  Margulies is a divorce lawyer and not just some woman bashing man off the street. He advises men how to calmly broach the subject and actually manages to tackle different scenarios that could and do occur. I found Marguiles advice on how to communicate with women to be dead on.  The book is almost a primer on what happens when John Gray's Men are from Mars Women are from Venus doesn't quite pan out. The writing is relativly succinct and the author is very candid. Let's face it, most men shun the idea of therapy and they have very little help out there aside from friends and family to give them advice.  Some men won't even go that route.  Some men are too scared to consult a lawyer at first.  This book is THE book to read when you have decided that you do want a divorce but are in the  stuck position  where you are too afraid to move forward and not resigned to staying put. It is probably not the best idea to let your spouse know that you're reading this book.  I say this because it can in theory help her make your life more difficult.   Definitely worth purchasing.  It's like having a portable coach on the subject.	2005-01-13

Keyes fans are not likely to be disappointed.  The story has plenty of humor and would be a very good beach, airplane, rainy weekend type of book. Probably worth purchasing in softcover if at a reasonable price and definitely worth checking out from the library.   <br /> <br />The story is about 3 girls: Lisa, Ashling and Clodagh.  I really disliked Clodagh as a character.  She is supposed to be Ashling's best friend but you would never want a friend like her in real life.  I think I'd rather have enemies!  Lisa is a workaholic - your stereotypical career woman.  She's very interesting and quite mean -- a combination that makes up for the drama that Ashling's life lacks.  So: you have a nice girl, a mean girl, and a girl who is mean but doesn't know it. The 3 different types of women give the story momentum.  Drags on a bit more than necessary but overal a worthwhile read.  Closer to a 3.5 than a 3.0 but I am not giving a 4 because like most chick lit it was relatively predicable.	2005-01-13

Some of the stories are a bit outdated and hokey, but if you can get past that, the informational content still holds true for today.

While the material isn't light and breezy enough for this to be considered chick lit and the story doesn't end with a stereotypical happy ending, I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this book.  The story explores a mother-daughter relationship with such brutal honesty that it is hard not to like it.  I could easily see this novel striking a cord with single mothers in particuluar.  Charlotte (the mom) is a divorcee who tries her very best to watch over her daughter (Emily) and to keep her happy. In doing so, she sacrifices her own happiness and, over time, becomes an extremely anxious individual. Her anxieties are the focal point of the novel and I must say that the author did a tremendous job of giving this character really authentic anxieties.  It blew me away really.  I know people who are exactly like the character Charlotte --  so very afraid of living their own lives that they become absorbed with the lives of their children - trying desperately to protect them from the sorrow that they themselves have come to know. There is a line in a song I know that says \\"...we can talk and still say nothing. Stay together yet alone...\\"  Those words are the essence of Charlotte. You won't get a happy ending that is packaged nicely,  but I can promise you a good read for sure. This book is really a 4.5 in my eyes but only because after 300 plus pages I'm a sucker for a happy ending.  I won't spoil it - I'll just say again that it's worth picking up.	2005-01-09

This book does not really follow the typical methods of storytelling.  For starters, the narrator is a fictional biographer, but much of what the real author wrote is largely factual. In plain English it is a study in contraries. The book was relatively humorous and touching at times. Howard Hughes was an incredibly fascinating individual - the likes of which we will probably not see again in our lifetime. During my reading I kept thinking \\"Wow, this guy was nuts but I damn if I don't like him\\".  I think that the author did a great job of making Hughes likable and most of all he really conveyed the magnetism that Hughes embodied.  What I didn't like about this book was the narrator Mr. Reece.  He was a pretty unlikable character.  He came off as pompous and full of himself which I realize was supposed to be a comparison to Hughes but let's face it - Hughes is one individial who defied comparison. It's one thing to have an unlikable character and it's another to allow that character to have narrative rein.  Reading this book was much like reading the diary of someone I did not like and having the content of the diary be about someone I did like.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book.  It is a better library read and for God's sake try not to read this before you have see the movie The Aviator which is out right now.  I think that some of the magic that was Hughes may be lost to you at that point.	2005-01-09

The plot is revolves around a treasure hunt and I would have to say that is where any similarities end.  There is no real great crime to solve until about the middle of the novel and even that crime is predictably solved if you give it some thought.  I felt like this book tried too hard to incorporate too much information and plot scenarios.  The authors spend a great deal of time describing Princeton.  Realistically speaking, who cares? The details certainly didn't add to the story.   The main character Tom (also the narrator) has his relationship played out throughout the course of the novel.  I think by the end of the book I had covered close to 6 years of Tom's life and liked him less and less the more I read.  Many other reviewers have commented on the \\"coming of age\\" factor.  Now, this is baloney.  What coming of age?  There were no great character revelations to really speak of.  Character observations yes - nothing more than that though.  I liked the story enough to give it 3 stars - if you like books about treasure hunts and/or college days.  I don't feel that this is a book worth purchasing in hardcover.  A reasonably priced softcover would do well on an airplane ride or a checkout from the library will give you the treasure fix you seek. All in all it is not bad book but then again it is a far cry from the masterful and mentally intriguing DaVinci Code.	2005-01-04

It's your typical feel good story in the tradition of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" except the main character Eddie does not return at the end of the story. The story itself is not very original - a man dies and goes to heaven.  There he meets 5 people who show him what his purpose in life was. Yadda. Yadda.  I would imagine that one reason this book has done so well is because it is an \\"everyman\\" story.  The overwhelming majority of us want to know what difference our lives have made. I would have to agree with the reviewer who stated Heaven isn't about YOU. It's about God.  As far as a spiritual novel (given the previous premise) this book falls short of the 5 stars so many others have given it.  It's an exceptionally quick read but a bit expensive for stocking stuffer.  Good to check out of the library if you are remotely depressed and need validation that your life has meaning.  Not the best read of the year and certainly not the best that the author has penned.	2004-12-27

I think it's safe to leave it on the library shelf unless you will read absolutely anything of an equine nature. For starters, the plot started out as somewhat original and then quickly progressed from predictable to downright ridiculous. Judy leaves her wealthy husband and runs off to become a groom on a horse farm. She then takes an apartment with 3 other women ala Sex in the City commune style.  It only got worse from that point on.  Judy falls for a wacko neighbor who engages in horse rituals with some sort of coven.  She ultimately ends up with a local doctor. Incredibly predicable in nature, poor character development, and bizarre interludes that do not add to the plot of this novel are what I based my 1 star review on. I think that the author should stick to writing horse stories and steer clear of trying to incorporate them into the modern chick lit genre. The two just do not mix.  That's just common horse sense!	2004-12-27

I was a big fan of the show and much of what you will read in the book is from actual show material.  Whether or not you think it's humorous is a matter of personal taste.  If you are into sarcasm and wry humor then you will probably like it.  Jerry says upfront that it's all in the delivery, inflection, yadda yadda and he's right.  If you can hear it in your head then believe me it's funny. Every now and then I pull this book off of the shelf and re-read it just because it still puts a smile on my face when I'm down.	2004-12-27
US	49437470	R2799LCZV02DEF	1400032717	459979615	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Innovative plot and perspective	As many of the other reviews will indicate, this book is told from the perspective of a 15 year old autistic boy named Christopher.  Christoper is blamed for the murder of his neighbor's dog and he sets out to find the real killer. Thus the story begins... The readers learn about Christoper from his own perspective and they learn about his family.  The story is full of emotion.  The plot movement is a bit choppy but I am pretty sure that was intentional on the part of the author.  Overall this was an interesting read.  It's a good travel book in lieu of the inflight movie and if for nothing else it will at least educate you a bit about autism.	2004-12-27

I found the story to be very detached from time in an odd way.  I could not honestly tell you when the story took place because I think that the author was trying to illustrate the concept that it could take place at anytime and anywhere really.  What I mean by this is the accidents in life, the affairs and indiscretions that people -regardless of class- all have.  <br /> <br />The narrator Timoteo begins the flashback tale by telling us of his daughter Angela's near fatal accident.  She was riding a scooter that her parents had argued over even giving her (for fear of an accident) and she ends up in the hospital because she was hit by a car.  Her father Timoteo is a brilliant surgeon and she is rushed, clinging to life, to his hospital.  While she is being operated on Timoteo reflects on the year prior to her birth all the way up through present moment.  He tells of his relationship with her mother Elsa -- an incredibly independent and well provided for woman.  They have a beach house and lead what is most likely a very privileged life.  One day on the way to the beach house Timoteo's car breaks down in what I could only gather was a shantytown.  While waiting for the car to be repaired he meets a woman named Italia in a bar and ends up raping her. After raping what he describes as a poor and ugly woman, he proceeds to his beach house to meet up with his wife.  All the while Timoteo cannot stop thinking of the power he felt by raping Italia and how he wanted it to happen again.  Ultimately he goes back and bizarrely enough begins a relationship with her.  He leads a double life until up to a few days after his daughter is born.  And so goes the story... <br /> <br />The entire time I was reading this book I could not help but feel that Timoteo was quite possibly the most selfish man to have ever walked the face of the earth.  He spends his time mentally confessing his sins to his daughter instead of praying to God for her operation tobe successful.  The book was very well written but I absolutely detested the storyline.  This book is actually closer to a 4 but I did not think it was quite there by my standards -- hence the 3 star rating.   A good book to get from the library - certainly not worth purchasing at the hardcover price.   <br />	2004-11-22

I read the hardcover version of this book awhile back and found it to be utterly fascinating.  I had never read nor had I heard anything about the case prior to this.  Based upon the evidence presented I would have to agree with Mr. Hodel that his father is likely the killer in question.  Many other reviews cite the photos as the main reason they dismissed the evidence therein.  I don't think that this is reason enough to be quite so dismissive.  I have photographs of myself from 5 years ago that look nothing like I do today.  The handwriting analysis and journal entries were really what convinced me.  Known sex parties, deviant behavior, and the molestation of 2 of his daughters further convinced me that this was not a good man.  My thoughts on the matter after having read the book were that he would fit the psychological profile of a serial killer and that his son had very little to gain (other than a book contract really) by bringing this information forward.  I gave the book 4 stars because I felt that it dragged on a little too long.   You could probably do away with 50-100 pages and still make the same case just as effectively.  I would be interested in seeing this made into a film version as I think it would make for a good thriller.	2004-11-12

Rarely do I ever rate books 5 stars, but I simply had to in the case of this book.  The novellas are wonderfully composed. Bausch manages to weave very detailed stories in what is seemingly a brief and fleeting moment in the characters lives.  The expressive use of emotions was quite overpowering.  For the most part these were real situations that people encounter: the death of a parent, the birth of a child, alcoholism, suicide, media frenzy, etc... Even if you yourself had not actually experienced these life events, chances are you know someone who has (except probably the serial killer situation but I found that to be more about society's fascination with the macabre). Artfully and intuitively written, this book is well worth the read.	2004-11-10

I am not sure how this book managed to get so many 5 star reviews.  I typically reserve the 5 star rating for books I truly think are great. This was not one of those books (at best I found this book to be bizarre).     The story revolves around Cassie (who is not 29 by the way -- you other reviewers were not paying attention!!!) On the surface, Cassie is your typical single chick-lit heroine. She's single and looking for love. The book deviates from traditional chick-lit beyond this. It seems that Cassie is not satisfied by the quality of available men so she sets out to reform them.  She is a domestic dominatrix of sorts.  Basically, Cassie kidnaps 3 full grown men, locks them up in her basement and for the most part they seem grateful to her for it.  At some point in the book she manages kidnap a fourth but he ends up dead and by that point her friends get dragged in to the mess.  There is no way that anyone could ever find this plot to be believable.  Some reviewers seem to like that about this book. I like to escape from reality just as much as the next gal but this was more of an escape into mediocrity.     Beyond the book review I will add that if you plan on reading this book anywhere outside the confines of your own home, you may want to invest in a book sock.  Let's put it this way... there is a picture of a man licking a woman's boot on the front cover.  Bring this into your workplace lunchroom and you will attract the office [...] for sure!	2004-11-09

For starters, I really did not like the plot. Post 9/11 terrorism is nothing to be glib about. There are most definitely evil people in the world and there is nothing funny about it. I don't care what spin you try to put on it. Many other reviewers stated that they felt that this book was racist.  I don't think it was racist per se, but I will agree that it did feed into some of the Arab sterotypes that exist today. The plot was oddly reministent of the one used in the movie Ms. Congeniality with Sandra Bullock.  I was wondering if anyone else noticed that as well.    <br /> <br />I found the whole Rachel Pixely/Olivia Joules character to be annoying. She suffers a tragedy and feels that this requires a name change?? I mean really!  Not to mention she's pretty sure that she thinks Pierre is a terrorist and then proceeds to follow him around the world for the sake of a story??  Oh and did I mention she's a bit of a floozy? She hooks up with a few different guys and is prone to taking crotch shots when provided witha  camera.  The rest of the story goes downhill from there.... At the very end of the novel readers will no doubt marvel at Ms. Fieldings grasp of the male vocabulary as evidenced by Olivia's boyfriend Scott -- his favorite word is \\"baby\\". He must have said it at least 15 times!!   <br /> <br />Anyway the lowdown on this book is ... make it a library book instead of a permanent purchase.	2004-10-25

Exceptionally quick read complete with likable characters.  If you are looking for some mindless enjoyment in the chick lit genre then you should give this book a try.  The only problem I had with this book (aside from the predictability factor) was that the main character Emma comes off as a real idiot/airhead.	2004-10-21

It really wasn't that great. The main character Alex was not a nice person at all.  She's whiny and seems to think way too much of herself when bothers to think at all. Her best bud Rachel is snotty and over the top. The other main characters are not much likable either. The development of the non-central characters was pretty bad too.  I'll cite C Se. as an example. She was quite obviously J Lo. but for God's sake just say so or don't try to pretend she is someone else.  Come up with something original at least. I am giving the book 2 stars because I actually liked the plot (when they finally got to it that is). Too bad the unlikable characters ruined it. I didn't mind the cut throat image of Hollywood. I actually expected that -- I just wanted a character to like. A good girl stuck in a bad world if you will.	2004-10-20

I really did not care for this book at all. I felt that the plot was way too predictable and the behavior of the characters was extremely cliche.  I probably would have been better off watching a Lifetime movie than wasting my time on this book.  The book did have its funny moments but they were somewhat forced.  I'd recommend taking a pass on this book.	2004-10-13

The antedotes are very humorous and told from a very \\"real\\" perspective.  I thought that many of the reviews I have read here were a bit harsh.  Wendy really just gives people her perspective on life as a \\"fat\\" woman.  I myself am not plus size, but I have many close friends who have struggled with their weight over the years.  It is not easy in this day and age to be overweight.  Wendy's commentary on binge eating was spot on from what I can glean from the lives of those around me.  I very much admire the frankness of the author and applaud her efforts to better herself and the world around her. Just an aside... as I was finishing up this book I became aware of a new TV show called \\"The Biggest Loser\\". Now think about this. Openly, the media is insinuating that fat people are losers.  Granted, it is a weight loss challenge but the word play is just too much. You will never see a reality show starring anorexics.  It is an appaling double standard. Why are thin individuals treated with more kindness/softness? Are the \\"fat\\" among us tougher? No, they aren't.  I have seen the shows previews and some contestants were actually crying. It was very sad to see that as a nation this is what our entertainment has become.  We enjoy watching fat people cry and struggle. Very pathetic of us.	2004-10-08

The main character (Hannah) is likable enough and humor is peppered throughout the novel to lighten it up a bit. Parental infidelity is a major theme throughout this novel. As a result of her mother's infidelty, Hannah has a fairly disturbing relationship with her father, her best friend, and her lovers. I think the story may have been slightly more believable if the character had been about 5 years younger. Overall I would rate this novel 2.5 stars (but I can't give a half star) because the material is not as light as I'd like it to be for something that is considered to be chick lit. Just my personal opinion but Ms. Maxted would do well to steer clear of issues such as parental infidelity, rape, repression and the like if she wants to grow her fan base in this genre. The base content is somewhat distressful.	2004-09-08
