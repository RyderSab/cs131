The story begins with the brutal murder of an American G.I. and becomes a personal vendetta for detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep. Sonchai, the son of a Thai prostitute and an unknown American soldier is given to deep philosophical ruminations on Buddhism during his quest for revenge, giving his character an immediately appealing complexity and tone. He is an enigma: an honest religious cop in a police corps where corruption is a way of life. The taut storyline follows Sonchai's journey through the Thai underworld of sex, drugs and the illegal jade trade and his encounters with those that make their living in this teeming city of 9 million. It is an alien landscape that Burdett leads the reader through, and like a drug, leaves the reader wanting more and more. <br />	2004-09-27

What I found was a profoundly moving series of lessons on the nature of self, the mind, relationships, the world's beauty and other dilemmas that are as relevant today as they were nearly 2,500 years ago when the Budda wrote these \\"poems.\\" There are shocking moments of clarity, of realization in the short verse lessons. The verses are organized by subject, each chapter with a corresponding guide written by the author of this new translation, Glenn Wallis. It is easy to see why Buddhists worldwide value the Dhammapada (translated by Wallis as \\"verses on the way\\") for its vibrant and immediate teachings. <br />	2004-09-27

The year is 1967, and Conroy's typically self-depreciating opening line tells it all: \\"I was born to be a point guard, but not a very good one.\\" The book's success-his illuminating memories and energetic narration of that season's most exciting moments-is balanced by that most Conroyesque tendency to give in to melodramatic excess and self-absorption. Yet, for those who read Conroy, one might argue that is precisely the reason for reading the highly regarded Southern novelist in the first place. No one expects high literature from Conroy, but what they expect they get: a sympathetic, heart-wrenching portrait of a talented young man and the hard lessons he learns one season many years ago. And how that year left an indelible, emotional mark on the man Conroy was to become. <br />	2004-09-27

It is a remarkable tale of this Alabama farm boy thrust into the great conflict of the 20th century. The first beach that Joe ever saw was Omaha Beach in Normandy. He had never shot anything more powerful than a BB gun when he was drafted into WWII, yet his experiences with the 92nd Signal Battalion are a catalogue of the European theater's pivotal battles and events: D-day, the Battle of the Bulge, the liberation of the infamous Dachau concentration camp, even a post war visit to Hitler's Eagles Nest. Where the Birds Never Sing is an engaging story about a local man's small role in the cast we've come to call \\"The Greatest Generation.\\"	2004-09-27

Think of Tolkien's The Hobbit or Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. It is the story of exile and myth and the clever touch was to use rabbits-yes, rabbits, the little furry creatures in the fields-as the protagonists and antagonists. When you read this as a child, you enjoy the grand adventure of it all. When you read this later as an adult, you suddenly see grand, serious adult themes that Adams takes very seriously. Consequently, Watership tends to inspire real devotion among its readers.  <br />	2004-08-31

Set in a Tuscan villa in 1944 as World War II dies down in Italy, this novel is significantly different than the popular movie a few years back. To begin, the often-dense prose style of Ondaatje-a poet and novelist who was born in India, educated in England and immigrated to Canada-does take some time to get used to.  <br /> <br />The novel emerges as the four protagonists play out their drama in the ruined villa. They are Hana, the Canadian nurse; her patient who is burned beyond recognition; Caravaggio, a thief who knows Hana from before the war; and Kip, a young Sikh who spent the war disabling bombs for the British. All the characters have been damaged, physically and spiritually by the demands of war, but the real brilliance of the work may be the desert setting and the drama that unfolds as the English patient recounts his story spent mapping and exploring North Africa before the war. <br /> <br />	2004-08-31

Goethe was an unabashed worshiper of Napoleon for the heroic energy of that man of action, and ironically enough, Napoleon read Werther at the age of 17 and identified with the romantic hero according to Napoleon's diary at the time. But banned and attacked at the time, Werther was taken to heart as much as the book was reviled at the time of its publication. This brand new translation is a welcome update, making the epistolary novel accessible to a new generation. <br />	2004-08-31

Censored in 1871 when it was published and out of print since the 1950s, this is the first translation of The Kill in more than a century-and the effort was well worth it. It is a novel of a scheming family of three Parisians during France's Second Empire: Aristide Rougon, an ambitious, wicked real estate speculator; his young second wife, Renee, who's vacuous quest for pleasure is in its own way as destructive as her husband's quest for riches; and Maxime, Aristide's son and Renee's son-in-law, an idle rich young man of privilege. No one of the protagonists here are very sympathetic, and their rise and fall-while no surprise to the reader, certainly yields some very engaging and delightful storytelling by Zola. <br /> <br />For those familiar with Paris, the rapidly changing face of the city during tin the 1850s and 60s will be particularly engaging. During this construction boom, vast thoroughfares are being built as masses of homes and buildings are being torn down to remake the Paris into a modern capital. On this level, The Kill works as the story demolition of the ancient city by the unscrupulous movers and shakers of the day. Zola, often described as a naturalist, is a master of description, and thanks to this excellent new translation, the novel does not show it's age at all. <br /> <br />	2004-08-31

In a small town on the bank of the river Ujana e Keqe, a bridge is to be built that threatens the town's very existence by offering the Ottomans their line of attack into Europe's rear flank.  <br /> <br />Recounted by a monk, Gjon, who observes events, the whole movement and narrative of the book hinges on a local saboteur who for a time slows the bridge's construction until he is caught and immured in the bridge itself. At this point, propaganda and legend collide in a most unpleasant manner. While the bridge represents sacrifice, it is also a metaphor for military domination. A book that may have slipped under the radar when published in 1997, Albanian novelists Kadare's The Three-Arched Bridge is a quiet delight that reads like a fable. <br />	2004-08-31

Highly literate and engaging, I Don't Want to Talk About It was perhaps the first book to look at a well-known secret that men experience-and suffer through-depression in a manner distinctly different from women. Admit to falling prey to depression, and you are in essence, unmanly. Refuse to admit it and sink further into the clutches of depression, affecting your work and family. A wonderful look at a malady that touches us all in some fashion. <br />	2004-08-31

There is little sympathetic about his treatment of the Holocaust, but in Lovely Green Eyes we learn the story of Hanka, a young Jewish girl who manages to survive in the camp by passing herself off an Aryan, thus her nickname, Lovely Green Eyes. Lustig's prose is stripped bare and reveals all the horrors of such an existence but at the same time, the novel is a hard-edged story of hope and survival. <br />	2004-08-31

This is the first novel in Smith's very popular series about Precious Ramotswe, the only female detective in Botswana. There is a warm human element-matriarchal, even-about the tales that combine to make this novel that is unlike most other detective fiction that you'll read. Smith lived in Botswana and there's a real authenticity to the stories about witch doctors, missing husbands and con men. The book is a bit like the sign Precious has outside her office: \\"Satisfaction Guaranteed for all Parties.\\" The good news is that this is an ongoing series, and the fifth story, The Full Cupboard of Life, has just been released. <br />	2004-08-31

It's been passed from family member to family member like a virus this winter! It is so addictive, and everyone has loved. It's a mystery-thriller by Smith (of Gorky Park fame) set in 1870s in a small coal-mining town in England. The atmosphere is terrifically rendered, the characters are so realized they stick with you long after you put it down. My wife even went back to reread several passages, just to rediscover some of the more clever exposition with the benefit of hindsight. Maybe the best novel I've read all year. <br />	2004-08-31

Deeply atmospheric and creepy, protagonist and cynical police detective Aureilo Zen returns to his native Venice to find a vanished American millionaire. The character of Zen is a beaten-down yet resilient revelation-and a character that consistently amuses and entertains. Italy is a morally ambiguous landscape full of unsavory characters where it's hard to discern the criminals from the crime fighters. The good news is that if you enjoy this Zen crime mystery, there's plenty more enjoyment in store for you since Dibdin has written several in the series. <br />	2004-08-31

It's the story of a burnt-out Houston tax lawyer who heads to small town Jenks, Texas, to escape the rat race. Quirky Southern characters, bizarre plot twists and outrageously funny situations abound in Austin Davis' first novel.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-31

If you've ever wanted to do so, it is equally a great read for Halliday is so matter-a-fact, so immodest and honest about her bumps, failures and travel successes, that you will laugh out loud at the recognition of what it is to be a true traveler as opposed to just a tourist on a one week holiday abroad. She is an outrageously amusing narrator. <br />	2004-08-31

These thinkers are the ones that he believe can question special interests, corporate thinking, blind patriotism, even class or racial privilege. Above all, the intellectual is an exile and an amateur-that is, one consigned by choice to the margins. And one who can \\"speak the truth to power.\\" <br /> <br />No stranger to controversy while alive, one cannot help but read biographical inferences in Said's essays. He chooses figure like James Baldwin, Virginia Woolf, Henry Kissinger and Jonathan Swift that resisted money or power to uphold intellectual honesty and rigor of thought. They are also individuals whom social transformation was an essential goal-much like Said. Regardless of one's attitude to Said's own politics, this collection of lectures given a decade ago remain imminently pertinent and timely for discussion today.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-31

Ignatius Reilly, Confederacy's central character and quasi-hero, has to be one of the most singular and original literary inventions of the last few decades. He is a modern Don Quixote setting forth upon a series of hilarious misadventures and disasters in and around New Orleans' French Quarter. The caricatures in this novel are both stereotypes and quite real. There's a film version of this finally in the works as we speak. <br />	2004-08-31

Though to be sure, this is no comedic novel. It's a Western, and adventure with horses, guns and coming of age for the protagonist, John Grady Cole, the last of a long line of Texas ranchers. And that's the core of the book, the sense that America is shrinking, that there is no room left for cowboys or adventurers. There's a great line in the book that John's buddy Rawlins says to him as they set off to Mexico on their adventure. \\"I could understand if you was from Alabama you'd have ever reason in the world to run off to Texas. But if you're already in Texas. I don't know.\\"	2004-08-31

This is the story of the young Quentin Compson, a young southerner attending Harvard who is absorbed the history of the South, specifically the decaying remains of Sutpen's Hundred, a massive Mississippi plantation fallen into physical and moral ruin. As Faulkner is wont to do, the book can be challenging with multiple narrators, points of view and a shifting narrative. Or, another way to look at the brilliant novel is to consider it a puzzle that rewards the attentive, patient reader. Faulkner presents some wonderful fragments of a story and asks that the reader help in the reconstruction of a grand, tragic American tale. <br />	2004-08-31

It details his journey and the series of simple, universal lessons he learns along the way: namely, trust your heart. If you've read of The Little Price and Jonathan Livingston Seagull there will be familiar echoes here-and at times I thought it a bit formulaic-but numerous friends of mine really love this book by Brazilian author, Coehlo. So, here we are with a 10th anniversary edition of the book-testament to its huge following around the world. <br />	2004-08-31

It is ostensibly a backpacking journey across the country begun by a young, somewhat disenchanted man, but it is also very much a journey of self-discovery. A good portion of the memoir takes place in Alabama-in fact, it ends in Mobile-such as a stay in Mountain Brook as well as an eventful Alabama football game in Birmingham. The author's meeting with Governor George Wallace has to be read to be believed. It's a special book. <br /> <br />	2004-08-31

(Nichole Kidman won an Oscar for her role in the movie this year). \\"The Hours\\" was Virginia Woolf's working title for Mrs. Dalloway, and Michael Cunningham's book is something of a modern version of Mrs. Dalloway, or a commentary on it, or a dialogue with it, or an extension of it, or a novel in it's own right that uses elements of Mrs. Dalloway as a source of ideas. You don't have to read Mrs. Dalloway first to enjoy it, but it will enhance your reading.  <br />	2004-08-31

Millman decides that he's going to follow the Vikings' original sea route from Norway to the Shetland and Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, and eventually Newfoundland and the New World. The subtitle is \\"A Journey in the North,\\" and that is quite true. For most of us, it is an alien landscape he travels through, eating fried seal nose bits, being propositioned in Iceland, seeing an albino moose, meeting a convicted murderer and enjoying other truly bizarre adventures. Last Places defines the success of the travel genre: you read it and then say, \\"I have to go there and see for myself.\\"	2004-02-23
