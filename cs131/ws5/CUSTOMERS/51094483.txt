The author does a masterful job of capturing the ennui that is sure to follow every incoming class.  In typical Bret Easton Ellis' fashion, the book is brutally honest and impossibly hard to put down.  For fans of this book, I would recommend that they also check out Fried Calamari (imagine Sean and Lauren having a date 10 years after college) which does a great job of capturing the lost generation as they try to mature and find a stable relationship.	2002-10-18

The all-dialogue format really works to make the reader feel like she is sitting at the next table.  The characters are all too human and you can really relate to their struggles to make the evening work.  What I really liked is that the book really rings true and is highly insightful without failing into typical stereotypes.  Most of all, it's just really fun reading.	2002-09-24

It does a great job of capturing the nuances of dating and offers some valuable insights into today's dating culture.  While it's not as good as the series, I still found it refreshing for it's viewpoint that is not at all stereotypical.  I would also suggest readers take a look at Fried Calamari which is another insightful and witty look at modern dating that I recently read and greatly enjoyed.	2002-09-24

I read this book twice.  The first time purely for entertainment and on the second read, I tried to pick up all of the insights in the underlying subtext.  On both accounts, this book came out a winner.	2002-01-31

Casual fans of Steve Martin would be hard pressed to ascertain he is the author if the book was published anonymously.  What Shopgirl is, however, is a rather poignant look at modern day relationships.  And while Shopgirl certainly has some funny and entertaining moments, I found the strongest part of the book to be the insightful look at how differently men and women view relationships.  Steve Martin has done a good job of creating an entertaining quick read that still offers the reader more than comic relief.  For fans of this book, I would also recommend the novella Fried Calamari that takes a very entertaining and insightful look at how differently men and women view relationships.	2000-10-22

Even those couples fortunate enough to be in a very solid relationship can benefit greatly from this book.  If you make the effort, you will gain valuable insight into both yourself and your partner.  This book is the real deal, not like those Mars and Venus books.  I would also recommend the novel Fried Calamari to anyone looking for a funny and insightful look at the different ways men and women view sex and relationships.	2000-10-10

Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf is  a gem, but I only found it by looking at the &quot;People who bought this  book also bought...&quot; section.  This book was an amazingly well written  and funny book.  I would highly recommend Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf as  well as Fried Calamari (where I found the cross reference to this book) for  anyone wanting a highly entertaining novel about modern day relationships.   I'm introducing this book to my book club so I can have some other people  to talk to about this gem.	2000-09-17

But if you want to read a touching, fun, heartwarming  tearjerker of a novel, then sit back, relax and let yourself get lost in A  Walk to Remember.  Nicholas Sparks may not be the most literary writer out  there, but he touches a woman's heart the way D.M. Roman (the author of  Fried Calamari) touches a woman's psyche.  With Sparks, you know what you  get, and A Walk to Remember does not disappoint.	2000-09-17
US	51094483	R3JKD0ZV039KIU	0375506039	878470234	Open House	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Wonderful!!	Elizabeth Berg has created a modern masterpiece in Open House, capturing  all of the trials and tribulations of post-modern feminism.  While the  ending is somewhat predictable, the reader will enjoy an unforgettable  roller coaster ride in getting there.  Be prepared to cry a little, laugh a  little, smile a little and be torn in a thousand different directions.  You'll go through an emotional tug-of-war, but when you finish this gem of  a book, you can sit back and drink a glass of wine relaxed in the knowledge  that you've just read something very special indeed.  Being a recently  divorced woman, I could truly appreciate this book.  Although I think  anyone would enjoy Open House.  (As an aside, after I finished Open House,  I read a light hearted comedy called Fried Calamari about a divorced woman  back on the dating scene -- which served as a perfect anectdote to such an  emotionally packed book like Open House.)	2000-08-26

This is a must read for all single women (and men) everywhere.  Yes, it's farfetched in many instances, but the  underlying emotions are easy enough to relate to.  Along with Fried  Calamari (another very funny, sexy book about dating), I found Sex and The  City to be one of the most unique and entertaining books that I've read  this year.	2000-06-12

Melissa Banks novel is the best of the contemporary urban novels out there for single women in their late 20's to late 30's.  I loved it and it is written in a very original manner.  This book is better than either of the  Bridget Jones' series and is on par with In the Drink and Fried Calamari  (two books I would highly recommend for those readers who liked TGGTHAF)	2000-05-14

I really enjoyed Bridget Jones, but I agree with the other readers here that Tiffany Trott is clever, wittier and ultimately more likeable.  A great read.   Can't wait for a sequel.  I would still recommend Bridget Jones as well as  another funny book about dating called Fried Calamari.	2000-03-12

Fans of the orginal will not be disappointed. In fact, as much as I enjoyed the original, I think I liked The Edge of Reason better.  I  found the character of Bridget a little more developed and her insights  rang more true. And, of course, her wit and insecurities kept me interested  and laughing. (Bridget Jones' fresh perspective reminded me of the female  characters in Fried Calamari, and The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing --  two other books I would recommend.) All in all Bridget Jones is one of the  best characters in literature today. I highly recommend this book to both  readers of the original and those discovering Bridget Jones for the first  time.	2000-03-02

US	51094483	R1UQ0R5GP01GAS	0679742115	826671409	Vox	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good, not great	I found Vox to be a very well written book that is more about the vulnerabilities and emptiness of the characters than about sex.  I think some of the criticisms in the reviews are off-base in that this book is not  meant to be titilating.  I found Vox to be about two people reaching out  for something missing in their lives.  I do agree, however, that the author  could have done more to get that point across and to give the reader a real  point to the story.  Also, I'd like to thank the reader who suggested FRIED  CALAMARI (I really enjoyed it).	2000-03-01

The reader can sit back, relax and laugh at the anxiety, insecurity, and hope that accompanies a first date (while taking comfort that they are not on  the date themselves).  I found Fried Calamari to be witty, insightful, and  very entertaining.  It captures the fun (and horror) that we all have  experienced on a first date.	2000-02-20

Great character development that offers incredible insight into both the male and female point of view.  One of the  best books I've read this year (along with A WALK TO REMEMBER and FRIED  CALAMARI) about relationships.  The setting, the story and the  insightfulness of the characters make Gap Creek a truly special book.	2000-02-18

This is a very unique all-dialogue novel that really works.  I found the storyline not only intriguing but very compelling as well.  Interested  readers may also want to try reading VOX and FRIED CALAMARI, two other all  dialogue novels that I found to be compelling and entertaining.	2000-01-09

Claudia is self-absorbed, spoiled, a thief, a liar, and a hypocrite -- who stays true to her nature through the bitter end.  Which would be fine if she was at all interesting. Unfortunately for  the reader, she is not.  So we are left with another boring cliche-ridden  journey through the Manhattan nightclub scene.  The only turning point  comes from Claudia's boyfriend's &quot;revelation&quot; that seems to have  been stolen from The Best of Jerry Springer.  And, of course, any chance  for the slightest bit of arc in Claudia's character is lost as she reacts  in typical Claudia fashion.  I failed to find any of the witticisms that  other readers seemed to enjoy, but maybe they were lost in the annoying  whines of self-pity.  In fairness to the author, she does possess a  wonderful vocabulary (as does Claudia). Which only makes this novel that  much more disappointing as the reader can see the potential in both Claudia  and the author.  Alas, neither live up to that potential, and we are only  left to wonder what might have been.	1999-06-18
