But for me at least, this remains the least fun of all those junior high masterpieces.<br /><br />The animals at Manor Farm have had enough of Mr. Jones' despotic rule. Inspired by the deathbed speech of the prize pig Major, they rebel and kick the farmer and his wife out, rename their home \\"Animal Farm,\\" and declare they will henceforth not have any interaction with humans, creating an animal utopia that will hopefully inspire other farm animals in England, Ireland, and points beyond.<br /><br />\\"Animal Farm\\" is a short book, told as an allegorical fable, and Orwell's tone in telling his tale seems exactly right, depicting without emotion the gradual corruption of this supposed paradise. The novel presents clear parallels to the then-existing situation in the U.S.S.R. and contains a dead-on attack on its despotic leader, Josef Stalin, here presented as an opportunistic pig named Napoleon who bends the animal's classless utopia to his own self-aggrandizing ends.<br /><br />The book holds up today, long after the toppling of Soviet communism, because it's an elastic comment on how those hungry for power can manipulate altruistic ideals with the help of shameless propaganda and a population that is either fooled into believing its leaders, or too cowed to do much more than mutter about them.<br /><br />Most of the fun I get from \\"Animal Farm\\" is in the form of trying to guess what specific characters and events are meant to represent. Major seems to be based on Karl Marx, while Snowball, the pig who leads the Revolution before being betrayed and exiled by Napoleon, seems to combine the early Soviet revolutionaries Lenin and Trotsky. You can quibble with some of Orwell's apparent parallels, like the strained interaction between Napoleon and the neighboring farms, meant to suggest Hitler's Germany and Chamberlain's England. Stalin, for all his faults, didn't completely overturn the Soviet ideals he inherited.<br /><br />But he does get an awful lot right. It's noteworthy that the corruption of the Revolution begins even before Snowball's ouster, when we learn about the fate of the milk and the pigs' appropriation of the apples for themselves, a rare point of agreement between Napoleon and Snowball. While Stalin is the focus of Orwell's scorn, clearly he sensed something was rotten in the situation up front, before the purges and show trials.<br /><br />Except for the part when the pigs discover booze, \\"Animal Farm\\" lacks humor. More problematically, the characters lack sympathetic dimension, even the noble horse Boxer. Orwell wants us to get the point Boxer represents the dim-witted common man, bending himself to Napoleon's will, but since he has little to say except \\"I will work harder\\" and \\"Napoleon is always right,\\" it's hard to care about his sad fate, or that of the others.<br /><br />Orwell was a brilliant man, but a depressing one, and that holds true here. Orwell later called \\"Animal Farm\\" his attempt \\"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole,\\" but my one caveat with this otherwise terrific book is that the political accomplishment clearly outweighs the artistic.nt parallels, like the strained interaction between Napoleon and the neighboring farms, meant to suggest Hitler's Germany and Chamberlain's England.

US	50230169	R1IXKKW6NCHUBN	044018424X	689073601	Swag	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Crime And The Buddy System	Elmore Leonard has defined his career writing books like \\"Swag,\\" amoral tales of shady characters with some buried honor finding themselves up against people who are just bad, swathed in an atmosphere of casual danger and tough, smooth talk. But Leonard has had a great career, and \\"Swag\\" is a terrific early example of what he does best.<br /><br />Frank and Ernest meet when Ernest tries to steal a car at the lot where Frank works. Impressed by his moxie, Frank helps the thief out of a bind and then hits him with a proposition: How about we go after some big bucks?<br /><br />What Frank has in mind is a little strong-arm wealth appropriation, and for a while it works out pretty well. Cruising through the suburbs of Detroit, the pair hit bars, supermarkets, and liquor stores, flashing their pistols just enough to get what they want. The story is fast-paced, exciting, and fun, with lots of vignettes of assorted crimes. Though not likely to resonate with the reader after, it's an impressive example of Leonard's mastery of the form. He gets us to actually care about these lowlifes and wish them well, even as they rob innocent people of their hard-earned cash.<br /><br />Leonard does this by focusing on one of the pair, Ernest \\"Stick\\" Stickley. He's not enjoying the stick-up work, and thinks about leaving it for a chance to spend more time with his estranged daughter. But Stick has some things worth sticking around for, like the \\"career ladies\\" who hang around the pool where he and Frank Ryan live. To what extent can Stick trust Frank not to mess things up? Is Frank playing Stick for a fool? And why is he hanging around so much with the owner of a seedy nightclub?<br /><br />Some reviewers here suggest this is like a Quentin Tarantino version of \\"The Odd Couple,\\" which works for me. Though both men are more Oscar than Felix, we do see them in a number of amusing domestic arguments. There's that line from the TV show that comes back to me in thinking about this novel, Oscar telling Felix \\"Be cool.\\" That's a standard mantra in Leonard books, and you can hear Stick telling Frank this on almost every page as the action heats up in the second half.<br /><br />Before throwing them to the sharks, Leonard has fun figuring out how crime might indeed pay, as long as Frank and Stick follow Frank's ten simple rules for committing crimes. They're good rules, too. The problem is human nature being what it is, it's hard to stick with the program even when it's working, especially when you add booze, broads, and bullets to the mix.<br /><br />Leonard actually saves a lot of his twists for the ending, one of the best he's ever written. It's hard not to call this a classic, but there are more involving Leonard books out there, and more suspenseful ones. Still, you can't do much better for whipsmart dialogue. He has a way of getting you to pay attention with a few small words, like by having one heavy ask a simple question like: \\"Why would a man want to die at his age?\\"<br /><br />A book you can read in a single day, \\"Swag\\" has a lot going for it, the best being there's a lot more where it came from.s a standard mantra in Leonard books, and you can hear Stick telling Frank this on almost every page as the action heats up in the second half.

White? Where is the person who can write the history of a fresh presidential election cycle without alienating nearly half those who care enough to read it? Where is the scribe who can lead an anxious electorate back to its golden mean, to contemplate dispassionately on lessons learned, rather than battles lost and won?<br /><br />There's been a huge hole in the writing of contemporaneous political history since White's heyday, when his four \\"Making Of The President\\" books taking in the quadrennial election years 1960 through 1972 could be found on middle-class bookshelves across America without giving away the political leanings of the homeowner. But the hole is not quite as wide as I once thought, after discovering this book in the library. Of a piece with the \\"Making Of\\" series, the title suggests a condensing of 24 years in presidential politics, but really focuses on three elections White didn't cover in his previous histories, in brief those of 1956 and 1976, then, in greater detail, that of 1980.<br /><br />So what you really get here is a \\"Making Of The President 1980\\" with some opening observations on other campaigns. The book doesn't really tie up the whole of White's reporting with a \\"here's-what-I-learned\\" bow, and in that way the title's misleading, though he does offer some wisdom near the end accumulated from his experiences. One that sticks out: \\"Critical elections are not fixed in history by election night returns; they depend on what the victor does with his victory.\\"<br /><br />It was still an open question in early 1982, when this book was published, what Ronald Reagan would do with his 1980 victory. It was a bad spring for the economy, with high unemployment, a nasty recession, and popular unrest at home and abroad over the nuclear buildup Reagan was championing.<br /><br />But one gets a sense of White's sympathies being with Reagan all the same. He may not have understood conservatives, and writes of the anti-abortion movement particularly with deep scorn, but you sense reading White's observations about the 1970s and the election of Jimmy Carter that White's faith in liberalism, so clear in his \\"Making Of The President 1960\\" hagiography of John F. Kennedy, had not just been challenged but routed by the failure of the Great Society, the war in Vietnam, and the culture of complaint that became rooted around the Democratic party.<br /><br />\\"They had set out to free everyone and had created a nation of dependents instead,\\" White writes. Add to that a brittle president (Jimmy Carter) unable to make tough, effective decisions, and you have a clear recipe for change.<br /><br />It wasn't that White was a liberal or a conservative, or even a moderate. It was that he was able to take in all political viewpoints, weigh their respective merits and minuses, and offer in the end something deep and penetrating about what was going on with the nation at the time of any particular election. He had a deep vocabulary, an ear for the telling quote, an eye for vivid detail, but his greatest strength was his open mind.<br /><br />White writes especially well of Carter, his colorful Democratic challengers in 1980, and gets a penetrating interview with Reagan near Election Day where the exhausted candidate can't let go of his Carter attacks. \\"I wonder whether he's confusing some of his own statements with having come from God,\\" Reagan offers. White is more cutting here than in his earlier books, but he takes pains to present all his portraits in sympathetic context, and frankly, his acerbic takes on Carter are very entertaining.<br /><br />It's not a full-blooded \\"Making Of\\" book, and White does test your patience with a lengthy examination of the 1980 census, but given the resounding importance of the 1980 election, it's nice to have White's voice offering commentary one last time, and sad to reflect upon how it has been missed.rly with deep scorn, but you sense reading White's observations about the 1970s and the election of Jimmy Carter that White's faith in liberalism, so clear in his \\"Making Of The President 1960\\" hagiography of John F.

The British commandoes lay hidden in the bush. The train is coming 'round the bend. Just then, a British colonel, a POW, takes a final walk over the bridge he helped build for his enemy and looks over the parapet. His blue eyes narrow. Something is wrong...<br /><br />Those of you who think you know what will happen next, from seeing the Oscar-winning film adaptation of this novel, may be in for a surprise or two. Author Pierre Boulle's point seems less about the folly of war and of racialism (as was the case in the movie) and more about how a blind work ethic can make one betray the very things one holds dear, without knowing it.<br /><br />It's tempting to look at this book and think of it as a literary dig at the proper, orderly Brits by a typically relativistic French author. But Boulle, a World War II French resistance fighter who was captured by the Vichy in the Far East, apparently wanted to use the real-life building of the bridge (in reality, there were two) by British POWs as an examination of how warfare tilts moral scales and turns lawfully-minded leaders into traitors.<br /><br />It's an interesting position, presented here more in the form of a quasi-fable, or more to the point, two short stories joined together. In the first, we see British Col. Nicholson face off against Japanese Col. Saito, who expects the British to resign themselves to servitude, officers included. In the second, we watch a trio of British green berets prepare their attack on the bridge.<br /><br />One of the movie's main characters, the one played by William Holden, is not in the novel, which is fine with me. I found the guy annoying. But the other characters don't come into greater focus for his absence.<br /><br />Instead, they are rather colorless, especially Saito, presented here as a brutal drunkard with none of the panache that director David Lean and actor Sessue Hayakawa bestow on the character in the movie. It's especially hard to like Nicholson when Alec Guinness isn't giving us a spoonful of sugar with all that thematic medicine. He's more of a martinet here, dense to the point of ridiculousness, like when a subordinate suggests they paint the bridge after building it.<br /><br />\\"The most we could do would be to give it a coating of lime - and a fine target that would make for the planes, wouldn't it,\\" Nicholson counters. \\"You seem to forget there's a war on!\\"<br /><br />That's about as close as the book comes to humor. It is tense at times, but slow-moving, and like other reviewers here I found the book lacking in narrative detail that would have made it feel more alive. It's a quick read, worth reading especially if you enjoyed the movie. But I missed the Nicholson Guinness played in the movie, and if you were a fan of the film, so will you.like Nicholson when Alec Guinness isn't giving us a spoonful of sugar with all that thematic medicine.

Just two months after he took office, the New York Stock Exchange had its single worst day ever, losing over a fifth of its total value and plunging below 2,000 points. Twelve years later, Greenspan was accepting plaudits from a grateful nation as the same index floated toward 12,000.<br /><br />What did he do right?<br /><br />It's a question author Bob Woodward leaves unanswered. Woodward of course is the digging reporter best known for uncovering government secrets. But he's no analyst, and he doesn't tie himself down to taking specific positions about what Greenspan does right so much as report (mostly anonymous) opinions from others.<br /><br />By alternately holding off on interest rate cuts and hastening to increase them, Greenspan provides discipline in an era of what he memorably calls \\"irrational exuberance.\\" While staffers in his office wonder what drives such growth, Greenspan seizes on employee productivity as the right metric to track.<br /><br />But is Greenspan really the \\"Maestro\\" of Woodward's title? Woodward himself hedges his bets. \\"The economy had to grow on its own,\\" Woodward writes. \\"The Fed couldn't make it happen.\\"<br /><br />Using anonymous quotes is a Woodward trademark, but it doesn't really serve the book. Firstly, Woodward gives away who talked to him by reading their thoughts in the narrative, a style that quickly grates. Also, there's not enough dish given here to merit the Deep Throating. Greenspan blandly asserts his authority over the other Fed governors while providing such non-memorable soundbites as: \\"If we had complete capability of seeing into the future, this would be an easy job, but obviously we don't have that.\\"<br /><br />Greenspan's life before, and outside of, the Fed is treated with suspect deference. Forget Greenspan's formative association with famed \\"virtue of selfishness\\" harpy Ayn Rand. Woodward only touches on it to point up Greenspan's intelligence, not his controversially libertarian leanings.<br /><br />Woodward does a much better job explaining some critical moments in Greenspan's tenure. It's here \\"Maestro\\" is pretty effective, beginning with Greenspan's handling of Black Monday in October 1987, the day of that big 500-point Dow dip. Woodward also shows how well Greenspan worked with President Bill Clinton, who managed to turn around the deficit spending of his Republican predecessors and find the financial sturdiness under which America could enjoy its unprecedented bull market. \\"I couldn't have done it without what you did on deficit reduction,\\" Greenspan tells a misty Clinton on the eve of the latter's departure.<br /><br />Of course another reason for that bull market is the fact those same freespending Republican predecessors used their deficit spending to victoriously end an expensive Cold War, permitting Clinton's cutbacks. Woodward doesn't get into that, not surprisingly, especially since Greenspan had nothing to do with it.<br /><br />What I liked about this book was the understanding it gave me of an aspect of governance I didn't know much about before. It's actually pretty readable for a layman like me. But ultimately \\"Maestro\\" may boil down to a case of the wrong author for the story.reenspan's intelligence, not his controversially libertarian leanings.

US	50230169	R2728ZGX75BAG4	0192836013	154970587	Waverley: or 'Tis Sixty Years Since (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Like Reading K2, But Worthwhile	The first 200 pages of \\"Waverley\\" represent an early zenith for novelists testing the patience of their readership.<br /><br />After a lengthy introduction where author Sir Walter Scott mocks the romantic pretentiousness then abounding among novelists, he proceeds to introduce us to assorted personages we will never meet again before finally focusing on the opaque central character, whose name not only gives us the book's title but a sense of grating irresolution which comes to define him. The reader's feet start tapping.<br /><br />Scott then throws up a detailed sequence of non-events. Young Waverley joins the British army, marches off to Scotland, and becomes the guest of every Highland warlord with a grudge against His Majesty. I may have left off a couple of incidents, but that's the sum total of the action for the first third or so of the book. \\"Shall this be a long or short chapter?\\" he teasingly asks at the beginning of his 24th chapter, nearly 200 pages in.<br /><br />\\"Waverley\\" does eventually kick itself into a higher gear, not that it ever becomes a thrill-ride. But he imbues his mysterious Scottish landscape with an aura that swirls around the reader and, though hard to explain coherently, becomes not only quite charming but compelling, too.<br /><br />Waverley, like David Copperfield and many other such heroes of 19th century fiction, finds himself torn between two women, and as his attempts at wooing one fell painfully short, I found myself cutting across the chasm of time and really identifying with the guy.<br /><br />\\"The sensation of hope with which he had nursed his affection in absence of the beloved object seemed to vanish in her presence...\\"<br /><br />Scott's remedy for such pining is also too good not to quote: \\"I knew a very accomplished and sensible young man cured of a violent passion for a pretty woman, whose talents were not equal to her face and figure, by being permitted to bear her company for a whole afternoon.\\"<br /><br />I wish I had the stomach to finish this book the first time I tried to read it, when I was a sophomore in high school. It might have saved me much misery.<br /><br />The noteworthy thing about \\"Waverley,\\" as others here comment, is that it plays off the romantic ideal of the day in a character whose inconstancy is a deliberate statement about how such all-or-nothing sentiments can be misleading, even injurious. Edward Waverley, introduced to us memorably (if at great length) in terms of the books he starts but doesn't finish, becomes a waterbug skittering across the waves of history, once a loyal supporter of the Hanoveran throne, then a rebel Jacobite, as his loyalties are played by people of varying moral hues.<br /><br />\\"Well, after all, every thing has its fair as well as its seamy side,\\" Waverley declares by the second half of the book, beginning to understand.<br /><br />What makes \\"Waverley\\" a great book are the characters around Waverley more than the man himself, especially one rebel named Fergus who takes his measure of Waverley's indecisive character, and his station as the heir to a British title, in order to manipulate him. Scott does this so subtly we may feel ourselves as caught out as young Edward when he learns the score, but it works not only because it carries logical force within the ever-shifting narrative but doesn't turn Fergus into a villain so much as a man who does what he can with what he has.<br /><br />For all the romantic stuff, well presented indeed, it's the relationship between Waverley and Fergus that carries the strongest resonant strain, since it isn't exactly a friendship or adversarial, but a bit of both with an undercurrent of tragedy that becomes more focused toward the end.<br /><br />\\"Waverley\\" isn't a well-structured novel per se, given the sluggish opening and Waverley's pinball-like relationship to the politics around him. Readers of \\"Ivanhoe\\" will miss the firmer storyline of that work, not to mention comic relief in the form ofpithy Wamba of that book rather than the windy, Latin-loving Baron, though the latter has his moments.<br /><br />Everyone in \\"Waverley\\" has their moments, and they add up to a great book once the momentum gets going. It's a tough climb, but you'll be glad you made the effort when it's over.pithy Wamba of that book rather than the windy, Latin-loving Baron, though the latter has his moments.<br /><br />Everyone in \\"Waverley\\" has their moments, and they add up to a great book once the momentum gets going.

He never saw an ocean, yet before he turned 21, he would be flying and fighting over the largest of them. World War II was a transforming conflict in many ways. For Hynes, it was his ticket to a larger world.<br /><br />Not that he seems too happy for the experience. Yes, Hynes writes with humor, and some nostalgia, about his experiences fighting in the Pacific Theater with the Marines air wing in the last year of the war. Yet, when he describes his feelings about his return to civilian life as \\"the end of something that had been good, perhaps like the breaking up of a marriage,\\" it feels odd and wrong.<br /><br />Hynes didn't see a lot of combat, but he saw a lot of waste, deadly waste, pilots in training killed attempting maneuvers, or else later on, lost at sea because they were lost in the clouds. There are attacks on a Japanese-held island tucked too deep behind Allied lines to threaten anyone. There's no glory in Samuel Hynes' war; even the deaths of Japanese foes are related with bitter resignation.<br /><br />Hynes writes of his and his comrades' struggle less in terms of victory than simple survival, doing what the military asks them and no more. Hynes mentions the film classics \\"Wings\\" and \\"Dawn Patrol,\\" but there's more here of Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22,\\" where the carnage of World War II is played as a sick joke. Even the humor has that same acidic quality. When one pilot is lost at sea, only to be rescued, his comrades disguise their relief by pretending to have gotten rid of his belongings when he returns.<br /><br />The book is three-fourths over before Hynes reaches the only real battle he participated in, Okinawa. As he hops from post to post stateside, the narrative sometimes gets dull. But the overall tone of \\"Flights Of Passage\\" is what makes it worth reading. With most war books, the focus is naturally on battles, or individuals who made some difference in the conflict. Hynes, a self-described small cog in giant machine, writes of the other side of war, its boredom, pettiness, infidelity, and creeping ennui. Danger, too, and tragedy, but in such small doses one can never be ready for them, not ready enough.<br /><br />While his style is dispassionate and nonjudgmental, I get the feeling Hynes didn't care much for what he saw of the war. It's not that he was a bad Marine, just not a warrior.<br /><br />His best sections involve the spurts of battle he did see, his impressions of flying the different combat planes of the era. Corsairs were prized as beauties but prone to spinning out during landing approaches, while the Hellfighters were \\"all muscle and no guts.\\"<br /><br />Hynes spends a lot of time on his comrades, but except for one hotshot he gets close to named Joe, none really stick out, not even Hynes. Carefully written, at times beautifully, the book avoids any non-factual embellishments that might make it more readable but less true, the kind that other memoirists would defend as compensation for fading memory. The result is a flat, dry read, but one you trust to tell it like it was.<br /><br />I'm glad for the service Hynes gave his country, more perhaps than Hynes himself. But his book makes clear why wars, even when fought for the most noble of purposes, leave scars and a sense of loss that outweighs any triumph, however worthy.ndividuals who made some difference in the conflict.

Carefully written, at times beautifully, the book avoids any non-factual embellishments that might make it more readable but less true, the kind that other memoirists would defend as compensation for fading memory. The result is a flat, dry read, but one you trust to tell it like it was.<br /><br />I'm glad for the service Hynes gave his country, more perhaps than Hynes himself. But his book makes clear why wars, even when fought for the most noble of purposes, leave scars and a sense of loss that outweighs any triumph, however worthy.	2005-09-11

Other times, you find yourself reading a book where you have a pretty good idea what the twist is going to be, only you keep reading because you care so much about the central character you hope you're wrong. The second kind is more impressive to me, and \\"The Golden Orange\\" is a perfect example of it.<br /><br />Joseph Wambaugh's 1990 novel focuses on a boozy ex-cop's love affair with a beautiful society girl on the coast of Newport Beach in Orange County, California. Maybe that's why people are down on it; it's more Raymond Chandler than Ed McBain. Yet I can't help loving \\"The Golden Orange,\\" one of the most humorous and emotionally compelling novels I have ever read.<br /><br />There isn't anything here to surprise film noir enthusiasts, though this is much different in tone and story. With his masterly sense of characterization, Wambaugh starts off putting the reader in the shoes of Winnie Farlowe, a hard-drinking 40-year-old forced off the local police because of injury. Adrift, wishing he could return to a job where he mattered, he wastes his small pension drowning his sorrows in one of the few cheap dives in Orange County, occasionally getting a peek at the well-heeled around him.<br /><br />Winnie's a hard guy not to like, with his sardonic yet humble manner. Told he is ingenuous, Winnie asks: \\"Is that like ingenious? I used to be ingenious sometimes. Working on homicide gave me ingenious moments.\\" He's so straight up he pays child support for his ex-wife's kids because he adopted them during the marriage. The only thing he's not straight up about is his drinking: \\"I'm not an alcoholic. I jist shouldn't drink rum!\\"<br /><br />After a mad drunken boat ride lands Winnie in the papers for a couple of days, into his bar walks an unexpected grace note. Tess Binder, a 43-year-old thrice-divorced \\"Hot Momma,\\" saw his picture in the paper and felt something, it's hard to explain what exactly, that made her want to reach out to Winnie.<br /><br />In no time they're in bed, she's asking him to stay the week, calling him \\"old son,\\" seeking his help in figuring out what happened to her father's lost fortune and why someone might be trying to kill her. Protective Winnie is convinced his life just passed perfect and is somewhere north of sensational. Except when he dreams.<br /><br />Wambaugh finds a cagey balance between amusement and gravity with the alcoholic Winnie. When we first meet him is having one of his three-in-the-morning wake-up calls with his version of pink elephants, two buzzards he visualizes pecking at his stomach. He's so used to them he's given them names.<br /><br />There's also a nice portrait of Newport Beach, Wambaugh's home turf when he wrote \\"The Golden Orange.\\" After a small temblor gets his customer praying, a bartender wisecracks: \\"A day to go down in Newport Beach history...Fifteen square miles a greed and white-collar crime. And people finally pray because of a little four-point-sixer.\\" Among the funny asides is a dissertation on the different kinds of rich, and how the Hot Mommas work their tans and plastic surgeons in a never-ending quest to marry up.<br /><br />The one downside of the book is a tinness of dialogue: The bar Winnie frequents is full of drunks who seem to one-up each other with wisecracks straight from Neil Simon. But this wouldn't be as much of a flaw in a lesser book. There are moments, mostly between Winnie and Tess, where the conversations ache with real emotion, and you can almost hear the lilt of laughter in Tess's voice.<br /><br />Other people express their frustration with Wambaugh after his 70s/80s commercial peak, but \\"The Golden Orange\\" makes me want to read more. I love his humor here, but I treasure his sensitivity and his compassion for the unlucky and dumped-upon even more. It's a keeper..

US	50230169	R2BO6T571IA5X0	0553264907	977328985	The Devil's Alternative	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Detente Turns Deadly	After turning spy fiction upside down with his first three novels, Frederick Forsyth took a lengthy breather before returning with this, his first foray into geopolitics. While dated in some ways with its Iron Curtain setting and talk of Ukrainian liberation, \\"The Devil's Alternative\\" remains a clever, fast-paced return to form by the then-young master.<br /><br />As a grain mishap threatens the U.S.S.R. with famine, a British operative is contacted by a former lover who has access to transcripts of secret Politburo meetings. While U.S. and British leaders deliberate over their volatile contents, a Ukrainian partisan brings the emerging crisis to a flashpoint by hijacking the world's largest tanker just off Amsterdam.<br /><br />What's missing in \\"The Devil's Alternative\\" is a compelling central narrative. Not that what's here isn't compelling, but unlike the earlier Forsyth novels, there isn't one clear lead character to follow. Adam Munro, the British agent in Moscow, comes closest, but his is but one of three stories Forsyth the ringmaster puts in front of us, and Munro is not present in the two most dramatic parts, that being the hijacking of the Freya and the deliberations in the Politburo as the premier tries to fend off a power grab by zealots bent on starting World War III.<br /><br />This might disorient some looking for a more straightforward thriller, but what's here is good, solid spycraft, nicely layered with Forsyth's attention to detail. The Politburo material is especially terrific, even if it consists largely of talking heads and shuffling papers. Forsyth finds that believable level of real human tension in every situation.<br /><br />\\"The Devil's Alternative\\" is very much a product of its time, pre-Reagan and the \\"Evil Empire\\" speech. The focus of President Matthews, a thinly-veiled Jimmy Carter, and his mostly dovish cabinet is to keep the peace with the USSR, even if it means giving the Russians millions of tons of grain in return for hollow arms concessions. Forsyth, who is sometimes described as politically to the right of Attila the Hun, demonstrates a surprising friendliness to this realpolitik-lite approach, though he may just be making his points in more subtle ways.<br /><br />Forsyth's acerbic insight into the motivations of the central players is mercilessly acute: \\"In his time he had learned that, in principle, politicians have little enough objection to loss of life, provided that they personally cannot be seen publicly to have had anything to do with it.\\"<br /><br />This may also be the best book in demonstrating Forsyth's cleverness with storyline. Time and again, he sets the reader up for one action and then delivers another. Even when you expect a twist, Forsyth's way of delivering them is breathtaking. Bear down especially with the last chapter, as Forsyth turns over cards you didn't even know he was playing.<br /><br />There are logic gaps, as other reviewers note, and the story drags a bit more than it should at the beginning. But those who keep reading will be amply rewarded. \\"The Devil's Alternative\\" is a good alternative to nearly any thriller published today.metimes described as politically to the right of Attila the Hun, demonstrates a surprising friendliness to this realpolitik-lite approach, though he may just be making his points in more subtle ways.

That wasn't exactly a newsflash, Charlie. But given the title of the book suggests some skinny on the biggest thing to hit the desert since the Pharaoh's army did their Esther Williams impersonation, namely that quintet of talented joes (well, quartet and Peter Lawford) who turned Las Vegas into Jilly's West at the dawn of the 1960s, it took some of my shine off to get the warmed-over Kitty Kelley instead.<br /><br />Shawn Levy can write, that's for sure. He slaps together a ring-a-ding-ding narrative full of sex and cocktail-hour wisecracks, written in the tough-guy patois of the Rat Pack itself, which he admirably sustains for more than 350 pages. But as he explains frankly in his acknowledgements (though it is clear long before), he chose \\"to treat my work not as biography but as analysis,\\" to present the Rat Pack \\"as a kind of organic phenomenon, a being that lived for a few years around the turn of the sixties with roots stretching back to its principals' childhoods and effects haunting them until their deaths.\\"<br /><br />Levy could have done better. He did, back when he wrote the superb Jerry Lewis bio \\"King of Comedy,\\" in which he both did some great analysis and the accompanying legwork, including a remarkable interview with Lewis himself. Levy feels like he's coasting here, throwing up regurgitated bits of other books and piecing together what comes off more as a windy, repetitive GQ profile than an attempt at studying what has become, more now than it was at the time, an entertainment milestone.<br /><br />There's a nice opening where Frank and his main Summit pal (they didn't like the term \\"Rat Pack\\") Dean Martin decide to swap roles on stage, with Frank making the wisecracks and Dean playing straight guy. Only the audience still laughs with Dino, because, as Levy explains, they really liked him. They were more in awe of Frank than actually comfortable with the guy.<br /><br />That's analysis I can use. But most of the time, Levy is content to ignore the stage-side banter and glittery spotlight moments for what the Pack, and especially Frank, was up to when they didn't play to the crowd. Most of Frank's downtime seemed to be spent with either the Mob, President Kennedy, or various fine ladies. Sometimes it was all three at once, at which point we were lucky J. Edgar Hoover was the suspicious misanthrope he was.<br /><br />It's scary to think of to where the Kennedy Administration, not to mention our nation, might have descended had Hoover not gotten Bobby to make his brother cool it with Sinat and the gun molls. Levy has a lot of fun elaborating on this, as well as Sinatra's ill-conceived venture into Lake Tahoe, Cal-Neva. There's also a chapter consisting largely of a list of names, famous women Sinatra bedded, or perhaps just was rumored to have bedded. I got a kick out of spotting Nancy Reagan's name, then I saw Sal Mineo's...<br /><br />The problem with all this is it's not the Rat Pack, just one of the guys when he wasn't Packing. There's little to be read about what the Pack did in their glory years, what their parties were like, what the audiences had to say after their shows. Levy does quick two- or three-paragraph summaries on each of their movies, not great films, but a likely basis for some original reporting Levy leaves be.<br /><br />The Rat Pack comes across ultimately as childish and boring, maybe because that's how Levy wound up finding them. Then why write a book about them? The way he paints them, it makes no sense why Peter Lawford was so crushed to be stripped of his Rathood. I know I couldn't wait to escape these guys.hat's analysis I can use.

MacLean was the ultimate airplane fiction writer, someone whose picaresque, globe-trotting adventure novels could be devoured in a single sitting.<br /><br />He might be remembered for thin characters and wooden dialogue, but it was MacLean's fast-paced narrative, often very alive and tactile, that gained him fans. Something else, too; he had a formula but a lot of creativity within that formula, an ability to develop gripping stories by putting his good-guy-bad-guy adventure yarns in unusual settings and situations. In that way he was a lot better than many give him credit for.<br /><br />Unfortunately, MacLean's mobile imagination didn't always produce great fiction, which leads us to \\"Caravan To Vaccares.\\" A mysterious fellow named Bowman shadows a group of mysterious, murderous Gypsies around the south of France. He jokingly explains his motives to his companion Cecile as being those of \\"a vengeful layabout,\\" but what he's really up to is left opaque.<br /><br />Adding to the chemistry of mood here is a group of mysterious women being held captive by the Gypsies, one with weals covering her back; a Chinese couple that appear and disappear at several points in the narrative, saying nothing but watching everything; a charging bull; and a French duke of marked appetite and hauteur who may not be as much of a neutral observer as he seems.<br /><br />\\"Le Grand Duc,\\" as he is called, is the most interesting character in \\"Caravan,\\" and MacLean has fun with him. Bursting in on a budding hostage situation, he is told he can't just barge in.<br /><br />\\"Nonsense. I am the Duc de Croytor. Besides, I never barge. I always make an entrance.\\"<br /><br />\\"Caravan\\" is nonsense, though fun at times around the middle when MacLean gets going with a clever reverse chase between Bowman and the Gypsies. He's chasing them chasing him. There's a good opening, too, of a Gypsy's murder, which MacLean paints darkly and well.<br /><br />But as the story progresses, it becomes harder to follow. MacLean gets caught up in the sport of playing with reader expectations. You think one thing is going to happen, so something else does instead. Nearly every character has a hidden identity; one has two. The back end of \\"Caravan\\" becomes one confusing about-face after another, winding up in a too-cute tidy resolution with one character calling out \\"Encore!\\" No thanks.<br /><br />Also weak is the Gypsy angle, which is never explored in any great depth. You feel like he made the bad guys Gypsies just because it would make for good cover art.<br /><br />I was amused by some of this book, and enjoyed its first half pretty well. But a thin setting and confusing narrative really brought me up short. I had no problem reading the book; it's MacLean, and something to make a flight pass quickly.

As described by Joseph Conrad, the title character of \\"Lord Jim\\" had no real love for ocean voyage or relish for adventure except when it was inside his own head. His \\"dreams and the success of his imaginary achievements\\" were \\"the best parts of life, its secret truth, its hidden reality.\\" His passage to the Far East was destined to prove a ticket to failure, and so it was, when he abandoned a foundering vessel filled with pilgrims to save himself.<br /><br />Now his shame is the stuff of conversation in every roadstead and harbor between India and Australia. Can the chastened dreamer manage to recover his lost sense of honor in a distant land where no white man will come to tell of his past mistake?<br /><br />\\"Lord Jim\\" may be set in the Pacific, but its ideas are universal, as Conrad takes on the contradictions behind the Western concepts of honor and bravery. Published in 1900, the novel feels like the start of the modern literary era in both its loose, ambling structure and its questioning of the base convictions of right and wrong still girding society today. \\"Lord Jim\\" hasn't lost much of anything in the 105 years since it was published. If anything, it's more relevant than ever.<br /><br />Who is Jim? Is he a hero, a coward, or a victim? Is he all three? Part of the problem pegging him is the fact the fellow doing most of the talking about him, cagey Marlow the narrator, doesn't seem too sure himself. That ambiguity is another way in which the novel is modern. At one point Marlow even seems to suggest Jim is no more than a figment of his imagination.<br /><br />\\"He existed for me, and after all it is only through me that he exists for you,\\" he tells his anonymous group of listeners at one point. It's interesting Marlow is only identified by his last name and Jim by his first. Are they two halves of the same person?<br /><br />While playing with the metaphysics of identity and of right and wrong make \\"Lord Jim\\" vital and important, Conrad's deep engagement in humanity's many odd and nasty facets makes it fun. He creates a myriad of secondary characters inhabiting the backwaters of the West Indies, of varying moral shadings, finding amusement in even the cruelest.<br /><br />One singular nogoodnik tells Marlow he wants the disgraced Jim to work for him on a barren island harvesting guano. It's not much of an offer, he knows, but there is one benefit: \\"Anyhow, I could guarantee the island wouldn't sink under him - and I believe he is a bit particular on that point.\\"<br /><br />\\"Lord Jim\\" is a great book not for its message so much as its lived-in depth, a sense we are really there on Marlow's steamy veranduh amid casuarina trees or aboard a creaking brigantine sailing placid under a crepuscular sky. Conrad really engages you as a reader, and while he plays with the narrative structure, and allows the story to drift quite a bit, often frustrating me and other readers at least the first time through, the book remains engaging and illustrative about both its theme and subject.<br /><br />Dark? Yes, but not oppressively so. In a way, Conrad is taking a humanistic approach to a nihilistic question, asking what good notions of honor and glory really do mankind when most of us aren't fated to join life's immortals. Do we have the right to expect more of ourselves than life itself allows?<br /><br />At one point, when a minor character obsessed with his sense of honor kills himself, Conrad asks a burning question worth keeping in mind: \\"Who can tell what flattering he had induced himself to take of his own suicide?\\"ement in humanity's many odd and nasty facets makes it fun.

Kennedy quizzes his driver about the smelts in Lake Superior and reveals a boundless curiosity. His Republican opponent, Richard Nixon, addresses an audience \\"the way the man in a white smock selling an analgesic does on the television screen.\\"<br /><br />Before \\"The Making Of The President 1960,\\" writing about presidential races was stiff and by-the-numbers. Author Theodore H. White saw the potential to capture a democratic nation in transition with near-stroboscopic precision, not to mention all the hothouse drama and character that tended to get swept away with the ballot stubs on Election Day.<br /><br />The book won a Pulitzer, coined a lingering phrase in its title, and became the first of four successive presidential campaign write-ups by White. More significantly, and perhaps more to the point of its winning the Pulitzer, it presented a lovingly detailed account of Kennedy's victory. The first man born in the 20th century to win the presidency, Kennedy seemed to augur a transformation of the Republic from stolid, old-fashioned virtues to something fresh and dynamic, a compassionate liberalism willing to stretch further than Roosevelt's stodgy New Deal, and there were many in the writing class like White who saw this as something worth celebrating.<br /><br />\\"Imagine, just imagine kids who never drink milk,\\" Kennedy asks aloud while visiting the poor hills of West Virginia, a state he manfully toils in despite deep suspicions there about his Catholic faith.<br /><br />White was writing about himself as well describing Kennedy's \\"national press cult,\\" but his close identification with the Democrat helps more than hurts \\"Making '60.\\" He starts the book with a characteristically atmospheric look at the Kennedy compound in Massachusetts, a lonely gull floating over the Hyannisport shore while the candidate, finally away from the cameras on Election Day, shows confidants the calluses and scratches from all the flesh-pressing he did.<br /><br />Of course, Kennedy benefited from having Dick Nixon to kick around. I almost wrote \\"Kennedy and White\\" in the last sentence, but White doesn't attack Nixon so much as expose a degree of torpor in his campaign, noting that Nixon was less hard-boiled than his opponent. For a long period, Nixon avoided saying anything negative, fearful it would only augment the Neanderthal image the press had saddled him with. Then, during the first-ever televised debate, Nixon made the mistake of focusing on the ideas at hand while Kennedy played to the cameras, looking terrific.<br /><br />Unlike Kennedy, Nixon didn't give White an interview, let alone invite him to hang out with his inner circle. White doesn't provide the less seemly details of Kennedy's rise, like the rumors of cooked vote tabulations in Chicago and West Virginia, and only raises the issue of what role his father's money played as something to refute. But White gives you a sense of riding alongside Kennedy as he rises to his moment of history, and communicates such exhilaration relating the details of democracy in action, it's understandable why so many political journalists point to \\"Making '60\\" as a key influence in their career choice.<br /><br />The only problem I had with \\"Making '60\\" was a long chapter about the 1960 census, and what it says about the shifting character of the nation. This is White at his most tedious. As he burrows into numbers and data points, we lose the human connection and sense of everyday life that makes the rest of his book so alive.<br /><br />It's a shame the other \\"Making Of...\\" books are out of print; all are worthy histories and the final two are more compelling than this, as White's rose-colored glasses came off and his ability to sense history grew sharper. But he was off to a fine start.Of course, Kennedy benefited from having Dick Nixon to kick around.

In fact, you might put down \\"The Final Fury\\" feeling like you knew less than when you picked it up.<br /><br />Wars usually end messily, and the American Civil War was no exception. There was no formal, final surrender; Lee's color-striking at Appomattox Court House only ended the war for one Confederate fighting force. While the government moved out of Richmond, other Rebel forces remained, dormant but unbowed, including Kirby Smith's Trans-Mississippi force which was the last but one to give up. Before that happened, there was minor fighting with Union troops, culminating at Palmito Ranch on the Rio Grande in Texas.<br /><br />A Union colonel trying to gain some 11th-hour glory led a combined force of Indiana and free black infantry as well as \\"Yankee Texas\\" cavalry to Brownsville, tangling at Palmito Ranch with a similarly irregular Confederate force led by John Ford, not the director, but a similarly rough-hewn fellow upon whom Tucker showers much approbation.<br /><br />The battle was more of an engagement, and a one-sided rout at that. Unfortunately, Tucker feels the need to pad this thing out well past the breaking point. With little in the way of first-hand accounts to draw from, Tucker offers much supposition and endless repetition of facts that weren't that key the first dozen times he mentioned them. He varies the casualty count on both sides with amnesiac imprecision, describing the mortal wounding of a Confederate soldier on one page, then suggesting a few pages later that no Rebels were killed at all. He trots out tortured \\"ironies,\\" such as the battle ended with a shot being fired eastward just as happened at Fort Sumter, the first battle, and that both were Confederate victories.<br /><br />But unlike Sumter, Palmito Ranch didn't change much of anything, and the central problem for Tucker may be the insignificance of his story. Even Bruce Catton would have had his hands full trying to make a silk purse of this. But Tucker, though his intentions seem good, has little to say and a frightfully bad way of saying it.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book, Tucker, whose Rebel sympathies are obvious though balanced, suggests the possibility that some Union troops, in particular the Texas riders, were shot after surrendering to their brother Texans. That might have made a more interesting basis for a book than the engagement itself, but instead the idea is merely raised with the vague comment people still find human remains around the battle site. It's the one time one wishes Palmito Ranch had the services of a better historian.or Tucker may be the insignificance of his story.

Confidential	There's a twist about 75 pages in to \\"The Zero Game\\" that left me furious with author Brad Meltzer for about ten seconds, before I realized how masterful it was and surrendered my scowl for a 10-minute grin. When a writer manages to shock you so effectively, you have to stop and admire it.<br /><br />But the rest of the book doesn't live up to that early promise, showing off Meltzer's intimate knowledge of Washington and Capitol Hill as a former congressional intern but failing to deliver a taut or believable storyline. We meet interesting characters and plausible characters, though never at the same time, as well as an indomitable villain named Janos who is neither. Not to mention sappy sentimentality, creaky dialogue (\\"they're setting up shop like that scene from 'E.T.' when the government shows up\\") and a centerpiece chase through a very deep mine that runs out of steam long before the heroes run out of oxygen.<br /><br />It's a shame, because the concept of \\"The Zero Game,\\" a seemingly innocent diversion between bored staffers involving vote counts and meaningless bill attachments suddenly turning deadly, holds a lot of promise. In the first 100 pages, Meltzer sucks the reader in, leading us through the corridors of real power in the U.S. government, then making us dizzy by pulling one startling, paranoid plot-twist after another out of his hat. I'm reluctant to give even these early story bits away, since they are the best parts of the book, but fans of \\"L.A. Confidential\\" and \\"Six Days Of The Condor\\" (which shares a Washington, D.C. setting) will like what they read here and wish for more.<br /><br />But then we get to that filibuster-length part inside the mine, where, like the protagonists, I felt in the dark trying to follow what was going on, hobbled by an increasingly inability to care. The two characters, at this point staffer Harris Sandler and a Senate page who comes to regret aligning herself with him, seem to compete over how selfless and heroic they can be under pressure, losing in the process much of their early spark.<br /><br />I liked the idea of a Senate page being the focal point of this thriller, having been one myself. Meltzer calls them \\"ghosts in blue blazers\\" and limns such a vivid picture of these otherwise invisible public servants that I got flashbacks reading details like the giant water fridges and busy assignments desks in the party cloakrooms and the underground tram carrying workers to various Senate and House office buildings.<br /><br />But you don't need to have been a page to find Viv Parker's actions unbelievable, no more than you need to be a physicist to realize you can't turn lead into gold playing pinball with leptons. Even when Meltzer returns to the Capitol, and recaptures some early momentum, unreal clich&eacute;s persist as bad guys keep hopping out of nowhere and good guys under attack reach deep inside themselves for hidden reservoirs of strength they never dared guess existed.<br /><br />Still, Meltzer shows signs at the outset of being a better adventure plotter, and while the writing is largely prosaic, there are nuggets of welcome insight and cleverness I hope he works on mining more from in future novels. Noting the Capitol has four \\"fronts\\", i.e. East Front, West Front, etc., Meltzer has Sandler comment: \\"Four sides of a building, and not one of them is the back.

But it's a remarkably readable book, more so than \\"1776\\" despite the entertaining style McCullough has perfected. In a category of writing that seems divided between \\"academics\\" and \\"popularizers\\", Fischer's \\"Washington's Crossing\\" crosses the divide of history-writing with as much deceptive &eacute;lan as that fellow standing on the boat.<br /><br />Fischer has a story to tell, very similar to \\"1776\\" except Fischer's book, despite the title, is concerned less with Washington himself than the troops around him, the Continental Army which shrunk to near-dissipation following the loss of New York. Fischer takes pains to sketch these men out, in a very readable way.<br /><br />Fischer is especially taken with their spirit, as expressed by one of Washington's chief aides, Lt. Col. Samuel Blachley Webb: \\"Never was finer lads at a retreat than we are... No fun for us that I can see; however, I cannot but think we shall drub the dogs.\\"<br /><br />Fischer begins the book with an examination of the painting of Washington crossing the Delaware that remains the lasting image of that time, noting that it is popularly criticized for all the wrong things, like showing Washington standing when sitting on a thwart would have been more practical. Fischer points out the boats had too much icy water at their bottoms for low sitting, and later reveals, without delving into the pregnant meaning of such a thing, that Washington spent at least some of the ride sitting on a beehive box.<br /><br />Washington here doesn't come across in the same vibrant way he does in \\"1776\\", but as the character of the army rather than its leader was in question in the days before the battles of Trenton and Princeton, that seems the right approach to me. Fischer takes great pains to sketch the adversaries as well, giving them a humanity while avoiding the moral relativism that makes history-writing so often dull and doctrinaire. The British and especially the Hessians plundered and murdered captured foes far more often than Washington's Continentals, and that made a difference in how the fighting turned out.<br /><br />There's a moral center to \\"Washington's Crossing\\" that, as an American, makes it satisfying to read. Not only were the battles of Trenton and Princeton (actually two battles at the former town, days apart, as well as a \\"Forage War\\" which followed) strategically significant, but they set a tone for the young nation in holding to a course and not allowing adversity to blind them to moral duty. It had a spiritual dimension, as ill-focused as that spirituality often was, \\"that sense of optimistic fatalism which had appeared before in this American army... a feeling that Providence was with them that night.\\"<br /><br />And so are you, thanks to Fischer.<br /><br />There's a note of triumphalism to the book, a sense of the war being won with the British retreat from New Jersey, which doesn't allow for the fact 1777 was a worse year for Washington than was 1776. But hopefully Fischer will feel inspired enough by the success of this book (he won a Pulitzer for \\"Washington's Crossing\\") to write further chapters about the Revolutionary struggle.gton here doesn't come across in the same vibrant way he does in \\"1776\\", but as the character of the army rather than its leader was in question in the days before the battles of Trenton and Princeton, that seems the right approach to me.

Kennedy might well have been the world's first mass-media tragedy, in which an event so calamitous as to seer itself into the minds of everyday citizens coincided with technology's ability to put people on the scene. \\"President Kennedy Has Been Shot\\" is a valuable, addictively readable record of how the terrible news of a presidential assassination was relayed to the public.<br /><br />Using first-person accounts from more than a score of newspaper, radio, and television reporters covering what they thought would be a friendly visit to Dallas, the book presents a compelling mosaic of short narratives that quickly takes you from the tarmac of Love Field, where Kennedy and wife Jacqueline are greeted by an adulating crowd, to the seconds after shots were fired and confusion over whether the president had been hit, and if so how badly, ran riot.<br /><br />It's interesting how right the media got so much of this difficult story. Breaking into a soap opera to give CBS's first television bulletin minutes after the shooting, anchorman Walter Cronkite described Kennedy as \\"seriously wounded.\\" Less than an hour later, he would announce Kennedy's death, choking up as he did so, as he admits in his recollection for this volume.<br /><br />A lot of reporters struggled with their emotions while trying to scoop the field, at times breaking up on-air. Kennedy may have been the last president the press really liked, and they took his death hard for that, and also as they found themselves not only filtering the facts but articulating the emotions their audience was going through.<br /><br />Mistakes were made, of course. One early report had Vice President Johnson wounded as well, while one reporter on the scene when suspected assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was gunned down in a police garage didn't see Jack Ruby, who was pretty hard to miss, especially for NBC viewers who watched the killing live. But the story was on the whole covered extremely well.<br /><br />Accompanying the book is a CD where Dan Rather, then a young CBS reporter and the first to report Kennedy's death (though that is apparently a contentious point) narrates a series of television and radio reports of the assassination and its aftermath, as well as such non-broadcast items as Lyndon Johnson's first call after taking the Oath of Office (to Rose Kennedy, JFK's mother, who heartbreakingly addresses Johnson as \\"Mr. President\\") and an announcement of Kennedy's killing at a horror-struck concert hall.<br /><br />Also heard on the CD are three people who didn't survive the four days in question: Kennedy (getting a laugh in a speech at Fort Worth the morning of his death), Oswald (giving a non-answer to a reporter's question on whether he shot the president), and Dallas police officer J.D. Tippett, responding tersely to a dispatch call to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity right after Kennedy's shooting.<br /><br />The book could have used more connecting narrative; what's there is good in setting a tone but I was never sure whether the purpose of the book was to recount the events around November 22 or the media's response to it. It's also very difficult to follow the CD in the book, the latter follows a strict chronology while the former jumps around, and there are items in the CD like Johnson talking to Martin Luther King that aren't recounted in the book.<br /><br />But there's a immediacy to the package as a whole that grabs one, especially listening to radio reporter Ike Pappas as he describes Oswald's killing while looking at a picture in the book that show Pappas standing over Oswald's shoulder as Jack Ruby lunges forward to shoot him. Oswald ironically would be pronounced dead in the same room as Kennedy, and perhaps less ironically, be carried to his grave by reporters enlisted at the spur of the moment, an appropriate send-off for mass media's first dark celebrity.where Dan Rather, then a young CBS reporter and the first to report Kennedy's death (though that is apparently a contentious point) narrates a series of television and radio reports of the assassination and its aftermath, as well as such non-broadcast items as Lyndon Johnson's first call after taking the Oath of Office (to Rose Kennedy, JFK's mother, who heartbreakingly addresses Johnson as \\"Mr. President\\") and an announcement of Kennedy's killing at a horror-struck concert hall.

Al Rosen stuck his neck out to help the government put some goons in prison, only it didn't go according to plan. Now Rosen is in hiding for his life. Life was still good until Rosen helped some old timers get out of a burning hotel, and wound up getting his face in the papers. Now he's on the run in Israel with three killers on his tail and a U.S. Marine for company. The Marine wants to help. Maybe he should ask Rosen what happens to do-gooders.<br /><br />Elmore Leonard in 1977 was still years away from being embraced for marrying suspense stories with witty dialogue, quirky characters, and off-center humor, but he was well on his way toward perfecting that approach when he wrote \\"The Hunted.\\" In some ways echoing Leonard's past as a writer of westerns, with Mexican standoffs by dry wadis, \\"The Hunted\\" isn't exactly scintillating by Leonard's later standards, but it more than holds its own.<br /><br />You can almost see Quentin Tarantino adapting it for the screen, with Rosen's way of wooing 40-something women to bed and characters who digress about God while waiting for the guns to start blazing. The bad guys are not without their enjoyable qualities, and there's Mel Bandy, a fat lawyer of no discernable morals whose idea of wooing an attractive assistant involves walking around her in a towel and inviting her to bed with him by telling her she can close her eyes and pretend it's someone else.<br /><br />Leonard throws some nice philosophy here, too, though it doesn't get in the way of the terse narrative:<br /><br />\\"Don't let people scare you; because nine times out of ten they don't know any more than you do,\\" Rosen explains to the Marine. \\"Or even less. They got there pushing and shoving, acting, conning...If they had to get by on basic intelligence - most of the people I've done business with - they'd be on the street selling Good Humors and probably ------- up the change.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Hunted\\" didn't amuse me like great comic Leonard novels such as \\"Maximum Bob\\" and \\"Freaky Deaky.\\" It didn't thrill like \\"Rum Punch\\" or \\"Bandits.\\" The plot is actually kind of threadbare, and a little nonsensical, when you think about Rosen's unresolved financial situation and how it's supposed to be resolved by a visit from the untrustworthy Bandy.<br /><br />But \\"The Hunted\\" manages to keep you reading, and surprises you more than a little at the end. You'll enjoy the amiable company of both the good guys and bad guys while appreciating Leonard's mastery of his craft.

David McCullough's \\"1776\\" does a lot to redress that.<br /><br />Taking as his focus the first full year of the American Revolution, and then pushing to the background the one event of the Revolution most commonly associated with it, the Declaration of Independence, McCullough crafts an engaging, quick-moving narrative of America's first army, and its somewhat untried leader, in victory and defeat.<br /><br />\\"The eyes of all America are upon us,\\" said Henry Knox, one of George Washington's most able lieutenants. \\"As we play our part posterity will bless or curse us.\\"<br /><br />As McCullough makes clear, it was a near-run thing. The British enjoyed not only superior numbers, but better training and often, better on-the-field judgment. Trying to hold onto New York too long, Washington isolates nearly 3,000 dearly-needed troops on the tip of Manhattan, where they are invested and captured by the enemy. Even his most beloved officer loses faith in him, trusting instead the dubious and fractious deputy commander Gen. Charles Lee.<br /><br />In just a few months, from August to November, Washington's personal command shrank from 20,000 to 3,500. Worse, morale was racked by a series of defeats, and the knowledge crops were withering back home while the Continental Congress, readying their retreat from Philadelphia, bickered over paying them.<br /><br />As Thomas Paine would note in a document that McCullough indicates was of greater significance to Washington's troops than that Declaration, \\"These are the times that try men's souls.\\" Fortunately, Washington's meager troops had some assistance from unlikely quarters, as McCullough illustrates.<br /><br />Like Elizabeth Loring, a Tory wife who wrapped the British commander-in-chief in a longtime affair that pulled his attentions away from the battlefield at crucial periods in the conflict...<br /><br />Like Banastre Tarleton, the most dogged and ruthless of British leaders in the Revolution, who by capturing Gen. Lee as Washington was most vulnerable made the decision of sticking by the man from Mount Vernon the only practical option for the United States long before it was the obvious winning one...<br /><br />Like the fog that rolled in as the Continental Army lay exposed in mid-crossing of the treacherous East River...<br /><br />Modern minds may call it luck, though McCullough's expert culling of contemporaneous accounts shows Washington and his men were more apt to credit Providence, in the various ways they defined that. Whatever the reason, success came because Washington, for all his faults, believed completely in his cause, and never gave up. It's a lesson with resonance for Americans, today and always.<br /><br />McCullough's book is shortish, not terribly detailed on the logistics of the battles, and cursed with poor maps. A couple of reviewers correctly note episodes that McCullough leaves hanging, and I would add the opening scene of King George in London doesn't gel with the rest of the narrative and feels like padding to bring it close to 300 pages.<br /><br />But \\"1776\\" is entertaining history with important lessons about the power of stick-to-it-tiveness and a compelling drama about the birth of a nation that nearly died in its cradle.s attentions away from the battlefield at crucial periods in the conflict...

Yet its sharp insights on society and religion, not to mention liberal and welcome doses of sarcastic good humor, offer far more than a mere precious curio.<br /><br />Charles Ryder, an officer in the British Army, finds himself suddenly stationed at a base located at the now-empty manor house of his long-lost friend, Sebastian Flyte, and his noble family. Being back at Brideshead, as this country seat is called, stirs Charles to remember what he had, what he lost, and what he carries with him.<br /><br />Waugh's ability with language and his keen insights into the human condition are on full display in this, his best-loved work, though it's atypically serious of intent for someone who is popularly thought of simply as a curmudgeonly, grandiloquent wit. For all his talent on display in other novels, you get a sense it came together here in a remarkable way. Waugh here paints a detailed and celebratory portrait of the good life, of picnicking on strawberries and white wine in secluded bowers, trysts on cruise ships, and life lived amid museum-caliber splendor, yet at the same time presents a compelling argument for Catholic austerity and discipline in seeking life's higher purpose.<br /><br />For Charles, it is a hard journey that takes him from being a young student at Oxford who believes with confidence \\"that to know and love one other human being is the root of all wisdom\\" to becoming a sadder, older man who begins to ponder: \\"Perhaps all our loves are merely hints and symbols; vagabond-language scrawled on gate-posts and paving-stones along the weary road that others have tramped before us.\\"<br /><br />Waugh writes with a fine sense of style and language, and cleverness, too, but in this book, unlike any of the others of his I have read, you get a feeling of sympathy, too, of people being observed not just with precision and wit but compassion, too, which is both unexpected and welcome. He promotes his faith unreservedly, but not uncritically, offering hard questions and a sense of grace as hard-won. Humor, too; like the stories one girl tells a credulous would-be convert about how Catholics all believe in \\"sacred monkeys\\" and sleep with their feet pointing East \\"because that's the direction to Heaven.\\"<br /><br />The occasional purpleness of the prose and some later dialogue is oft-commented upon, True, Waugh let himself go sometimes, but given the beauty of his writing, which is really about the best there is, its hard to begrudge the extra line, or the odd declamation that rings a bit false upon reflection. So much else here feels so alive. This is a book worth reading; savoring, too, though the reading's the only part you will have to work at.<br /><br />Whether or not you find the task of reading the novel daunting, worth checking out is David Cliffe's Evelyn Waugh website, which includes a detailed and illuminating \\"Brideshead\\" reading companion, and of course the excellent Grenada TV series from 1981, which is how I and so many others got here in the first place.

Even with firm Democrat majorities in the House and Senate, there would be those who, whether out of caprice, malice, or simply not seeing issues the same way, wouldn't play ball.<br /><br />Complicating matters was a national economy that Clinton had made the central concern of his campaign (\\"It's the economy, Stupid\\" became such a mantra Clinton insiders shortened it to ITES) and now threatened to bury him after years of profligate spending by his Republican predecessors. Before any meaningful change could occur, Clinton had to work on such capitalist esoterica as interest rates and deficit reduction.<br /><br />The liberal side of Clinton balked: \\"I hope you're all aware we're all Eisenhower Republicans,\\" Woodward recounts Clinton yelling at his cabinet. \\"We stand for lower deficits and free trade and the bond market. Isn't that great?\\"<br /><br />It is at this point, more than a third of the way in, that \\"The Agenda\\" zooms right up there with \\"The Brethren\\" and \\"The Final Days\\" in terms of Woodward tomes. Not that Woodward's prose ever sings (he is strictly meat-and-potatoes that way), but the story evolves into one of good intentions clouded by hubris and political calculations. Even when progress is made, passions run high, way high, too high.<br /><br />Political consultants who should have been given letters of reference after the Inauguration are instead allowed to roam through the White House browbeating economic advisors about low poll numbers more than three years before the next presidential election. Congressional Republicans are ignored so contemptuously that conservative and moderate Democrats on the Hill get nervous.<br /><br />And then there's Hillary, who while her husband desperately insists he's no tax-and-spender, casually tells a roomful of senators she'll need $100 billion in new revenue to nationalize health care. When a friendly Democrat asks for her to back up on that obvious red flag, she replies: \\"That's the truth and they better get used to it.\\"<br /><br />The book ends with the successful passage of Clinton's first budget and with Hillary's health care initiative still alive. In fact, things would get worse for Clinton before they got better; 1994 presented him with Republican control of the legislature for the first time in 40 years. That's probably not what he had in mind when he talked about being an \\"Eisenhower Republican.\\"<br /><br />As a character study, it's not much, but \\"The Agenda\\" lays out the early history of the Clinton Administration in what seems a fair and balanced as well as absorbing style. A lack of quotes hurts; Woodward notes that all his many interviews were done not for attribution, and won't be made public for 40 years.<br /><br />Even Mark Felt didn't have that good a deal. Also the reader misses out on being able to understand who told Woodward what and gauging why they did so. But since some like George Stephanopoulos say Woodward was on the mark (even though his participation cost him Clinton's good graces), it seems like the reporting here was solid. Woodward isn't a pundit, thank God, and he's no Zola, but he shows here why he is considered by so many to be one of the best reporters ever.on are instead allowed to roam through the White House browbeating economic advisors about low poll numbers more than three years before the next presidential election.

It was also a presidential election year, but not so interesting as such, with incumbent Lyndon Baines Johnson running as heir to his martyred predecessor Kennedy against a Sun Belt Republican most saw as a right-wing kook.<br /><br />\\"It was over before it began,\\" Theodore H. White acknowledges near the end of his history of the campaign, \\"The Making Of The President 1964.\\" \\"The issue had been decided long before - perhaps within minutes of the fatal shot at Dallas.\\"<br /><br />That shooting in Dallas, almost a year before the election proper, is the setting for the opening of the book, and it offers a vivid account of just what was going on in those chaotic initial minutes and hours after John F. Kennedy's murder. White describes the funeral procession, the carting up of Kennedy's possessions in the Oval Office, and the rent feelings of the nation with sharply-focused prose that reads like poetry.<br /><br />White seems less engaged in the rest of his narrative. His heart obviously broken by the death of Kennedy, a personal friend, he is at a loss to describe the principal combatants of this campaign. Johnson was an outsider to the Kennedy circle still smarting over the East Coast Establishment types who rejected him. LBJ wouldn't give White so much as a single interview for his book, as White makes clear in a cagey footnote. Barry Goldwater, the Republican challenger, is more welcoming but no less aloof, and inscrutable to White, a moderate liberal who can't fathom how such an extremist got the reins of a major party.<br /><br />\\"In Goldwater, one had to take all or nothing,\\" White notes, and though that's true with any presidential candidate, that's more of a problem with Goldwater, who spoke enthusiastically of using nuclear weapons in conventional combat and voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<br /><br />White seems to have trouble getting a handle on many players in this book, including the civil rights leaders whom White either describes as faultless angels (Martin Luther King) or vicious racists (Adam Clayton Powell) without much gray allowed. Too often he sinks into platitudes, crediting Johnson for his \\"deft response\\" to North Vietnamese attacks at the Gulf of Tonkin, when in fact his response was confused and plunged us deeper into war; or explaining to us the higher moral purpose that led Nelson Rockefeller, Republican governor of New York, to take a married mother of four as his mistress.<br /><br />Better writing on that score comes from White's account of Rockefeller's angry speech to Goldwater supporters at the Republican convention in San Francisco, where he incites the crowd into an extremist fury. One angry woman screams back: \\"You lousy lover!\\"<br /><br />Every once and again, White gets it right, as with the many moods of Lyndon Johnson, \\"the most extreme swings between tenderness and cruelty, between dedication and cynicism, between comedy and high purpose.\\" White even mentions Johnson's otherwise secret tape recordings, which when examined back up much of the LBJ reporting here.<br /><br />About Goldwater, White is less certain of his ground, but whether from charity or clarity of vision, his likening of Goldwater to William Jennings Bryan in the pantheon of failed presidential candidates has turned out quite apt.<br /><br />White was still trying to keep on his Camelot-colored spectacles in this second campaign history, but the painful adjustments he struggles with here, once made, would render far better his third and fourth installments of this series to come \\"Making '68\\" and \\"Making '72.\\"cluding the civil rights leaders whom White either describes as faultless angels (Martin Luther King) or vicious racists (Adam Clayton Powell) without much gray allowed.

You'll find me at the bar.\\"<br /><br />Alistair MacLean has fun with his sarcastic protagonist, and his levity is much needed with a storyline that gets gothic and overwrought. The drug trade is the nemesis in this taut action yarn, equal parts mystery and \\"Dirty Harry\\"-style rogue cop story.<br /><br />Actually, I was reminded a lot of Nelson DeMille reading this, something I wasn't expecting. MacLean is known for his fast-paced action yarns, but not for the humor he shows off here, often and well. Like DeMille, MacLean here presents a wonderful narrative voice that deepens our sense of engagement with the tale's teller by using humor and a feeling for the moment that is at times quite fine.<br /><br />Occasionally the plot seems to almost veer into parody, as when Sherman checks into a hotel and almost immediately is set upon by a hopped-up bellboy. There's also an attack by wimple-wearing haymakers and the use of a safe as torture device. I wish he had let himself go more in a comical direction with these ideas, but he had an army of readers who expected otherwise.<br /><br />It's not an easy book to follow, maybe because I was reading it too fast. One bit on the last page between Sherman and a woman is especially odd; I'm still not sure if he was proposing to her or exposing her as a double agent. The villains, when revealed, as not exactly who you expect in part because their motives and modus operandi make no sense. Of course, MacLean is writing for effect here, nowhere more so than in the title image of a Dutch doll hanging from a hook, which the bad guys use to demonstrate their menace. Why? Don't ask, just keep reading.<br /><br />But that's the easy part. It's a fast, fun read. The best bit is when Sherman does some investigating of a barge operating around the Zuider Zee; MacLean's ability to convey the sense of the natural world and its elements is on full display in a night scene with \\"the faint threnody of the wind and the soft creaking and rubbing as the wind made the barges work gently at their moorings.\\" After eluding some assassins, Sherman gets on the wheelhouse roof and quickly realizes he's likely to freeze to death in the hard winter cold coming off the water.<br /><br />Since he's telling you all this, you sense Sherman will pull through, but MacLean keeps many balls in the air and the reader isn't let off so easy. You might feel a little like that puppet on a chain as MacLean dangles your expectations and pulls your strings; but his intentions are honorable and it's all in good fun.of a Dutch doll hanging from a hook, which the bad guys use to demonstrate their menace.

The book is divided into two parts, the first of which draws us into the lush, amiable beauty of Savannah, Georgia, with its sleepy squares, Mercer songs, cold cocktails, and manor houses occupied by eccentric, slightly dangerous, but always charming characters; the second of which throws us in a convoluted murder case in which darkness springs out and a sense of evil's complicit character grows within you and yet, the charm of the first half remains vibrant as ever.<br /><br />Some might call it voodoo. Berendt himself says he knew he had a bestseller when he first saw the cover photograph, a Gothic statue of a little girl holding two bowls, her head slightly tilting toward one with an ironic smile on her face. It sets the whole tone of the book, that we are going to get a balancing act between good and evil, fact and fiction, generosity and greed. Even the North-South dynamic is played with, as Berendt is a visitor from New York disoriented by the strange casualness of this very traditional place.<br /><br />Great dialogue abounds, much of it of the overheard-in-the-hallway variety. Two old ladies are whispering at a party about a Luger used in a murder, and you the reader bend an ear.<br /><br />\\"My late husband blew his brains out with one of those,\\" says one.<br /><br />\\"Oh! So did mine! I'll never forget it.\\"<br /><br />I should say not. Nor will you forget the case of antiques dealer Jim Williams and his naughty boy-toy, or the marabou-clad beauty of yesteryear who bosses around the help with a stevedore's vocabulary and seems the real-life model for Bette Davis' character in \\"The Little Foxes.\\"<br /><br />A minor criticism of \\"Midnight\\" is that Berendt's wanderings through the fair Georgia seaside city seem to acquaint him exclusively with old women and gay men. The transvestite Lady Chablis gets to be a minor annoyance. I guess the whole concept of \\"faction\\", that is the telling of a factual story through fictional constructs such as imagined conversations, sits poorly with me, but Berendt not only maximizes the obvious entertainment potential of such a method, he managed to write something that most everyone in Savannah was not only comfortable with but took pride in, especially when the tourist dollars started rolling.<br /><br />\\"Midnight\\" has a mysterious charm that draws you in, and rewards return visits. At its conclusion, Berendt's narrative ironically lights upon a tour bus, ironic because the bus has but three passengers. After his book came out, Savannah became a kind of Disneyland destination for the book's millions of readers.<br /><br />In the conclusion, Berendt notes the tourists leave \\"none the wiser about the secrets that lay within the innermost glades of its secluded bower.\\" We feel much wiser after finishing this great book. But are we? Again, \\"Midnight\\" is a balancing act that holds together very well, and you will enjoy the game of reading it.real-life model for Bette Davis' character in \\"The Little Foxes.\\" <br /> <br />A minor criticism of \\"Midnight\\" is that Berendt's wanderings through the fair Georgia seaside city seem to acquaint him exclusively with old women and gay men.

US	50230169	R1UOXK8IB41JGC	0446364800	859674593	The General's Daughter	Books	3	31	34	N	N	Kinky Murder Mystery Lusty But Lacking	When Nelson DeMille gets going, there are few fiction writers to beat him. Other than \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" in Sanskrit, there's nothing more difficult for a reader than putting down \\"Plum Island\\" in the last 150 pages. \\"The General's Daughter\\" actually is the reverse, though, pulling you in quickly and then running out of steam.<br /><br />The concept grabs you fast: A female Army officer is found bound, naked, and dead on the rifle range of a Southern military installation. A Criminal Investigation Division warrant officer is pulled from his undercover case to investigate the homicide, and learns about the victim's secret life, which basically consisted of rough sex games that connected to her interest in aberrant psychology and her own wounded past.<br /><br />DeMille provides some details into what this is all about, with descriptions that are quite graphic, though more in a clinical than salacious way. I didn't have a problem with this, though I can see why others would. Not only is the victim sexually active, she is actually quite eager to be hurt. At one point, she talks about being raped by a male character as the only time she found him \\"interesting.\\"<br /><br />This is thin ice for a writer to skate on, but DeMille carries it off because his depiction of the character, Capt. Ann Campbell, is both vivid and compassionate. DeMille works the reader's libido, creating an edgy, lusty portrait much like Sharon Stone did on screen in \\"Basic Instinct,\\" the same year of this book's publication. Yet the more you read of her, the sorrier you feel.<br /><br />\\"Why do some men think they have to be knights in shining armor?\\" we read in her journal. \\"I am my own knight, I am my own dragon, and I live in my own castle.\\"<br /><br />The problem with \\"The General's Daughter\\" is none of the living characters seem as alive. Not only do they lack Capt. Campbell's dark spell, they are rather inert and soulless. Paul Brenner, the CID investigator, has some good wisecracks but his tough-guy routine wears thin.<br /><br />With him is former flame and rape specialist Cynthia Sunhill who DeMille needs in this book not only to give Paul someone to talk to by way of exposition but also to remind us from time to time that rape and suchlike are bad things most women really don't like. But DeMille's attempts to create some romantic interest between the two investigators feels forced, and by the end of the book, fairly absurd.<br /><br />Also a problem is the mystery. Though well set up, it just didn't make much sense when it was over. Like other reviewers here note, there are too many suspects and too little is done to fill the reader in on how, other than gut instincts, the investigators come to focus on one. There's a slow crawl to the end, a sudden resolution, and a number of questions DeMille strangely leaves unanswered, like the reappearance of a ring and the disappearance of a material witness in another case.<br /><br />In the end, I couldn't get Capt. Campbell out of my head, and I'm guessing DeMille couldn't either. After the first 100 pages, the book never seems to go anywhere without her in it. Even though her story has its share of logic gaps, too, she's so erotically high-charged in her uncomfortable, heroic way you kind of skirt over them until after you get through the novel. \\"The General's Daughter\\" is one mystery where the victim is more interesting than the crime.is former flame and rape specialist Cynthia Sunhill who DeMille needs in this book not only to give Paul someone to talk to by way of exposition but also to remind us from time to time that rape and suchlike are bad things most women really don't like.

Stewart's \\"The Prosecutors\\" is a worthy follow-up to his solid first book, \\"The Partners,\\" another take on the real-life practice of American law in the 1980s that focuses this time on those the state relies on to penalize lawbreakers.<br /><br />For readers in 2005, the most interesting aspect of the book is its early take on likely future presidential aspirant Rudolph Guiliani, called \\"Rudi\\" here as well as other less flattering things. Stewart doesn't do a hatchet job exactly, he offers Guiliani's side of the story, but as he is described in \\"The Prosecutors\\" Guiliani comes off as the boss from hell, undercutting his own prosecuting team to make nice with some corporate wrongdoers and writing off their subsequent complaints as the whining of \\"jerks.\\" I wouldn't want the guy Stewart describes running my country, put it that way.<br /><br />\\"There are ways of doing what Giuliani did gracefully,\\" one unnamed member of his U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan claims. \\"We'd hear the rumors that somebody was out for weeks. By the time there was a memo or announcement it was an established fact. The person being fired was usually the last to know. Rudi's hatchet was bloody.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Prosecutors\\" is about more than Giuliani, though. It's a nice cross section of actual cases, from the somewhat humorous takedown of a Japanese corporate espionage ring operating in Silicon Valley to a taut murder mystery outside CBS News headquarters in New York that plays like a good \\"Law & Order\\" episode.<br /><br />Stewart does provide sage analysis, and demonstrates a clear understanding of how the law operates which a careful reader will take much away from. The big negative is his writing style is somewhat flat and juiceless, not breaking out of the high-toned Wall Street Journal-form Stewart cultivated in his years of reporting for that publication. That and he doesn't offer much in the way of dates to help the reader figure out the chronology of the often-complex cases he relates.<br /><br />But the six cases he relates are well chosen for the different views they give of prosecutors at work, sometimes succeeding, sometimes going down in flames. Unlike \\"The Partners,\\" the book holds together as a single work, with a nice job from Stewart of tying the various stories into a narrative whole.<br /><br />Most interestingly, Stewart delves into the psyches of the people who take on the role of prosecutors, and examines when its wise to press forward with a case when the wrongdoing isn't clear-cut and when its better to step back. He quotes Henry Singer, a Depression-era prosecutor, as saying: \\"Anyone who seeks to become a prosecutor should be disqualified on that ground alone.\\"<br /><br />Maybe that's overstating it a bit, but if you ever watched an episode of \\"Perry Mason\\" and ended up wondering about poor Hamilton Burger, this book should be plenty interesting.es he relates are well chosen for the different views they give of prosecutors at work, sometimes succeeding, sometimes going down in flames.

Chauncey Gardiner, is cast out of the garden he has tended which has been all he has ever known of the world, left to fend for himself in uncaring Manhattan. A fortuitous accident leaves him in the care of a dying plutocrat and his young, sexually frustrated wife, for both of whom Chance is the perfect tabula rasa upon which to affix their aspirations and sensibilities. How soon before they guess at Chance's true nature, and kick him out of their world? Or will he somehow avoid detection, with his storehouse of borrowed phrases and techniques he has learned from television?<br /><br />Jerzy Kosinski can't tell a joke to save his life, but he writes with beautiful clarity.<br /><br />\\"And yet, with all its life, even at the peak of its bloom, the garden was its own graveyard,\\" goes one early passage of Chance tending his garden. \\"Under every tree and bush lay rotten trunks and disintegrated and decomposing roots. It was hard to know which was more important: the garden's surface or the graveyard from which it grew and into which it was constantly lapsing.\\"<br /><br />If \\"Being There\\" the novel suffers from one thing, it's \\"Being There\\" the movie. There, Chance is played by the sublime Peter Sellers, who finds every glimmer of humor in Chance's character, adds some more, and yet carries Kosinski's character to metaphoric heights the author himself didn't envision. There's also the fact that the film plays more assuredly with the video medium that is a central theme in both stories, throwing up bits of real commercials and children's TV to play up against the plot shifts.<br /><br />What the book has going for it is its use of fable-like elements that don't translate so well onto film. The Russian ambassador tells Chance that he has \\"that certain Krylovian touch,\\" referring to a popular Russian fable-writer, and its true enough. Near the end of the book, we are told by a White House observer that the sequence of events that have brought Chance to global attention span fill just four days, which is clearly not in the realm of reality as we know it, especially given the soporific pace of events in the book.<br /><br />There's an edge to this fable: The Russian ambassador goes on to send Chance a copy of Krylov's fables in the original Russian, which we discover has been taken from a recently arrested Jewish dissident. But characters who present a voice of skepticism in the film, like Louise the cook and Dr. Allenby, are absent here. So too, alas, is the film's finest single moment, its enigmatic ending which actually underlines the fairy-tale quality of this story.<br /><br />Chance does have some self-knowledge in the book, just enough to wonder who he is and whether he will become two people when he appears on television, the Chance on TV and the Chance who watches. Within its simple constructs, Kosinski asks some deep questions and presents us with food for thought. Plus he doesn't take very many pages to do it.

Do you look at one of Q's gadgets and ponder the limits of technology, or see Barbara Bach in a silken nightie and wonder about the gender politics of the Bond corpus?<br /><br />If so, Jeremy Black has written the book for you. \\"The Politics of James Bond\\" takes on the political as well as social constructs underlying both the original novels by Ian Fleming, as well as the subsequent films. Given the enormous impact of Bond on world culture for half a century, this seems a worthy enterprise. Black certainly knows his Bond, able to deftly move from plot point to plot point in particular stories and explain what was going on at that moment in the Grand Scheme of Things, either a Cuban missile crisis or a spy ring scandal or the advent of the Pill, to draw appropriate connections.<br /><br />Black is especially on target, and amusing, when he notes the various ways Bond has been modernized over the years, as when the films, with Timothy Dalton by then playing Bond, took on a Jesuitical strain:<br /><br />\\"It was acceptable to have an agent who blew up and shot people at will (and without the concerns of Fleming's Bond), but he was no longer allowed to smoke or have sex, a contrast that reveals much about the nature and impact of modern political correctness.\\"<br /><br />He takes a similar critical approach to Fleming's novels. It's clear Black admires Fleming's writing, and though he echoes the criticisms of Fleming's Old World snobbery, he is also careful not to attach modern sensibilities to Fleming's often-badly-dated views of racial and sexual differences. He calls attention to Fleming's \\"racialism\\" rather than \\"racism,\\" and it's an important distinction, that Fleming could be patronizing about blacks, for example, and yet more willing than many of his time to see beyond stereotypes; certainly not be ruled by them.<br /><br />For all his cross-indexing and learned discourse, I never got a sense of whether Black thought Bond was any good for society, whether his value extends beyond box-office proceeds. Also, he takes a second-hand approach to explaining the Bond stories, assuming everyone has the same familiarity he does with every novel and film. While he starts pulling out recondite quotes from \\"Octopussy\\" to glean insight in male-female relations, I'm trying to remember if that's the one where 007 tells the tiger to sit.<br /><br />While the book is advertised as \\"How James Bond has changed the world - and how the world has changed James Bond,\\" it's really more about the latter than the former. Maybe the premise of the book is off, maybe he didn't spend enough time working out the merits of the individual stories over their cultural impact. Does anyone care about what the film version of \\"The Man With The Golden Gun\\" has to say about the energy crisis anymore?<br /><br />Black has written a smart book and done his homework.

Fleming's one attempt at a non-fiction book thus held promise, yet fails to deliver.<br /><br />\\"The Diamond Smugglers\\" is based on a series of conversations Fleming purports to have with a diamond-smuggling investigator he names \\"John Blaize.\\" I say purports because Blaize's words, both as quoted by Fleming and in an introduction supposedly penned by Blaize, sound very much like Fleming. \\"The trouble with diamonds is every stone carries the germ of crime in it,\\" Blaize explains.<br /><br />The trouble with \\"The Diamond Smugglers\\" is not so much its sense of unreliability but that it's boring. Instead of capers, we get a geography lesson of coastal Africa. The device of channeling the narrative second-hand creates an automatic disengagement with a series of unimpressive tales about investigations undertaken for the great diamond mining interests of the time by what came to be known as the International Diamond Security Organzation, or IDSO. From what can be gathered but is never directly said in this book, the IDSO didn't exactly accomplish very much, yet Blaize adopts a stultifying self-congratulatory tone from beginning to end.<br /><br />Smugglers, Blaize tells us in his introduction, \\"will hear of this book and read it, out of fear or vanity, to see if their activities have been revealed or their names mentioned.\\" Or perhaps for a laugh at the authorities who tried so fruitlessly to root them out.<br /><br />Stories include an investigation into how Liberia, not one of Africa's more diamondiferous nations, became a clearinghouse for diamond export. In one case, a small-time smuggler who keeps a diamond in a vaseline jar is snitched out by a pretend-friend angling for promotion. At one point, the IDSO tries to run a double agent, but he comes back with nothing.<br /><br />When another double agent dies in a plane crash just as he is on the verge of cracking a case, Blaize labels it \\"curious\\" and leaves it be. We are told of great criminal figures who spirit away some diamonds and melt into the shadows, but Fleming and Blaize assure us we are safer not knowing their names.<br /><br />As journalism, this wouldn't merit a segment of \\"60 Minutes.\\" The book is only worth reading for the view it gives us of James Bond's creator switching gears, apparently while researching his Bond novel \\"Diamonds Are Forever.\\" The best parts are when Fleming sets the stage for his conversations with Blaize, in levanter-battered cafes or beaches, where we get that sense of place Fleming conveyed so well. Some humor, too: At one point, in Morocco, Fleming and Blaize avert suspicions about what they're up to by pretending to have a captured coelacanth, a \\"living fossil\\" fish whose discovery was all the rage at the time, in a bathtub.<br /><br />Fleming pronounces himself impressed at the end with this real-life \\"secret agent,\\" calling him \\"a professional to his fingertips.\\" Yet the only thing John Blaize has in common with James Bond are his initials. Otherwise he comes across as a boring bureaucrat with some dusty second-hand stories to throw up. Fleming, in passing them on so breathlessly, seems to have been a bit of a dupe.h nothing.

US	50230169	R1XOWMN6IRFJFR	0449200019	861620876	Athabasca	Books	1	9	12	N	N	Frozen Stiff	The moment I realized \\"Athabasca\\" had to be one of the worst suspense books I ever read came when one of the heroes found himself chained to a steel ring set in concrete while a \\"dragline,\\" in essence a giant tractor, is set in motion to run over him, very slowly.<br /><br />\\"Goodbye, Mr. Dermott,\\" says a bad guy before leaving. \\"You have two minutes to live.\\"<br /><br />What follows is one of the slowest performances of the adventure yarn's oldest clich&eacute;, the rescue of the damsel from the railroad tracks, except here the damsel is doing the rescuing. For all its faults, this is \\"Athabasca's\\" one moment of genuine action, even if it moves like molasses.<br /><br />\\"Athabasca\\" is a sad, dispirited-feeling book from an author who did much better work. As Joseph Shembrie noted here, Alistair Maclean had his battle with the bottle, and it's no trick guessing which was winning when he wrote this. The heroes avail themselves of alcohol at every spare moment, retiring for some belts of whiskey, even daiquiris at times, when they could instead be acting on one of the many hunches they get about who is sabotaging oil-processing facilities in Alaska and Alberta, a plot they have been hired to foil. The drinking here is as copious (if not as entertaining) as \\"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?\\", yet Maclean treats this as if it were not only natural but edifying behavior.<br /><br />The jocundity of this besotted band is a little tough to take as the bodies start dropping. After meeting one character, the leader of this band, Jim Brady, observes \\"Pity he acts so suspiciously - otherwise he'd have made a splendid suspect.\\"<br /><br />This casual air taken by the heroes to their work might be even more frustrating if the story was easier to follow. But you never really cotton to what's going on. You have two plots set in motion at two very different oil facilities run by two different entities, apparently for extortion purposes, yet until the last 60 pages there are no demands made. The bad guys instead kill people and blow things up to make the point they are serious. We know the same people are responsible in both cases, but why do they spread themselves so thin by covering such a large section of the icy North American outback? And why do they persist in their destruction for so long before asking for money?<br /><br />Several times the author seems to lose track of his plot. At one point, much attention is given to the broken finger suffered by one of the novel's four corpses (all the killing takes place off-screen, as it were; the narrative consists largely of wooden dialogue.) Yet the explanation for the injury, when given, makes no sense. Also stretching it are two breaks in the case, one when a woman is dropped 100 feet from a helicopter and just happens to land on a snow drift, and another where a hostage passes on some vital information. Brady breaks the case by letting himself be captured so the bad guys in their mistaken smugness will spill their story.<br /><br />Keeping track of all the interchangeable minor characters presented as suspects is not only impossible but pointless. The heroes don't act on their suspicions about which are the criminals as it would interfere with their drinking time, and when the evil gang is at last revealed, the big \\"A-ha\\" moment is considerably dampened by the fact they are mostly either obscure or unknown to the story as told to that point.<br /><br />In essence, \\"Athabasca\\" is as torpid and unwieldy as that menacing dragline, and a poor representation of Maclean as one of the great adventure writers of his day.blow things up to make the point they are serious.

Doctorow's \\"The Waterworks\\" is a fictional portrait of the novelist's favorite locale, Manhattan, this time in the early 1870s. Limbless Civil War veterans beg for coins, poor children press wilted flowers in the hands of passersby, and on streets filled with broughams and drays, an omnibus carries a stiff-looking seated man recognized by a brooding freelance writer as his supposedly dead father.<br /><br />I almost wanted to write this review in the spirit of the great Count Floyd from \\"SCTV,\\" who always had to introduce these stinker horror films by pretending they were frightening beyond belief. \\"How about that scene where he sees his father with all the other zombies in that carriage? Wasn't that scary, kids? Or the part when the mad doctor is there in the lab cutting open that dead body. Oohhhh. I get shivers just thinking about it, kids, don't you?\\"<br /><br />Doctorow deserves more respect. He's stepping out here, playing with a horror element in his usual realistic historical fiction. Since belief in the supernatural is not a Doctorow hallmark, he has to find some alternate means of creating that same kind of mood, and so presents us with a man, one Dr. Sartorius, who believes science affords all the answers to life's mysteries, a belief he pursues with amoral gusto.<br /><br />\\"Philosophy poses the right questions,\\" he explains. \\"But it lacks the requisite diction for the answers. Only Science can find the diction for the answers.\\"<br /><br />I especially like that last passage because there are no ellipses in it. There are a lot of these ...-style punctuations running through the narrative, I think as a nod to the period's newspaper style (the narrator is an editor) as well as Walt Whitman, New York City's great bard of the time. But it is repeated well past the point of tolerance.<br /><br />More fatal is a story that never really gels. A good set-up is presented, the writer seeing his father on the omnibus and then disappearing himself, but the narrator seems to treat the mystery's unraveling with obscure detachment, something a policeman friend of his takes on and leaves him out of while he ponders what it all means from the sidelines. Most damagingly, Dr. Sartorius and his great scheme, when we finally come face-to-face with both, are disappointing and half-baked.<br /><br />More interesting to Doctorow is the metaphysical significance of the story, the delineation of the epistemological limits of a time when Darwin had just come on the scene and conventional religion was scurrying to retrench. It's interesting the son and the father both have the same last name as the protagonist of Doctorow's later, more religion-focused \\"City of God,\\" set in New York in the present day. But the religious and philosophical ideas presented here carry no weight, because Dr. Sartorius, the modern man of science who seeks to replace both, is confusingly presented.<br /><br />It's also a dry, largely humorless book, odd given how vigorously and enjoyably Doctorow presented history in \\"Billy Bathgate\\" and \\"Ragtime,\\" two books everyone should try to read once. Doctorow's abilities are enough to generate some interest with every new chapter, but \\"The Waterworks\\" lacks the kind of passion and engagement one expects from this brilliant creator.<br /><br />I would have liked this book had Doctorow let himself go more, created a more purposely spinechilling account that laid off the Henry James in favor of the more ghoulish Poe. Instead we get a very draggy book, relieved only occasionally by Doctorow's eye for detail. But had he made \\"The Waterworks\\" more of a departure from straight history, even worked in the kind of \\"Creature Feature\\" vibe Count Floyd would have liked, this could well have been a much better book.ling with obscure detachment, something a policeman friend of his takes on and leaves him out of while he ponders what it all means from the sidelines.

US	50230169	RF4MDIJ1BFDIZ	0553234919	399868099	Red Duster, White Ensign	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Miracle At Malta	From 1940-1942, Malta was the burr under Hitler's saddle, the frail island fortress that managed to frustrate Axis plans for sweeping British forces out of Africa. Until the decisive British victory at El Alamein, it was a near-run thing, and just how near-run is the subject of this engaging, inspiring book.<br /><br />First published in 1959 and re-released in the U.S. in 1983 as a Bantam War Book, \\"Red Duster, White Ensign,\\" as its title suggests, pays tribute primarily to the British merchant marine and Royal Navy sailors who, against incredible odds, kept the island just supplied enough to fend off starvation as well as German and Italian attack.<br /><br />Ian Cameron's book is a product of its time in a way, very stiff-upper-lip and relying heavily on official reports rather than interviews with witnesses. But because the story of Malta is so fascinating in its bare facts, this works to create a tense yarn of constant adventure, as we follow the laborious progress of convoy after convoy, some suffering worse fates than others, all desperately needed by an island on starvation rations and contemplating surrender.<br /><br />Sometimes the story is almost too incredible to believe, as when the island's entire air force, just three outdated biplanes, manages to frustrate and injure the pride of Italy's Regia Aeronautica. The Maltese, heartened by this turn, call the planes \\"Faith,\\" \\"Hope,\\" and \\"Charity,\\" and long after they are finally taken out by the Luftwaffe, their spirit imbues Maltese resistance and courage in the face of attack.<br /><br />It was some attack, too. During one 14-day period, Cameron writes, \\"the island spent 168 hours under attack from the air; she endured 2,159 individual raids, and in Grand Harbour, 18 ships were sunk and 27 damaged.\\" In terms of concentrated air attack, the pure tonnage of bombs dropped around Grand Harbour during another, earlier period exceeded any similar-sized area in Stalingrad or Coventry.<br /><br />Cameron doesn't linger over much of anything. He zooms in on particular ships as they tread the dangerous straits between Alexandria and Malta, telling of their perseverance. Sometimes, like the island they are supplying, the ships endure incredible damage but manage to limp into Grand Harbour with their vital cargoes. Other times, they come agonizingly close, only to fail.<br /><br />In the end, of course, they accomplished their mission, and the West was saved. Of all the important theaters of World War II, perhaps only Burma is as forgotten as Malta, but the story of Malta's victory is one worth anyone's time, and Cameron tells the story in gripping and accessible fashion.

US	50230169	R3GMIHQR1BWRHD	0684801469	11530247	A Farewell To Arms	Books	4	1	5	N	N	Love Is A Battlefield	Is \\"A Farewell To Arms\\" an anti-war novel? I say no.<br /><br />Like others note, there's not a lot of actual violence here. The protagonist, Lt. Henry, is nearly killed while eating cheese, and has to spend much time in a hospital where his convalescence is something akin to Club Med. He doesn't have to be in this war, as he is an American and his country at this point in World War I (early 1917) is still neutral. When one doctor tells him his knee requires time to heal before it can be operated on, Henry says no, do it now. He wants to go back to the front.<br /><br />Later, his mind changes, when the Italian Army finds itself in headlong retreat and the bloody \\"Battle Police\\" start shooting officers. Yes, bad things happen to him, and his lover Catherine, by book's end, and Henry's powerful narration offers sentiments like this: \\"I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory, and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done to the meat except to bury it.\\"<br /><br />But the worst thing that happens in this book happens not in war-torn northern Italy but peaceful Switzerland. My sense is that Hemingway thought of war as another one of those things men do, no more a cause for censure than driving without a safety belt. He didn't glorify it, but he doesn't seem to bemoan it, either. It's an adventure like any other, with its necessary share of perils.<br /><br />I think the power of this book comes not from its depiction of war but of life and love. The war zone where Lt. Henry and Catherine plight their troth is a metaphor for life lived under any circumstance of pressure. Love is the great killer, not war, because it gives people real value and thus elicits real sorrow from their demise. When Henry has his final epiphany, and talks about how \\"they killed you in the end,\\" he's talking about the unseen masters of human fate, for whom saving or not saving souls in peril is akin to watching ants burning on a log.<br /><br />Hemingway's religious views here are most interesting; he's quite nearly an atheist here, but not exactly. His protagonist seems unwilling to entirely let go, seeking the counsel of a priest and telling an old man he will pray for him. Of course, he's also boozing it up, living in sin, and pretty dismissive of religious values as a whole, but it's not a dead issue, and his discussions on the subject are engagingly bipartisan.<br /><br />There's greatness throughout this book. The opening, where Lt. Henry wiles away the winter lull in combat with his agreeably eccentric companion Rinaldi, pulls you in with its swift, alkaline portrait of camions and kings rolling across muddy roads to the front. The ending is great, too, and I very much like Henry's stay in the hospital; Hemingway at his most romantic, comic, and even hopeful.<br /><br />People have problems with Catherine being Henry's boy toy, and it's true she becomes more docile as the story goes on. But its because she represents an ideal, a hope for human happiness based on a real-life nurse whom Hemingway had a brief, unsatisfying, but haunting encounter with. She's utter male fantasy; even when she tells Henry to \\"shut up,\\" he notes she says it \\"as though you didn't want to offend anyone.\\" (She agrees.) But she is the means by which the book creates real human involvement.<br /><br />Alas, not complete involvement. I know Hemingway's a great writer, better than I'll ever be (and I'm trying), but he leaves me cold at times in this book, as he samples the various wines and discourses at length about various things in that clean, terse way that excites admiration but repulses identification. There are pages and pages devoted to things like horse races and cafe idylls that just go nowhere, and my tired eyes scan over the tight sentences like so much gravel in a stream bed.<br /><br />Another reviewer here says \\"A Farewell To Arms\\" is a novel with great moments, but isn't great. I agree. It's tremendously readable, and parts of it are worth memorizing, but overall, the effect is less for me than \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" \\"The Old Man And The Sea,\\" and Papa's many great short stories. It's a solid book worth reading, but not his greatest work.y readable, and parts of it are worth memorizing, but overall, the effect is less for me than \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" \\"The Old Man And The Sea,\\" and Papa's many great short stories.

US	50230169	R80DSS1KFVSTW	B00005WK6O	541136724	The palace guard	Books	4	6	6	N	N	So Much For German Efficiency...	Days before his death, Lyndon Johnson entertained a group of old political acquaintances by telling them of a recent visit to the White House, now occupied by his successor Richard Nixon. Johnson marveled that while his old phone allowed him to talk to anyone in government he wished to chew out at the moment, Nixon's hotline had only three buttons.<br /><br />\\"Just three buttons,\\" reads the quote in \\"The Palace Guard.\\" \\"And they all go to Germans!\\"<br /><br />As Dan Rather and Gary Paul Gates go on to explain, Nixon would have benefited from disconnecting two of the lines, the ones that reached chief of staff H.R. \\"Bob\\" Haldeman and domestic affairs advisor John Ehrlichman. Together the two men effectively blocked all access to the President during most of his time in office, with only one exception, that being chief White House diplomat Henry Kissinger (German #3). By insulating Nixon so, they not only shielded him from a broader range of ideas, but instilled an institutional paranoia that abetted the blockheaded Watergate fiasco that brought them all down.<br /><br />It's tempting to read \\"The Palace Guard\\" with an eye on co-author Rather, especially as he departs his own place of prominence this week over a scandal given the name \\"Memogate.\\" Rather's knee-jerk liberalism is on display for sure, as when the book criticizes Nixon's opposition to forced busing as a blatant sop to racists while crediting him only for initiatives that revealed non-conservative thinking, like welfare expansion and reaching out to communist China. But \\"The Palace Guard\\" is not written in a mean-spirited way. In fact, it's quite entertaining for the snarky but sensitive way it presents its characters.<br /><br />It's not only Haldeman and Ehrlichman who get the spotlight. Much time is spent on people like Wally Hinkel, the secretary of the interior who goes Green on Nixon and is frozen out after balking over Kent State. Arthur Burns, an early cabinet leader, is dubbed \\"Super Bore,\\" which the book notes \\"was no small achievement when you stop and consider the place was something less than a haven for gifted raconteurs.\\"<br /><br />One exception to that rule, the effulgent future Democratic senator and urban affairs advisor Daniel Patrick Moynihan, mentors Nixon for a time on taking a more liberal policy course, thus earning Rather and Gates' approval, until he is undone by some memos leaked to the public, probably by Haldeman, that gets Moynihan in trouble with blacks and academics and undercuts his authority. That and, suggest the authors, there was less need for Nixon to protect himself by tacking left after his most likely opponent in the 1972 election drove himself off a bridge in Chappaquiddick.<br /><br />The book's drawbacks include a lack of direct quotations (surprising given the fact one of the authors was CBS's White House reporter at the time) and a divided sense of what its supposed to be about, the various cabinet officers Nixon drew around him at various times or the way two of these officers (Haldeman and Ehrlichman) paralyzed the process by denying access to Nixon for anyone else but themselves.<br /><br />Still, it's an entertaining book whatever it's about, very much of the moment and somewhat dated (words like \\"Negro\\" pop up from time to time) but worth having for Nixon lovers. Rather enthusiasts will miss the Texasisms of their hero's later career, but he and Gates put together a solid addition to the record on one of our most interesting, if not exemplary, presidents.hievement when you stop and consider the place was something less than a haven for gifted raconteurs.\\"    One exception to that rule, the effulgent future Democratic senator and urban affairs advisor Daniel Patrick Moynihan, mentors Nixon for a time on taking a more liberal policy course, thus earning Rather and Gates' approval, until he is undone by some memos leaked to the public, probably by Haldeman, that gets Moynihan in trouble with blacks and academics and undercuts his authority.

US	50230169	RDDG12RTJ7X83	0553572423	328007521	The Fist of God	Books	3	9	10	N	N	Lesser Forsyth, But Still Forsyth	\\"The Fist Of God\\" is one of the most exciting white papers I've ever read, wrapped around the spine of a pretty routine thriller.<br /><br />It's the last days before the first Gulf War, and Iraq's Saddam Hussein seems to be courting disaster by refusing to back down from his occupation of Kuwait. Is he just nuts, or does he have a plan? SAS officer Mike Martin is sent behind enemy lines to figure it out.<br /><br />Starting out with one of the great opening lines in thriller writing (\\"The man with ten minutes to live was laughing\\"), \\"Fist Of God\\" covers a lot of ground in its nearly 600 pages, from an arms scientist trying to help Iraq enter the nuclear age to Kuwaiti resistance battles to the inner councils of the Coalition High Command and Saddam's all-Tikriti amen club.<br /><br />Forsyth discourses knowledgeably about the problem of Iraq, noting the factionalism among Shiite, Sunni, and Kurd; visiting Abu Ghraib prison; and analyzing how Saddam counted on Arab disunity and U.N. dithering to bail him out. He gives us an engaging tour of everything from Swiss banks (a favorite Forsyth topic) to Mossad spycraft to atomic bomb development.<br /><br />Forsyth makes for impressive company; he seems to have pored over every map and read every history book in existence, and is willing to discourse with dry detachment about what he has learned. I just wish he'd channel his inner Alistair MacLean more and rediscover his leaner, yarnspinning self. What action is here is papered over with acres of explanatory commentary, and the characters, namely the shadowy Martin, are one-dimensional bores. Even when tension mounts, it's hard to care when you don't really know the people you are rooting for.<br /><br />We all know that the central threat of the book, Saddam attacking Coalition troops with nuclear arms, never came to pass. Forsyth works the narrative briskly enough over that inconvenient if fortunate fact, by focusing on the real-life plots and counterplots that went on and spinning some interesting alternative ideas for how the whole thing might have gone down.<br /><br />Martin starts off in Kuwait, then goes into Baghdad, his boyhood home. Forsyth has Tom Clancy's way with technology, but one wishes he did more with the backdrop of the war. Martin's leading a group of Kuwaiti children into battle is too pat and swiftly handled, and his travels through Baghdad amid air raids lack tension.<br /><br />Like Alistair MacLean in \\"Guns Of Navarone,\\" Martin eventually leads an SAS team to find Saddam's big weapon, but its no big thrill when his main action involves pointing an invisible laser at a hill. When the team runs into Iraqis, the foe is swiftly dispatched, a tribute to SAS fortitude but dull writing.<br /><br />There's other parts of this overlong book that could be trimmed or chopped outright, like a Mossad operation to discover the identity of an Iraqi mole that never really factors into the rest of the story and just left me confused and feeling sorry for a poor Swiss secretary.<br /><br />I don't know, though, it's still Forsyth, and very interesting reading. His way with the pen is still remarkable, as is his store of knowledge. \\"A mercenary in the intelligence world is like a whore. No tiresome candle-lit dinners and sweet nothings are necessary. A fistful of dollars on the dressing table will do nicely.\\"<br /><br />Forsyth's better than most thriller writers; he's not just in it for the money.

US	50230169	R2I7LWE6OIPQ3L	0312523696	795712434	McCartney/the Definitive Biography	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Child Is The Father Of The Beatle	After his mother dies of cancer, preteen Paul McCartney puts on a seemingly untroubled face while channeling his woe into a fierce determination to succeed, not to mention an artistic sense of melancholia that will help get him there. Thus Chris Salewicz makes a compelling argument for what drove McCartney to help found the world's greatest pop music band.<br /><br />A fairly skimpy bio by today's standards, \\"McCartney\\" deserves credit for raising the bar for Beatle historians back in 1986. When Philip Norman published \\"Shout\\" some years before, he credited the recently-murdered John Lennon with 90 percent of the Beatles' enduring legacy, a tack taken by many others. Salewicz makes the point that Lennon was duffing around with some chums, unaware of how to even tune a guitar, until the more disciplined McCartney appeared one day at a garden fete where Lennon's band, the Quarrymen, were playing.<br /><br />\\"Their relationship was not so one-sided: as much as John was inspired to progress by Paul's unswerving diligence, so the younger boy was equally liberated by John's anarchic direction,\\" he writes.<br /><br />Salewicz painstakingly details McCartney's boyhood days in Liverpool, paying special attention to his schooling and teachers and the academic promise he showed before devoting himself to rock 'n' roll. There's some nice comments Salewicz brings in from interviewing everyone from his classmates to his German teacher to his next-door neighbor who recalls the misery-inducing racket of John, Paul, and their little friend George Harrison working out the rudiments of what would become a cultural revolution. \\"It was a terrific row to our ears - absolutely horrible,\\" he says.<br /><br />Salewicz's research even finds some interesting, eerie facts: for example, the first piano in Paul's father's life came from NEMS furniture store, the same company Brian Epstein later ran when he discovered the Beatles.<br /><br />But this is really half a book, which comes apart after the Beatles make it big. Too many key sources (like Paul and the other surviving Beatles) were unavailable to Salewicz, and the result is an obvious clip job that dampens what could have been a very strong account of McCartney's life. Salewicz's failure to give context, explaining who he interviewed and what he picked up from other sources, leaves a loosely-stranded narrative where trivial bits are thrown up in the way of substance while large segments of McCartney's life fly past undigested.<br /><br />By the time Salewicz gets to McCartney's post-Beatles period, he is left making some tired criticisms of Wings' lack of artistic validity and quoting Nick Lowe about Paul's ability to travel long distances without requiring a bathroom break. There's a whole rich tale left unexplored.<br /><br />I wish McCartney had given Salewicz some time. The writer is fair and quite good at synthesizing McCartney's earliest days into readable form. But the paucity of primary sources costs this book deeply near the end. Really, if you read this book up to Salewicz's account of the writing of \\"Yesterday\\" (which he notes authoritatively has its genesis in his mother's passing) and then put it down, you are missing very little unless you are the most ardent of Paul fans.ources (like Paul and the other surviving Beatles) were unavailable to Salewicz, and the result is an obvious clip job that dampens what could have been a very strong account of McCartney's life.

US	50230169	R1UFVN3FKAYTEG	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Simply Horrorshow	Great books seldom make for great films, but when they do, it's usually the movie people remember better. Films reach more people, requiring less investment of their time. Plus, when they are made as well and as excitingly as was Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of this Anthony Burgess novel, it's hard not to think of the movie first.<br /><br />Both feature a young man named Alex who, in what was a vaguely futuristic society for the time, rides around with his friends committing various felonies. Alex lords it over his friends as well, a bit too much. Then he finds himself with one victim too many, and in the hands of the police. His only chance for freedom: Submit to a controversial mind-altering technique that will make him incapable of violence.<br /><br />There are two reasons the book remains vital above the movie. The first, more surface reason, has to do with Nadsat, the unique argot Burgess developed for the youthful protagonist, Alex, and his friends. For example, while contemplating robbing helpless victims, Alex narrates thusly: \\"Our pockets were full of deng, so there was no need...of crasting any more pretty polly to tolchock some old veck in an alley and viddy him swim in his own blood...\\"<br /><br />You can find a Nadsat glossary online if your edition doesn't have one, but the remarkable thing is how well you pick up on the words' meaning after a few pages without looking up definitions. The movie keeps some of the Nadsat but it doesn't have the same place it has in the book, which is too bad since the language makes a point about the corruption of the culture Alex inhabits.<br /><br />The second thing about the book that places it over the movie is explaining what the title is all about. The phrase \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" recurs through the novel, while never appearing in the movie. \\"A fair gloopy title,\\" Alex calls it, when he first spies it on a manuscript of an author he is in the process of terrorizing.<br /><br />As Alex goes on to read, the author describes \\"a clockwork orange\\" as the artificial imposition on man of \\"laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation.\\" This has a ring of irony when Alex himself submits to the technique. It's not that the movie doesn't carry the concept of the clockwork orange, just that it doesn't connect the dots or make the point as effectively.<br /><br />A third reason to choose the book over the movie is the missing 21st chapter, which is found in later editions of the book but not all, and did not appear in the movie. It's kind of a mixed blessing, since the missing chapter wouldn't have gone so well in the movie (hard to imagine the wonderfully malevolent Malcolm McDowell suddenly having a sensitive moment) but does give the reader something positive to take away from an what otherwise might feel depressing upon reflection, the idea that man has two choices, to be controlled artificially or left to their evil desires.<br /><br />But \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is not depressing to read through. It's actually thrilling, mind-warping, and more than a bit funny. You will find yourself liking Alex despite yourself, and adapting to his worldview with surprising ease. That's because Burgess does such a good job of representing the devil inside all of us, why we listen to it, and even, most daringly, why it's better to have one than not.ificial imposition on man of \\"laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation.\\" This has a ring of irony when Alex himself submits to the technique.

This was a book taken so directly from life that it became a parlor game figuring out who was who. Sure, Jack Stanton was really our then-president, and his wife Susan was Hillary Clinton, but who was that crazy Libby woman supposed to be? Or the shadowy narrator, Henry Burton?<br /><br />The buzz gave \\"Primary Colors\\" most of its popularity, but one wonders just how interested people are in the book now that Bill Clinton is retired. Probably not much, which is a shame, because \\"Primary Colors\\" deserves better than being a '90s time capsule.<br /><br />If you haven't read \\"Primary Colors,\\" one thing you need to know about it is it's not a note-by-note recitation of the Clinton road to power. It takes some similar turns, and some prescient ones (Monica was not news when this came out in 1996), and in general Jack and Susan Stanton are recognizably Clintonesque, but there are some liberties taken that make the real First Couple seem like the saintly Carters by comparison. The plot takes some jaw-dropping turns, in a sort of shameless \\"Desperate Housewives\\"-way that makes for fun reading.<br /><br />The other salient thing about the book is that it is a clever satire not of one specific administration but the whole way politics is done in our time, the way passion and practicality come together and threaten to do each other harm. One campaign leader cautions our narrator about getting TB, True Believerism, and \\"Primary Colors\\" sells its weary cynicism with sharp humor and pungent observation.<br /><br />It has the feeling of reality, too. Klein has followed a lot of political campaigns, and invests his narrative with a sense of how things really play out when the candidates aren't in front of the cameras. One staff worker is unhorsed not by anything she says but what she doesn't say, a slight but noticeable pause when talking about another candidate's giving blood that reveals her knowledge about - and discomfort in - the candidate she's working for.<br /><br />The novel isn't perfect. The main romance isn't really well-defined, there's too much Libby and not enough Richard Jemmons, the crazy cracker Carville stand-in. Klein throws a lot of balls in the air, and doesn't catch all of them, but I think the variety of ideas and atmospheres you get in the space of 500 pages has a lot to do with its readability, and the satisfying sense you have when you are done.<br /><br />\\"Primary Colors\\" reminds me a lot of Tom Wolfe, vibrant, flashy, but well-thought out all the time. Waggish, too; Klein even uses \\"mau-mau\\" as a verb. Most important, it's entertainment at its highest level, and something worth remembering long after the rest of the circus has passed us by.m with sharp humor and pungent observation. <br /> <br />It has the feeling of reality, too.

The bad kind is when you eavesdrop on political opponents and violate laws and ethical codes. The good kind, as we discover in the opening pages of this classic of journalism as it happens, is when you are a reporter assigned a court case, and don't take no for an answer.<br /><br />Bob Woodward is talking to a well-dressed lawyer who mysteriously popped into the courtroom to handle the defense of five equally well-dressed burglary suspects, caught the previous night at National Democratic Headquarters in the posh Watergate complex.<br /><br />Why are you here? Woodward asks.<br /><br />\\"I'm not going to talk to you.\\" \\"I have nothing to say.\\"<br /><br />But the lawyer talks, a little, just enough to give Woodward some footing on what would turn out to be perhaps the biggest journalistic break in history, one that ruined a presidency and echoes to this day. Any national political scandal is almost automatically accorded the suffix \\"-gate,\\" in memory of this.<br /><br />People who think they know the story from seeing the movie really should read the book. The movie condensed a lot of the story, almost to the point of rendering it nonsensical. Watergate as a story really comes together from reading the book.<br /><br />It's less the story of presidential misdeeds and more of how a couple of mismatched journalists stumbled their way to the scoop of the century, with hard work, stubborn persistance, and occasionally breaking the rules. People who criticize Woodward and partner Carl Bernstein for telling a self-serving story really haven't read the book. Like the part when, stalled for a new story after Nixon's overwhelming re-election, they start knocking on the doors of Grand Jury members legally precluded from discussing the Watergate case. Nothing is learned, and after the jurors complain to Judge John Sirica, the two brace themselves for a stern public lecture, maybe even formal charges.<br /><br />But Sirica only notes the violations and leaves the reporters nameless. Woodward and Bernstein find themselves confronted by other members of the press asking questions. Woodward and Bernstein duck the questions, not without lingering irony. \\"They had dodged, misrepresented, suggested, and intimidated, even if they had not lied outright,\\" the authors conclude, speaking of themselves in the third person.<br /><br />Mostly, though, Woodward and Bernstein get it right. June 17, 1972 was not the most important date in history, though some Nixon haters will say otherwise. The burglary itself was small potatoes, indicative of a larger problem with illegalities permitted by Nixon and his senior staff, but it wasn't like Woodward and Bernstein destroyed the Fourth Reich.<br /><br />They latched onto a story, kept digging, wouldn't take no for an answer, and made sure they had the facts. In the end they won a Pulitzer, and became heroes of the Fourth Estate. This book, warts and all, tells how, and offers worthy testimonial to all those who want to follow in their footsteps.

Of course, within those broad categories are individuals with complications and insecurities their smooth exteriors often hid. Kids work very hard at protecting their inner selves from scrutiny. Fortunately the older versions of these kids are all-too-happy to share the details of their class insecurity, sexual desires, and what they thought of each other.<br /><br />\\"I just remember her being sort of a snob, and I could never quite trust her,\\" one female class member says of another. \\"She would be my friend one day, and the next day everything would change...\\"<br /><br />\\"He was totally sarcastic,\\" goes a recollection of another class member. \\"I enjoyed his sense of humor, but a lot of people didn't. I know this because people used to ask me how I could stand to go around with him.\\"<br /><br />You can recognize such characters from your own high school years. I know I can.<br /><br />I wish the authors did more with the \\"when they were young\\" element of the story. There's some recountings of favorite music and when President Kennedy was shot, but not enough. The focus, after various classmates give their snapshot portraits of each subject in turn, is often on what these kids grew into. The quarterback is now a New Age minister. The flirt is now a lesbian. The outcast now lives in Micronesia. Several have been arrested for drugs.<br /><br />It's here where the story becomes more specific to its time, the freewheeling 1960s and 1970s, and you get that sense of things coming apart unique to that era. There's still poignance in the stories, though, especially two. One, the school dreamboat, pursues an acting career with diminishing success and commits suicide. Another, the aloof dreamer, joins a series of movements and finally becomes a John Bircher, renouncing sex, movies, and society in general as he lives in his own dreamworld. \\"Ten years from today I expect to have written at least ten books which are far superior to anything a college or high school student sees in his literature courses,\\" he tells the authors.<br /><br />I haven't done a search of the name \\"Jamie Kelso\\" on this website, but I sense that I won't find much if I do.

Though the book was a bestseller in its day, and even was the basis for a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch, there hasn't been a true followup, which is not surprising.

US	50230169	R1ZOICOF1QKDO7	0140060898	329849771	The Mosquito Coast (Penguin Essentials)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	There's No Place Like Home...	Allie Fox is a struggling Yankee inventor disgusted with the rampant materialism and money-grubbing he finds in the United States. Convinced the country is going to pot, he burns his last bridge and takes his family to Honduras and its Mosquito Coast, to get away from a culture that hoards goods and sells cheese in spray cans.<br /><br />It's hard not to feel some empathy with Fox, especially the way he is described by the book's narrator, his preteen son Charlie. But author Paul Theroux has some surprises in store for those expecting a 20th-century Swiss Family Robinson idyll in the Third World.<br /><br />Theroux does two things in this book I really like. One is the way he writes about the land of the Mosquito Coast, with lush descriptions of rainforests where pacas and tapirs burrow for grubs and an eerie cave-like silence is broken by the bull-fiddle bellow of a curassow. Or the way he describes the river camp Fox and his family set up, \\"a twisted blue vein in the muscle of the jungle.\\" Theroux's acclaimed for writing like this, and you might find yourself reaching for the bug spray between chapters.<br /><br />The other is the character of Allie, who Theroux makes clear from the outset is all-too-human, and not a little screwy. Even before making landfall in Honduras, Allie browbeats young Charlie into climbing to the top of a ship's mast and dangling himself from an overhanging shroud. \\"Seasickness is just a misunderstanding of the inner ear,\\" Allie yells at the frightened boy, at once mocking and misrepresenting the real danger he has put the child in.<br /><br />Allie is a great inventor, and Theroux imaginatively portrays how Yankee ingenuity might make some headway in the wilds of central America. But he is at heart selfish and insecure, about himself and his place as head of a family he can't provide for. \\"If there was one thing Father did not know, it was this: he did not need to prove himself to us,\\" Charlie tells the reader.<br /><br />Yet Allie keeps pushing a fragile situation onto more dangerous ground. With every success he smells complacency, materialistic grasping, and the dangerous influence of Christian missionaries, whose gospel of external reliance he abhors. Or maybe he just minds the competition. After he makes ice in the jungle, an impressive feat of limited practicality, Allie talks about being a kind of God, only one that finishes what he starts.<br /><br />\\"The Mosquito Coast\\" was published in 1982, and I sense Theroux was more than slightly influenced by the then-recent horror of a cult leader named Jim Jones who led his followers to Guyana, not far from Honduras, and eventually induced a mass suicide. Not that Fox is much like Jones externally, but there are echoes of the Jonestown tragedy in this book, and they become more pronounced as the narrative develops.<br /><br />The negative thing about \\"Mosquito Coast,\\" and it's significant, is it's not an easy book to read. It's well-written, but all Allie, all the time. Some reviewers here note Allie's wife doesn't get much of a description, not even a name, but I had more trouble accepting the lack of detail with Charlie's siblings. There are three of them, but you don't really know who's who and what they are about. One is actually something of a rebel to Allie's command, but this isn't adequately developed until the final third of the book.<br /><br />Even when they go off with some other children to a special place away from Allie called \\"the Acre,\\" there is little detail given about Charlie's relationships with these children. The reader is instead forcefed Charlie's feelings about Allie, even when Allie isn't around. I found the story limited on this basis. Surely Theroux could have chopped a few lines from Allie's rants, which are repetitive anyway, and given Charlie's separate world more room to breathe.<br /><br />But \\"The Mosquito Coast\\" keeps you interested more often than not, is an excellent showcase for Theroux's mastery of his craft,and leaves you with some pretty thick meat to chew on, specifically about when people need to light out and explore the world around them and when they are better off staying home.ut when people need to light out and explore the world around them and when they are better off staying home.	2005-02-02

To everything there is a season, and Clark had to have magnificent tunnel vision in the late '90s not to see the leaves turning on the dot-com economic revolution he helped create and profited from.<br /><br />Author Michael Lewis is a little more on the ball in this prescient, engaging account of Clark's doings almost right up until the moment the music stopped. Not that Lewis was so blatant about predicting the bubble's bursting: He enjoyed rather exclusive access to Lewis and probably didn't feel like he could hang his subject out to dry. But the hints are there, and it makes for a juicy narrative.<br /><br />Lewis is a practitioner of what I call \\"Rolling Stone\\" journalism, a ramped-up offshoot of New Journalism where the emphasis is on pizzazz and flashy one-liner endings. The thing is he's really, really good at it. He makes some funny, sage observations that aren't the least bit disposable, however flip the delivery.<br /><br />\\"The 'business model' of most Internet companies was to attract huge crowds of people to a Web site, and then sell others the chance to advertise products to the crowds,\\" he writes. \\"It was still not clear that the model made sense.\\"<br /><br />Lewis focuses not on Clark's business or technical dealings but his nautical adventures as captain of the world's largest sloop, with which he plans to sail the Atlantic completely under the control of a computer, barring any major foul-up or else Clark getting bored along the way, both of which are highly possible.<br /><br />As Lewis tells the tale, Clark is both one of the world's most dynamic tycoons and one of its most conspicuous ADD poster children. He has some clever ideas, but leaves the detail work to his followers and is too quickly off to the next new thing: \\"A plan was merely a theory of how he might spend his day; at all times it clashed in his mind with half a dozen other theories.\\"<br /><br />I don't read toadying in lines like that; I read a healthy level of friendly, persistent skepticism that becomes Lewis and behooves his subject. It's not that Jim Clark was some kind of space-age snake-oil salesman. He believed in what he was doing. He just couldn't stay interested long enough to save the situation when it started going south.<br /><br />The sloop story does take up too much of Lewis's narrative, and Lewis does seem to short-shrift the technical end of things, probably because he knows it will slow down his sprightly narrative. The biggest problem in this book is the absence of Clark from the center: Apparently he let Lewis hang around but didn't pause to answer many questions, though if the failure of his health-care venture is any indication it wasn't like he had anything better to do.<br /><br />This book is no \\"Moneyball,\\" Lewis's book on building the Oakland A's franchise which is the best available narrative on baseball today. It's better then his overrated \\"Liars' Poker,\\" though, and makes for an engrossing if shallow immersion in a world that was quickly coming to an end. This isn't the most historically significant voyage ever taken by a Lewis and a Clark, but it makes for an interesting ride.n his mind with half a dozen other theories.\\" <br /> <br />I don't read toadying in lines like that; I read a healthy level of friendly, persistent skepticism that becomes Lewis and behooves his subject.

Then we ate a toad and a snake and a beetle and after that I was a blood-brother.\\"<br /><br />Not exactly enticing, but compared to the culture Tony has thus far been immersed in, London between the wars, it sounds too lovely to pass up. \\"A Handful Of Dust\\" is as dark a critique of civilized mores as one can imagine, and though it comes off at times as far-fetched, the view of life is even more disturbing, and blackly humorous, for being true.<br /><br />A rural nobleman who only wants to live in his Gothic manor with his family, Tony finds himself the victim of his wife Brenda's sudden bout of unfaithfulness. She sets off, rather inexplicably, with a Mommy-coddled cheapskate named Beaver. For her, it's something to do. For her cosmopolitan circle, it's a cause not for concern but merry gossip. \\"You know, you're causing a great deal of trouble,\\" her sister Marjorie confides. \\"You've taken London's only spare man.\\"<br /><br />If cruel social satire is your cup of tea, you won't go wrong with \\"A Handful Of Dust.\\" Waugh is not working from the heart here, but from the spleen, but once you allow for the fact caring is out the window for the reader and the cast, what you get is a pretty thorough and, in its upside-down way, satisfying exposition on the petty viciousness of cheating hearts. If you've ever come across a real heartbreaker in life, and who hasn't, this book offers a perverse form of solace.<br /><br />While Brenda's heartlessness is milked in depth, it's really the enabling connivance of her kinfolk and friends that Waugh sends up so masterfully. It's what makes his novel a treat. Tony, we understand, is a stick and a bore, but he not only cares for his wife but trusts her blindly, which makes her adultery and her circle's abetting of it particularly cruel. No doubt to point up the amoral nature of secular London's high society, the Catholic Waugh gives us dialogue that ricochets back heavily on the speakers, as they wonder why Tony doesn't just accept his losses, sell his manor to satisfy Brenda's exorbitant alimony demands, and not be such a bore about it.<br /><br />The drawback in this book, as other reviewers here note, is in the ending, not because it is sour but so out of left field. Even though there's a nice juxtaposition of the Amazon and London, Tony's strange expedition, and its resolution, don't add to the proceedings so much as push them in another direction that seems to add Waugh himself to Last's already-thick stable of tormentors. It's not a bad ending, but it doesn't maintain the drama or the subtlety of what passed before.<br /><br />But there's plenty to enjoy here, like the dialogue, the odd mix of characters, and sublime moments of balmy nonsense, like the vicar who recycles ill-fitting sermons from a long-ago India sojourn. Waugh writes about Tony's manor with a zest that makes architecture seem witty, while even the harshest moments have a cold, brave beauty about them.

The police smell whisky and think he was joyriding, but at least one colleague at Daniel Kearny Associates (DKA) isn't buying and sets out to figure out what really happened, with a 72-hour time limit imposed by his apparently-unsympathetic boss.<br /><br />This is the first book in Joe Gores' DKA series, and the second I've read after \\"32 Cadillacs,\\" which others rave about being the cream of the series but which left me a bit flat. This one, however, is really good, and I found myself warming to it despite a slow start and my low expectations.<br /><br />The feeling of the book is dog-eared and desperate. After a few pages of setting the scene, an already-tired Larry Ballard sets about trying to unravel the mystery of who clocked his partner by checking up every one of the last few cases on his partner's file. This is when the story begins to take off, not so much in terms of plot (it takes a while for Ballard to narrow down the list, and longer still to figure out why the final suspect might have done it) but in terms of giving the reader a sense of what the life of a repo man is all about.<br /><br />Ballard meets up with all kinds of people, lawabiding and otherwise, like the 30-something woman who left her husband to shack up with a teenaged boy, the movers who loll around their office drunk as skunks on a weekday morning, and the rock musician who plays at a club called \\"Freaks.\\" It's set in San Francisco in the early 70s (Gores wrote the book in 1972) and you get a real sense of what the city was turning into in the decade and a half since \\"Vertigo.\\"<br /><br />I didn't mind the long time it took for Ballard to get to the bottom of things. I was enjoying the ride. Gores gives you just enough story with each person to give you a sense of life's richness and cruelties, then moves on to the next one as Ballard keeps on the clock.<br /><br />Gores is not only sharp and deft at building a multi-faceted plot, he is really funny. \\"Why do those middle-aged swingers, when they start swinging, always buy a T-Bird?\\" one guy asks Ballard. Another woman old enough to be his grandmother loses her matronly reserve when asked about a bail skipper: \\"She made a two-word comment about Griffin and his mother that was probably more ritual than fact...\\" I was still laughing at that one a dozen pages later.<br /><br />Gores's dialogue, pacing, and rich sense of character really put him in league with other great modern-day mystery writers like Elmore Leonard and Ed McBain who typically give you a lot more to chew over than a dead body. \\"Dead Skip\\" would be worthwhile reading even if it didn't lead to a series of other books.

US	50230169	R1MB9X5FVMZWFL	0689105533	26307263	The Making of the President, 1972: A Narrative History of American Politics in Action	Books	5	7	10	N	N	Anatomy Of A Blowout	As the last of four successive accounts of presidential campaigns linked by their titles and author, \\"The Making Of The President 1972\\" is a remarkable end note to a series that places writer Theodore H. White at the vanguard of his subject, the Bruce Catton of campaign historians. But was the 1972 race worthy of his eloquence?<br /><br />People generally agree that Richard Nixon's election in 1968, however understandable in the context of the times, was a misstep in American history. As president, he angered liberals, alienated moderates, embarrassed conservatives, widened the generation gap, and deepened the malaise it took 10 more years for the U.S. to recover from. If 1968's Democratic candidate, Hubert Humphrey, had won and appointed a tough Henry Kissinger-like statesman to run foreign policy, the nation would have been better off.<br /><br />It's far less popular to embrace the concept of Nixon's losing to his 1972 rival, Sen. George McGovern. In part that's because Nixon in 1972 was doing well with Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union, and it was a dangerous time to change horses. Also, McGovern was too much of a left-wing stooge.<br /><br />White makes a convincing, often entertaining case for McGovern's ineptitude in his book, like the ridiculous battles McGovernites undertook at their convention to chip away their party's own elected delegates and replace them with a higher proportion of women and minorities. Even with the specter of Watergate arising in the last days before the election, Nixon was seen as the wiser choice to liberals like White and some of Humphrey's top supporters. Not only did McGovern alienate centrists with his dogma, he was fatally unable to stick by people who stuck by him, like the running mate McGovern declared himself \\"1000 percent\\" behind just before dumping him. White even pokes holes at McGovern's \\"St. George\\" image with anecdotes of the Senator's double dealings.<br /><br />To no one's surprise, Nixon blew McGovern away that November, by 61 percent to 38 percent in the popular vote, and sweeping the electoral vote except for Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. Even McGovern's home state of South Dakota went with Nixon by eight percentage points.<br /><br />White thought it could have been a bigger blowout: \\"Had it not been for Watergate, it is quite possible that Richard Nixon's margin would have been increased by another three to four million votes,\\" adding that the state vote totals for senate races were often higher than the votes for president, suggesting some disillusionment with both candidates.<br /><br />Why is \\"Making Of The President 1972\\" still worth your time more than 30 years on? In part it's because the McGovern candidacy was an important one, with resonance in today's political scene. The Democrats are still divided between their moderates and true believers, and this was their equivalent of what the 1964 race was for the GOP, when Barry Goldwater sounded the trumpet for his party's ideologues in a way that would echo through history.<br /><br />But mainly it's because White was the great one when it came to political writing. Without hyperbole or vitriol, he manages to create a galloping narrative that always takes the high road, a feat difficult then and almost unimaginable today. He also gives some of the most concise word portraits of characters like McGovern and Nixon (who sharply corrects White at one point when the writer complements him on his office's yellow decor: \\"We call it gold.\\")<br /><br />The matter of Watergate, too, is presented effectively if incompletely (the scandal was still a year from resolution when White's book went to press.) \\"A good clipping service would have provided the Committee to Re-Elect with more information than any number of wire-taps,\\" White marvels. It's amazing not so much how Nixon broke the law (he wasn't the first or last president that way) but for the sheer lack of necessity involved.<br /><br />At one point, White espies a slogan on a wall: \\"Winning's Not Everything, It's The Only Thing.\\" Alas, as Nixon would learn, this isn't always so.one point, White espies a slogan on a wall: \\"Winning's Not Everything, It's The Only Thing.\\" Alas, as Nixon would learn, this isn't always so. <br />	2005-01-07

Naipaul turns his eye to the American South in this fascinating, multifarious examination of culture and attitudes prevalent among blacks and whites from Tallahassee to Charlestown to Nashville.<br /><br />The title is a bit misleading. \\"A Turn In The South\\" suggests a change or culture shift Naipaul is tracking, for better or worse, in the Southland. In fact, the story here can be summarized as more of the same, a region so steeped in tradition it's almost choking from it like kudzu. Naipaul is not particularly critical; in fact his book is remarkably even in tone and light in judgment. But if there's one message in this book, it's that the South remains the same, for good and ill.<br /><br />Unlike the better-known Southern guidebook \\"Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil,\\" Naipaul doesn't focus on just one city, He moves around, and you don't get a strong sense of place much of the time. People and ideas interest Naipaul more, and there are some wonderful portraits like the Forsyth County sheriff who says a racial crisis in his county is now \\"dead\\" because everyone involved got their 15 minutes in front of the camera and the black activist who promotes his civil disobedience arrest record to the point of carrying a toothbrush in his jacket pocket.<br /><br />Writer Anne Seddons notes Americans are born protesters, \\"It's what we know how to do.\\" Many talk raptly about their religious faith, which leaves the non-religious Naipaul respectfully puzzled. Naipaul makes clear that there is intelligence in the devout, and that even the more doctrinaire and conservative sects allow room for questioning and self-expression. This is something many Americans have a hard time picking up on.<br /><br />When I told a relative I read this book, he recalled it was the one with the redneck in it. That's probably what \\"Turn In The South\\" is best known for, the account Naipaul gives of a zesty conversation with a self-styled \\"neck\\" named Campbell which provides a great deal of comedy and insight as he describes the men and women who make up the South's best-known subculture (though perhaps counterculture is a better word.)<br /><br />\\"He's probably thinking, with that hair and beard, that he's God's gift to the world,\\" Campbell tells Naipaul after spying a fellow redneck in a hotel lobby. \\"But he's just a neck. He's as lost as a goose. He's never been on a tiled floor in his life.\\"<br /><br />\\"Turn In The South\\" is not always so zippy. Naipaul moves carefully, and while he's great at relating dialogue, he's not as certain about what makes Southerners tick. He often pulls back and likens the Southern experience to that of his native Caribbean, which gets repetitive after a while and adds little. He's justly famous for describing cultures in India, Africa, and Trinidad, and this feels more like an attempt to broaden his palette than say something new.<br /><br />But what's here has value and readability. Many of the characters stay with you, and since Naipaul doesn't linger on anyone for more than a few pages, often much less, there's a lot of narrative churn to keep your interest even when individual characters don't.<br /><br />\\"Turn In The South\\" is a good, solid, refreshingly humble, and non-P.C. account of what makes the South tick, how, as Naipaul puts it, it is a place of \\"optimism in the foreground, irrationality in the background,\\" and why, for all its faults, crimes, and travails, it is still a place people are proud to call home.d insight as he describes the men and women who make up the South's best-known subculture (though perhaps counterculture is a better word.)    \\"He's probably thinking, with that hair and beard, that he's God's gift to the world,\\" Campbell tells Naipaul after spying a fellow redneck in a hotel lobby. \\"But he's just a neck.

Frederick Forsyth would be a great writer even if he were writing stereo instructions. The problem is, with all the attention paid here to logistics, \\"Dogs Of War\\" doesn't feel that far removed in dryness from a Sony manual.<br /><br />Frederick Forsyth had his mojo working in the early 1970s, when he launched his fiction career with the magnificent \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" and followed up with a totally different, equally absorbing work in the same vein, \\"The Odessa File.\\" He had contracted for a third book, and evidently drawing on his experiences as a journalist covering the Biafran civil war in Nigeria, decided to write about a group of mercs hired to topple the leader of a small African nation.<br /><br />As a premise, \\"Dogs Of War\\" is very promising, and Forsyth's familiarity with the sights and smells of Africa feeds a backdrop that at times is presented quite well. A cynically world-weary tone predominates, and that works well in the context of the story. The problem is there isn't much of a plot, and a core group of main characters that, while presented as hard-bitten desperados, don't exactly give Pike, Dutch, and the rest of the Wild Bunch a run for the money in terms of characterization. One guy is called Tiny because he's large. Another strops his knife whenever there's a lull. When these characters finally face danger, we don't know them well enough to care about their fates.<br /><br />You know there's a big problem when there's only a few pages left in the book and the mercenaries haven't even hit the beach of the country they are about to take over. Forsyth takes his time getting to the central action of the story, and though he writes with his usual flair, the final showdown is perfunctory and unconvincing.<br /><br />You can see some positive developments in Forsyth's writing here, such as the emergence of humor, especially with a subplot about some scummy capitalists who set up a shell corporation for their illicit scheme with the unknowing help of a balmy Scottish widow. He works in a lot of fascinating commentary on the nature of the world though the eyes of the main protagonist, Cat Shannon.<br /><br />\\"The truth is, the Establishment is on the side of the big battalions, because it created and armed them in the first place,\\" he tells a lady friend. \\"It never seems to occur to the millions...that maybe God, if there is one, has something to do with truth, justice, and compassion rather than sheer brute force, and that truth and justice might possibly be on the side of the little platoons.\\"<br /><br />But not all the side routes Forsyth takes justify the time and attention, and there are too many ideas that either are left half-baked (a Russian interest in the African nation, a rival mercenary homicidally jealous of Shannon) or that cry plot convenience, like how Shannon gets the inside track on his employer's intentions.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Dogs Of War\\" is not so much a bad book, but a frustratingly incomplete one. It's got that classic Forsyth style for those (like me) who admire it, but it lacks a sense of purpose. It's not a surprise Forsyth took a few years off before penning his next, far better novel, \\"The Devil's Alternative.\\"shell corporation for their illicit scheme with the unknowing help of a balmy Scottish widow.

But even among lawyers, there are the elites, and the elites within the elite. Of the half-million practicing law in the early 1980s, James B. Stewart tells us, only 3,000 work in the blue-chip corporate law firms \\"which occupy the pinnacle of the profession.\\"<br /><br />These men (women for the most part came later) were set apart by their education (Ivy was good, Harvard Law better), achievement (law review editor also a plus), and sheer dedication.<br /><br />In the best of the eight essays which make up the book, we meet attorneys at the firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, who are representing IBM in an anti-trust case and happen to be Stewart's own old firm. Working through weekends and vacations is small beer to these guys, as Stewart writes: \\"When Sahid scored another triumph by billing 24 hours in a single day, Rolfe - in a move that became the subject of legend in the firm - flew to California, worked on the plane and, by virtue of the change in time zones, managed to bill 27 hours in one day.\\"<br /><br />Forget about getting home early to pick up your kids. Divorce was a common casualty, and a certain casual cruelty prevailed, unusually harsh even for the American workplace. One of the more easygoing partners at Cravath counsels an associate: \\"You tell people their work isn't good, even if it's perfect. Find something and make them redo it, or they'll give you anything.\\"<br /><br />This is hog heaven for any John Grisham enthusiast. The rest of \\"The Partners\\" isn't nearly so entertaining. But it's a very illuminating look into the world of high-pressure corporate law in all its varied facets, like public offerings, hostile takeovers, government bailouts, even estate planning. I felt I learned a lot reading each one of the essays, even if it was sometimes work keeping awake, especially as Stewart likes to show off his technical aptitude now and again.<br /><br />At times, this has the feeling of a college textbook. There's an opening chapter which features efforts by the legal community to help liberate the U.S. embassy personnel held against their will in Iran from 1979-1981, where Stewart seems to forget that the lawyers' work had nothing to do with the hostages' liberation. He also writes up the Chrysler bailout saga from a legal standpoint, then at the end sheepishly admits it was really a political issue at the end. The writing is often dry, and this book is a product of another era almost a whole generation gone by.<br /><br />But Stewart knows what he writes about, and you will feel the vigor of the law as practiced at its highest level. You may not know these cases from reading about them in the news, media reporting on business law is pretty spotty unless it's Enron. But as Stewart makes clear, in writing about what could have happened if IBM had been broken up by the government, that \\"the government antitrust case is as close as litigation ever comes to social and economic planning.\\"<br /><br />In other words, these cases may well decide more about the quality and value of the lives we live here in America than does any single presidential election. So it's nice to have a learned explainer like Stewart to put it all down for you.

The writing is often dry, and this book is a product of another era almost a whole generation gone by.    But Stewart knows what he writes about, and you will feel the vigor of the law as practiced at its highest level. You may not know these cases from reading about them in the news, media reporting on business law is pretty spotty unless it's Enron. But as Stewart makes clear, in writing about what could have happened if IBM had been broken up by the government, that \\"the government antitrust case is as close as litigation ever comes to social and economic planning.\\"    In other words, these cases may well decide more about the quality and value of the lives we live here in America than does any single presidential election. So it's nice to have a learned explainer like Stewart to put it all down for you. He has gone on to more-heralded things as a writer since this, his first book, but he was off to a fine start.	2004-11-20

While making funeral arrangements for his former living companion, a scriptwriter-turned-suicide, Barlow meets and romances a cosmetician at Whispering Glades, the in-place for dead celebs who crave some final status before they go. Using some recycled poetry from the likes of Shelley and Shakespeare (he's long since run out of gas on his own), Barlow manages to woo young Aimee Thanatogenos from under the attentions of chief Whispering Glades undertaker Mr. Joyboy. But will Joyboy play fair with his rival?<br /><br />One confusing thing people often say about \\"The Loved One\\" is that it's a Catholic satire on the materialist way people handle the subject of death. Waugh was a devout Catholic, and a satirist, but it strikes me that \\"The Loved One\\" is rather agnostic in tone, without a religious character or idea presented as buttress against the nihilist vision of the book. I don't think people are wrong to be disturbed by it that way. \\"The Loved One\\" satirizes the non-religious nature of death as memorialized at Whispering Glades, but not so much with the suggestion of an alternative as with the notion that talk of non-sectarian \\"better worlds\\" is like whistling in a vacuum and, at best, frivolous. After a few reads, my sense of \\"A Loved One\\" is that it could be a book written by a Lutheran, a Jew, or an atheist. I could be wrong, but I don't think so.<br /><br />The fact that the novel still manages to be entertaining even as it runs against the grain of Waugh's moral and spiritual beliefs is testament to the author's brilliance. It's one thing to write the Crete passage in \\"Officers And Gentlemen,\\" where the awful carnage of the battle is presented with a sense of some higher significance. When Barlow returns home one day and finds his old friend swinging from the rafters in a noose, we are told \\"his reason accepted the event as part of the established order.\\" Barlow is an artfully rendered protagonist precisely because he is so lacking in character or decency. He is a thorough clod. Readers tackling \\"The Loved One\\" for the first time are well-advised not to make the mistake of caring for any of the characters in it, especially not him.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is the opening, where we meet Barlow and his companion, the aging screenwriter-turned-hack-publicist Francis Hinsley. \\"Kierkegaard, Kafka, Connolly, Compton Burnet, Sartre, 'Scottie' Wilson. Who are they? What do they want?\\" asks Hinsley over sodas-and-whisky, taking in the literary \\"new breed\\" which was by then either dead or collecting pensions. There's a wonderful sense of comic disengagement, the idea of Hollywood as some Somerset Maugham outpost in deepest Africa, and the Tinseltown focus is something we lose as the novel goes on, which I missed.<br /><br />The rest of the book is a clever forum for Waugh's brilliant observations and off-handed commentary about a life lived in a world without standards. Aimee notes at one point: \\"Once you start changing a name, you see, there's no reason ever to stop. One always hears one that sounds better.\\"<br /><br />Or the infamous single episode where we meet Mr. Joyboy's mother, who had \\"small angry eyes, frizzy hair, pince-nez on a very thick nose, a shapeless body, and positively insulting clothes.\\" Who says adverbs ruin good writing?<br /><br />As I said, \\"The Loved One\\" is not for the fainthearted. I almost wish my edition didn't come with a Charles Addams cover illustration; it sets the wrong expectation. This is a \\"fiendishly entertaining\\" read only for those who go into it not expecting to be fiendishly entertained. It's for the dour pessimist in us all. But it's definitely one of the best novels ever written, precisely because of its unremitting focus on the things mankind naturally would turn away from if it could, and the dark amusement it finds from such exploration serves as a kind of triumph of the literary imagination we can still celebrate today.fiendishly entertained.

Hedrick Smith's \\"The Power Game\\" takes on the story of politics in Washington, D.C., circa the 1980s. Not only does he dig into every subject imaginable, like the importance of staffers, the intricacies of foreign policy work, and the behemoth of defense spending, but he takes more than 700 pages doing so.<br /><br />\\"The Power Game\\" works best as a series of anecdotes about political life, and the passions that ran riot across the national landscape at various times in the second half of the 20th century. Smith gets some tremendous candor from many of his subjects, like former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas, who tells Smith that his \\"substantive work\\" suffered most when he was most in the public spotlight. \\"I was probably a lesser senator when my numbers were going up,\\" Tsongas confesses.<br /><br />There's great anecdotes about presidential power, too. The book begins with preparations to convert a senator's rambler-style ranch house into a bunker as Ronald Reagan plans a sleepover there, and then dovetails into an account of the symbolic importance of the office. Smith's style is to present such an anecdote at the start of each chapter or section, then offer some insights and overview.<br /><br />The anecdotes are great, like the one that features Lesley Stahl anchoring a CBS attack piece on Reagan. After, she gets a call from a White House senior official. She expects a tirade, but instead the guy thanks her. Stahl's acid commentary was aired over image after image of Reagan in carefully staged feel-good set pieces, sort of by way of ironic contrast. But the senior official told Stahl no one cared what she said, it was the images that would resonate with the viewer, and those images supported Reagan. Alas, to her chagrin, he was right.<br /><br />The problem I have is with the analysis and overview. At times Smith is very dry, writing at length about congressional backroom games, staff work, and supplemental appropriations in a way that's probably too elementary for the poly sci student and too dull for everyone else. Elsewhere, he is just wrong, nowhere more so than when he talks about the presidency as a debilitated institution. He discourses on such things as the Democratic control of Congress and the dominance of PAC money as if they are things that will always be with us, when time has shown him wrong.<br /><br />The last chapter is the book's weakest, not because Smith attempts to offer prescriptions for the ills he ably depicts in the rest of the book, but for the \\"this could work, but then again...\\" tone he takes as he offers them up. Smith is a typical reporter; he wants to find fault but not commit himself to anything that smacks of a solution, since his inner cynic tells him such nostrums only bite you back in the end.<br /><br />There's a great book about Ronald Reagan and his impact on D.C. in \\"The Power Game\\" which I sort of wish Smith had hacked from the rest of this book and released in its stead. Smith is no fan of Reagan, but he's a keenly perceptive critic, not blindly partisan but very mainstream media in his generic liberal disdain. He makes some strong points about Reagan's less-than-positive legacy on the economic front, specifically by channeling the artful turncoat David Stockman, who ran the numbers for the early Reagan budgets, then turned around and told everyone Reagan was just in business to give tax breaks to the wealthy. Reagan also got run around by Congress more than popular history remembers, and Smith is there with the play-by-play.<br /><br />But did Reagan's first term in office see less growth in the national economy than the lone term of his predecessor, Jimmy Carter? Smith says so, but I sure don't remember it that way. He also lambastes Reagan for things that history proved him right on, like his handling of the Soviets, the Contras, and tax relief, and for Star Wars, where the jury is still out. By the end, Smith has worked up such a head of steam that he lumps Reagan and Kennedy alongside Carter, Ford, Nixon, and Johnson as failed presidents. [Here's a clue: When they name a major airport after a president, it probably means he did something right.]<br /><br />The problem is that the premise of \\"The Power Game,\\" that Congress is winning, is flawed. Since Smith keeps hitting on that point, it keeps sounding a false note.<br /><br />But Smith is a solid journalist, and at its best, which it frequently is, \\"The Power Game\\" is a fine inside-the-Beltway account of what went on in Washington during a time of great change. In some ways, the book is valuable historical reading as much for what it gets wrong as for what it gets right.d, Nixon, and Johnson as failed presidents.

Yet the dead man, Salomon Tauber, still can write: \\"With the passing of the years I have learned again to love; to love the rocks and trees, the sky above and the river flowing past the city, the stray dogs and cats, the weeds growing between the cobblestones, and the children who run away from me in the street because I am so ugly.\\"<br /><br />From there, the novel may slide a bit, but how can it be otherwise? A reporter who reads the journal, Peter Miller, takes it upon himself to find the man behind Tauber's tortures, former SS officer Eduard Roschmann A.K.A. \\"The Butcher of Riga,\\" and bring him to justice. Yes, people are right when they say \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" worked better as a story from front-to-back. Maybe the book could have done more with Miller's plan to infiltrate the Nazi underworld, the \\"ODESSA\\" of the novel's title, an idea developed more in the 1974 film adaptation starring Jon Voight. There are a couple of contrivances, not as egregious as are found in some other Forsyth books I can mention, but they are there.<br /><br />It's still a brilliant story, delivered with a minimum of sentiment and a feeling of lived-in journalistic accuracy. Most of all, it's exciting from chapter-to-chapter, a brisk gallop of a narrative. The final confrontation between Miller and Roschmann is justly famous and well-known; I suspect George Lucas was taking notes.<br /><br />I've read the book three times now since 1981, and while it's a little less than I remember, it's still tops in its genre in so many ways. People who think spy fiction is all about James Bond and Tom Clancy owe it to themselves to read \\"Odessa File;\\" they will be edified, or at the very least, highly entertained.its genre in so many ways.

But his \\"The Making Of The President - 1968\\" may be the best of his election chronicles precisely because of White's position at the nexus of one of America's great culture clashes.<br /><br />It was the year Vice President Hubert Humphrey tried to shake off the cold grip of his unpopular boss, Lyndon Johnson, and run as his own man, while Richard Nixon sought to convince the electorate he was new and improved from the 1960 figure they rejected. Which one would be more successful?<br /><br />There's not a lot of tension in the contest itself. White's readers knew who won, as do you. But White does shine in the wealth of detail he offers on the race, his philosophical analysis of shifting attitudes, and a cast of unique characters including the racist third-party candidate George Wallace, prickly peace advocate Eugene McCarthy, and hapless George Romney, an early GOP frontrunner of whom another Republican comments: \\"Watching George Romney run for the presidency was like watching a duck try to make love to a football.\\"<br /><br />There was tragedy in the 1968 race, too, most especially the murder of Democrat Sen. Robert Kennedy after his win in the California primary. White dedicates the book to Bobby and Jack Kennedy, and it's clear the reporter's heart was broken by what happened to them. Yet he manages to stand back and give an objective account of Kennedy's foreshortened run.<br /><br />White seems to be everywhere, with Kennedy and his family at a California home the night before his assassination, with Humphrey at the Democratic convention in Chicago the night the town blew up in rioting and tear gas, with Nixon on Election Eve, flying over the nation as Nixon stares out a airplane window \\"as if by looking down and concentrating he could pull in more votes.\\"<br /><br />Nixon comes off well in this book. 1968 was his year, and White gives him his due. Perhaps White bought too much into Nixon's new public image; time showed those demons inside him were not dead but resting. But Nixon was also a figure of great dimension and brilliance, and White provides expert testimony for that. Plus Nixon best articulated a position on one core issue, law-and-order, which White and many other concerned observers, liberal though they were, could see America needed more of in 1968. Claiming this issue for his own gained Nixon the support of much of the moderate middle, the \\"silent majority\\" he spoke of on the stump.<br /><br />White does have an ornate style that may bore some, and there's a lengthy postscript on what it all meant which was probably already outdated by the time the book was published. But \\"The Making Of The President - 1968\\" is by no means an outdated book. It's instead a primordial account of national politics as we now know them, with its sharp divides along racial, class, and ideological grounds, where the old ways, for better and worse, were being changed forever and the politicians were struggling to keep up. It should be required reading for political science majors; it's worthwhile reading for any citizen.a airplane window \\"as if by looking down and concentrating he could pull in more votes.\\" <br /> <br />Nixon comes off well in this book. 1968 was his year, and White gives him his due.

Is he mad, or just a prisoner in a mad world? Will he adjust, or fall into that chasm Mr. Antolini warns about?<br /><br />You can ask yourself a thousand questions about the protagonist of J.D. Salinger's lone novel, one of the most controversial and popular ever written in the United States. Critics may debate its merits, but \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" continues to reach readers young and old more than a half-century after its first publication. Like \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" it's one American classic that has lost nothing in the way of accessibility for all the time that's gone by.<br /><br />The secret is Caulfield, who pulls you in with his outsider status and sharp observational humor (\\"Sensitive...That guy Morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam toilet seat.\\") He's a rebel, quick to spot \\"phonies,\\" but not at all belligerent and more than a trifle naive. You can look up to him and pity him simultaneously.<br /><br />The division of sentiment about the book evident as you go down the page is pretty reflective of how critics have viewed the book since it first came out. Yes, it was a selection of The Book of the Month Club (or as Holden calls it at one point in the text, \\"the goddam Book of the Month Club\\"), and praised in The New York Times, but it also attracted some snarky digs from the get-go that's only accumulated over the years, about it being a narcissistic book with a limited leading character and a thin plot. Others call it the ultimate zen masterpiece. This only proves its staying power. If people started agreeing on \\"Catcher,\\" it would be in danger of getting boring.<br /><br />Maybe the most sticky criticism is that Salinger the anti-intellectual is championing Caulfield's know-nothing posture, his desire to fight his own maturation and be unchanged by pending adulthood. Clearly Holden has this problem; he idealizes younger children to a fault and can't so much as bear the notion of revisiting a museum and facing the prospect of his having changed just a little bit in the interval between visits. Salinger writes about this affectionately and with comic understanding, but not in agreement. His voice seems echoed by Mr. Antolini's, who warns Holden of the danger of looking for something \\"their own environment couldn't supply them with\\" to the point where they abandon hope of becoming anything at all.<br /><br />Of course, then Mr. Antolini puts the moves on Holden, chasing him away and putting him at odds with yet another adult. Holden distrusts, but he doesn't dislike, and that may be his saving grace, the fact he can love more easily than he can hate.<br /><br />There are no easy answers here, just great questions, the kind many of us grow up asking ourselves without quite being able to articulate, at least not until we read this book. Holden's last words to us can be taken as either prayer or warning: \\"Don't ever tell anybody anything.

Lyndon Baines Johnson was a lot of things, but couth wasn't one of them. After starting his presidency by calling Rose Kennedy, the mother of his murdered predecessor, to offer sincere condolences, LBJ quickly set off putting his own stamp on the White House, driving to the point of rude, focused to the point of nasty. At times he could be charming and sympathetic, but what comes across most clearly from these collected transcripts of Johnson's conversations is just how sick in the head our nation's leader often was.<br /><br />Reading through these transcripts, all recorded secretly by Johnson, mostly by phone, one is struck by how the man seems to take cold delight in belittling his staff, bullying legislators, and taking apart anyone who has the misfortune of wandering into his world when the mood is upon him. He's nice to his wife, and able to hear the occasional able counsel of those like Sen. Richard Russell whom he respects, but that's about it.<br /><br />The period covered in this book is the first nine months of his five-plus years in office. Supposedly this was the best part of the Johnson Administration, before Vietnam sent everything else on a downward spiral. But the record here shows something different. His heart may be in the right place, especially with civil rights, but there's something odd right away. Despite his massive lead in the polls, Johnson obsesses over outpolling likely Republican opponents even within their own party, and whines about presumptive GOP nominee Barry Goldwater's rhetoric even as it makes Johnson's reelection surer by the day. Out of concern for protecting his Southern base, he dodges the parents of three missing civil rights workers later found murdered in Mississippi. Most especially, Johnson focuses considerable ire on one man, his own Attorney General, Bobby Kennedy, who he blames covertly for every perceived problem he faces.<br /><br />Was Johnson this bad, or was Michael Benchloss trying to make a point with selective editing? I trust Benchloss's judgment, even if I don't always agree with it. He truncates one of Johnson's most memorable and hilarious phone conversations from this period, when he orders some slacks from the Haggar Company, and I have a feeling some Camelot sympathies color other parts Benchloss presents. But whatever the case, Johnson clearly had a problem with Bobby that extended beyond any rational place. I never cared much for Bobby Kennedy before, but I could only feel sorry for him here. Kennedy seems a dutiful assistant in Johnson's plans, but has his motives read again and again by his boss in the worst possible light.<br /><br />It's a one-note situation that occurs again and again, making \\"Taking Charge\\" less scintillating than salacious. The title suggests a study in strong leadership, but what you get is a study in obsessive compulsion. Call it \\"Moby Bobby.\\" At every turn, in the hours and hours of recorded conversation, Johnson continually brings up RFK in some negative context. The newspapers are giving Johnson grief, so Bobby must have something to do with it. Civil rights activists are agitating over the 1964 convention, must be Kennedy's shenanigans. He even puts the FBI on him. Captain Ahab wasn't this miserable.<br /><br />I'd give this book more stars if I had more fun reading it. Benchloss provides helpful notes and brief lead-ins for most of the conversation, but he doesn't do anything to set up the narrative at the outset, except in presenting an interesting if off-center series of comments Johnson made about the mystery of the Kennedy assassination which makes clear LBJ's innocence in that matter. One thing the New York Times reviewer noted is that Benchloss should have provided introductory essays to each of the month-by-month sections. You kind of have to follow the footnotes if you are to have any sense on what is what, and while Benchloss's footnotes are fun and smart, they also are mandatory reading, something footnotes should neverbe.<br /><br />This is a good book for what it is, but I have a feeling it could have been better with Benchloss taking more of an active hand. It's a clear contribution to American history and presidential politics, but its many insights are scattershot and the overall effect it leaves is more depressing than uplifting. Maybe with Johnson, that was the point.ould never be. <br /> <br />This is a good book for what it is, but I have a feeling it could have been better with Benchloss taking more of an active hand.

No, UConn is not a part of the Atlantic Coast Conference, the subject of this season-long profile by John Feinstein. But Feinstein gives a solid appreciation for what college basketball is all about through the experiences of the coaches, players, refs, execs, and fans active in the ACC, which Feinstein claims is perhaps the most competitive b-ball conference in Division 1, year in and out. \\"Let down just the slightest bit and you become instant roadkill,\\" he writes.<br /><br />Feinstein gives you a sense of the different coaching styles at play here, from Dean Smith's traditional approach at North Carolina to Rick Barnes' cut-up quirkiness at Clemson to Dave Odom's huggy-bear avuncularity at Wake Forest. He relates tales about the history and folklore of the conference that make one feel like an instant Dick Vitale just from reading them, even if the terms \\"traveling\\" and \\"charging\\" make you flash on American Express. Most importantly, he writes a book that really opens up the world of college basketball to the more casual fan, or even curious non-fan.<br /><br />That's what I liked the book. I read it, relished it, and enjoyed it with practically no knowledge of the sport going in. The way Feinstein writes about how different refs call different fouls, for example, was both illuminating and entertaining reading.<br /><br />Feinstein also writes candidly about contracts, recruiting, marriages (failed and successful), burnout, death, and all the other factors that affect college coaches. Players are less the focus, and I get the feeling that Feinstein speaks from personal experience late in the book when he speculates about how an inability to relate to his young players may have moved Dean Smith to retire at 66. The absence of a players' perspective is unfortunate, but it kind of follows with the focus of the book being on the nine coaches, seven of whom gave Feinstein total access.<br /><br />Feinstein obviously worked hard, and at times his narrative seems to be everywhere at once. Really great work on game descriptions, too, the way he uses them judiciously to punch up the storyline without letting them overtake the rest of the book.<br /><br />Finally, this is a must-read for fans of Duke and their coach, Mike Krzyzewski. Krzyzewski comes off the best in this book, and while some charge Duke grad Feinstein with bias, the truth is Krzyzewski has the most to offer, both as a man and as a coach. The story of his \\"drawing the line\\" before a big game with North Carolina is worth the price of the book by itself. Between him and Dean Smith, I'm surprised Feinstein had time at all for poor Pat Kennedy of Florida State, but he works hard at balance.<br /><br />What most comes across in this book is the amazing drive of the people involved. \\"If you're good enough to reach a goal, then there's still someplace else to go,\\" says Maryland coach Gary Williams. \\"You don't just stop. You keep trying to be better.\\"<br /><br />There are minor holes in \\"A March To Madness,\\" but what makes it great is the fact its author shares Williams' passion for excellence.

Author Rex Stout presents a delightful central concept showcasing one of mystery fiction's most unlikely yet enduring partnerships, that of rotund master detective Nero Wolfe and his smartalecky sidekick Archie Goodwin, who does all the legwork and narrating. Magnificent Manhattan ambiance and clever offhand dialogue abound, as does an appreciation for the finer things, like orchids, shad roe with creole sauce, and a second bottle of beer.<br /><br />\\"If Death Ever Slept\\" showcases these strengths, but as a murder mystery, it's neither plausible nor interesting. Wolfe is hired by a wealthy Manhattanite (vaguely described as a \\"capitalist\\" in \\"Who's Who\\") to investigate his daughter-in-law, whom he suspects of stealing business secrets. Archie poses as the man's new secretary, and finds himself \\"in a hive of predators and parasites\\" with the former including at least one person armed with a .38 and no compunction against using it.<br /><br />This should be good stuff, fine company for a rainy night, but the characters never gel into anything interesting, just stereotypes. You don't feel anything for them or their situations, not even when one of them is murdered. The pace is sloggy. \\"If Death Ever Slept\\" is an luxurious ambiance bath, and those that treasure Goodwin's funny lines and wry observational humor are well-served (About being caught in his room with his shoes off: \\"Conferring in bare feet with a man who is properly shod may not put you at a disadvantage, but it seems to.\\") Alas, it never engages the reader as a story.<br /><br />I had problems with the way Wolfe and Goodwin took the law into their own hands, tampering with a crime scene and then parsing over legalities while people died. Normally when the cops show up all out of sorts at Wolfe's brownstone stoop, you are supposed to relish the moment the fat man puts them in their place, but this time the pair meddles with a police investigation that's on the right track while Nero and Archie haven't a clue.<br /><br />Also, Archie's practiced patter wears thin after a while. He's got a great set of wisecracks, but nothing in this story seems to bother him, so why should we care? We already have a setpiece scenario, with all the stock characters in their stock situations, so any bit of empathy we can get from our humble narrator will help. But the most he offers is that the client's daughter does a mean rumba.<br /><br />Nero Wolfe books are usually good to great, and this at least is at times pretty funny. But it's far from Stout's best. If you read this and nothing else, give Stout another chance. And if you are looking for your first Nero Wolfe, there's at least a couple dozen better bets than this.ticed patter wears thin after a while.

As the narrative of \\"The Killer Angels\\" turns to Day 2 of the Battle of Gettysburg, and the view from the summit of Little Round Top with Union Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and his 20th Maine, you might swear that Michael Shaara was in the thick of things as the Confederate Army charged up the hill and the fate of the Republic swung in the balance. For about 30 pages or so, this is about as intense a reading experience as you will find, a masterpiece of combat fiction written like a nightmare come to life, distending in its brutality.<br /><br />There's another episode as good 80 pages later, told from the point of view of Confederate Gen. Lewis Armistead as he leads the famed Pickett's Charge on the third and final day of the battle. It's shorter, and has a far different result, perhaps even more powerful for that.<br /><br />The rest of \\"Killer Angels\\" is good fiction and good history, if not the ultimate version of either as represented by others. It's a great read, but there are sections on troop movements that come over rather dry, the dialogues between Confederate Generals Lee and Longstreet get a bit samey, and the narrow focus of the narrative, with just one U.S. regiment and the Confederate high command featured over the two roughest days, makes this less epic that it could have been. We get a couple of glimpses of the Union generals, but key parts of the battlefield like Culp's Hill and the Peach Orchard are passed over almost completely.<br /><br />That said, Shaara's sense of history and drama feel sure, and his unwillingness to play to the customary exultation of Lee is refreshing. Longstreet, blowing up at the dunderheaded questions from a British observer, exclaims: \\"God in Heaven, there's no strategy to this bloody war. What it is is old Napoleon and a lot of chivalry. That's all it is.\\" The irony is Longstreet is the one guy in the Confederate high command who sees beyond this, knowing frontal assaults with guidons streaming isn't going to get it done in an age where Napoleon is just another brand of cannon.<br /><br />It's been argued how right Shaara was depicting Longstreet this way, and whether Lee was such a stick in the mud, but clearly anyone who ordered something like Pickett's Charge wasn't adapting well to the reality of Industrial Age warfare, and the depiction we get of Longstreet here points this up in a way that gives due credit to Southern notions of gallantry and honor, as well as why such notions were tragically self-defeating.<br /><br />Shaara writes in a spare and simple way, making this a good introduction both for young readers and Civil War novices not too interested in the intricacies of command chains. He gives you a harrowing view of combat as it was back then, before the petty mercies of Kevlar and laser-guided smart bombs. He doesn't dote over characters, and I for one missed feeling something more than respect and awe for the folks depicted in the book, but he is writing fiction in service of history, not the other way around, and for that this book deserves its strong reputation.get it done in an age where Napoleon is just another brand of cannon. <br /> <br />It's been argued how right Shaara was depicting Longstreet this way, and whether Lee was such a stick in the mud, but clearly anyone who ordered something like Pickett's Charge wasn't adapting well to the reality of Industrial Age warfare, and the depiction we get of Longstreet here points this up in a way that gives due credit to Southern notions of gallantry and honor, as well as why such notions were tragically self-defeating. <br /> <br />Shaara writes in a spare and simple way, making this a good introduction both for young readers and Civil War novices not too interested in the intricacies of command chains.

The Bond lovers who made up this novel's key audience back in 1971 must have scratched their heads. But they kept reading. So will you.<br /><br />Ian Fleming had his James Bond take on outsized supervillains in blurry circumstances that only slightly approximated real life. Forsyth took Fleming's Anglo love for the good life and attention to how-things-work detail, and transported it to a real-life setting, part travelogue, part \\"what-if\\" hypothesis. He named real people, used real issues, and presented in utterly passionless style a story that sells you on its utter verisimilitude.<br /><br />Forsyth doesn't go much for humor: a trip by the assassin Jackal to a gay bar is about the closest to a chuckle we get; a politically incorrect one to be sure. He throws in some nice descriptions: \\"The heat lay on the city like an illness, crawling into every fibre, sapping strength, energy, the will to do anything but lie in a cool room with the jalousies closed and the fan full on.\\" But for a first-time fiction author, Forsyth isn't trying to sell you on his lyrical brilliance. He just moves you from one scene to another with minimum fuss, a deeper brilliance given he was a struggling writer with no track record with this sort of thing.<br /><br />Spy fiction was never the same after \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" came out. It became less a thing of fantasy, more a thing of life, because Forsyth proved that such an approach not only could work but work better than the Fleming approach. Even the movies' Bond adapted to it over time, for better or worse.<br /><br />One thing not talked about much that first-time readers will likely get is \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" is at times a brutal book, unsparing in its detailing of government-directed torture, of casual murder, of the mass of luckless shadow people with their missing limbs and mildewed medals in which evildoers are able to move, unobserved by the hoi polloi. Reading it for the first time in boarding school, I was taken aback at how harsh a world I lived in, that things like this could go on. Read today, after 9/11, it's almost quaint in that respect. But it's never a nice book. In fact, the casual nastiness is part of its perverse charm.<br /><br />First and last, this is a ripping good yarn, well told with a wealth of lived-in detail. You get the feeling Forsyth, struggling as he was, traveled every yard of the Jackal's long trail before setting it all down. It's not the only great book Forsyth wrote, \\"The Odessa File\\" came a year later, and he's shown flashes of his old form in the decades since. But \\"The Day Of The Jackal\\" began the art of spy fiction as we know it today; more than 30 years on, it's still the gold standard.r missing limbs and mildewed medals in which evildoers are able to move, unobserved by the hoi polloi.

Sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's terribly self-conscious and clever, serving no purpose except allowing self-aggrandizing deconstructionists and post-modernists a chance to strut their stuff and feel like they have something over the rest of us.<br /><br />I want to be clear in saying I regard \\"Ulysses\\" as a supreme example of craft and literary brilliance, but I don't think it is the great English-language novel, only maybe the most important. J.D. Wombacher said it very well in one of the earlier reviews: \\"My own view is that Ulysses is an example of a writer not doing his job.\\" If a writer's job is to create a novel in such a way as to let the reader in, this is not only a valid sentiment, but a boldly honest one.<br /><br />You start out thinking this isn't going to be as bad as every says. We watch an awkward young man named Stephen deal with his supersmug semi-friend and an annoying British interloper high atop the city of Dublin, in Martello Tower. Stephen is aware of the fact his \\"pal\\" Buck is really a bit of a user, and patronizing as hell, and in subtle, clever, and often funny ways, Joyce lets the reader see how. Then we watch poor Stephen alternately try to instruct a bunch of Anglo-Irish brats and deal with a supercilious headmaster, who fancies himself an expert on everything from livestock to why the sun will never set on the British empire.<br /><br />Then Stephen goes to the beach, and what follows in the third chapter, \\"Proteus,\\" is something that would make any good editor cry out for a rewrite. Joyce noted that his writing skills by the time he got to \\"Ulysses\\" were of such an advanced degree that he could do anything he wanted to with the English language, but there's ample evidence in the finished work that such absolute power can corrupt absolutely.<br /><br />At least Joyce seems to realize this, too, somewhat. He shifts the focus to another social outcast, a Jewish advertising salesman named Leo Bloom who busies himself with the stream of life around the fair city of Dublin so as to avoid going home, where he knows his fat wife is about to carry on an affair with a callow bounder.<br /><br />The results are some of the most affecting chapters ever written, each one slightly askew from the next, but forming a kind of whole that takes into account the whole history of literature, while advancing that history into unexplored territory with stream-of-consciousness narratives and multiple perspectives. Chapters like \\"Wandering Rocks,\\" \\"Sirens,\\" and especially \\"Cyclops\\" work on so many levels they make the head spin, and Joyce the humorist (he claimed one of his principal goals in writing \\"Ulysses\\" was to make the reader laugh) rivals Twain in his humanistic humorousness. Witness this sardonic exchange in \\"Cyclops,\\" my favorite chapter.<br /><br />\\"Dead?\\" says Alf. \\"He is no more dead than you are!\\"<br /><br />\\"Maybe so,\\" says Joe. \\"They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\\"<br /><br />But do we really need the mindgames of \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" or the play-form phantasmagoria of \\"Circe,\\" which lead us into blind alleys and throw enough red herrings to kill us with mercury poisoning? People say you need to read the Greek legend this all is based on, and I didn't, but I don't think I'm alone in finding this tangent strained. When Stephen finally ditches his false friend, he does so off-stage as it were, and it is never explained what transpired. Critics have their ideas why the connection between Stephen and Bloom, once made, is so vital, but it eluded me, even with all the supplemental reading I did.<br /><br />The end result is a writer writing essentially for himself, and for those who will play his games. That leaves out the rest of us.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this book, and hope God grants me the time to read it again someday. But don't believe the hype. Read \\"Ulysses,\\" but don't sweat what you don't get. Many of those who say they do \\"get\\" it are kidding themselves. Better to be honestly perplexed, and humbled by the experience. Humility has its virtues, and Joyce might have benefited from it more in writing this, creating a real masterpiece for the masses rather than an ivory tower to which only he held the key.luded me, even with all the supplemental reading I did. <br /> <br />The end result is a writer writing essentially for himself, and for those who will play his games.

He just got lucky. But so do golf readers, because this wry, perceptive, and utterly addictive account of Rich Beem's trials and tribulations, and that of his caddie, Steve Duplantis, is surely a once-in-a-lifetime event. It's hard to imagine any other PGA golfer, at any point in his career, opening up to the degree Beem does here, as well as be complimented by the perspective of Duplantis, a once-promising caddy who bounced back with Beem after losing top contender Jim Furyk's bag a few weeks before.<br /><br />Beem's a deserving center of attention, particularly in a moment-by-moment account of the first tournament Beem and Duplantis ever worked together, the Kemper Open in Maryland, the one Beem won. But Duplantis may be the most enduring character here, a guy who makes his own worst luck, but wins you over by wearing his heart on his sleeve.<br /><br />As Shipnuck relates, Duplantis hits on a succession of strip-bar performers, then wonders why he can't have a steady relationship. He shows up late for practice rounds, and wonders why golfers lose patience with him. But when he says of Beem: \\"Does he want to be responsible and treat this like a job or does he want to get ----faced and stay out all night?\\" you know what he means even if it is pot-on-kettle commentary.<br /><br />Beem has fierce drive, guts, and creativity with his iron shots, but what seems to drive him most is a desire for a good time. He ogles waitresses, downs Jack and cokes, and talks about hitting on Tour groupies in a way few golfers do, at least when someone with a pen or tape recorder is around.<br /><br />All this candor could have blown up in Beem's face, but two things prevent it. One is Beem doesn't seem to care that much what people think. He's beyond social embarrassment. Two is that Shipnuck is not writing some leering tell-all to titillate the masses, but a very finely-tuned account of what makes pro golfers tick, namely what separates the good from the great. Reading about Beem makes you appreciate more a man like Tiger Woods, who stays hungry win-after-win. Beem's first victory, hard-earned and glorious to read, put him in a bit of a glidepath which went on for the next two years. You know from reading this that Beem has it in him to excel, but will he?<br /><br />Add to this examination Shipnuck's way with metaphors, his unerring ear for the right quote, and an occasional way with a phrase that would make Herbert Warren Wind proud: \\"There is no room to write excuses on the scorecard, just numbers,\\" Shipnuck writes, but golf is a game of color and life, and in \\"Bud, Sweat, & Tees\\" Shipnuck delivers both like nothing you've ever read before.ave blown up in Beem's face, but two things prevent it.

It's not that Eisenstock plunges into a lot of juicy sports controversies. There's mention of whether Gil Hodges should get into the Baseball Hall of Fame, an atypical outburst by Rick Pitino, and why black athletes excel in certain fields of endeavor more than whites. But all that is secondary to the main focus of this book, which is the people, those that listen, those that call, and those that host.<br /><br />Papa Joe Chevalier in Chicago gets a call from an attractive-sounding woman who wants to wish him a Happy Valentine's Day. Will he take her number? Lee \\"Hacksaw\\" Hamilton in San Diego hides behind hideous orange sunglasses, opening up after much prompting only to shut down again abruptly.

I had the chance to interview Mike and the Mad Dog a couple of years ago, before reading \\"Sports Talk,\\" and all I can say is I wish I had done half the job Eisenstock does here.<br />With all of these visits, what you get is a you-are-there second-by-second account of conversational back-and-forth, a sense of how these guys talk when the light isn't on. The results are bluntly hilarious, sometimes rude, and always real.

US	50230169	RJ8LPS0ML6H7F	0684800829	271601423	Rave On: The Biography of Buddy Holly	Books	4	24	26	N	N	Buddy Gets His Due	I needed to read this book because all I knew about Buddy Holly, other than a dozen or so evergreen songs, was that movie, \\"The Buddy Holly Story,\\" which is hardly accurate. Philip Norman gives you a much better sense of what Buddy's brief moment in the spotlight was all about.<br /><br />It was brief, just over a year and a half from the time he and his band, the Crickets, hit the U.S. charts with \\"That'll Be The Day\\" in the summer of 1957 to the fateful flight from Mason City, Iowa on February 3, 1959. It's hard to imagine making as much of the time as Buddy Holly did of his, starting a career, a business partnership, and a family, not to mention writing music that revolutionized rock n' roll.<br /><br />Norman gives you a good sense of how Holly did this, in a book that is a clear work of love, not ignoring negative elements of the story but striving to put them in less lurid context. One weakness of the book is that this sometimes gets in the way (Holly's alleged gambling problems, dwelt on in other books, is only mentioned once in passing, while a tale backup Cricket guitarist Niki Sullivan offers up about Holly getting a girl pregnant is thrown up only to be knocked down in backhanded fashion.) But the overwhelming sense one gets from reading \\"Rave On\\" is Norman's contention that Buddy had everything going for him except luck.<br /><br />I liked especially the English context of this book. Norman, a British author, pays close attention to Holly and the Crickets' impact on the British music scene, where he was a bigger sensation than his native land. Occasionally, as when the Crickets visit the U.K. and Norman itemizes hotel expenses and suchlike, it gets a bit precious, but Holly, the first rocker to write his own songs and perform them in a band context, obviously was laying some groundwork here that the British would emulate with great success in the coming decade.<br /><br />Norman also takes on Norman Petty, producer and manager of the Crickets who was either duplicitous by design or by accident. \\"To some, he was the person who made it possible for Buddy Holly to come alive; others feel he could hardly be more to blame for Buddy's death if he'd gone out into the Iowa snows with a machine gun and pointed it straight into the sky.\\" Given Buddy's reason for joining the 1959 \\"Winter Dance Party\\" tour had to do with Petty's reluctance to part with money Holly earned under Petty's wing that Holly needed for himself and his pregnant wife, you can understand the bitterness.<br /><br />Norman was able to get a look at Petty's files, tape transcripts, and the like, which cast some new light on the fellow Norman dubs \\"Clovis Man,\\" if not enough to figure out exactly who he was or what he was about. Petty makes an interesting character; Norman got more use out of Brian Epstein in his Beatles book, \\"Shout,\\" but when the Holly story finds itself in the strange Clovis, New Mexico studio space where Petty, his wife, and their butch female companion lived, the story picks up a bit.<br /><br />Ultimately, the focus stays with Buddy, though, where it belongs. Norman explains just what it was about his music that made it so innovative, both uniquely of its time and timeless. It's amazing that he not only established a new sound but moved so far beyond it in such a short time. Maybe not so amazingly, his songs were often ignored in the United States (just 3 Top 10 hits, by himself or with the Crickets) while embraced with greater fervor overseas (his last single release, \\"It Doesn't Matter Anymore,\\" was a #1 hit in England, but peaked in the U.S. at, natch, #13.)<br /><br />The last images of the book are the most arresting. Norman gets a rare peak at the overnight bag Holly carried with him on his fatal flight, still encrusted with dirt from that frozen farmland where his single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza slammed down, still containing a tube of toothpaste, a lint brush, and a comb still entwined with a few hairs that never turned gray.<br /><br />This book didn't really breathe Buddy; it skims over a good deal and Norman fails to corroborate stories he offers up from single sources. But it's a nice book that captures who this fellow named Buddy Holly was, and why he left such a deep imprint on culture, both directly and through his many followers.br /><br />This book didn't really breathe Buddy; it skims over a good deal and Norman fails to corroborate stories he offers up from single sources.

That's a rock, country, and soul trifecta for those keeping score, not to mention Campbell was briefly a member of the Beach Boys' touring band. Or how about a book that is ostensibly about the Boys but spills more ink about the bodyguard who had an affair with Brian Wilson's wife than it does on Al Jardine or Bruce Johnston, actual members of the band?<br /><br />At least Gaines throws in a kind mention of Bruce Johnston's classic \\"Disney Girls (1957),\\" which was nice for this fan to read. It's more notable because there's not much attention in this book to the Beach Boys music, other than their earliest, career-making singles, \\"Good Vibrations,\\" and the Pet Sounds album. He skims over so much there's no mention of such classics as \\"Wendy,\\" \\"Do It Again,\\" \\"Little Honda,\\" \\"Come Go With Me,\\" \\"All Summer Long,\\" and \\"Good Timin'.\\" There's nothing said of \\"Kokomo\\" either, though since the book was published in 1986, two years before that final number-one hit was released, you can't blame Gaines for missing it. (If only the Beach Boys had.)<br /><br />The advantage of Gaines approach is you do get drawn in, right away as he begins by recounting the last hours of Dennis Wilson's troubled life, then back-pedals to the abusive Hawthorne, CA household where frustrated songwriter Murry Wilson browbeats and, at times, just beats his three sons into becoming the closest answer America ever had to the Beatles. Murry is one guy you can't worry about being too unfair with, and to his credit, Gaines attempts to separate fact from fiction with this nasty fellow.<br /><br />But the book sags notably once the band's career takes off. Gaines can't really focus on the music, or even on the band's upward trajectory or its influence on popular culture. His interest is exclusively on What Went Wrong. As a result, this reads at times more like an autopsy report than the history of a band so successful it became an institution. Unlike Gaines' Beatles book, \\"The Love You Make,\\" there's no narrative thread to sustain the story. The most wretched lowpoints are thrown up one after another with minimal context.<br /><br />There's fun to be had here, with a character list right out of Dickens, everyone seemingly scrambling to be more messed up than the next. Brian and Dennis Wilson are obvious centers of attention, as is a manager who apparently got the bright idea of moving America's Band to the Netherlands just so he could have a cozier place to be with his boyfriend. A succession of managers, wives, girlfriends, and hangers-on create an environment so chaotic and dysfunctional you are hardly surprised when the Manson Family drops in for an extended stay.<br /><br />Brian's '70s excesses prompts one funny question from Gaines, \\"how a 240-pound, unwashed, emotionally-disturbed man could wind up with three women fighting over him?\\" The answer of course, is money and fame can blind a lot of people. The problem is, in a different way, it blinds Gaines, too, making him look less at the Beach Boys as confused mortals than as depraved gods making a gorgeous mess of their Mt. Olympus.<br /><br />Unless you have some personal stake in the Beach Boys, and many do, there's probably more to like in this book than not, provided you don't take it seriously. The bitter recollections of hangers-on don't really make for a definitive story, though the claims made in \\"Heroes & Villains\\" are the kind any serious biographer will need to address, which is morea good thing than not. I liked reading it more for entertainment than illumination, but I needed to take a shower when I was done.a good thing than not.

He writes about parking pressures and vendor pilfering the way Cornelius Ryan wrote about D-Day.<br /><br />Those expecting a play-by-play on the golf played during those four days in June, which saw Tiger Woods break away the first day and never look back, may be disappointed. Even when the book's narrative finally reaches the event itself, after some 260 pages, the focus remains on the behind-the-scenes organizers, the USGA, NBC, and state officials. It's a unique situation, Feinstein reminds us, to have used a municipal course to host the U.S. Open, but maybe it's not worth writing a book about.<br /><br />That said, Feinstein's book is an interesting read, especially for those who care about things like event management, sports broadcasting, or professional golf. As an author, Feinstein is much more engaged than he was when he wrote \\"The Majors,\\" his style coming up to that of his classic \\"A Good Walk Spoiled.\\"<br />Some of his wit is back in evidence. When a volunteer realizes Tiger used the Porta-John he helped set up, he calls a friend to share the good news. \\"Yes, Woods thrilled people in many different ways,\\" Feinstein concludes.<br /><br />I also liked the fact he doesn't hold back with the players, something I noticed and minded with \\"The Majors\\" after his no-holds-barred approach in \\"Good Walk Spoiled.\\" Woods still won't shake a TV reporter's hand 18 months after that reporter said Woods was in a \\"slump.\\" Sergio Garcia has his star moments, while Jeff Maggert comes across as totally unpleasant. At least Feinstein whipping boy John Daly's on his best behavior this time around.<br /><br />The portraits of the organizers and staff that center this book are smoother, and maybe Feinstein finds more of interest about them than you will. It's an interesting tack to take, though, writing not about the game's stars but those who help to make such marquee events happen. Feinstein is in uncharted territory here, and maybe reclaiming some lost ground as golf's most original working writer.<br /><br />That said, \\"The Open\\" is still a bore in parts, and lacks a strategic or historical overview of what makes Bethpage's Black Course so special. What did course designer A.W. Tillinghast do with the track that was so unique, and how did it preserve that notoriety over the decades as an overused Long Island muni? There's a splendid tale about golf course architecture waiting to get out here that never quite does.<br /><br />All the same, \\"The Open\\" is good for what it is, an appreciation of a very underappreciated aspect of sport. Too bad it isn't a little more interesting, but for those who care (and there are many, given golf's popularity), it will probably be worth your while to check it out.events happen.

When he goes to court a lovestruck lass, he brings a bottle of acid to threaten her with. He kills not only to cover evidence of previous murders, but because he derives pleasure from the act. He hates with a blind fury anything that makes him feel vulnerably human.<br /><br />\\"Heaven was a word: Hell was something he could trust.\\"<br /><br />Pinkie is not just a bad guy, he is a teen so twisted by evil that he willfully chooses damnation over salvation. He's an archetype, yes, but very compelling, a flip side to the flawed cleric of Greene's \\"The Power And The Glory\\" for whom observance of Catholic ritual nevertheless steers him along the right path. For Pinkie, Catholicism is no less universal a truth, but a concept only adhered to in the negative, at least after an encounter with razor-wielding toughs forces him to realize he can't expect himself to make that last-minute plea for divine forgiveness he had been counting on.<br /><br />\\"Brighton Rock\\" starts out strongly, with the last hours of a man on the run, before introducing us to the trinity of characters that steer the plot, Pinkie; his unfortunate girlfriend Rose, who invests her evil beau with all her Catholic-honed faith; and the secular, lusty Ida who, because of a chance encounter, decides to avenge one of Pinkie's victims.<br /><br />Greene writes with passion and an eye for detail that reveals greater designs. There's also a black humor in the book, as Pinkie shows himself time and again the servant of his inner bile to the virtual exclusion of common sense. Greene describes the coastal British getaway of Brighton in crunchy detail, and there's a nice verisimilitude to his dialogue that anticipates Anthony Burgess's later examination of juvenile thuggery, \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" without the futuristic component. [\\"Brighton Rock\\" is set in the 1930s, when the novel was published.]<br /><br />The only weakness of the book as I see it is that it takes a while to get started. There's a good 100 pages of scene-setting, and Ida doesn't make for a compelling character when she's not moving the plot, so her sections tend to drag a bit, at least until she starts getting after Rose about what Pinkie's really about. Since Greene writes his book as a mystery, this early lack of dramatic undertow costs the narrative in terms of readability, at least for a while.<br /><br />But Pinkie and Rose, as they develop, more than make up for this. There's an element of melodrama in her sad devotion to his evil cause, but it's effective. Greene makes clear in his careful, empathetic way how sad Rose's life has been before she found herself receiving the attentions of a young tough she mistakes for true love. She creates the sympathetic center of the novel, while Pinkie forms a counterbalance of true malice, a man so twisted even basic human lust is lost on him. Even Shakespeare's Richard III could charm, but Greene's development of Pinkie's character is stunning for the simple fact he delves deeper into Pinkie's psyche while avoiding the slightest pretense of sympathy.<br /><br />As a mystery, \\"Brighton Rock\\" finds itself in the second half, then takes off toward a conclusion that is actually quite gripping. What makes this book great is its exploration of the human character, and of the Catholic philosophy of good and evil. \\"Brighton Rock\\" is an obvious starting point for understanding Greene's attitude toward spirituality and man, and a powerful message of faith even by a negative example.ness of the book as I see it is that it takes a while to get started.

An unexplained package for Det. Steve Carella? A dead naked woman lying in the park across the street? Must be another call from that fiendish archvillain, the Deaf Man.<br /><br />\\"Eight Black Horses\\" was published in 1985, but it's more like a throwback to an earlier time in the 87th Precinct's development, when the accent was more on the mystery and less on the characters around it. That's not a bad thing here, since the problem posed to the investigators (and readers) by the Deaf Man is so involving and enjoyable in its macabre way. You get four dead civilians, three dead cops, and plenty of kinky sex before this one is through, so maybe it's not so bad to take this one as an entry in a lighter vein.<br /><br />Ed McBain is as serious as death when he writes one of his 87th Precinct thrillers, but sometimes he's less serious than others, like he is here when he writes of a woman, feeling jilted after a one-night stand involving bondage and Russian roulette: \\"Lying to her, taking advantage of her, doing disgusting things to her, and then not even calling her again...\\"<br /><br />The pace of this one zips along in classic 87th Precinct style, with more attention than usual given to the full complement of detectives in the squadroom. The clues the reader and the detectives get are clever even if we pick up on it a little before they do. Something about the Deaf Man makes him operate like his classical predecessor, Moriarty, laying forth the gauntlet in an almost gentlemanly style that would seem archaic were it not so entertaining. It makes him happy company, too, however fiendish he may be.<br /><br />For those who try to keep score, there's some useful details about the boroughs of Isola and how they were named: \\"Bethtown had been named for the virgin queen Elizabeth, but undoubtedly by a British officer with a lisp; it was supposed to be Besstown.\\"<br /><br />And there's even some Christmas cheer to be had. Never mind that the Santa at the local department store isn't called \\"short eyes\\" because he gets confused about his elves. Probably the finest misanthropic take on the meaning of Christmas is offered by Det. Andy Parker in a hilarious monologue that belongs in any curmudgeon's handbook.<br /><br />Even for 87th Precinct fans, the Deaf Man may be a bit of an acquired taste; since he likes to drop clues a la the Riddler he pushes the bounds of realism somewhat more than some 87th Precinct readers might like. But for those of us who enjoy Ed McBain's storytelling vibrancy, having an outsized story now and then only adds to the pleasures of the series.<br /><br />And there's always useful information to be had. Here, for example, we learn from a detective which silk panties to buy a girlfriend for which day of the week. Saturday is black, we know, but Thursdays are purple? Just as long as you don't forget the lavender garter belt...mas cheer to be had.

In parts a celebration, in parts a eulogy, it makes for some fascinating reading.<br /><br />Those who read and liked Guralnick's earlier, shorter \\"Feel Like Going Home\\" will enjoy this second trip to the well. There's calls paid on Rufus Thomas, \\"the world's oldest teenager\\" whose blues-centered dances led to some early-'60s chart success; on DeFord Bailey, a harmonica whiz who was the Opry's first major star until folks figured out he was black; Hank Williams Jr., who lives up to his Daddy's tall legacy with the help of artificial stimulants and his own sense of the blues; and Charlie Rich, who was last visited in \\"Feel Like Going Home\\" as something of a straggler but grew into one of the biggest country singers of the 1970s, not that we find him here feeling too happy about it.<br /><br />The best writing in this collection comprises several chapters on Elvis Presley, who was still just barely alive when Guralnick wrote his first essay here in 1976 and just dead when he wrote his next right after. Elvis was the one guy Guralnick didn't talk to, but you feel his presence in interviews with his old guitarist Scotty Moore and former mentor Sam Phillips.<br /><br />\\"He hit like a Pan-American flash, and the reverberations still linger from the shock of his arrival,\\" Guralnick writes.<br /><br />There's a lot of characters, and some seem more interesting for their uniqueness (Jack Clement, Charlie Feathers) while others seem like misses altogether (who was James Talley anyway, and why should we care?) But there's some arresting profiles of those who made it and those who didn't, plus a sense of what got them there.<br /><br />\\"It has to be the only thing for you - the one thing in your life,\\" says cowboy legend Ernest Tubb. Guralnick makes it all seem worth it, for a few hundred pages at least.	2004-05-09

I finally realize why I enjoyed that earlier book so, in that le Carr&eacute; modeled the work so directly (and with proper acknowledgement) on this 1958 masterpiece.<br /><br />Le Carr&eacute;'s effort isn't bad, but its often-maudlin tone detracts from the humor of the situation. Not so Greene, who subtitled his book \\"An Entertainment\\" and meant it. He doesn't waive all suspense and tragic overtones in search of punchlines; one of the chief joys of this book is how well it works as a spy novel. But unlike heavier Greene works like \\"The Power And The Glory,\\" \\"Our Man\\" plays in a kind of high-adventure, almost Ian Fleming kind of way.<br /><br />Greene's novel concerns a struggling British vacuum salesman living in Cuba, Jim Wormold, recruited by U.K. espionage to provide intelligence on the local scene as it becomes a hot spot in East-West relations. Wormold can't resist their money, but decides that instead of giving honest information, he will make up stories with the \\"assistance\\" of a stable of recruited agents he invents on the spot.<br /><br />\\"Just lie and keep your freedom,\\" advises Wormold's best friend, an old German doctor with a mysterious background named Hasselbacher. \\"They don't deserve the truth...They have no money, except what they take from men like you and me.\\"<br /><br />So Wormold does exactly that, for the benefit of his blossoming daughter, the flower of his heart whose faith in him and God he seeks to preserve though he doesn't share either belief. The result is a tangle of tall tales about alcoholic pilots and Mata Hari (...) he basically makes up as he goes along.<br /><br />At one point, he wonders whether he pushed his luck when he presents the plans for one of his vacuum cleaner models as a secret Soviet base, but he's hopelessly addicted to his fiction almost as much for the pleasure of creation as for the financial reward: \\"It astonished Wormold how quickly he could reply to any questions about his characters; they seemed to live on the threshold of consciousness - he had only to turn on a light and there they were, frozen in some characteristic action.\\"<br /><br />Wormold is playing a dangerous game; in addition to snookering his own country, he is also attracting the notice both of the rival camp and the Havana police in the intimidating person of Captain Segura, a rumored torturer who covets Wormold's daughter. But in oddly detached fashion, perhaps because his life lost much of its purpose when his wife left him years ago, Wormold improvises his way through with cosmic aplomb.<br /><br />There is a deeper meaning to this book, based on Greene's belief that neither East nor West deserved any special allegiance during the Cold War. One character puts it this way: \\"They haven't left us much to believe, have they? Even disbelief. I can't believe in anything bigger than a home, or anything vaguer than a human being.\\"<br /><br />It's possible to take issue with Greene's value-neutral attitude, but his execution is so deft, and his style so entertaining, that you can't help but admire him. \\"Our Man In Havana\\" is a thoroughly mesmerizing comedy that manages to impart some subversive truths about where the moral lines exist between serving one's government and serving one's fellow man.hed Wormold how quickly he could reply to any questions about his characters; they seemed to live on the threshold of consciousness - he had only to turn on a light and there they were, frozen in some characteristic action.\\"<br /><br />Wormold is playing a dangerous game; in addition to snookering his own country, he is also attracting the notice both of the rival camp and the Havana police in the intimidating person of Captain Segura, a rumored torturer who covets Wormold's daughter.

McBain takes time out to describe the demographics of the 87th, the dance clubs, the stay-at-home wives who rake each other over in their washing-line gossip sessions like so many Mesdames Defarge.<br /><br />Some nice time-outs, too, like one early on about the essence of urban loneliness. \\"Loneliness doesn't respect the calendar,\\" he writes. \\"Saturday, Tuesday, Friday, Thursday - they're all the same, and they're all grey.\\"<br /><br />Steve Carella, the de facto hero of the 87th series, is away on his honeymoon for this one, and the reins are taken, for maybe the only time in the series, by a patrolman rather than a detective. Bert Kling is still nursing his injury from \\"Cop Hater\\" when an old friend pays him a visit, asking him to talk to his sister-in-law. That he does, and when the sister-in-law turns up dead the next day, he finds himself investigating the mysterious circumstances of her life. Why was a beautiful woman so sad, why did she visit a strange dance club and sit zombielike on the sidelines despite the many invitations to dance, why did she turn up a corpse on the other side of the city?<br /><br />Since Kling is just a beat cop, he is limited in what he can do, but he does manage to meet one woman who may have some answers, particularly for his own lonelyheart condition.

She already wrote the definitive memoir of a child's life in an East Texas hellhole, \\"The Liars' Club,\\" which as a first-person narrative remains better than anything I've ever come across. Why risk another trip to the well? Can you exceed expectations when so many of them, like mine, are off the charts?<br /><br />I'm in a funny position writing this, because I expected to come here and write about my disappointment with \\"Cherry,\\" why it wasn't up to par with \\"Liars' Club.\\" But reading all the one- and two-star reviews, some of which raise valid points, others of which are just all wet, I feel a little more protective about what I just read.<br /><br />No, it's not as involving as \\"Liars' Club.\\" Karr isn't the passive youngster anymore, and she takes on a wider swath of her life, from just before sixth grade all the way up through high school, meaning there isn't the concentration of time that worked with \\"Liars' Club.\\" Our narrator is changing this time, and quickly.<br /><br />More problematic, there is Karr's use of the second-person singular for the bulk of the book, describing her actions as if you are her. It doesn't work, feeling arch and odd instead of inclusive. Karr's budding sensibilities as a poet also come into play, with the help of a friend suspiciously named Meredith Bright, and you either will identify with their precocious conversations on absurdist theater or, like me, feel distanced by it. But it's her life, and she should tell it as it is.<br /><br />The best part of the book is its first third, with its account of elementary and junior high school life. Karr's sharp eye for detail and her fluidity with language, so stunning in \\"Liars' Club,\\" doesn't fail her here. She recalls the posture of a picked-on classmate \\"till her whole body became a sort of living question mark, the punctuation with which she responded to every mean sentence we could construct.\\" Then there's her fear when approached by a boy she likes: \\"Part of me is also crazily rewinding to play back my whole walk across the field, for surely I did some stupid thing. I wouldn't pick my nose or anything...but I could have been skipping or singing some goofy song under my breath.\\"<br /><br />Later, she will find herself recruited to give this same boy a long leg massage, in a riotously funny passage in which she gets hot and bothered learning the critical distinction between gastrocs and hamstrings.<br /><br />While people here note the presence of drugs, in all fairness they don't show up for more than a hundred pages, and she doesn't exactly turn into Ozzy Osbourne. She smokes some joints, and tries a few other things, but seems a bit removed from the drug culture even as she writes about it. Actually, I was glad to have the drugs come into play, as it beat reading about her reading Howard Nemerov. She has sex, too, but is shier about describing that than I would have expected from \\"Liars' Club.\\"<br /><br />Karr is a virtuoso at description, and tying up the loose ends of a disorderly life.

US	50230169	R1IMP0FNUZ1NO2	0743255003	334825958	The Battle for Augusta National: Hootie, Martha, and the Masters of the Universe	Books	4	1	4	N	N	Culture Clash Behind The Ropes	Alan Shipnuck has made himself into one of golf's snarkier voices with his classic shaggy-dog-story \\"Bud Sweat & Tees\\" and his sometimes barbed, often candid commentary for Sports Illustrated. So what is he doing writing a sober account of one of golf's loudest social controversies? Is he trying to be John Feinstein all of a sudden?<br /><br />Actually, the motivation is purer. Shipnuck offers a detached, analytical view of what exactly happened when the Augusta National Golf Club, site of the Masters, refused demands that it admit women members.<br /><br />\\"Hootie Johnson has four daughters,\\" one woman tells a reporter. \\"How does he sleep at night?\\"<br /><br />While some bashed Hootie, Augusta's chairman and the voice of the gender ban, others excoriated Martha Burk, the activist whose cry for membership equality seemed at times a personal crusade. Ultimately, it came down to how people felt about things like abortion, equal pay in the office, glass ceilings, female circumcision, anything but golf.<br /><br />That's about my only problem with Shipnuck's book. I want him writing about golf, not peripheral culture issues like this. He overblows the importance of this particular story. But Shipnuck does a great job putting both sides of the argument in a fair light, and detailing in a clinical scorekeeper fashion just how the controversy was resolved.<br /><br />Shipnuck's interest is not ideology but people. He manages to get under the placards and in the face of just about everyone who took a stand on this issue, including, in exclusive interviews, the two main players. Hootie comes across as a prickly but likable character, neither as exclusionary nor as unthinking as his critics often claimed. Martha is a cagey, doughty crusader with periods of understandable exhaustion and a fine sense of humor. When someone brings her an anti-Martha T-shirt [\\"If Martha had balls...She could join the club\\"] she gets a real kick from reading it.<br /><br />She needed that sense of humor, as her strong charge, seemingly on the verge of making a miracle and bringing women members to Augusta, caused instead another miracle, that of making Americans feel sorry for a coterie of rich white men. Overplaying her hand, claiming common cause with U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, and equating the Augusta National with the Ku Klux Klan all killed the momentum of her campaign, along with the savvy PR work of Augusta?s media consultant, Jim McCarthy.<br /><br />Also damaging was the fickleness of the press, rallying behind her and then against her. Shipnuck's best work, an easy five-star essay on its own, details the various shifts in press coverage of the campaign, particularly at the New York Times, which tried to adopt Burk's campaign as their own only to have it instead contribute to the unhorsing of its own executive editor. Shipnuck's pen is sharp, whether the subject is TV commentators like Rich Eisen [\\"a one-time standup comic masquerading as a journalist.\\" Ouch!], rabid bloggers, and even SI colleague Rick Reilly, who gets into a silly macho face-off with a one-man Imperial Wizard whose only white accoutrements are his prize poodles.<br /><br />In the end, Shipnuck makes clear his belief that Augusta should admit women, that Johnson's refusal has denigrated the sport and forever equated him with the ardent segregationists who supported Jim Crow laws in the 1950s, but that the feminists lost their heads too quickly to make a clear case. The nice thing about \\"The Battle For Augusta National\\" is you don't have to share that view to enjoy the book. Shipnuck writes with clarity, humor, and a sense of fairness that really does credit to his profession. That puts him in the minority in the Augusta controversy.humor, as her strong charge, seemingly on the verge of making a miracle and bringing women members to Augusta, caused instead another miracle, that of making Americans feel sorry for a coterie of rich white men.

More than $27 million in debt and trying to conceal bald-faced embezzlement, the broke stockbroker and former New York Stock Exchange president still managed to carry himself with a smug hauteur as he drew up new IOUs.<br /><br />Approaching one broker with whom he was on a bad footing, Whitney \\"made no lame effort to ingratiate himself. Rather he announced brusquely that he 'wanted to get this over with quickly'...Then he said he wanted to borrow $250,000 'on my face.'\\"<br /><br />He was denied that time, at least, but Whitney's arrogance was rewarded in other instances. When you were one of Wall Street's aristocrats of the 1920s and 1930s, life was like that.<br /><br />Whitney is the central character in John Brooks' \\"Once In Golconda,\\" an absorbing, picaresque account of the New York Stock Exchange's painful coming of age during the Jazz Age and Great Depression. Though there are some patterns watchers of today's stock markets may recognize in this account of the Great Crash of 1929 and its aftermath, some things are probably never to be repeated, probably for the best.<br /><br />Wall Street in 1929 was a plutocratic fiefdom where might meant right and no one was righter than J.P. Morgan & Co., known by many as \\"23\\" for its Wall Street address. But the crash brought anger as it took the rest of the national economy down with it, and in time, calls for reform that the stockbroking elite ignored at their peril. Leading the resistance to change was NYSE President Whitney, who showed great bravery on Black Thursday by placing some stabilizing bids but remained inflexible despite growing demands for needful change.<br /><br />\\"Once In Golconda\\" is a financial history anyone can pick up and enjoy. The terminology is not too technical, and Brooks writes with a real zest for the human equation. At the same time, you get a deeper appreciation for the market forces that dictated what happened on the Street; how the market was democratized, first by the influx of middle-class investors before the bubble burst, and then after, by the formation of the Securities And Exchange Commission; and how J.P. Morgan lost its supremacy to new-money upstarts like Merrill Lynch.<br /><br />Brooks, writing in the late 1960s, clearly favored a closely regulated market, but he avoids coming off shrill by presenting both sides of the argument at all times. Not completely in the New Deal camp, he describes the theory of an early FDR economic adviser as amounting to populist voodoo economics. \\"To reverse the roles by trying to make gold prices affect commodity prices was like a man in a building lobby trying to move an elevator from floor to floor by pushing the indicator dial from place to place: it wouldn't work, and it could easily end up ruining the whole mechanism.\\"<br /><br />This is an excellent companion volume to Brooks' other classic, \\"The Go-Go Years,\\" a contemporary account about the market's rise in the 1960s. It has the same elegant prose, the same attention to nuance and detail, perhaps an even larger-than-life cast of characters, and a wry wit that pierces through even the driest sensibility.

US	50230169	R2FYGLWAEOIAW0	0743202694	953997941	Money, Money, Money: A Novel of the 87th Precinct (87th Precinct Mysteries)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Money Makes The Eight-Seven Go Round	Ed McBain's 51st entry in the 87th Precinct series shows the author in fine fettle, robust even. It's an enjoyable, somewhat unusual novel, a good page-turner as McBains nearly always are. If it's less than his best, it's not from lack of trying.<br /><br />Someone is moving funny money through the streets of Isola. A woman gets fed to the lions. A guy turns up dead in a garbage can. A peaceful burglar gets an odd visit from a Secret Service agent. A group of terrorists from the Middle East plot an explosion at a city landmark. Just another day at the office for the 87th Precinct.<br /><br />There's a lot to chew on here, and like the poor woman in the lions' cage, it ends up getting scattered in many directions. Focus is usually one of McBain's strengths, but after a promising start, it kind of gets lost. Perhaps it is because he wanted to tell a story that had little to do with the 87th Precinct, a story about counterfeiters and spies and terrorists. The novel begins rather oddly on a dirt runway in the American Southwest, and the 87th Precinct detectives don't even show up until the book is well underway. They take a back seat for much of the ensuing narrative, while McBain focuses his attentions on one of his more interesting villains, a nasty coked-out drug dealer named Wiggy The Lid, and a white-shoe publishing house where all is not as it seems.<br /><br />Even this gets tangled up, however. I'm not sure I understand what happened in the novel, why this person did that, but as best I can tell, the pieces don't all connect in the end the way these books usually do. The resolution feels muddy. There's some noises made about government conspiracies, which frankly reeks of Oliver Stone paranoia but grabs you all the same, then it's just dropped without further mention. \\"Money, Money, Money\\" feels like an experiment, at times a worthy one, but as a novel it's more than a den of lions can chew on.<br /><br />The introduction of a terrorist subplot is notable. The copyright of \\"Money, Money, Money\\" is 2001, and I suspected McBain threw the subplot in because of a wish to acknowledge 9/11. Yet \\"Money, Money, Money\\" hit the bookstores earlier that summer, which renders his take on a group of al-Qaeda operatives plotting to detonate a bomb in a concert hall rather eerie. \\"We are teaching them we can strike anywhere, anytime,\\" the terrorist leader explains. \\"We are telling them they are completely vulnerable.\\"<br /><br />More eerie is the fact this subplot has no apparent purpose in the novel. It doesn't connect with the other plot threads, except that it seems this particular al-Qaeda group has the benefit of counterfeit cash in funding their deadly work. McBain just throws the terrorist plot in there, it seems, because he sensed it was something important that needed to be dealt with. He was right, of course.<br /><br />But \\"Money, Money, Money\\" is not a better book for this Nostradamian turn. It's certainly interesting, vibrant, readable, at times funny, with Fat Ollie Weeks, the miserably uncouth and bigoted cop, getting more center-stage attention than usual. Reading \\"87th Precinct\\" novels is always worthwhile, and this is no exception. But this is no standout, either, however elevated its ambitions.opyright of \\"Money, Money, Money\\" is 2001, and I suspected McBain threw the subplot in because of a wish to acknowledge 9/11.

If not for the fact readers of the McBain crime procedural series have developed a bond with the 87th Precinct detectives, this narrative imbalance might pose more of a problem. Instead, it works well, sneaking up and pulling on your attention like a treacherous undertow.<br /><br />Bert Kling has a problem. He's married to a beautiful model, only now he is aware there may be more going on in her life than he previously knew. A comment by a drunk girl at a party makes him wonder if she's having an affair, and Kling eventually decides to use his detective skills to find out, despite warnings from his partner, Steve Carella, to talk it out with her instead.<br /><br />\\"Carella could have told him that in any marriage there was a line either partner could not safely cross,\\" McBain writes. \\"Once you stepped over that line, once you said or did something that couldn't possibly be taken back, the marriage was irretrievable.\\"<br /><br />But Kling has to know, though, and so does the reader. McBain strings you along in two different ways, one by giving us a strong idea right away of what is going on but stirring just enough doubt to muddy the waters, and second and even more successfully, by having Kling compromise his police ethics in search of the truth. Like McBain says, there are lines of privacy in life, and crossing over them can be destructive. But there are prices to be paid for not crossing those lines, too.<br /><br />There's also a killer hunting Kling, not adequately developed in the short space of the book but leading to some interesting moments, particularly as this begins to intersect with Kling's own investigation of his wife.<br /><br />The main business of this novel, the investigation by Carella into the apparent suicide of an alcoholic artist, is a well-thought-out crime drama with some arresting incongruities, but it is almost too sedate to keep pace with either of the Kling subplots. If it was a suicide, the guy didn't leave a note, and that, McBain writes, \\"was like a pastrami sandwich without a pickle.\\" So Carella talks to several people who knew the artist, none of whom are surprised or sorry the man is dead.<br /><br />This would probably rate a good \\"Columbo\\" episode on its own. Again, McBain here introduces the question of whether to believe the worst in people (though for Carella, unlike Kling, it is his job to thoroughly eliminate the possibility of murder.) Since the wife is a key suspect, it also opens up the question of marital loyalty (How well do we know the people who share our lives, really?) in a way similar to the Kling subplot.<br /><br />McBain was beginning to carve out some exciting new ground for the 87th Precinct, in terms of the lives of the characters and the city they serve, and the 1980s would see many of the best novels in the series, like \\"Ice,\\" \\"Poison,\\" \\"Tricks,\\" and \\"Lullaby.\\" If \\"Heat\\" isn't quite in their category, it still is a standout for its probing treatment of Kling and his marital torments, an overture for the deeper psychodramas to come.congruities, but it is almost too sedate to keep pace with either of the Kling subplots.

Nesbitt, leader of a gang on a killing spree.<br /><br />As a time capsule, \\"Hail To The Chief\\" is a sometimes interesting read. As a police procedural, it's weak. The leader of the \\"Yankee Rebels\\" (one of many symbolic nods to Nixon perfidy) Nesbitt is presented to us as a guy elected to his second term in office, fighting a war he inherited without much enthusiasm but that he is intends to finish because, as he piously insists, he is a man of peace. \\"I pray to God every night that I'll always do the right thing,\\" Nesbitt insists.<br /><br />McBain has at Nixon both in terms of Watergate, then blowing up but still a year away from its final resolution with Nixon's resignation, and particularly with U.S. troops in Vietnam, just then being brought back home. The opening scene, of men, women, and an infant lying in a ditch, deliberately conjures up the My Lai massacre and similar atrocities which Nixon was seen by many to be complicit in, even though My Lai took place during the previous administration. You keep waiting for Nesbitt to tell someone he is not a crook. He doesn't, but that's about the only button McBain misses.<br /><br />Subtlety is not his goal here, nor is humor. Both are missed. While McBain criminals can be quite deep and multi-faceted (more than the cops often) it quickly becomes clear to anyone reading this novel that Nesbitt is a knuckle-dragging moral leper, a boil on the face of humanity, unable to see beyond his own colossal egotism. When he condemns his fellow gang member's girlfriend (a character named Midge, based on the wife of John Mitchell who talked to reporters during the height of the Watergate investigation) to what becomes her doom, he insists that there is no blood on his hands. He only gave the orders. [Cue the Nazi marching music here.]<br /><br />As a polemic, McBain offers meat to chew on. But \\"Hail To The Chief\\" is a police procedural featuring the 87th Precinct, and it's an ill-fit seeing the familiar environs of Isola playing host to a doctrinaire political parable. McBain had been writing about gang violence since the first 87th Precinct novel two decades before, and before that, under his real name Evan Hunter in the classic \\"Blackboard Jungle.\\" Maybe he wanted to jazz up the old formula. But the Yankee Rebels can't work as satire if they don't work in the reader's mind as a real gang, and they don't. For example, how Nesbitt, a pious, paranoid blowhard with a marked aversion to obscenities, sex, and drugs, got to command a street gang is never explained.<br /><br />It's sometimes fun to pick up on the Nixon references. Nesbitt has a bug installed in one of his rivals' headquarters, known as \\"Gateside\\" rather than \\"Watergate.\\" His chief negotiator is called \\"Doc,\\" (i.e. Dr. Kissinger) and he works on a policy of triangulation against two rival gangs much like China and the Soviet Union. In the end, Nesbitt is done in by his own paranoia, and it's something of a credit to McBain he seems to beat Woodward and Bernstein to Watergate's conclusion.<br /><br />But the book just doesn't work as crime fiction. There is no mystery to solve here, just dead bodies lying around and a gang too drunk on bloodletting to cover its tracks. By the time Nesbitt explains how his \\"second term as president\\" was his mandate for seeking peace through strength, we got the point long ago. One good thing about Nixon resigning the next year - it meant McBain had to go back to writing about real crime.But \\"Hail To The Chief\\" is a police procedural featuring the 87th Precinct, and it's an ill-fit seeing the familiar environs of Isola playing host to a doctrinaire political parable.

If I had any kind of life, I might resent the time this novel extracted from it to afflict me with its arch, dark-gray worldview.<br /><br />I know, I know. Being that I didn't go to an Ivy League college, don't visit the Guggenheim for relaxation, or work out while listening to atonal music, I probably had little chance making any headway here. Don DeLillo is just out of my league. I'm like an ant trying to learn brain surgery reading this book.<br /><br />So here's what happens, as best I can figure. A college professor named Gladney who chairs a department on Hitler studies in a nameless college finds he has contracted a strange contamination and finds himself unable to face the prospect of his death. He is befriended by a visiting professor who wants to form his own academic discipline around Elvis. Meanwhile, his wife takes these strange pills, and assorted children run about, having hyperliterate conversations about nucleotides and the perils of sugarless gum.<br /><br />The point of the novel, as best I can figure, is that we are all surrounded by waves and waves of meaningless sounds, images, and information designed to prop us up through our brief sojourns along this mortal highway. \\"We need an occasional catastrophe to break up the incessant bombardment of information,\\" one of Gladney's colleagues says, before they get one courtesy of an \\"airborne toxic event\\" that afflicts Gladney with his sad condition.<br /><br />Sad, except you never buy any of these people as real. Instead, they seem two-dimensional philosophic constructs designed to trot out some of DeLillo's often fascinating but always depressing ideas about the nature of man in a Godless universe. I couldn't get close to any of these people, not that I didn't try.<br /><br />There are those like the New York Times reviewer who describe \\"White Noise\\" as comic, and there are some archly amusing lines. One professor congratulates Gladney thusly: \\"Nobody on the faculty of any college or university in this part of the country can so much as utter the word Hitler without a nod in your direction, literally or metaphorically...He is now your Hitler, Gladney's Hitler. It must be deeply satisfying for you.\\" That's irony, in case you didn't guess, even more pronounced because the speaker's Jewish.<br /><br />\\"White Noise\\" is certainly surreal. When a plane is about to crash, the voice on the address system informs the passengers: \\"We're a silver gleaming death machine.\\" People fleeing the deadly cloud complain about the lack of media coverage. A friend of one of the children plans to insert himself in a glass cage with deadly mambas for 70 hours, to break the world record. There are moments of amusement, more dry chuckles than anything else. Certainly not engagement.<br /><br />I've read a couple of other DeLillo novels and liked them. \\"Underworld\\" was also surreal, but I cared more about the characters and the situations they found themselves in. \\"Libra\\" is a solid examination of the Kennedy assassination, a tour de force of imaginative historical reconstruction.<br /><br />But I found \\"White Noise\\" a mess. If you find otherwise, congratulations. Just don't say I didn't warn you.y of any college or university in this part of the country can so much as utter the word Hitler without a nod in your direction, literally or metaphorically...He is now your Hitler, Gladney's Hitler.

There's also a murder, of three restaurant employees who raped a woman and then beat the rap.<br /><br />The Matthew Hope books, which seem to have been brought to a close by McBain in 1998 with the release of \\"The Last Best Hope,\\" was an excursion on the other side of the criminal justice system by McBain, writer of the \\"87th Precinct\\" series of police procedurals. It was a detour in tone, in tempo, in setting, and in character, but for some reason, the Hope novels I read never seemed to benefit from this fresh approach. Unlike the \\"87th Precinct\\" books he was writing concurrently, McBain seemed to plot these ones by the numbers, with little interest in what made people tick, until it came to a romantic situation. Then his focus would bore in on cute meets, long walks on the beach, and post-coital cuddles of quiet satisfaction. Often he throws in lovers of different ethnic backgrounds, showing what a liberated guy he is and all that. Meanwhile the killer continues to kill and the reader gets frustrated. Love makes the world go round, but it is more likely to make a good mystery go down the drain.<br /><br />The mystery here, published in 1990, is one of McBain's weakest. It's not terribly clever in its set-up, and an attempt to set up a red herring is transparent. Hope seems unable to see things about his client, the jailed husband of the raped woman awaiting trial for the murders, and those closest to him which any mystery-versed reader will pick up on fast. At one point, when finally confronting the killer, he does so in a stupid, self-exposing way, without backup, despite the fact he knows someone else doing the same thing ended up losing his life.<br /><br />The romances, picked up suddenly in the middle of the narrative, aren't resolved in any way. About the only thing unique is that one of the romances doesn't wind its way into the bedroom, as the couple want to take things slow for a while. The woman, it turns out, is a virgin, which makes her quite an exotic female in the McBain canon.<br /><br />But this book is not for McBain virgins, or you may lose interest in reading his other, and for the most part, much better books. Then you really would be losing out on something.the same thing ended up losing his life.<br /><br />The romances, picked up suddenly in the middle of the narrative, aren't resolved in any way.

This is one of the more notable ones, if rather obscure.<br /><br />\\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane\\" has been out of print for a long time, and the movie it was later made into, \\"The Ninth Configuration,\\" while celebrated, is decidedly in the cult category. But the recent release of a \\"Ninth Configuration\\" DVD seems to have stirred up a little more excitement, judging from the reaction it is getting on this website, and maybe more people will be moved, as I was, to special order the novel it all sprang from.<br /><br />Whether or not it's worth it is another question. \\"The Ninth Configuration\\" is my all-time favorite film, and even I had a tough time reading \\"Twinkle.\\" Not because it's not good, or packed with the same philosophically probing, gut-wrenchingly hilarious dialogue that makes the film so special. But it's a choppy narrative, lacking the sense of mood and character that enriches the movie. I've only read one other William Peter Blatty book, \\"Demons Five, Exorcists Nothing,\\" which was terrible, so maybe he's the rare storyteller who works better on screen than on the page. But I'd rather view this as an interesting rough draft of the project that would become a true classic in its film version.<br /><br />\\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Killer Kane,\\" published in 1966, may be one of the first novels to ever explore the theme of madness in the time of the Vietnam War. Blatty doesn't make the connection until the novel is more than half over, and it's not one he leans on too strongly (he would in the movie), but he certainly was onto something there, and should get points for that alone.<br /><br />Otherwise, the book works for me mostly in the form of showing the many paths Blatty's imagination was taking as he thought through the story. There are some striking variations in the story we have here versus what we see in \\"The Ninth Configuration.\\" The central character, Col. Kane, is more active and vocal a presence in the book, and you really can appreciate what Blatty (and actor Stacy Keach) did with the character onscreen to make him more of an enigma. Same with Dr. Fell, who was played so well by Ed Flanders in the film, but is bland and off-putting in the novel. He has little to do with Kane in the book, and would be improved upon vastly on film.<br /><br />The dialogue is loopier at times, and not always in a good way, but there are some recognizable passages for fans of the movie.<br />\\"If God exists, he is a fink.\\"<br /><br />\\"A fink?\\"<br /><br />\\"Or a foot. An omnipresent, omnipotent Foot! Do you think that is blasphemous?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes,\\" said Kane. \\"I do.\\"<br /><br />\\"I believe I capitalized the 'F'.\\"<br /><br />That one got me laughing out loud, as did some other lines rewritten or excised in the film.<br /><br />The concerns of the book, as with the film, is the existence or non-existence of God and the problem of evil in the world. There are some odd detours, though. The old house being used by the military to house lunatic veterans once belonged to a Bela Legosi-type movie actor, not the aristocrat mentioned in the movie, and there's a subplot involving the actor's legacy in a secret part of the estate. There's also some business involving a cost-conscious senator which seems to belong in a New Yorker cartoon. More to the point of the story that survives in \\"The Ninth Configuration,\\" some of the asylum patients seem to have swapped identities.<br /><br />I liked reading this book, and recommend it to others who love the film, even though they may find it as inchoate and choked with bad comic rimshots as I did. Blatty uses adverbs too much, and words like \\"scruted,\\" but his gift for witty dialogue is evident. There are also sections where he works in some ideas left out of the movie which I found rather moving, and deepened my appreciation for what he was after.<br /><br />\\"We're all miscast - one way or another,\\" Kane says at one point. \\"Being born into this world: that's the ultimate miscasting.\\"<br /><br />This is a bit of a miscasting job, too, since it only came alive in screen form, but because it gave life to a great movie, I have to feel some gratitude. Life can be a brutal voyage, but having fellow passengers like Mr. Blatty makes for a more endurable ride.t one point. \\"Being born into this world: that's the ultimate miscasting.\\"<br /><br />This is a bit of a miscasting job, too, since it only came alive in screen form, but because it gave life to a great movie, I have to feel some gratitude.

Hence the title.<br /><br />Diving in, you might think \\"The Frumious Bandersnatch\\" is one of the 87th's more comic outings, given its goofy name and the focus on the cult of celebrity surrounding this particular case. It's not especially intriguing as mysteries go. The singer is plucked off a yacht by a pair of masked intruders just as she finishes a lip-synched dance routine for a music industry crowd and a local TV news camera team. It takes 50 pages for the crime to occur, then another 100 pages for the kidnappers to call with their demands, while McBain lavishes his attention on the music industry and our culture of complaint. 87th Precinct detective Steve Carella finds himself used as an errand boy by a joint FBI/police task force, while the rest of the precinct is left on ice.<br /><br />McBain does use one interesting character I haven't seen before, a former police academy buddy of Carella's named Corcoran who runs the police side of the task force and has gotten too big for his britches in his new post, ordering his old friend around and insisting on being called \\"lieutenant.\\" This bit of intraservice rivalry is well played out, especially when the 87th jumps into action late in the book to try and break the case ahead of the task force.<br /><br />But there's not much else to be said for \\"Bandersnatch.\\" It has a remarkably sour conclusion for the jocular set-ups, as if we aren't expected to care about any of the characters McBain has taken such pains in sketching. The familiar faces of the 87th Precinct seem a fey bunch now. About the only character other than Carella that McBain lingers on is the crude bigot Ollie Weeks, who works out of another precinct. In the last book, \\"Fat Ollie's Book,\\" we watched him try to write a novel and begin to romance a patrolwoman of Puerto Rican extraction. This time, McBain foregoes any crimesolving role for Weeks and just plays out their romance, a first for the 87th series and not a successful one. Meanwhile, 87th Precinct detective Cotton Hawes starts a romance with a television news reporter. It's a little disconcerting watching the book series that gave lessons to \\"Hill Street Blues\\" and \\"CSI\\" suddenly aping \\"Friends,\\" but that's what's here.<br /><br />For the last few books, McBain has been moving away from the standard 87th Precinct formula, maybe because he's seen it imitated too often. There's nothing wrong with experimenting; sometimes, as with \\"Fat Ollie's Book,\\" it pays off. But I'd like a new 87th Precinct novel that starts with Homicide dicks Monoghan and Monroe making bad jokes over a body waiting for the ME to pronounce it dead, puts Eileen Burke in harm's way as a decoy prostitute, nearly allows Andy Parker to botch everything, and gives Meyer Meyer something more to do than sip coffee. That's the way it used to be, when the series was great. McBain has lost none of his wit or punch, but he could do with more engagement. Maybe a trip back to square one is in order.at McBain lingers on is the crude bigot Ollie Weeks, who works out of another precinct.

After all, it takes a gifted writer to write prose as bad as McBain produces on behalf of one of his less noble fictional creations, Detective First Grade Oliver Wendell Weeks. Weeks figures if he solves the crimes, what's the trick in making one up on paper and getting it on the best seller's lists? Not only does he have a well-worn list of \\"how-tos\\" for creating crime fiction (\\"BE SURE TO AVOID AMBIGUITY\\"), he's been doing his homework surveying the marketplace by reading Amazon.com reviews.<br /><br />Clearly this guy is in trouble...<br /><br />Weeks has been floating around McBain's 87th Precinct novels for a while, and now he gets center stage. Though he's with the 88th Precinct, and much disliked by the 87th Precinct detectives (and many readers) because of his nasty manner and blunt racist approach to life, he's still a decent detective.<br /><br />Weeks kind of works as a protagonist only if you are playing it for laughs, and McBain is here. \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" is one of the more comic 87th Precinct offerings. People still die, and others mourn, but this time there's more emphasis on laughs, incongruity, and malaprops, particularly when it comes to Weeks' novel. He decides it should star someone like himself (maybe not quite as fat) but female, since he discovers women buy more mysteries than men.<br /><br />It's not exactly like Weeks transforms himself into Phil Donohue. His opus, \\"Report To The Commissioner,\\" includes references to the narrator's ample bust and what a hot dish she is in general. She's writing from a locked room, you see, waiting for someone to kill her, and the first thing she wants you to know is there's a run in her stockings...<br /><br />Then someone steals his manuscript, and Weeks goes on the warpath to get it back.<br /><br />As a crime drama, \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" is problematic. There's a couple of cases being worked on in tandem with Ollie's crisis, neither which holds much interest. The other detectives, like Steve Carella and Bert Kling, go through their paces but don't manage anything particularly interesting this time around. A problem with this book is that Weeks is probably the most colorful character anyway, and pushing him up to the foreground, especially as entertainingly as this, makes the others pale by comparison.<br /><br />But as a crime comedy, \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" is a nice reminder of a key reason so many of us visit the 87th Precinct: McBain's one funny writer, and he can spin a yarn.<br /><br />Pity poor Ollie can't. But at least he can dance, play \\"Night And Day\\" on the piano, and come up for a derogatory epithet for anyone else on the planet.m with Ollie's crisis, neither which holds much interest.

Ed McBain, Hunter's best-known pseudonym, is the author of the 87th Precinct crime novels. \\"Candyland\\" is a McBain crime novel, too, about the murder of a hooker. But it is also a Hunter portrait, of a man suspected of killing her.<br /><br />Ed McBain novels are especially interesting when they stray from the 87th Precinct. \\"Downtown,\\" a dark comedy of a man lost in the big bad city a la \\"After Hours\\" but with a body count and better jokes, was up there with Elmore Leonard's finest. \\"The Sentries\\" was a bizarre Cold War paranoia tale with a remarkably downbeat and unpleasant tone for airport fiction. \\"Candyland\\" is a brilliant and clever detour from the fictional environs of the 87th Precinct's Isola to the reality of New York City, and one of his best crime stories yet.<br /><br />The tone is the same as in the 87th Precinct novels, dark and funny and acutely sensitive to how police officers operate. In the second half of the novel, the criminal investigation part written by \\"McBain,\\" two detectives have a problem questioning a witness. The guy turns to the woman after they are done:<br /><br />\\" `We ought to arrange some signals we can use. If we are going to be working together any amount of time. Like if I touch my nose, for example, it'll mean you're Good Cop, I'm Bad Cop. Or if I call you Em instead of Emma...'<br /><br />\\" `I told you I don't like being called Em.'<br /><br />\\" `That's just what I'm saying. If I call you Em in front of somebody we're questioning, that'll mean Don't go there. Same as if you call me James. Don't go there, leave it be, shift the topic to something else.'\\"<br /><br />The female detective here, Emma Boyle, is an interesting creation. She's not the typical gorgeous McBain dame with a positive mental outlook on life and love, but somewhat squirrelly and resentful. She's had a hard time with her brother officers, and she's having a hard time with her ex-husband, a rich philanderer keeping her child from her on a shabby pretext. She blames him for \\"raping\\" her during the last two years of their marriage, because his affair meant their marriage sex took place under false pretenses.<br /><br />Sex is what it's about for these vice cops, and that's what the initial half of the novel, or the first novella, written by Hunter, is all about, too; a profile of a day in the life of a man with a problem he is unwilling to control. This is Benjamin Thorpe, successful architect who becomes a murder suspect in the second half of the book. Again, the writing here is subtle, detailing in matter-of-fact prose just how far gone this forty-something architect named Benjamin Thorpe has gone in pursuit of orgasms. Some reviewers here say Hunter's descriptions of Thorpe's activities cross the line into porn. It is certainly intense writing, but more cautionary than erotic, more ugly than graphic, designed to make Thorpe's desires read as the sickness-inspired impulses rather than vicariously thrilling to the reader.<br /><br />Some people claim they knew how this was going to turn out, but I was fooled. Does the dual nature of \\"Candyland\\" work? Better than expected. The two-novella conjunction plays off very well, the two-author format even more so. The different approaches of the writer (just-the-facts McBain versus the deeper and more psychological territory of Hunter) dovetail nicely. In the end, you have a story with but one central character, that being Eros Unbound, and what it does to distend the mind and distort the character. It's dark and heavy, but never dull, and the story stays with you after it's over.e typical gorgeous McBain dame with a positive mental outlook on life and love, but somewhat squirrelly and resentful.

As he wrote in a funny introduction to the Armchair Detective Library edition, he wanted to get it done before some house guests arrived, and almost managed to do so.<br /><br />It's an unusual 87th entry for several reasons. Those expecting lots of violence and profanity will be surprised by how tame this reads compared to later editions.<br /><br />It's the only 87th novel I've read where Steve Carella was not the main investigator, as Cotton Hawes, a background character in other volumes, strides to the fore. Most notably, there is a very compressed time frame in this book, just over 12 hours from the time a mysterious boy hands a note to the 87th's desk sergeant that states someone's plans to kill \\"The Lady\\" to when the note says the killing will take place.<br /><br />I have a hard time believing that the Isola crime lab would or could respond so quickly to what seems a likely crank note, developing prints and precisely identifying paste and paper. Also, the resolution was unsatisfactory. The would-be killer, who we get shadowy glimpses of before the full reveal, seems to be one type of person before we find out he's another. Maybe Ed just didn't like keeping his guests waiting, but a couple more days would have helped make for a better resolution.<br /><br />But the pace of this book is great. It has a real kind of moment-by-moment vibrancy with assorted diverting detours like the hunt for the mysterious kid and various leads on who \\"The Lady\\" might be. While reading it, you don't want to do much of anything else. Food and bathroom breaks seem unwarranted intrusions. Maybe it's because the book is such a tight read, at well under 200 pages, but it feels like a really good episode of \\"Law And Order\\" or \\"24,\\" though you'd have to call it \\"12\\" instead.<br /><br />Add to that McBain's wicked sense of humor, his canny ear for dialogue, and his brilliance in observed detail, and you have a recipe for a terrific crime fiction read. Too bad he didn't finish what he started, but maybe you will find the ending more satisfying than I did.or, his canny ear for dialogue, and his brilliance in observed detail, and you have a recipe for a terrific crime fiction read.

It's a very enveloping and informative look at some of the compelling personalities who helped shape two key forms of American popular music, the blues and rock 'n' roll.<br /><br />It's not a comprehensive history; Guralnick instead offers some individual, detailed portraits. You can understand him choosing Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Jerry Lee Lewis, because they were all giant figures in the creation of these genres. But other choices are more idiosyncratic, like Johnny Shines, described as \\"a run-of-the-mill blues singer\\" by the co-founder of landmark label Chess Records; and Robert Pete Williams, who seems to merge blues with free associative verse and would never be more than a footnote character in most histories. And what's with including Charlie Rich, who had a brief association with rock's founding via Sun Records but never really established himself as either a blues or rock performer?<br /><br />Guralnick never does tie any of this in; his pieces, however intended to cohere, feel like collected articles written for music magazines. I don't know that they have to be read in order and one after the other, like chapters of a book.<br /><br />But individually they are good, in most cases very good. Guralnick is an unusual departure from rock writers. He writes with singular care; with craft, honesty, and an engaging sense of humility that draws the reader in. He doesn't make broad claims for anyone's greatness, or dismiss others out of hand. He takes himself out of the picture, and makes it feel like you are the one in the room listening to Shines talking about traveling moonlit country roads with Robert Johnson, looking for a barrelhouse or gin joint to make a few bucks in.<br /><br />Or Williams, sitting in his country home alongside a dirt road, portraits of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King over his head, drinking away the afternoon and wondering if his inability to pick out a tune at times is because maybe \\"blues is evil.\\"<br /><br />\\"God is warning me, I've got to get myself straight,\\" Williams tells Guralnick. \\"And yet still and all I don't know, something hits me and I feel peculiar, I might be riding along, say now you get in your car and ride, well the ideas just come to me out of the air. Why is that? What made me think of that?\\"<br /><br />Traditional blues music was in trouble by the time of this book's publication, in 1971. Guralnick visits Chess Records and finds a record company about to collapse. It's perhaps symbolic that when Guralnick introduces us to Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, both men are laid up sick in bed. Perhaps an earlier look would have offers a more vibrant take. But Guralnick gets the most out of what he finds.<br /><br />The best essays are on Wolf, who relishes comments about his \\"gargantuan\\" onstage theatricality but exposes a thin skin on other fronts; and Rich, who seems so out-of-water here except for the engaging candor from him and his wife. Rich's drinking problems and lonely sadness are the main focus of his essay, yet Rich not only cooperated with the author, he ended up inspired enough by it to write a song using the book's title. It's the best essay in that you feel for the guy; then again, they're all like that.<br /><br />I don't know that much more about Skip James or Muddy Waters from reading this book, but I know enough now not to duck off in the other direction when I hear their names spoken of.

Carella and Meyer to solve the crime.<br /><br />The first page introduces the murder scene, and from there on the plot twists and suspicious characters accumulate with bullet-train velocity. The detectives find out another B&E (breaking and entering) occurred in another apartment in this building, and chase the burglar believed responsible, while a lapis pendant found at the scene is overlooked for the moment but will assume greater significance.<br /><br />By the 1980s, people were overlooking the 87th Precinct a little, while McBain himself pumped out one great book after another, finding something a little different to bring out about the precinct territory and the nature of hard crime each time. It's been said McBain writes not \\"whodunits\\" but \\"whydunits,\\" and \\"Lullaby\\" is a classic \\"whydunit,\\" but it also works as a standard police procedural.<br /><br />There's a second plot that introduces a new group of bad guys, members of a Jamaican drug \\"posse\\" who tangle with Det. Kling after he interrupts three of them in the middle of a hit on a Hispanic rival. The storyline actually takes us through a parade of ethnic nationalities, each representing a major force in the underworld, in a way that allows McBain full vent for his political incorrect dialogue and humor as he throws them up against each other. When it's all over, and only one group is left standing, the boss decides it's \\"all a matter of which is the oldest culture.\\"<br /><br />This second story is fun, but it's less integrated thematically and in plot with the other story than is typical for McBain, it moves a bit baroquely and the conflict with Kling is not resolved in a satisfying manner. The first story is the main one, and it moves with force and deftness, but the reveal of the killer striking about 30 pages short of the end read like a mistake to me. Otherwise, it keeps you guessing, as much about motive as identity (who would kill an infant?), and that is a huge part of the story's success.<br /><br />Until then, it works almost as well as a psychological thriller as it does a murder mystery. In order to solve the crime, the detectives have to get inside the mind of someone who killed a child. Even for hardened investigators, this is not an easy place to be. The theme of lost innocence, prefigured by the title, is everywhere in this story, in such details as the lapis pendant, a fugitive who seeks shelter and companionship from his former babysitter, and an old man dying in Washington State.<br /><br />It's hard to say any book that features a dead baby is funny, and certainly McBain handles this sensitive subject with grace and finesse. But the mourning tone does not detract from enjoying the book as a satisfying crime drama, and as a prime representation of a crime fiction master at his best.short of the end read like a mistake to me.

US	50230169	R2PQ243WKFXB4M	9993939056	326809904	Tricks	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Tricks Is Treat	Ed McBain was on something of a roll while writing his 87th Precinct novels in the 1980s. For years they had been very good, but in his fourth decade of defining and detailing the seedy underworld of the mythical Northeastern U.S. city of Isola, something was clicking like never before.<br /><br />There were great classic crime dramas, like \\"Ice\\" and \\"Poison,\\" taut psychological thrillers like \\"Lullaby,\\" and then this, 1987's \\"Tricks,\\" which is hard to classify but perhaps the most entertaining of all 87th Precinct novels. While other 87th Precinct novels have major and minor storylines, \\"Tricks\\" presents us with three very different central plots. All are cleverly connected to the deceptively simple title, a McBain trademark: There's a magician who disappeared as part of his big finale during a show and seems to be turning up in pieces around the city. There's a group of trick-or-treaters shooting up liquor stores and then vanishing into the night in their innocent-looking children's disguises. Then there's undercover detective Eileen Burke, looking for \\"tricks\\" of another kind, namely those slashing prostitutes to death in Isola's dangerous Canal Zone.<br /><br />Each story works in a different way. The one with the undercover cop is a suspense story focused on Burke, a recovering rape victim who is probably McBain's best female creation. The one with the missing magician is a nicely-crafted mystery that caught me in the end by complete surprise. The trick-or-treater story, bloody as it is, is funny as well in a brutal Quentin Tarantino sort of way.<br /><br />It's nice to have this book not as three good short stories, though they are that, but as a glimpse of detectives in action during a particularly bloody and strange Halloween. The sequences work off of each other in tandem, forming a kind of rhythm that gels into something bigger than any one of the stories. There's long sections of dialogue set in the precinct house where conversations about two different cases are alternately quoted and blended one into the other without identifying the speakers. Writer's vanity? Perhaps, but it works at establishing both tension and dramatic pace.<br /><br />There's also McBain's trademark humor. At one crime scene where part of a human torso is found in a garbage can, a homicide detective regales a visibly sickened colleague. \\"You won't need an ambulance for this one...All you need is a shopping bag.\\"<br /><br />The medical examiner arrives. \\"What have we got here?\\" he asks.<br /><br />\\"Just this chest here,\\" the homicide detective replies.<br /><br />\\"Very nice. Do you want me to pronounce it dead, or what?\\"<br /><br />And then there's Andy Parker's eventful Halloween night out, at a party with a onetime murder witness he has the hots for which turns out to be less of a break from duty than he expects. Parker's a funny and rich character here, not the 87th's finest but not someone you can pigeonhole as a miserable failure, either. You actually root for him here despite yourself.<br /><br />Even the minor characters breathe in \\"Tricks.\\" At one point, two detectives visit two old guys at a school at night, a custodian and his checker-playing buddy. It's an inconsequential scene in the narrative, but McBain still fills out some five pages with tiny details that add color, interest, and life. The custodian thinks the cops are on to him stealing school supplies. He mops his brow. The cops wonder what he is hiding. The checkers buddy explains he is a widower who has nothing better to do. The vignette ends, and so it goes.<br /><br />It's hard enough to end one good story in a satisfactory way. How McBain manages to do it so brilliantly in triplicate boggles the mind. With the lack of a clear central focus, this may not be the most representative of 87th Precinct novels, but it is very enjoyable and even a non-crime fiction fan will likely savor and marvel at its many twists and turns.ases are alternately quoted and blended one into the other without identifying the speakers.

You stared up at it in something like awe, and sometimes you caught your breath because the view was one of majestic splendor...\\"<br /><br />Thus in 1955 Ed McBain begins his first-ever 87th Precinct crime novel, \\"Cop Hater.\\" But before you start worrying if he's turning into Walt Whitman, he breaks off his rumination of urban beauty with this kicker: \\"There was garbage in the streets.\\"<br /><br />And thank goodness for the garbage, or else we wouldn't need the bulls of the 87th Precinct to clean it up.<br /><br />\\"Cop Hater\\" reads like pulp fiction, perhaps because that was the genre Evan Hunter, the real-life writer responsible for the McBain pseudonym, worked in. \\"Cop Hater\\" was a unique sort of novel all the same, because as Hunter writes in his new introduction, it presented as a protagonist/hero not so much a central character (though here as elsewhere in the series, Det. Steve Carella is the main figure on the case) as a police squad room. McBain spends a lot of time depicting the squad room in this book, dwelling on physical details that he would gloss over in future volumes. This time at least, he and his readers were venturing into unusual territory.<br /><br />For those familiar with the 87th Precinct stories, there are plenty of recognizable signposts: Carella's slanting eyes, long and ominous descriptions of the weather, McBain's obsession with the ethnic make-up of his characters and the WASPy prejudices of others (one witness tells Carella she would prefer to tell her story to an \\"American\\" detective after realizing he's of Italian ancestry.) You can see the mainstay elements taking shape, which makes this a must-read for fans.<br /><br />The bare bones nature of the crime itself (a series of killings targeting 87th Precinct detectives) may leave readers used to juicier 87th Precinct plotlines wanting more. The language of the streets is considerably cleaner and less realistic than later volumes. Bert Kling is not a detective yet. Andy Parker and Meyer Meyer have yet to arrive.<br /><br />But it's a nice introduction to the 87th Precinct, a tough, merciless world of bad people, good people, and lots of grey in-betweeners. The cast of detectives at the Eight-Seven include a few who aren't around later, like Carella's first partner, who has some issues at home that seem to be distracting his work effort. Another is the precinct commander, an out-of-it old-timer named Frick who \\"was a tired man when he was 20\\" and shrugs his way through the violence around him.<br /><br />There's a nosy, unscrupulous reporter named Savage who makes trouble pestering gang members but insists he serves the community. McBain works in a resonant feeling of the times, the mid-1950s where open windows were the most common form of tenement air conditioning and the most dangerous juvenile weaponry were homemade \\"zip guns.\\"<br /><br />One of the good things about \\"Cop Hater\\" is the center story is simple and resolved in a satisfying manner. Another is that the story leaves you wanting more. Just how much more no one could have predicted in 1955, but considering there's now been 53 87th Precinct novels, \\"Cop Hater\\" probably wasn't a bad idea for a book.realistic than later volumes.

US	50230169	R3JG0NB37L8383	1568363168	212574824	Inside the Oval Office: The White House Tapes from FDR to Clinton	Books	4	6	7	N	Y	Inside The Ultimate Cockpit	It's a little mindblowing to realize such a historical resource exists: Recordings of presidents in the Oval Office discussing matters of state, negotiating with world leaders, and offering often-candidly caustic opinions of their contemporaries.<br /><br />While William Doyle's \\"Inside The Oval Office\\" is subtitled \\"The White House Tapes From FDR To Clinton,\\" this is a misnomer. As others here point out, there's really only a trio of presidents that taped themselves at work with any regularity, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, and four more (Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, and Ford) that did so even at all. Reagan and Clinton both had video crews film some of their formal meetings, but Bush 41 and Carter avoided anything more involved than private diary tapings in recording the doings of their administrations.<br /><br />Despite the uneven nature of this record, Doyle tries his best to analyze each president's administration from a purely executive-managerial level, sometimes using the tapes as a guide but just as often relying on contemporaneous accounts and even interviews with people who were in the room with the various chief executives. The result is some fascinating portraits in miniature of the vastly different leadership styles America have elected to its helm.<br /><br />Doyle manages effective profiles of each man, but delivers the goods best on the ones, not surprisingly, who did the most taping. LBJ verbally bludgeons cowering senators to pass aggressive civil rights legislation and tells a pants manufacturer to give him some slacks with more room for his testicles, employing some decidedly earthy terminology in both instances. Kennedy and his Best and Brightest advisor team listen in on reports from Ole Miss while James Meredith is enrolled as a student there and the campus erupts into a combat zone. Nixon makes bizarre and angry pronouncements, half-commands and half-rantings, urging aides to spy on Kissinger when he suspects his chief diplomat is talking to the press.<br /><br />\\"Even with all their limitations, the Oval Office tapes do offer something no other source can: A real-time record of the presidents as executives in action as they manage the business of American history,\\" Doyle writes.<br /><br />I heard my first Oval Office tape a couple of months ago at whitehousetapes.org, the first one ever made which features FDR holding a press conference in August 1940 and then, after the room is cleared, slyly slipping an aide some dirt on his Republican opponent, Wendell Willkie, apparently having forgotten he was wired for sound. That whole tape, just under an hour, is fascinating listening, even during that sometimes dry press conference where Roosevelt talks about American military preparedness and then apologizes to the lone female reporter before using the term \\"BVD,\\" a brand of men's underwear the troops were being outfitted with.<br /><br />It would have been nice to read about filigree like that in this book, if it had been written as a tour guide of the mounds of tapes out there and all the strange secrets and bits of trivia they contain. You can't listen to all the tapes; Nixon alone made more than 3,000 hours of them. But something attempting to give shape to the vast treasure trove of Presidential tapings would have been more worthy of the title of this book.<br /><br />Please don't read that as a knock: Doyle does write a solid historical overview, complete with voluminous footnotes that should please the scholar as well as the casual reader. He manages the feat of presenting a very political setting in a way that is non-partisan yet zesty. He offers some interesting tidbits about each president you won't find in any other book, particularly Johnson, who agonized about Vietnam long before most anyone else did and was in many ways the Oval Office's most complicated man.<br /><br />\\"He was King Lear, Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, Captain Ahab, Moses, and Grendel, all stuffed into a scratching, belching, blustering, six-foot two-inch 220-plus pound explosive package,\\" as Doyle memorably puts it, yet Johnson was also a passionate humanitarian and patriot who, as caught on tape, once exclaimed the one thing he ever wanted in the world was \\"a little love.\\"<br /><br />A good book, at times very very good, but one with a poorly-chosen subtitle.ing, six-foot two-inch 220-plus pound explosive package,\\" as Doyle memorably puts it, yet Johnson was also a passionate humanitarian and patriot who, as caught on tape, once exclaimed the one thing he ever wanted in the world was \\"a little love.\\"<br /><br />A good book, at times very very good, but one with a poorly-chosen subtitle.	2004-03-31

Or is it a book because it is about something?<br /><br />John Feinstein seems to take the former \\"I write therefore it is\\" approach. As a result, I never quite got what \\"The Majors\\" was about. My fault? I don't think so. I not only \\"got\\" the point of Feinstein's previous golf book, \\"A Good Walk Spoiled,\\" but enjoyed it. That book belongs on any sports lover's shelf, and is worth any novice's time as well.<br /><br />\\"A Good Walk Spoiled\\" is about the lives and trials of the pro golfer. \\"The Majors,\\" despite the title, is about much the same thing, not so much the four events that make up the biggest trophies in pro golf but the elite PGA Tour pros who compete for these titles.<br /><br />Frankly, if you aren't hot for golf, you aren't going to relate to these millionaires and their quest to buck the dread acronym BPNTHWAM (best player never to have won a major) the way you will to the fringe folk and dewsweepers that made up the cast of \\"A Good Walk Spoiled,\\" for whom making the cut was the difference between survival and doom.<br /><br />There are some decent profiles here, like that of Mark O'Meara, who won two of the four majors in 1998, the year of Feinstein's narrative. O'Meara seems affable, but I got no sense of hunger from the guy. Brad Faxon offers some revealing insights, but since he didn't contend for any majors, he seemed a waste of time in the ultimate scheme of the book. A lot of golfers Feinstein profiles are like that. Meanwhile, players who did contend in 1998 majors are skimmed over, like PGA Championship winner Vijay Singh, British Open runner-up Brian Watts, and most crucially, Tiger Woods. Feinstein probably couldn't get the same level of access to these guys he could to those he dotes on, but that shouldn't be the reader's problem, should it?<br /><br />Unlike \\"A Good Walk Spoiled,\\" the writing feels tired. The humor is forced. He throws in some clunky metaphors. A caddy \\"studies the wind the way a political pollster studies trends.\\" Tiger Woods' security entourage are \\"like the guys chasing Butch and Sundance: You could see them coming from miles away.\\" This makes the rote approach to the subject all the more apparent, and enervating.<br /><br />Feinstein seemed to be trading in on the good will he engendered on the pro circuit with \\"A Good Walk Spoiled.\\" That's great, if he gives the reader something for his new access. But whereas \\"Good Walk\\" was a candid and often blunt description of what went on inside the ropes, \\"The Majors\\" seems more an exercise in puffery and back-patting, never more egregious than with Fred Couples, a decent golfer and a good guy who Feinstein blows totally out of proportion in his narrative. Couples doesn't contend except at the Masters, but Feinstein can't let go of him for more than a chapter at a time.<br /><br />The biggest problem about this book is it isn't about the title subject. He doesn't give equal time to the four majors, doesn't really relate any of the day-to-day drama, and offers little insight as to the courses or the final-day fields. He reports the winners, and some key shots, but that's it. If you want majors excitement, read Herbert Warren Wind or \\"Massacre At Winged Foot.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Majors\\" won't interest people who don't care much about golf, and though it has some interesting insights that made it more than a one-star read for me, it's not something that knowledgeable golf readers are going to find that illuminating.a political pollster studies trends.\\" Tiger Woods' security entourage are \\"like the guys chasing Butch and Sundance: You could see them coming from miles away.\\" This makes the rote approach to the subject all the more apparent, and enervating.<br /><br />Feinstein seemed to be trading in on the good will he engendered on the pro circuit with \\"A Good Walk Spoiled.\\" That's great, if he gives the reader something for his new access.

When we meet him in this volume, he is more of a shell than ever, his psyche ripped apart by the terrible fighting he witnessed on Crete. Will he find one last shot at redemption, of ending his own private war in victory rather than defeat?<br /><br />\\"End Of The Battle\\" is the most problematic of Waugh's trilogy. The humor found in the preceding volumes is nearly gone. Key characters are snuffed out without warning. Waugh is bluntly straightforward about what he sees as the chief failing of his own country in war, a failing he saw carried over into the time he wrote this in 1960-61: The lapse of British will in the face of leftist challenge and Soviet domination.<br /><br />There's no way I'd recommend any reader to this book without first getting his or her hands on \\"Men At Arms\\" or \\"Officers And Gentlemen,\\" if not both. \\"End Of The Battle\\" assumes a reader is familiar with the concepts Waugh spent those last two books espousing, the cause of Catholic exceptionalism in the face of mundanity and evil, the slow strangulation of martial spirit by bureaucratic \\"banf,\\" Guy's inability to have children. If you don't care about this stuff going in, Waugh is not going to do much to sell you. He already laid the groundwork in the earlier volumes; \\"End Of The Battle\\" is concerned with resolution.<br /><br />There's many Waugh bete noirs in evidence, some which will no doubt bother many modern readers. Communists and leftists are practically interchangable, and there's a \\"velvet mafia\\" at work, too, homosexuals who toil to undercut democracy and serve Uncle Joe Stalin. Even if this was not at odds with history (the Burgess spy ring members were nearly all gay), Waugh presses his point with unsettling belligerence.<br /><br />What's to be said for a comic novel whose most comic sequence involves a woman's fruitless search for an abortion? Actually, quite a lot. The comedy in \\"End Of The Battle\\" may be largely mirthless, but it is sharp and biting, too. The characterizations of Guy, his father, uncle Peregrine, and Guy's former wife Virginia are layered and involving. Waugh moves his story in unexpected directions, and as he does so, brings the themes and concerns of his trilogy into focus and resolution that, while not always satisfying, have integrity.<br /><br />\\"End Of The Battle\\" reminds me a lot of the Hemingway novel \\"A Farewell To Arms,\\" with the same pathetic tone and the prevailing sense of war's wastefulness even behind the lines. It's a very lived-in book. It also makes for an arresting conclusion to Waugh's last major work of fiction, the \\"Sword Of Honour\\" trilogy, as a kind of existential if not nihilistic book that nevertheless manages to be profoundly spiritual in its focus. At one point, Guy's father explains that winning or losing great conflicts matters less than the salvation of a single soul, and it is this Waugh means for the reader to carry away.<br /><br />Does Waugh do this? A lot depends on your mindset going in, on your ability to go with the often-nasty twists and turns Waugh puts his characters through, and whether you've done your homework reading the previous volumes. Waugh the cynic makes a good case in the end for the presence of grace in this world, but perhaps a better one for how difficult such grace is to achieve.n's fruitless search for an abortion?

Author John Feinstein chronicles the 1994 PGA Tour season through the experiences of several pro golfers, stars like Tom Watson and Davis Love III as well as those trying to make the grade.<br /><br />If you watch pro golf at all, even just occasionally tune in on the final round of a major, this is a book for you. It gives you a taste of why the Tour is so absorbing to those who follow it week-in, week-out. The first 100 pages pull you right in with scenes from two pressure-cooker events from opposite ends of the bell curve: The 1993 Ryder Cup at The Belfry resort in England, where America's best golfers compete with those from Europe for a much-coveted trophy; and Qualifying School, where the wanna-bes vie simply for the chance to compete on tour. Both are nervous narratives, and highly addicting.<br /><br />Feinstein is no elegant prose stylist, but he's not a short-order cook, either. He writes in a deceptively easy-going way, not beating you over the head with all the words he knows or quoting from great works of literature to describe how John Cook felt about trying to make a certain putt. He just puts it all together and makes it gel, sometimes throwing in a clever metaphor. About the weather at the start of the 1994 British Open: \\"Turnberry had the feel of a schoolyard on the first warm day of spring, everyone excited and rejuvenated by the gorgeous weather.\\" On the work ethic of the pros: \\"On any Tuesday and Wednesday on tour, the [driving] range looks like the exchange counter at Macy's on the day after Christmas.\\"<br /><br />Feinstein is even better as an interviewer. From normally taciturn guys he draws out some personal stories worth reading, like Paul Azinger's fight with cancer and how Curtis and Sarah Strange dealt with an unexplained medical condition she had that hobbled her for months. Some nice catty comments, too, like Davis Love's noting the demeanor of tour legends Watson and Jack Nicklaus: \\"I'm sure it's subconscious, but sometimes with those guys you feel as if they have to remind you how great they were because they can't show you anymore.\\"<br /><br />Watson was a revelation for me in this book. He always came off as prickly and distant, but he shared a lot with Feinstein and comes across the better for it. He was still trying to win majors in 1994 at age 44, and coming heartbreakingly close, but maintained a stoic demeanor and a sense of humor throughout.<br /><br />Feinstein is a friendly-enough golfer's Boswell, but not everyone benefits from his pen. John Daly, working through his personal demons in 1994, comes in for some withering criticism, as does Greg Norman, who plans an elitist alternative to the PGA Tour that never gets off the ground. Tiger Woods is conspicuous by his absence, just a single mention near the end.

He always came off as prickly and distant, but he shared a lot with Feinstein and comes across the better for it. He was still trying to win majors in 1994 at age 44, and coming heartbreakingly close, but maintained a stoic demeanor and a sense of humor throughout.<br /><br />Feinstein is a friendly-enough golfer's Boswell, but not everyone benefits from his pen. John Daly, working through his personal demons in 1994, comes in for some withering criticism, as does Greg Norman, who plans an elitist alternative to the PGA Tour that never gets off the ground. Tiger Woods is conspicuous by his absence, just a single mention near the end.

US	50230169	R2YEZPFEGMHHC3	0896218317	780469129	Hold On, Mr. President (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)	Books	2	4	4	N	N	Sam Being Sam	\\"Hold On, Mr. President!\\" is a product of its time, the late 1980s, with Sam Donaldson offering a view from the press trenches on two presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />The index to this book includes the following note, perhaps in jest: \\"There are three names mentioned too often in this book to index: Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, and Sam Donaldson.\\" And not necessarily in that order.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this book. Donaldson was a character of television news when I was growing up, the late 70s and early 80s. Whereas other television newsmen offered various lighter shades of pale, Donaldson was a colorful bulldog, always ready to put the Leader of the Free World on the spot, whether the issue at hand was hostages in Iran or his wife's taste in china. Once Donaldson cornered Reagan when the president was a guest at an ABC function, grilling him about the latest embarrassing kafuffle at the White House. Network higher ups talked of firing him, but Reagan just chuckled: \\"Oh, that's alright, that's just the way Sam is.\\"<br /><br />That's from the first chapter, the best in the book. Donaldson analyzes his role and how he felt he served the causes of democracy and good television. He tells some funny stories, and makes some good points: \\"So when I cover the president, I try to remember two things: First, if you don't ask, you don't find out; and second, the questions don't do the damage. Only the answers do.\\"<br /><br />Donaldson was a good question-asker, too; not needlessly prosecutorial or opinionated like Helen Thomas, not pinheaded and trite like Chris Wallace or countless bottle-blondes. Donaldson had substance.<br /><br />And ego, too. Boy, does that come across here. It could be a drinking game for a non-social drunk. Find two sentences in a row without the words \\"I,\\" \\"me,\\" or \\"Donaldson\\" in it, or else take a slug. Add the words \\"we\\" or \\"our\\" and you'd have an easier time climbing K2.<br /><br />Another problem with this book is it's clearly not the work of a print journalist. There's little depth, even when the subject is the news business itself. That Harry Reasoner was a surly drinker who didn't put forward his best effort is great dish, but Donaldson doesn't do much more than throw that particular skunk out there and let the reader wonder. Jimmy Carter could be brusque, but he cared. Reagan is an amiable dunce, with some moments of clarity, but trapped by his own primitive ideology.<br /><br />I found Donaldson's description of Reagan most interesting, not because I agree with it (I don't) but because it demonstrates the media mindset Reagan had to work through and around in securing the goals of his presidency, clearly the most successful one since FDR's. Donaldson takes Reagan to task for missing out on arms control agreements with the Soviets, noting that one such treaty would have left the U.S. with a decided advantage. But reading later Reagan bios like \\"Role Of A Lifetime\\" and \\"Dutch\\" demonstrates Reagan had vision where Donaldson and the rest wore bifocals. He didn't want to pass limits on nuclear weapons, he wanted to eliminate them, and the world's most dominant tyranny in the process. Donaldson shakes his head at Reagan's use of the term \\"evil empire,\\" but 20 years later it is the majority view Reagan spoke the truth.<br /><br />A shame this book fails to analyze the larger role of the media, including the ups and downs of covering stories that may be hot one day, ice-cold the next. Also, I've yet to read a good book on Frank Reynolds, ABC's sterling anchorman from the late '70s until his death in 1983. A better take of the Reagan White House's relationship with the press, in many ways more critical of Reagan but at least more probing, is Hendrik Smith's \\"The Power Game.\\" Donaldson has some ideas about the future of the media, but they seem inseparable from Donaldson's career goals. He hardly deigns to notice, when discussing the future direction of presidential press coverage,the role of cable television, instead wondering aloud whether he might anchor the news himself. In fact, Donaldson may have been the cable revolution's Marie Antoinette, his style playing well for a 30-second soundbite in an evening news program but really fey and grating in the 24-hour news cycles of our post 9/11 world.<br /><br />Big fizz, little belch.

Trust Evelyn Waugh to write a novel about this effort that manages to find more to mock and be acerbic about than to be proud of.<br /><br />Amazingly, as fiction \\"Officers And Gentlemen\\" not only works but shines, and is a gripping account of how one fellow's war may or may not jibe with the larger political effort around him.<br /><br />In the previous volume of Evelyn Waugh's \\"Sword of Honour\\" trilogy, \\"Men At Arms,\\" we met the pallid Guy Crouchback, heir to an Anglo-Catholic aristocratic line of no special importance, struggling to find some personal meaning in the great conflagration that was World War II. \\"Men At Arms\\" is a mostly funny read, a comedy of errors and barracks farce, with some dramatic detours that accumulate in frequency and gravity by story's end.<br /><br />\\"Officers And Gentlemen\\" has a starker break point between the humor and the drama, which occurs after Guy and his unit is sent to Crete to cover the British retreat there. The Crete section of this story is harrowing, affecting reading; a collection of isolated moments that never quite gel because they are not supposed to. Waugh based this on his own similar experience doing very much the same thing in that battle, and throws up a dozen or so vignettes that only barely pierce through the fog of war: Radios thrown over the side of a ship; a soldier disguising himself as an officer so he can flee the front easier, a commander too tired to give orders to his newly-arrived reinforcements, a vigil beside a dead soldier lying nameless in a desolate village.<br /><br />Virtually every soldier Guy meets is lacking in some way, particularly a by-the-book brigade major named Hound and a dashing but callow sort named Claire who are among his closest companions. While Stukas dive and rain havoc on the shattered troops, Guy tries to figure out what he's supposed to be doing in this awful place. When he finally gets his orders, they are to do the unimaginable: Surrender.<br /><br />Before Crete, \\"Officers And Gentlemen\\" is a fairly funny read, not in a laugh-out-loud way so much as invigorating. The opening part features the aerial Battle of Britain, sacred stuff in the history of the conflict, but leavened here by the fact it is being observed by two tipsy officers inside a private club who watch nearby buildings burn and try to agree on which painter the resulting effect is most reminiscent of: \\"Not Martin. The skyline is too low. The scale is less than Babylonian.\\"<br /><br />Then it's off to the Inner Hebrides, and the mythical island of Mugg, with its rocky outcroppings, its castle \\"indestructible and uninhabitable by anyone but a Scottish laird,\\" and a troop of Commandos slowly going to seed. Guy struggles to prove himself worthy of this crew, even as he begins to wonder about their merit.<br /><br />War is human tragedy, and Waugh never loses sight of that or allows the reader to. Even light moments are interrupted by grim tidings, like the fate of a minor character aboard a ship of Italian internees sailing to Canada (based on a true incident). At the same time, Waugh doesn't wallow in sorrow or bathos. Even his toughest sections in Crete are unsentimentally and plainly presented. He doesn't expect our tears, or want them. He just wants to involve us in his personal take on mankind's greatest challenge of the 20th century, a take all the more valuable because it's not at all what you might expect from World War II storytelling. The ending of the story, for example, when Britain no longer finds itself alone after Hitler attacks the Soviet Union, would be a cause for celebration in any other book, but for Guy (and Waugh) it is something else to mourn. His nation's cause is besmirched by the fact it has taken on an ally every bit as diabolically totalitarian as the enemy.<br /><br />Such things make the novel tougher for others to take, but to me it points up the singularity and uniqueness of Waugh's vision, which make all his writing, but particularly great works like this one, worth reading.<br /><br />As with the other volumes in 'Sword of Honour,' ('Men At Arms' before and 'Unconditional Surrender' after), readers wanting insight and context are well off visiting David Cliffe's handy notes at [...]ian as the enemy.<br /><br />Such things make the novel tougher for others to take, but to me it points up the singularity and uniqueness of Waugh's vision, which make all his writing, but particularly great works like this one, worth reading.<br /><br />As with the other volumes in 'Sword of Honour,' ('Men At Arms' before and 'Unconditional Surrender' after), readers wanting insight and context are well off visiting David Cliffe's handy notes at [...]	2004-02-16
US	50230169	R3J9D5WT4QP0MI	0743205839	576682884	John Paul Jones: Sailor, Hero, Father of the American Navy	Books	4	15	15	N	Y	Solid Story About A Spectacular Man	What a difference half a decade can make! In 1774 John Paul was a destitute ex-slave-ship captain on the lam, forsaking his native Scotland for the unknown British colonies of North America. In 1779, that same man, now known as John Paul Jones, was the most feared pirate of the British Isles, the victor of an incredible sea battle which made his name across the Continent, and the first great figure of what would become the American Navy.<br /><br />Evan Thomas's \\"John Paul Jones\\" begins aboard of Bonhomme Richard, a crank Indiaman under Jones' fractious command, just as it is about to engage the British man-of-war Serapis off England's Flamborough Head. Cannons are primed, sand is spread over the decks to keep them from becoming slick with blood, and the doctor in the cockpit lays out buckets and saws for the surgery ahead. The Bonhomme Richard would not survive the battle, but Jones would emerge victorious anyway, plucking victory from the jaws of defeat by virtue of his grit and visionary fortitude.<br /><br />Thomas makes a great story out of Jones' life. A senior writer with Newsweek, he is nothing if not readable, with attention for detail and a zest for the telling touch. After allowing a pair of lieutenants to hit up an earl for his silver, Jones goes out of his way to make amends, writing florid and flirtatious letters to the earl's wife and then, finally, returning the silver. \\"The tea leaves were still inside the teapot,\\" Thomas writes.<br /><br />He offers some interesting insight into what made Jones tick. It's very engaging, and fits together, but as a shrink, Thomas is a good journalist. A lot of times he talks up some awful situation Jones faced, being passed over or calumnied by his Revolutionary brethren, and ascribes the result to Jones' overweening pride. Jones seems to have been a proud man, though not excessively so given his accomplishments or the age he lived in. He did tarry in Paris a bit long between battles, but he was also given some pretty lacking subordinates and superiors.<br /><br />Thomas calls him \\"the father of the American Navy.\\" It was interesting to read others here saying that John Barry deserves that title. I find myself agreeing with Thomas. Barry was an accomplished commander, and America was lucky to have him, but Jones captured the imagination in a way that would resonate through the centuries. He was quoted, erroneously but with ringing grandeur, by U.S. naval leaders scraping themselves off the sea floor after Pearl Harbor. He remains a figure of pride today. He may never have said \\"I have not yet begun to fight,\\" but he sure walked the walk.<br /><br />I would have liked Thomas to have laid off the dime-store Freud and focused a chapter on just how much of an outlier he was in the early American naval tradition. Thomas does mention Barry in a footnote, and speaks passingly of other decent captains such as Gustavus Conyngham, a privateer who took the fight to English shores before Jones, but most of his analysis of the Revolutionary Navy is so disparaging as to beg wonder at how the Americans won, Jones or no. It's entertaining reading of losers like John Manley and Dudley Saltonstall, and no doubt accurate, but just how much of a sorry lot was the first U.S. Navy? We are told that when Jones engaged the Serapis, \\"no captain of an American navy ship had ever defeated and captured a British man-of-war of any real size or strength.\\" But how unusual were Jones' successes? My sense is that when you include his capture of General Burgoyne's winter uniforms in 1776, and his harassment of British trade ships off the coasts of Nova Scotia and the home islands, Jones simply towers over his contemporaries. Just how much so would have made for good reading.<br /><br />Instead, we get a lengthy examination of his poor record as a lothario, cadging young women, some disturbingly young, and writing verse of obvious below-the-beltline focus. He places his trust in charlatans and spies, and Thomashas at him for it, but the feeling that he may have been more of a victim of his own patriotism and honest zeal for liberty is not adequately addressed.<br /><br />One interesting comparison Thomas makes all-too-briefly is with another American military commander, Benedict Arnold. It can be argued that Jones did at sea what Arnold did on land, giving legitimacy to the Revolutionary struggle via a blazing triumph against all odds. Both were traduced by scheming cohorts, and underappreciated by superiors. \\"But unlike Arnold, Jones remained steadfast to the American cause,\\" Thomas notes.<br /><br />That seems a point worth remembering. Even opting out of the U.S. Navy itself and becoming an American privateer, as many did, would have allowed Jones to make more money without committing treason. But he didn't. That's more worth study than his dalliances with the ladies of Holland or France. Thomas writes about Jones with appropriate zest and awe, and his book is a true joy, but its a bit of a missed opportunity too, in not getting past the trendy cynicism of our time and figuring out what makes for a genuine patriot.

The Bee Gees did an amazing lot in four decades, writing songs for themselves and others that topped charts in every corner of the globe from the 1960s to the 1990s. But for most people, even those who know the Beatles didn't originally record \\"To Love Somebody\\" and \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941,\\" they were the ultimate purveyors of pop music's guiltiest pleasure, disco.<br /><br />For 667 pages, \\"The Ultimate Biography of the Bee Gees\\" offers a somewhat more rounded take on who the Bee Gees really were and what their music was about. Not that it will change much. This is not a book for anyone but the sincerest Bee Gee fan. The first 300 pages are like a massive loyalty test: Can you plow through pages of choppy narrative, contextless quotes, and drawn-out references to nearly every person who sold the Gibb brothers an ice cream or recorded one of their songs?<br /><br />The Bee Gees were made up of three very creative and somewhat unstable people who never would have spent much time with the others except for the sometimes inconvenient, more often redeeming fact of their brotherhood. Each was a real character onto himself. Since the quintet of authors behind this book didn't have access to the Bee Gees when writing this in the late 1990s, they rely on press clippings and fail at providing adequate attribution, editing, or context.<br /><br />So we get long transcript-like statements from Music Maker articles and the like, say from Barry about not liking Robin's wife Molly. There's no follow-up to say how or if that was ever resolved. All three brothers, talking long ago in various forums, throw up a number of wild comments. These are often long and sometimes contradictory, with little attempt at contextual insight from the authors. The narrative is weak throughout the book; it really lacks a central voice or point of view. Especially early on, it reads like an artless clip job, because in essence that's what it is.<br /><br />The book picks up right when the Gibbs tap into R&B. Being able to interview studio insiders like producer Arif Mardin and keyboardist Blue Weaver first-hand make a difference. The next 100 pages are the most readable in the book, but as it deals with the Helium Years (their 1975-79 disco heyday), that only serves to feed the white-satin stereotype many will have of this band going in. Also, I'm more than a little concerned about the factual integrity of a text that refers several times to the singer of the Gibb-penned hit \\"Grease\\" as \\"Franki\\" Valli.<br /><br />The authors do try to cram every fact they can into the book, but the result is cumbersome and at times unreadable, especially at the beginning. I'd say this is two stars for fans, one for everyone else. Here's hoping that now that the Bee Gees story is at an end with Maurice's sudden death last year, some writer will come along to give it the class-A treatment it deserves. I'll just hang on to this while I'm waiting.when the Gibbs tap into R&B. Being able to interview studio insiders like producer Arif Mardin and keyboardist Blue Weaver first-hand make a difference.

That is not a problem with \\"Sahara Unveiled,\\" where author William Langewiesche submerges himself well beneath the thread of the story.<br /><br />Langewiesche, a reporter for \\"Atlantic Monthly\\" best known today for his \\"American Ground\\" series of pieces on the aftermath of the World Trade Center's destruction, writes in a lean, spare, slightly alkaline style reminiscent of Hemingway that seems to suit his subject, the world's biggest and perhaps most ferocious desert, quite well. It puts one in mind of William Least Heat Moon's travel writing, notably \\"Blue Highways,\\" with its cultural detours and picaresque, ever-changing cast of characters.<br /><br />Langewiesche starts off by quickly dispelling any myths his readers might have about the subject of the Sahara: \\"Do not regret the passing of the camel and the caravan. The Sahara has changed, but it remains a desert without compromise, the world in its extreme.\\" He goes on to demonstrate this by trekking through the desert's endless mass and then west to the Atlantic primarily by taxi, bus, and riverboat.<br /><br />It's not clear to me why Langewiesche was doing this (Least Heat Moon had similarly opaque motives), and the locals have questions, too. During one layover in the Algerian town of M'Zab, what he calls \\"the diving board for the deep Sahara,\\" there is the following exchange as Langewiesche looks for ground transport farther south:<br /><br />\\"He said: 'Why don't you fly?'<br /><br />'Because I want to see the desert up close.'<br /><br />'Buy a postcard.'<br /><br />'But I want to feel the desert.'<br /><br />'It feels bad.'<br /><br />Indeed it does. Sometimes it can even be fatal. Death, human and otherwise, is of no importance to the Sahara, devourer of whole towns and caravans. \\"The Sahara is not cruel, but it is indifferent,\\" he writes. And it produces a sometimes indifferent people, hard, lean, and fatalistic.<br /><br />People who attack Langewiesche for a lack of political correctness in depicting the Arabs, Berbers, Tauregs, Moors, and others he describes in these pages pay a glowing tribute without knowing it. Langewiesche is one tough writer, unsentimental, not macho but not running for office, either. When he has cause to describe the generosity and kindness of people he meets, he does so. When he runs into less decent folk, he doesn't mince words. He doesn't waste them, either, on emotional outbursts or self-righteousness. As I said at the beginning, he's one author who doesn't get in the way of what he's talking about.<br /><br />His take on the Europeans who come to the Sahara are sharp and cutting. He notes meeting a miserable French couple collecting scorpions and tales of injured superiority in Algeria, a former French colony: \\"She was a Parisian, and too young to remember the old Algerian war. But she had picked up the old colonial habit of talking about the Algerians as if they were not present or didn't understand French. Similarly, she wore a short skirt and a sleeveless shirt, and through the thin fabric displayed her nipples in disregard of local sentiment. And now she sat drinking French wine. These were not acts of indifference, but aggression. And Algerians understood the difference.\\"<br /><br />The best thing about \\"Sahara Unveiled\\" is it never sits still for long. Langewiesche can spend a few pages talking about the fate of a misguided missionary in the 1800s, then bring things back to the present day with an analysis of Taureg separatist violence. He analyzes the different types of dunes formed by Saharan sand, how the desert resembles an ocean, and how it does not. He relates folk tales and the anatomy of a camel. Using plainspoken and approachable prose, he manages to take deep stock of a variety of subjects, make his point, and move on.<br /><br />The last leg of the journey is a quick one, perhaps because Langewiesche was taken ill (from drinking the water, a classic tourist mistake). He doesn't wrap it up as well as he should have, but the rest of the book is too good to begrudge him anything for that. Complaining the author left you wanting more is not much of a complaint, is it?<br /><br />You will enjoy this account of nature at its extreme, and the people who live in it.

Instead he is plunked into the middle of a farcical parade where tired gray men do the best they can to lose a war against a dangerous, devouring adversary while underlings move like spastic marionettes beneath bony fingers.<br /><br />The result is no happy marriage for Guy, though happy marriages have not been his lot. He was married once, to a scheming heartbreaker named Virginia who divorced him for a career as a serial bride. Guy's strict Catholicism forbids him from marrying again, though as the last in his aristocratic line, such a situation means dereliction of duty in the posterity department. Stuck in every sense of the word, like Miniver Cheevy living mostly in the past, he views the onset of war as a means of redemption against the atheistic hordes of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, aligned at the war's outset in the partition of Poland.<br /><br />After a struggle, Guy finds himself enlisted in an army brigade where the golden mean is one of bare competence, and bureaucratic \\"banf\\" trumps all. France falls, and Norway, and the future is decidedly bleak. Whether Britain can ever rally is a point very much in doubt at book's end, though it doesn't seem likely Guy will help much.<br /><br />That said, the first of Evelyn Waugh's \\"Sword Of Honor\\" is actually a pretty funny read most of the way through. The dialogue is crisp and clever; the plot twists ingenuously lurid. Author Evelyn Waugh has obvious fun recalling his own second youth (he enlisted in his mid-30s) and overseeing the zany exploits of his off-kilter comrades. While Guy spends a lot of time in the shadows, his emergence to be the subject of the later books, \\"Men At Arms\\" focuses on characters he meets who shed light on the various all-too-human traits of His Majesty's armed forces.<br /><br />For example, brigade commander Ritchie-Hook is a one-eyed loon obsessed with attack and \\"biffing\\" the enemy. \\"There are no Sundays in the firing-line,\\" he declaims. At one point, angered by his troops' inability at the shooting range, he runs over to the trench beneath the target butts, pokes his head up, and promises a reward to anyone who can nail him. They don't, maybe because they really try.<br /><br />The book actually belongs to another character, Apthorpe, a strange, \\"rather rum\\" fellow who befriends Guy and in time enlists his aid on a mission to keep Ritchie-Hook from making use of Apthorpe's private \\"thunderbox,\\" a.k.a. port-o-potty. This gets rather involved, with hushed nighttime conferences between Guy and Apthorpe that wind up somehow getting reported to British Intelligence, before the two conspirators' plot stumbles its way to a charged and highly entertaining conclusion.<br /><br />If \\"Men At Arms\\" had ended there, it would be seen as an engagingly comic though perhaps shallow look at military service during the first and least nasty days of World War II, what would be called \\"The Phoney War.\\" But Waugh, deeply scarred from his own wartime experiences, keeps the story moving into more penetrating territory. The comedy pulls up a bit, though not abruptly, and never completely.<br /><br />Sometimes, when comedies turn serious, readers can be put off by the sharp change of tone. Yet here, even as laughs fall fainter, the reader's attachment increases, probably because Waugh subtly manipulates audience expectations (for example, by making Apthorpe less and less likeable, and the machinations of Guy's superiors more and more opaque) before messing with the storyline.<br /><br />Also, Waugh's deeper involvement with all he presents here really shines through. This identification will only grow with the next two volumes, \\"Officers And Gentlemen\\" and \\"Unconditional Surrender,\\" books that draw deeper focus on some real horrors of war only hinted at with \\"Men At Arms,\\" while enriching characters first illustrated here with broader and less subtle strokes.<br /><br />Talking about this book being an uproarious military comedy makes one think of something like \\"Stripes\\" or \\"M*A*S*H,\\" which \\"Men At Arms\\" isn't by any stretch. It's no laugh riot, but neither is it a dull bore. Actually, it's very bright and invigorating. Like another Anglo-Catholic trilogy written at around the same time, \\"Sword Of Honour\\" is intimately concerned with the question of worldly goodness and overcoming the awesome threat posed by evil and doubt.

That's one way to look at this opus, an exploration of the author's East Texas girlhood and the collapsing family situation she found herself confronted with.<br /><br />The book starts with a mystery: Why are police being called to the scene of a young girl's bed? Why is a kindly doctor inspecting her body for \\"marks?\\" The books builds a mystery, then takes more than 150 pages bothering to solve it, but by that time you are hooked too deep into the rest of the story to care. You want to find out how the most screwed up family ever to reside in the Lone Star State managed to survive themselves, albeit barely.<br /><br />While the author is a recognized poet and esteemed college professor, and \\"The Liars' Club\\" is widely praised among literary critics, those fearing some pointy-headed exercise in literati snobbery at the expense of slack-jawed Western yokels need not fear. Not that Karr doesn't get in some digs at the rustic Bible-thumpers responsible for so much of her upbringing, but her style of writing is much more akin to Stephen King than Margaret Mead, writing in a real-world way about actual experiences she underwent in a way that will make you feel you underwent them to, whatever your age, sex, or social background. She describes everything from hurricanes to rapes to a child's first gulp of sparkling alcohol with a \\"you-are-there\\" veracity that is almost frightening, and hard to pull away from. Only James Ellroy's \\"My Dark Places\\" and Mikal Gilmore's \\"Shot Through The Heart\\" hold a candle to this in my experience, and I've read a few.<br /><br />The cruelest thing one has to report about this book is, however savage the author's experience, it never stops being so goddam funny. With an eye for detail like Dickens crossed with a sense of humor as constant as Twain's, Karr makes \\"The Liar's Club\\" the kind of book one can't just put down at the end of a chapter, however sleepy or battered by second-hand reality the reader might feel.<br /><br />On telling about her grandmother's slow death from cancer, Karr is nothing if not succinct. \\"First they took off her toenail, then her toe, then her foot. Then they shot mustard gas through her leg till it was burnt black, then she screamed for six weeks nonstop. Then they took off her leg, and it was like a black stump laid on the pillow...\\"<br /><br />So much for pathos, as she continues: \\"At the end of this report, [Karr's sister] Lecia and I would start scanning around whoever's kitchen it was for cookies or Kool-Aid. We knew with certain instinct that reporting on a dead grandma deserved some payoff.\\"<br /><br />She explains later that she wasn't so sorry to lose Grannie. The woman used a quirt on her hide and distended her mother's psyche to the point of breakdown. Though it's hard to say exactly. Karr doesn't give away much, but she offers this counterbalance to her tale of Grandma's ordeal: \\"Real suffering has a face and a smell. It lasts in its most intense form no matter what you drape over it. And it knows your name.\\"<br /><br />Anyone who's lost someone to cancer knows intimately what that means, and that's the heartbreak and the greatness of \\"The Liars' Club,\\" a book that seems so amazingly knowing as it recounts Karr's firsthand experiences as a young girl. Her experiences are raw and miserable, to put it mildly, but she presents it in such a way to make it utterly compelling to the reader, yet endurable, too.<br /><br />The book works on so many levels. I was left wondering about sister Lucia, a rock-steady character who often protects her younger sister, but whom Karr nevertheless savages throughout her narrative. Is she writing here as an adult, or channeling her younger self and some form of sibling rivalry? I also wondered about the title organization, a group of men with whom her father hangs out and tells tall tales. Whenever she describes a meeting, she slips from the past into the present tense for one of the few moments in the book. Is that a signal that the Liars' Club interludes are themselves tall tales by author Karr? Or is she telescoping her experience in those close quarters to give it the special verisimilitude that makes her relationship with her father so central to the story?<br /><br />In one of these interludes, Karr ponders the nature of lying and how they reveal deeper secrets of the liar, that is to say, \\"how lies can tell you the truth.\\" Certainly there's no earthly way of explaining her mother, an earthy Bohemian who takes to painting and drinking with equal fervor, feuding with her husband and taking advantage of a sudden inheritance Gloria Swanson-style. Any divorced father will find himself welling up with tears as he reads Karr's account of how he was separated and then reunited with his daughters.<br /><br />There's nothing easy in this book, but so much to love. Everything good you've heard about this book is true. Now just go read it.ense for one of the few moments in the book.

At its best, \\"The Dogged Victims Of Inexorable Fate\\" documents what made golf special in the 1960s before it became the superstar circuit it is today.<br /><br />On Palmer, the King of the sport during that decade, though he never won a major after 1964, Jenkins writes movingly in one essay: \\"He is the most immeasurable of golf champions. But this is not entirely true because of all that he has won, or because of the mysterious fury with which he has managed to rally himself. It is partly because of the nobility he has brought to losing. And more than anything, it is true because of the pure, unmixed joy he has brought to trying.\\"<br /><br />Most of the time, Jenkins foregoes the heartstrings and settles for the funny bone. Take his lead on the PGA Tour's most august tournament: \\"It is commonly known among a select group of Masters goers that many of the best shots of the tournament are served in tall paper cups on the upstairs porch of the Augusta National Golf Club.\\" About a freespending golfer of an earlier era: \\"If Jimmy Demaret had won the money he would have been 8 to 5 to leave it in a bar or blow it on a handmade pair of orange and purple saddle oxfords.\\"<br /><br />Funny stuff. Jenkins also scores points in summing up the histories of tournaments and eras in ways that are definitive and deceptively breezy. Reading him is to get a sense of how golf writing moved from the stodgy versifying of Herbert Warren Wind to the snarky cool of Rick Reilly and Alan Shipnuck, not to mention the gang in the 18th hole tower at CBS. For that, and other things, he may well have been the most revolutionary golf writer, and this book offers some prize examples why.<br /><br />But there's something to be said for stodgy, too. Wind was not a snappy writer, but he was a measured and thorough one, and reading his account of golf's beginnings in America feels more like the real deal. Jenkins too often uses situations and characters as backboards for his zings and one-liners, then moves on, whereas Wind or another writer might linger and find something of value. Jenkins doesn't quote the players so much as channel them through his narrative, and though it is readable, it's suspect, too. He's also an impossibly snobby overdog, focusing on the favorites and ignoring the field. He seems to watch every tournament from the most exclusive part of the clubhouse, in the company of CEOs and Ben Hogan. He doesn't fawn, but he doesn't find a seat closer to the crowd, either.<br /><br />At least two of his essays, a faux-Runyanesque tale of a freeloader living off Tour luminaries and an account of a round with several Hollywood stars, seem like excuses for hobnobbing and overstay their welcome. But the rest vary in quality from illuminating to awe-inspiring.<br /><br />The second-to-last piece, \\"The Glory Game,\\" is considered one of sports writing's all-time best. It's a really great first-person account about a group of compulsive gamblers who play on a Fort Worth muni course that whips through its longer-than-average length. Also terrific is \\"The Big Window,\\" which details how CBS covered the 1966 Masters by putting the reader in the control room with blustery producer Frank Chirkinian.<br /><br />Jenkins' book isn't up there on the top shelf of my golf library with Wind's \\"The Story Of American Golf,\\" Shipnuck's \\"Blood, Sweat & Tees,\\" or John Feinstein's \\"A Good Walk Spoiled,\\" but if you like your sportswriting salty and dry, this is a good jar of peanuts to dig into.and this book offers some prize examples why.

US	50230169	R1JRUB2KOSYJDS	044023610X	309457317	Mr. Majestyk	Books	2	14	19	N	N	The Tenor Clears His Throat	Elmore Leonard is the king of crime fiction. We know this because the covers of all his paperbacks say so, and it's so. Nelson DeMille, Ed McBain, Joseph Wambaugh, and others all have their points, but no one has consistently produced the level of crime fiction that Leonard has over the course of five decades now.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Majestyk\\" isn't part of that legacy. It's a sturdy, muscle-minded, no-frills crime story that 100 other guys could have churned out in the 1970s, and many did. The idea of a peaceable loner coming up against dark criminal forces, only to be revealed as more formidable than any of his adversaries banked on, was old then and older now. Characterization is limited. The atmosphere is arid as a sun-baked arroyo. Most surprisingly for Leonard, the dialogue is long on brawn and short on brains. \\"Shut up, %**$^@#\\" is about the best the normally loquacious Leonard seems able, or interested, in presenting.<br /><br />A good review elsewhere on this page notes the book was actually written after the movie, which became a Charles Bronson vehicle after Clint Eastwood dropped out. You can kind of smell that star positioning behind the unpromising premise of a melon farmer who runs into trouble while hiring migrant workers in the American Southwest. Dirty Harry wanted to show he wasn't all about gunning down minorities, and apparently Chuck Bronson felt the same (though this movie came out just before \\"Death Wish\\" did during the same year, 1974).<br /><br />The novel doesn't shed much light in the migrant worker situation, or try to. Nor does it offer much insight into the Vietnam vet, Majestyk's previous line of work. It spends its short span setting up Majestyk's unenviable situation. Getting busted by the cops for defending his work site against a small-time hoodlum, he winds up crossing a much nastier and more powerful criminal during an escape attempt. Can he dispense with this threat and get his melons to market so he doesn't lose his farm?<br /><br />Though these sort of novels typically shortchange the police to provide the non-cop hero with more of a lone-wolf situation, \\"Mr. Majestyk\\" overamps this by making the fuzz Barney-Fife-caliber hopeless. For example, their case against chief villain Frank Renda goes up in smoke when a cop who collared Renda is gunned down during the escape fight. Didn't the officer write a report, or was he just going to testify at the trial from memory? Instead, the police seem to throw up their hands and rely on using Mr. Majestyk for bait (and then fail to keep adequate track of him.)<br /><br />Lucky for law and order, the bad guys in this one are even dumber. Frank Renda, we are told, is a hard guy \\"cool, patient, like someone who moved slowly, without wasted effort.\\" Well, that is until Renda gets it in his head to waste Majestyk. Then there's a lot of wasted effort. Renda just won't quit, even as it becomes obvious that his obsession for killing the melon farmer who gave him some static is going to cost him another trip to the big house, perhaps the good graces of his mob overlords, and a good half-dozen of his best foot soldiers. Renda's no psycho killer; he's actually diversified. We are told his other affairs include a restaurant linen service and a string of massage parlors. But a few minutes with Majestyk turns him into a kamikaze. For a cold-blooded trigger man, Renda runs a bit too hot to be believed.<br /><br />Majestyk doesn't emote much, which makes him a perfect Charles Bronson hero. Actually, Bronson apparently gave the character more charm in the movie version (I haven't seen it), which makes you wonder whether Leonard underwrote the character deliberately after losing Eastwood's services to construct his protagonist around and being at a loss as to what to replace him with. There's an attempt at presenting a romance, but why bother when we don't know much about what draws Majestyk and his migrant worker friend together except he likes the way she looks in a pair of jeans and she likes the fact he's a fair labor contractor. [Cue violins.]<br /><br />The final Wild West-style showdown borrows from many better stories, and wraps itself up too neatly in less than ten pages. Leonard obviously didn't waste more than a month punching this out, getting it in place as a film tie-in that would support him while he toiled over more ambitious fare. It's a decent story for a bus trip, but \\"Majestyk\\" in name only. Nearly any other Leonard is a better bet.ir of jeans and she likes the fact he's a fair labor contractor.

Like the butterfly (or in French \\"Papillon\\") which Charriere has tattooed to his chest, he will live his life in freedom or not at all. When a doctor questions him about his repeated escape attempts, Papillon's reply is matter-of-fact: \\"I don't belong here - I'm only visiting.\\"<br /><br />\\"Papillon\\" takes a while to get started, and Charriere's elusive and terse tone keeps one from feeling too close to the narrator. He tells you he didn't kill the man the police claim he did, but credits himself for not being a stool pigeon by telling them who did. So he's not exactly Dreyfus here, though he pretends otherwise at times. He mentions a wife and child in the outset almost as afterthoughts, then scarcely refers to them again. No false modesty for this guy - he runs the roost in every clink he is assigned, dispensing wisdom to prisoner and warden alike. No physical challenge is too much for him to overcome, no fellow \\"mec\\" too much for him to handle.<br /><br />Let's put it this way: If Charriere is selling bridges, I ain't buying. But if this is more fiction than fact, \\"Papillon\\" still makes for one amazing novel. With minimal pretense at craft, Charriere crafts a white-knuckle, plain-spoken suspense tale that finds our hero in every imaginable predicament - and some not at all imaginable - as he makes attempt after attempt to escape the hell on earth that is French Guiana, the three Iles du Salut (literally \\"Isles of Salvation\\"), and ultimately Devil's Island. Taking you from the lush, mosquito-choked jungles of the Caribbean coastline to a solitary confinement where Papillon stays sane by imagining himself in childhood haunts, this is about as picturesque a ride as you can have sitting in your comfy chair.<br /><br />A sense of life abounds in this book. Charriere holds court on such things as the proper way to sleep in a hammock, how one secretes money on one's \\"person,\\" how the sharks knew when a corpse was about to be dumped in the sea, the strange tales prisoners tell, how one fishes for mullet on Devil's Island, etc. How much of this is on the level is tough to tell, but it fills the mind with a sense of a world lived in, and in one of the world's most obscure corners at that.<br /><br />Whatever else, one statement Charriere makes is no doubt true: He is a spellbinding storyteller. He has a sense of the tragic and the funny and never lets the storyline sag. He also throws in nice little asides that keep the reader engaged. At one point, when he is thrown in solitary, Charriere takes a break from relating his squalor to offer this merry assurance: \\"The movie could not stop there; it must go on. It will go on, mecs! Just give me time to get back my strength and you'll have some new episodes, never fear!\\"<br /><br />What makes \\"Papillon\\" especially readable and gripping is how Charriere comes into contact with the best and worst in people, sometimes the same people. The most seemingly depraved people can turn out to be not all bad; finding your hermit-like host keeps dead bodies in a pit outside his home is not necessarily proof he is out to do the same to you. He also has an intriguing religious sensibility, which yo-yos between antagonistic disbelief to a sense of profound grace. \\"Where there's life, there's hope\\" is an oft-repeated maxim in the book, and they are not hollow words for Papillon, whatever his state. Despair is unknown to him, and he's heartening to read for that alone.<br /><br />I'd love to know how much of this tale is true. Apparently, there is a French-language book that analyzes the story of \\"Papillon\\" from a historical context, and the History Channel in the United States did a documentary you can order online. The little I've seen indicates some holes in the number of escape attempts Charriere made. But hewas a prisoner, and then he was free; he wrote a book that, if just 10% true, would be enough to fill out four or five adventuresome lives; and his legacy is one people still passionately relate to more than 30 years after his death. I can't give this book five stars only because of this trust factor, but rest assured \\"Papillon\\" is worth your time, and you will be happy you read it.was a prisoner, and then he was free; he wrote a book that, if just 10% true, would be enough to fill out four or five adventuresome lives; and his legacy is one people still passionately relate to more than 30 years after his death.

Reading this book is instructive for that alone.<br /><br />But the book is far more than a prescient account of today's market forces. It's a vivid rogues gallery of people who rode the tides of fortune, had their days at the crest of their profession, and then fell back. Some, like stockpicker extraordinaire Gerald Tsai, the first Asian to rise to NYSE prominence, were undone by fortune and circumstance. Other less savory characters had only themselves to blame.<br /><br />There's an early look at Ross Perot, described vividly at the book's outset as losing a half-billion in a single day (April 22, 1970) and more or less shrugging it off. Perot's priorities were solid and he knew what he was about. Not so Eddie Gilbert, \\"The Last Gatsby\\" as Brooks calls him, who parlays small victories into outrageous defeats, dragging along a coterie of privileged friends into more and more nefarious investment schemes. Brooks sees Gilbert's get-rich-quick attitude as too emblematic of Wall Street in the 1960s, and his narrative never tires of pointing these out.<br /><br />Brooks' elegant prose has a way of leaping out at you without disrupting the narrative flow. About the trend for all investment strategy to come unglued: \\"The dumb money could take bitter comfort in the company it had among the smartest of the smart money - or former money.\\" On Tsai: \\"...so swift and nimble in getting into and out of specific stocks that his relations with them, far from resembling a marriage or even a companionate marriage, were more often like that of a rou&eacute; with a chorus line.\\" On the numerous bailouts undertaken by the Street as the '60s went sour: \\"Save the broker in order to serve the customer: it was Wall Street's version of the trickle-down theory.\\"<br /><br />Brooks's writing feels timeless. His is a lapidary style of almost accidental eloquence, blending facts in a seamless way as he tells his tale. It's like Roger Angell's baseball writings for the same magazine - I kept thinking about Angell's great essays in \\"The Summer Game,\\" which focuses on roughly the same period as \\"The Go-Go Years,\\" albeit on a different sport.<br /><br />While Brooks's disapproval with Wall Street in the 1960s is obvious, and his genteel liberal disdain for a status quo that allows the market to manage itself shows up now and again, he never loses his focus on the people, and allows them to breathe in his narrative. He doesn't quote from them much, but he obviously spoke to many of the principals at length and weaves their insights into the story. As much as the then-nascent trend toward conglomeratization bothers him, he allows himself to show some sympathy for one of its more outrageous practitioners, Saul Steinberg, who in one of the best chapters finds himself thwarted by the bluebloods while attempting to acquire Chemical Bank. \\"I always knew there was an Establishment - I just used to think I was a part of it,\\" Steinberg says.<br /><br />It's not a connect-the-dots style history of Wall Street in the 1960s. It's too episodic for that. But if you are studying the facts and figures of the Go-Go Years and want a deeper look, or simply enjoy the human drama all-too-often overlooked in American business journalism, \\"The Go-Go Years\\" is a book that has only appreciated in value over time.ur: \\"Save the broker in order to serve the customer: it was Wall Street's version of the trickle-down theory.\\"<br /><br />Brooks's writing feels timeless.

To read the story comprehensively laid out by Alecia Swasy is to gape in astonishment at the true measure of human depravity in search of the holy buck.<br /><br />Does Swasy have it in for P&G? Yeah, but so would you if you were a journalist and your subject was breaking the law to trample on your rights while you tried to do your job. Things got so out of hand as P&G launched telephone record investigations and had ex-employees brought to Cincinnati police stations to explain why they were talking to a reporter, that the ensuing coverage sparked a national outcry. Pundits and cartoonists weighed in about the KGB tactics of people who make laundry detergent and toothpaste. When finally brought to heel by indignant shareholders, CEO Artzt shrugged and called it a mistake. \\"The only thing he regretted,\\" Swasy writes, \\"was getting caught.\\"<br /><br />Swasy was clearly embittered by her experience, and when her narrative flies into polemical flourishes, as in the Epilogue (\\"[Critics] refuse to buy the Ivory-pure image so carefully cultivated by P&G's years of marketing. We should all do the same\\"), the book is poorer for it. She does a great job describing, through the voices of mostly anonymous insiders, the noxious work environment of P&G for its employees (and you don't have to be a \\"Proctoid\\" to relate to the Dilbert-in-the-Death-Star picture she paints), then editorializes on how P&G advertising nurtures enduring cultural \\"myths\\" about a woman's place being in the home. Frankly, this latter angle comes up lame. P&G advertising reflected the culture for years, it sold product, and it has been adjusted to fit contemporary mores, as Swasy notes (just not enough for her liking.) I don't know whether it's so awful the role of the female was once rather more rigidly defined than it is now, but dumping much of the blame on P&G's doorstep seems excessive. Marketing to lesbian soccer Moms in the 1940s would probably have not helped P&G achieve its present level of success.<br /><br />Where Swasy's book is strongest is the account of Rely, the tampon whose ingredients could cause toxic shock, and were directly responsible for the deaths of several women in 1979-80. Despite the accumulation of evidence, P&G went forward with its marketing. As recounted in a chapter of the book \\"Guerrilla Marketing\\") that should be required reading in corporate ethics classes, CEO Smale even planned to roll out a deodorant version of Rely while his underlings worked to silence researchers (mostly successfully) with generous grant money. The chapter is particularly good when it recounts how one trial lawyer and a bereaved husband he represented forced P&G to pay ridiculously low damages and put needed heat on the effort to establish P&G's culpability. Never mind, though. Swasy reveals later on that P&G's lab boys were concurrently doping out how to add the same toxic chemical to diapers.<br /><br />There are other good chapters on P&G's arrogant practices overseas, its inept handling of domestic retailers (not just the small fry but WalMart, too!), and its stranglehold on a Florida community living around a river P&G polluted. Sometimes, as with the Florida case, Swasy seems too eager to embrace anything the critics dish out, and her noting the death of the P&G snack food Pringles [as of the book's publication in 1994] appears in retrospect to have been premature.<br /><br />But overall, \\"Soap Opera\\" is a solid addition to business journalism. Books like this one only make you look a little deeper than your coupon stash in thinking about what products you buy. And that's a goodthing.thing.	2003-12-11
US	50230169	RE5RK99RNMCZK	0316926108	605334526	Scoop	Books	3	10	18	N	Y	Half Scoop at best	Having just read Waugh's \\"Sword Of Honour\\" and being familiar with his novelistic satire in \\"The Loved One,\\" I expected more from Waugh than I got from \\"Scoop.\\" Was he at fault, or me? It's clear he was writing a lark here, something dashed off between more substantial works. Maybe I shouldn't have expected more. But given his abiding interest in politics, travel, and social mores, I thought \\"Scoop\\" a desultory endeavor from someone who could have delivered much more.<br /><br />His analysis of the newspaper trade is seen as pungent and jabbing by some, but it comes off as forced and fantastical. Was there ever a newspaper that sent off reporters with unlimited expense accounts, allowing them to buy hollowed out sticks and collapsible canoes on a lark? Rewrite desks transform barely-coherent telegrams from lazy, drunken scribes into five-column front page articles, while editors gleefully tear apart their front pages at the 11th and one-half hour to accommodate dispatches from their reporters the darkest corners of the Third World. Yes, barroom journalism is still practiced occasionally by the likes of Jayson Blair, but if life was ever really this good in the Fourth Estate, there wouldn't be so many ulcers in newsrooms. Even in the 1930s, reporters worked harder than this, and Waugh knew it. The shame is the real work of journalists can be made every bit as silly and tawdry within the realm of true parody, but Waugh opted to pretend they only could be bothered to leave their hotel rooms to yell at their servants that the ice on their head compresses needed refreshing.<br /><br />Waugh can write, he crafts amazing sentences, and he is capable of developing some probing lines of analysis around his myriad of characters. The middle part of this book is pretty good, not great but energetic, but it takes 100 pages to get there, and 50 more pages of denouement after its over to find out how everyone turned out. The lead character, the rustic rube William Boot, is no different upon leaving the strange country of Ishmaelia than before arriving, except for being taken for a bit of a ride by a shadowy German woman in one of several subplots that taper off into nothingness before the 321 pages run out. Boot seems a tribute to the complacency of the landed class, and like Waugh's ethnic epithets at the natives and others sprinkled liberally in the book, this leaves an unnecessarily sour taste. Waugh had a narrow perspective at times, but as a writer was usually more reflective, and less reflexive, than this.<br /><br />Even the main business of the novel, Boot's big story that gives the book its name, is handled perfunctorily. It's neither great comedy or very dramatic. From what I gathered, the revolution was snuffed out in less than half a page when some angry Swede bulled through a porch of pinko grandees. Please tell me if I missed something here, but I don't think so.<br /><br />\\"News is what a chap who doesn't care much about anything wants to read,\\" Boot is told by a companion, Corker, who makes a brief turn in the narrative before melting away like so many others in this maddeningly inconsistent book. It's a funny line, but it doesn't hold up to any deeper analysis.

US	50230169	R1VDCUPG0N7BY0	0140156046	937703555	Libra (Contemporary American Fiction)	Books	4	6	8	N	N	A Conspiracy of Coincidences	Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone gunman lashing out at his solitude and failure. Oswald was the patsy in a vast conspiracy to advance shadowy aims.<br /><br />Sailors of the ocean of literature published about November 22, 1963 can expect either one or the other of the above takes on what happened that fateful afternoon in Dallas. It's become almost a window into what you really are as a person, what you believe to be the true facts of the crime.<br /><br />The first great thing about Don DeLillo's terrific novel \\"Libra\\" is the fact it posits a third view of the assassination, which can be simplistically described as a blending of the two main versions. In \\"Libra,\\" Oswald is both a lone gunman, following his own idiosyncratic path through an absurd existence of his own design; and the dupe of a small coterie of disaffected ex-CIA operatives and anti-Castro Cubans who think killing Kennedy will shift negative attention on Uncle Fidel and punish the man who disowned their cause after the Bay of Pigs.<br /><br />Ultimately, what killed Kennedy wasn't one man or even a bunch of them, as DeLillo sees it, but a vast pattern of circumstances that gel with the advantage of hindsight into something so intricate and interwoven as to seem preordained. Oswald got a job at a school book warehouse, and the next month the president's motorcade is rerouted right by it. A newspaper ad denouncing the President is published with a funeral-like black border the day he arrives. A rifle and a pistol ordered weeks apart arrive on the same day. And so on.<br /><br />As David Ferrie, one of the conspirators, tells Oswald: \\"Coincidence is a science waiting to be discovered. How patterns emerge outside the bounds of cause and effect.\\"<br /><br />Every assassination conspiracy should have its own philosopher. One failing of \\"Libra\\" is DeLillo's continual use of dialogue like this, apt as it is, to flush out key points. The narrative, disjoined and non-linear to begin with, often verges on the Faulknerian within individual chapters and sections. Fortunately, the overall story is well known enough that this is navigable.<br /><br />Even the best authors can get too pretentious for their own good, but \\"Libra\\" is a great read worth sticking around for to the end. You get vivid characterization, particularly with Oswald and his hyperdramatically self-pitying mother. There's a strong sense of the period, the early '60s before the decade went ker-pow (i.e. before this happened). DeLillo really conveys a sense of what went wrong and what could have been behind it, without offering easy answers or unsubstantiatable blame. It's clear the guy did his homework, covering all the bases as he overlays his fictional vision to the facts we are so familiar with, the story of 11/22 that DeLillo likens to \\"the Joycean Book of America...the novel in which nothing is left out.\\" There are interesting detours, red herrings that tease out various subtleties and, while not essential to the plot, reward repeat readings. Finally, there are some real shafts of humor, as when Oswald, self-exiled in the Soviet Union, is looked over for possible employment by the KGB, and found wanting: \\"The test results were in and only his urine got a passing grade.\\"<br /><br />Does \\"Libra\\" offer the definitive account of the assassination? It's certainly one worth considering. I'm not sure the Jack Ruby angle is explained convincingly (though Ruby is one of the most interesting characters sketched by DeLillo). Most everything else is, though. For the record, I believe Oswald acted alone, but DeLillo does raise some strong points to suggest the contrary. At the same time, there's a lot here to peeve the Oliver Stone crowd.<br /><br />\\"Libra\\" makes for an illuminating introduction to one of our greatest living novelists and to one of the signature events of living memory, which four decades later affects us still. While you and I may not understand everything in the book, it's helpful to bear in mind thatcomprehensibility is not the object here, and what we get instead is a sense of the things that can happen beyond our ken, and that the belief we control our own destiny is a lie, sometimes fatal.comprehensibility is not the object here, and what we get instead is a sense of the things that can happen beyond our ken, and that the belief we control our own destiny is a lie, sometimes fatal.	2003-11-27

That's not a knock. Few authors ever get that lucky or brilliant once, let alone twice, especially their first two times off the blocks.<br /><br />\\"Icon\\" suffers from a beginning that suggests otherwise. You read the first 300 pages and they grab you in a way few books ever do, with alternating suspense yarns set years apart, each somehow building on the drama of the other. You agonize for poor Jason Monk as his Soviet assets are undone one after the other by real-life traitor Aldrich Ames, kind of what Benedict Arnold might have been had the Revolutionary figure succeeded in not only giving up West Point to the Redcoats, but Fort Ticonderoga and Philadelphia as well. The fact that its now well after 1999 and the ultra-nationalist movement in Russia has not taken control doesn't lessen the sense of fear and loathing Forsyth gets across as he slowly sets up the principal story with a nice sense of balance, nuance, and loving detail. You think to yourself: \\"Can it be? Did Forsyth find his wellspring once more?\\"<br /><br />Then it all goes to pieces in Part 2, along with the chief villians. After drumming in their diabolical competance in Part 1, Forsyth apparently allows them to forget their medication in Part 2. Not only do they act ridiculously, but Monk the hero, like the protagonist in \\"Fist Of God,\\" seems to anticipate everything that happens in such a way to alleviate any creative unease the reader might feel. The book that starts so promisingly ends not with a bang but a yawn.<br /><br />Even at the very end, when Forsyth reveals a key trick in his narrative, he does so in such a rote way as to raise more questions than answers. Clearly he went for a \\"He was my father\\" type finale, but what we get instead is another of those coincidences that pock the narrative's second half.<br /><br />I love Forsyth, even lesser Forsyth. There's a lot to enjoy here, especially in the first half, and people who like their resolutions tidy and suspense-free may enjoy the rest as well. But I sort of wish the master could have taken more time to sort out the second half of his story with the same apparent care he bestowed on the first.y in the first half, and people who like their resolutions tidy and suspense-free may enjoy the rest as well.

US	50230169	R1W9E0WJEQYSK3	0711991944	84766329	Bright Lights Dark Shadows: The Real Story of ABBA	Books	4	59	63	N	Y	Polar Music indeed!	Someone said it's as difficult to write about music as it is to dance to architecture, and I guess Carl Magnus Palm faced a tougher task than most. As any \\"Behind The Music\\" aficianado knows, your typical pop group creates plenty of drama, even when their music isn't all that good. Abba is unique in that their story is devoid of drug arrests or lurid groupie tales. Divorces, yes, they had that going in spades, as the band mates were all husbands and wives who broke apart and eventually ended the band, but the partings as described by Palm seem almost antiseptic, even when Benny cheats on Frida with (gasp!) a journalist. The dissolutions feel more like a Bergman movie than \\"A Star Is Born,\\" but that's not Palm's fault.<br /><br />Palm does a fine job with the story at hand, telling it in a Joe Friday \\"just-the-facts\\" kind of way that commands respect and a healthy amount of interest. He takes care to give us a perspective of the band in its time and place, and notes how badly Abba's music was received in its own homeland because of its excessive commerciality. (People digging your sound meant something was wrong with you, comrade.) He analyzes key moments in the band's creative development with commendable detachment and fairness. It's nice to see he doesn't pile on the negativity over the 1979 album \\"Voulez-Vouz\\" or praise 1977's \\"The Album\\" as the band's finest hour as others do. He's an especially biting critic after the band breaks up, even ragging on \\"Chess,\\" but he's careful to always give credit to Benny's tuneful genius, Bjorn's often-clever way with a lyric, and the way Frida and Agnetha's voices, when joined together, created a unique \\"third voice\\" which gave the band much of its urgency and power.<br /><br />I wish he was more willing to take us inside the band by painting some individual scenes in greater detail, making us feel like actual witnesses rather than readers of a police report, even a very good one. Guess the Swedes don't practice New Journalism too much. I didn't get much of a feeling of who the Abba band members really were, except that beyond their era-defining brilliance they seem a bit cold and dull. The only vibrant character, manager Stig Anderson, blusters and rants on the sidelines much of the time as Palm focuses on the band.<br /><br />But what's here is good enough. Its an absorbing, thorough, and sober-sided account of the life and death of one of pop's most successful and misunderstood bands.

It purports to tell the true-life story of a group of undercover police officers, most of Mexican descent, who work steathily to entice robbers preying on the heavy illegal alien traffic flowing into San Diego County from Baja California into attacking them, then turning the tables on their would-be victimizers.<br /><br />I'm in awe because it reads like fiction, with deep insights into the professional and personal lives of each of the policemen who are part of the BARF (Border Alien Robbery Force) team. We find out how they spend their off-hours, drinking and cheating on their wives with the sort of abandon of the cheerfully doomed. We discover how much they come to dislike one another, and particularly their leader, a hotshot in disco chains named Manny Lopez. The action sequences are riveting, and you get a real flavor for the desolate highlands these officers probe, and the desperate characters, both deadly and vulnerable, that they come across.<br /><br />But it reads too much like fiction. These guys either opened up to Wambaugh to a degree few ever do, not even to a very good, empathetic writer who asks all the right questions, or else the writer went the New Journalism route and extrapolated a lot of the inner monologues each of these officers have from time to time. I wonder about the former approach (cops are notoriously taciturn, even with each other or someone like Wambaugh who's obviously skilled at drawing them out) and question the validity of the latter, if used.<br /><br />Despite the numerous offenses against man, society, and God cataloged here, Wambaugh apparently didn't leave these guys so much out to dry that they got angry. It wouldn't be a good idea angering these guys, but how did he manage it, given the story we have here? I just wish there was some Author's Note explaining the access issue. All we have is the firm statement at the outset \\"This Is A True Story.\\" Yes, sure, but are these the real characters? Did he do one of those magazine-writer tricks of folding in multiple characters to create fictional hybrids? Did he use pseudonyms? I'd love to know.<br /><br />The dialogue is brilliant, the writerly asides masterful and witty, and a crisp narrative pulls you through quickly while asking the question of when a good impulse (protecting aliens who are being savaged by gangsters while trying to illegally enter your country) become a really bad practice. By the final third of the book, the cops are strung-out adrenaline junkies probing into Mexican territory and looking for conflict, not the sort of characters you want representing your country in a sensitive border region.<br /><br />Was this really what they were like?
