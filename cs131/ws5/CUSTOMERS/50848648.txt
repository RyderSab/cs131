Looking for a Christmas tale that's, well, *different* from all the rest? Then just ask Santa to stuff your stocking with this off-the-wall, squirt-milk-through-your-nose-lauging-out-loud little novel from the comically zesty mind of Christopher Moore.<br /><br />The subtitle says it all: It's heartwarming. It's a tale of terror (but it is NOT a dessert topping, nor a floor wax).<br /><br />It has Santa, but he gets whacked -- dead -- with a shovel. It has an angel, but he's not too smart: his mission to grant a Christmas wish quickly runs afoul of the law after he's reported to the local police for stalking the town for \\"a young boy.\\" It has love. And heartache. And a dope-smoking cop. And a schizophrenic warrior princess who really needs to get back on her meds. Oh, yeah -- it's also got a sunglassed fruit bat. And zombies. Almost forgot the Christmas zombies.<br /><br />What more could one ask for during the holidays?<br /><br />Buy the book, read it aloud (to your ADULT loved-ones), and share the joy -- and horror -- of the holidays in this wacky, weird, and always entertaining tale.	2004-11-13

Paul Wilson wastes no time pulling readers into his thriller SIMS: genetically engineered human/chimp workers who yearn for \\"family\\" but are maintained simply as property. But a small group of these \\"sims\\" have asked a lawyer to help them form a union, and a government employee is working with a masked man to uncover sim abuses.... Before long, they will all find themselves going up against the biggest corporation in the world -- and a shadowy organization -- that will do anything to stop them.<br /><br />Like the best thriller writers, Wilson has crafted an intricate plot based right on the edge of modern science and possibility. Unlike some of the more popular thriller novelists, Wilson is more thoughtful in his development of the story line... His story builds more slowly than, say, a Michael Chrichton or Dan Brown, but eventually reaches the same page-turner pace.<br /><br />And also like many of these other writers, Wilson's writing falters when it comes to characters: They are cursorily interesting, but not very believable. With the exception of some of the Sim, none of the characters is particularly believable. Indeed, they come across rather cartoony.<br /><br />All told, I find it a minor fault in an otherwise good book. SIMS remains a very readable sci-fi thriller if one is willing to overlook an all-too-common problem with the genre.	2004-11-01

First, this is a DK book and like all DK books, it reinforces and supports a spare narrative with many photos, illustrations, lists, etc.<br /><br />That said, this is really a great book for a person who wants an introduction to the \\"big ideas\\" (and thus, the \\"big philosophers\\") in the history of western philosophy. Magee succinctly summarizes some grand philosophical ideas while telling us about the philosophers themselves.<br /><br />The many illustrations and graphics help relate the philosophical ideas to works of art, to other disciplines (notably music and literature), and  -- ultimately -- to our daily lives.<br /><br />Obviously, this book is not meant to be a comprehensive view of any philosopher or philosophical approach. But it is a thoughtful, engaging, entertaining, and READABLE book -- a very rare find in any philosophy book.<br /><br />Any reader of STORY OF PHILOSOPHY will learn enough to know, at the least, if they would like to continue exploring philosophy or not.	2004-11-01

IT MUST'VE BEEN SOMETHING I ATE was my introduction to Jeffrey Steingarten; I found it to be a zesty tome of tasty morsels.<br /><br />Steingarten's essays (collected from VOGUE magazine) recount his forays into the world of haute cuisine. Despite moving in the upper echelon of the culinary world, Steingarten comes across as a giddy uber-gourmand-geek, travelling the world, the country, and every street in New York City, in search of the best (as he defines it) of everything when it comes to food.<br /><br />From his trek across the Big Apple with his high-tech spot-thermometer to measure pizza-oven temperatures, to his southern tour of Lousiana in search of the origins of \\"turducken\\", Steingarten writes in a sly \\"don't you wish you were here\\" style. He often pokes fun at his near-maniacal enterprises to prepare (seemingly) things like a cup of espresso or a loaf of bread, but he never (well, hardly ever) pokes fun at the food -- at least not the idea of food. Good food. Really, REALLY good food.<br /><br />Like a grand multiple course meal, Steingarten is best taken in small amounts -- an essay here, another there -- so that one doesn't get too full too quickly nor become overwhelmed at the sheer richness and complexity of each individual dish. Indeed, taken in moderate proportions, IT MUST'VE BEEN SOMETHING I ATE leaves one well-sated and wanting more.	2004-10-30

When a noted biblical scholar recommended this book, I knew I had to read it. All I can say is \\"Thank God for biblical scholars!\\"<br /><br />Locked in a hotel room by the angel Raziel, Biff writes his gospel of Jesus, from his unique perspective as Jesus' life-long pal and sidekick. As Jesus travels throughout the Middle and Far East -- learning what he must learn to understand and accept his fate as the Son of God -- Biff tags along to avoid hard labor,to keep Jesus out of trouble, oh, and to pickup chicks. Oh well, 2 out of 3 ain't bad...<br /><br />LAMB is probably the best Bible-inspired comedy since Monty Python's film LIFE OF BRIAN. Irreverent, thought-provoking, laugh-out-loud funny, and even touching, Moore has written THE biblical \\"buddy film\\" book (ROAD TO REDEMPTION anyone?) that every fan of great humor needs to read.<br /><br />It may not save your soul, but it would be a sin to miss out on all the fun.	2004-10-27

I have to admit: this is only the second ONE MINUTE MANAGER book I have read. While I appreciate the brevity and conciseness Blanchard uses in these books, I find the stories he wraps these messages in to be, well, trite. That said, I found THE ONE MINUTE APOLOGY to be of interest enough to overlook that drawback. Sure, it's still a rather silly story delivering the message, but the message itself is solid, rock-solid.<br />A recurring complaint of the ONE MINUTE MANAGER approach is that it routinely over-simplifies complex subjects. Well.... yeah, it does, and thank goodness. Life is complicated enough. Business moreso. What people need, what people want are simple solutions to help them solve problems or at least get STARTED solving a problem. This is where the ONE MINUTE APOLOGY is successful: it takes a very complex (and emotional) issue and gives the reader a very easy step-by-step approach to making amends when it's appropriate and necessary.<br />Is there more to the act of \\"apologizing\\"? Are people affected by others' actions more deeply than this book implies? Is it more difficult to really show someone you've offended that you've truly changed your ways? Perhaps.<br />But this book goes a long way in helping people start down the road to reconciliation by offering up a simple way to say \\"I'm sorry\\" in a meaningful manner.	2004-03-27

Along the way he learns the truth about his mother's death and the odd way a father's love can sometimes express itself.<br />Never schlocky or succumbing to sentimentality, THE CURIOUS INCIDENT is funny, touching, and challenging. The audio edition is one of the best audiobooks I've listened to in recent past. Jeff Woodman's performance enhances the story throughout the narrative.<br />Don't be surprised if you find yourself driving out of your way just so you can keep listening.	2004-03-06

It's fitting that this audio edition contains guests and narrators like Stephen Fry, Richard Dawkins, Terry Gilliam, et. al. In addition to helping bring this wonderful collection of Adam's work to life, they bring an additional sense of connection to the man behind (within?) the words.<br />Some fans of Adams fiction may not like the extensive nonfiction pieces included, but those people will miss out on some of the best gems of Adams' wit and wisdom. Most others, though, will realize that there is a vast archive of columns and articles, letters and speeches, (many published outside the U.S.) that we have missed.<br />In all of the pieces, nonfiction and fiction, Adams' crisp humor and prodding logic will make you giggle, laugh, and most of all, wonder at this gloriously silly thing we call life.<br />Listen to this many times... and don't forget your towel.	2004-03-06

Still, it is Rumpole that one truly reads for, and Mortimer has once again crafted a comfortable but multi-layered lead character who is at once off-putting and likable, plain-spoken yet charmingly witty. Although Mortimer plays with the Rumpole character and the traditional Rumpole story  -- if only slightly but always successfully -- one gets the idea that he wanted to really have some fun with Rumpole should this be their last outing together. And the result is that we all have fun.<br />Indeed, reading Rumpole is like sitting with a favorite uncle as he regales you with tale after tale -- you always want there to be just one more story, one more evening with a larger than life character that you love.	2004-03-04

Just in time for the 21st century, Dan Brown jumps to the top of the mass-market suspense/thriller genre with a handful of intricately plotted and furiously paced novels. The best of these -- despite the incredible sales and longevity of THE DA VINCI CODE -- is by far ANGELS &amp; DEMONS.<br />Propelling it's lead character (symbologist Robert Langdon) and readers into an enigmatic plot that unwinds page by page, ANGELS &amp; DEMONS touches on science, religion, history, art, architecture... With every turn of the page, you descend deeper and faster into a story in which the very existence of God hangs in the balance.<br />The characters are thin, their motivations and actions are sometimes odd, but the relentless plot pushes you onward. The historical elements are recognizable enough to make you wonder about the truth of these details, but not overbearing. The pace is so quick anyway that you won't have enough time to be slowed down.<br />ANGELS &amp; DEMONS isn't aspiring to be a history lesson, a scientific thesis, or a critical essay, but it DOES aspire, quite successfully, to be a no-rest-for-the weary, no-holds-barred, white-knuckled, page-turner of a thriller.<br />Sometimes that's all you need.	2004-03-04

Okay, more than pleased. This is one of those books that is so well crafted, so intricately plotted, so challenging in it's theme and tone, that by the time you're done reading it, all you can say is, &quot;Wow!&quot;<br />Early in the book, the main character claims that this story will prove the existence of God... I don't know about that, but it's a story that accomplishes what great art of any type does: it sneeks up on you with its beauty and form, and then it gets you thinking.<br />A true masterpiece, LIFE OF PI will stir up your mind and never let you forget that you read it.	2003-12-10

Mitchell and Coles successfully present the argument for &quot;why&quot; to focus on continuous business model innovation and then show you &quot;where&quot; and &quot;how&quot; to work the model in your own company...<br />But don't think that this book is just another dumbed down, hastily written business book from some wishful management guru. It's not. THE ULTIMATE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE is solidly researched and thoughtfully written. It's a serious book for people who are serious about creating a successful business for the long term. The 3rd chapter alone is one of the best examinations of cost-cutting techniques you'll ever find and well worth the price of the book, but happily the entire book is just as useful, applicable, and valuable, which indeed makes it a rarity.<br />Mitchell and Coles have created one of those infrequent stars in the business book constellation that deserve 'must-read' status.

Based on the many positive blurbs from other well-known writers that appeared on the cover, I picked this one up thinking it might be a grand introduction to a great writer I had somehow overlooked all these years. Having read it now, I feel that neither the introduction or the oversight was all that grand.<br />Matheson takes a classic thriller idea -- one man hunts another in the wilderness -- and loses it in a wild, untamed land of unlikable, unbelievable characters and less-than-possible plot twists. Despite being well-written when it comes to style, HUNTED PAST REASON is not written well enough that one suspends all reason or disbelief to get thoroughly lost in the story.<br />If you're hunting for a good thriller, you're on the wrong trail with this one.	2003-09-16

That's the core message -- and starting point -- of Scott Sheperd's new book attacking what he calls the &quot;stress myth,&quot; the popular belief that stress is some mysterious force that we cannot control, only manage.<br />Sheperd refuses to buy into that theory, and quickly shows how absurd most modern conceptions of stress really are. In a no-bull, plain-speaking style, he shows readers how they can overcome the sense of overwhelm and frustration that &quot;stress&quot; creates. His ideas are not the mere pie-in-the-sky, think-positive-and-it's-all-good ideas, but truly useful approaches that anyone can use to enjoy life more each and every day.<br />One of the best self-help gems of 2002, WHO'S IN CHARGE? is a must-read for those seeking sane, sensible ideas to conquer the stress and control their own lives.	2003-04-14

Marketing guru Levinson declares all-out guerilla warfare on cheesy, ineffective, downright bad advertising and marketing with this book on a marketing approach that could transform the marketplace.<br />While the &quot;memes&quot; concept has been around for some time, Levinson is one of the first to apply and evaluate the concept in the marketing arena. And, as the Godfather of guerilla marketing -- with it's emphasis on low- and no-cost techniques -- Levinson gives readers a well-thought, and reasonably documented analysis of how a single powerful meme can propel a business or product to the public eye, generating business (and more importantly, REVENUE) almost without effort.<br />He also provides many examples of memes that work, tells why they work, and then shows readers how they can get started creating their own memes.<br />An engaging, easily read book, GUERILLA CREATIVITY is one of Levinson's best yet with little fluff [a fun, but overlong comparison of marketing &amp; seduction] and a ton of useful information [especially on generating and developing ideas].

It examines the major schools and philosophers with enough depth to understand the development of the science, but not enough to overwhelm or, worse yet, bore.

For a quaint Scottish town there's plenty of murders that take place there.

Beaton continues to shine and really shows her stuff not when she deals with the murder but as she develops the Macbeth character.

Unlike much of today's so-called journalistic profiling, Mortimer approaches his subjects with a respectful distance that allows for more honest reporting and subtler observation. He always keeps the subjects -- and what they say -- as the center of attention.<br />Mortimer fans will not want to miss this one.	2000-11-16

Lyndsey Davis does it again -- and better -- by bringing back her gumshoe (sandal!?) hero, Didius Falco.<br />Having forestalled an attempt to overthrow the empire, Falco continues working for the emperor on projects here and there... This book picks up as Falco is in the process of some (cough, cough) &quot;cleaning up&quot; for the emperor. As he does so, he uncovers some shady goings-on that once again threaten the throne.<br />Sent to discover what's going on, Falco and friends travel across the Italian countryside to the oceanside resorts in the south. There he searches for a mysterious ex-slave who holds the key to the mystery of murder and mayhem that sent him on his way.<br />Falco fans will love this one -- and first time readers will marvel at the intricate story, the historical detail, and the likable (or in some cases, not-so-likable) characters who seem to leap of the page. Davis is a master of character and dialog who easily propels her cast (and her readers) through an exciting story of murder, intrique, betrayal, and love...	2000-11-14

Steven Saylor's historical mystery is a good read for fans of the genre, especially those attracted to Roman history.<br />This is the story of Gordianus, a finder (private detective), hired by a youngish Cicero who is defending a man charged with the horrific crime of patricide. The more Gordianus delves into the mystery, of course, the more it unravels until it becomes a tale that touches even the emperor himself.<br />A skilled writer, Saylor takes the reader on a tour through Roman daily life that most will enjoy. His eye for detail is superb, albeit wordy... There are a few occasions where, just as he's picking up the pace, you're thrust into page after page of too-much narrative, as if our narrator Gordianus has all the time in the world to tell his story (which he does not).<br />By the end, however, Saylor finishes the story with enough flair to make you want to see what Gordianus does on his next case. Luckily, this is just the first of a series of Gordianus the Finder books so the history-mystery fan will be able to sate his desire quickly -- and frequently.	2000-11-14

Didius Falco returns in this second book of the Falco series. Having helped the Emperor solve the plot from SILVER PIGS, Falco is now engaged to do some follow-up work -- disposing of a body or two -- but discovers that things are far from over.<br />Before he knows it, Falco is off, once again, pulling at the threads of rebellion that threaten to unravel the just-settled state of Roman affairs. --And it not just affairs of state that threaten to unravel.... Didius must carefully negotiate his developing relationship with socialite Helena Justina while at the same time assisting his teen-aged nephew (send along to look after Falco) negotiate love and life.<br />Davis proved that her first book was no fluke by crafting another intricate, enticing plot filled with characters that come to life with every word. Her dialog is sharp. Her narration (for the most part) witty and well-paced. Top it off with a lot of attention to historical detail mixed with a dash of anachronistic gumshoe-detecting and what you get is this page-turning delight.	2000-11-09

Short on the hoped-for graphics and illustrations but  long on information, the Oxford Companion proves its worth when one is  looking for an appropriate overview of various archaeological topics. Just  enough cross-referencing to excite one's imagination and more than enough  to whet one's appetite to dig even deeper into archaeology and all that is  has to teach us.	2000-09-06

Luckily, Beaton's dialog is snappy, enough so that you can  overlook some two-dimensionality in supporting characters and some all too  heavy-handed contrivance plot-wise. Then too, the Hamish MacBeth character  is so very interesting and well thought, that whatever character flaws  there may be in the book, you don't care as long as you can spend some time  with MacBeth....<br />....And you do get to spend most of the last half of the  book with MacBeth, puzzling out the mystery and scrounging free tea and  sandwiches from the locals. Not a bad way to spend day.	2000-09-04

John Mortimer continues his classic Rumpole series in this delightful  collection of stories, proof that some things do get better with age.<br />London lawyer Horace Rumpole eagerly seeks out the lowliest criminal  cases to keep himself well stocked of the local plonk and his missus, She  Who Must Be Obeyed, off his back. Surrounded by a cast of quirky supporting  characters, the aging Rumpole continues his quest for justice.<br />Like all  of Mortimer's work, the Rumpole stories are deftly written in a style so  casual, so seemingly transparent, that you finish reading before you're  prepared to. Perfect for the fan of humorous fiction and well-defined  characters, the 3rd Rumpole Omnibus is a treat!	2000-09-01

I was hoping it would be much  more breezy, direct, and to-the-point. Perhaps I expected too much, having  been introduced to Burke and CONNECTIONS via the television series.<br />The  proposal that people, ideas, inventions, and events are connected across  the history of time and man is intriquing. The facts Burke presents are  interesting, yet mired at times in too much detail. The casual,  non-scientifically knowledgable types (like me) face some slow, rough  reading at points.<br />By the end, though, where Burke ties-in and connects  his major ideas, you'll have enjoyed the trip you took through history....  just be prepared to take your time getting there.	2000-08-31

As a movie lover, I was intrigued with the theme of this book -- how  movies have shaped our culture, our thinking -- and was prepared for a  heavy, textbook-like reading. As I read, though, I was overwhelmed with  O'Briens style, his sterling craftsmanship in describing the feelings and  emotions of the movies. I would literally stop after every few lines and  shake my head in amazement. As a writer, I am jealous of his skill. As a  reader, I am eager to read it again.<br />Steve Martin said (in L.A. STORY)  that &quot;a kiss may not be the truth, but it's what we wish was the  truth.&quot; I do not know if O'Brien's book is THE truth about movies in  the modern mind but, oh, how I hope that it is.	2000-08-29
