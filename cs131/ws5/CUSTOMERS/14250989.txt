I had a tape of his when I was a teen and loved his humor and wisdom.  However, I have heard from enough sources to know he is a liar and maybe not a Christian after all. Jesus warned us that not everyone who says, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom. He also said we will recognize false prophets by the fruit they bear. In other words, action speaks louder than words. How sad that Mike isn't what he seemed. I am glad though, Jesus is, and I am reminded he(and his word) is the only one I can totally trust.  <br />\\"Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.\\" Proverbs	2005-10-12

I noticed improvement about 6 weeks after starting it. I am still seeing improvement 2 years later. It hasn't cured me, but I am thankful to experience real improvement. It seems like most fms sufferers get a little help here and a little help there. We must keep going forward, being thankful for any lessoning of our pain. Step by step we will get better. It may take time, but that's just the way it is. I don't see why so many people think this program is so hard. It's a bit hard, but I have had so many treatments that were much more inconvienent and downright painful (shots, colonics, physical therapy). I hope my testimony gives people hope and determination. Health is worth any amount of time and money. And by the way, this treatment is a lot less expensive than most treatments by m.d.'s and has no side effects!	2005-09-26

Most of the non fiction Christian teen stuff I read was written by people whom I considered geeks. S. Christian actually understands teens. He isn't condescending at all and is honest about the struggles he went through at that age. Full of great Bible verses as well as quotes from authors, preachers, etc. I highly recommend youth pastors buy a copy for their church library. I also think it would make a good Christmas present for caring parents to buy for their teens.	2005-09-21

It was one of my favorite books when I was about 4. The illustrations are great and the story is charming. It is about family, parents and two kids, along with their dog Jip and kitten, Mittens. My favorite parts were when the Farmer scratched the pig's back with a stick. (\\"oink, Oink! He is very pleased.) I also loved the part when family friends come for a visit and have delicious chocolate cake. (Uncle Tom had 3 pieces!) A charming story to read to your little ones. Get a copy while you still can. Your kids will love you for it.  <br />Also, if you are looking for another great book for kids 3-6, try \\"Scarlett Monste Lives Here\\". It's not available on amazon, but I have seen it available on ebay several times. It is not a little golden book.	2005-09-12

I am taking a long time to finish it because it is so deep. It is easy reading, but in order to get much out of it you really have to read it slowly and of course change your wrong behavior, one step at a time. I like the fact that the author tells you that change does take time. It seldom happens overnight. Very comforting for someone who wants to see huge changes overnight. I also like that she encourages you to have a relationship with God. He is the only one whom we are  supposed to be codependent with. Eveyone else is imperfect, just like me.  .	2005-09-11

Birdie was the only likeable character in my opinion. I thought Leeda was so pathetically insecure, shallow, and selfish, and Murphy was an irresponsible, dishonest floozy. Neither one was very admirable. I thought Birdie was more honest, mature, and hardworking than the other two. It wasn't a horrible book though. I thought the ending was nice.  The three girls changed for the better. I wish they had shown more of the moms' changes. They were all so distant from their own daughters.	2005-09-10

(My first is A Gown of Spanish Lace.)I am currently rereading it for about the tenth time and once again falling in love with all the characters.   It is about a somewhat pampered and sheltered young woman named Elizabeth who decides to accept a teaching position in western Canada where life is  backward compared to her hometown.  She encounters a few obstacles with courage and spunk.  She adores her students and is an awesome teacher and role model.    She is determined not to marry right away, but when an attractive Mountie comes into her life, her mind changes.  Mine would too if I met someone like Wynn! Jannette Oke has good taste in men. :)  I highly recommend the entire Canadian West Series for  females ages 15 and up. I especially love the first 2 of the series.  It is easy to fall in love with both the characters and Canada.   In order to really enjoy an Oke book you really have to read it slowly. So if you don't have the time and patience to spend a few days quietly reading a book, this isn't for you.I often have a hard time settling down for the first chapter or two of her novels since they are slowpaced, but then I am able to really get into the story and am glad I decided to slow down and smell the roses.  I hope someday Hallmark (or anyone else)makes this book into a movie.	2005-07-15

I thought it was very unrealistic how quickly the two young ladies became friends considering they didn't speak the same language.  This action was sooooooooooooooooo slow.  I prefer Oke's more exciting books like the Canadian West series, A Woman Named Damaris, and A Gown of Spanish Lace.

I first got into it when my 2nd grade teacher read it to our class.     It is about a dog, Ribsy, who is very much loved by his owner Henry Huggins.  He climbs out of his family's car in a shopping mall parking lot and decides to do a bit of exploring.  He then decides he wants to go back to the family car and go home, but he can't identify the car.  He tries to find his way back home, but can't find the way.  Many people take him into their homes but he is never content to stay.    Kids who own pets of their own will be able to relate to Henry's sadness over his missing dog, and his determination to find him no matter what.    The illustrations are adorable.	2005-07-14

I did enjoy it back then and recently got a copy.   <br />It is about a chubby little girl who takes ballet lessons and is the target for teasing from the snooty girls in her class.  Her only friend at ballet is a girl who is self concious because she is so skinny.   <br />For the recital Casey gets the part of a tree.  She wanted a bigger part and is disapointed.  However, she decides to make the best of the situation and be the most graceful tree she can be.  She does a terrific job and her self esteem soars.   <br />It has great illustrations.  My only concern, though, is that I don't know how overweight kids would react to this book.  I was not chubby as a child, so I didn't take offense when I read the cruel remarks kids said to Casey. I am not sure if a chubby kid would feel inspired by this book, or just more depressed about their weight.	2005-07-10

It usually takes me 3 weeks to finish a 300 page book!      I could definitely relate to twenty something Emily who is dying to get out of her small town and change the world.  I have also longed to go to New York, but after reading this book I can tell I wouldn't be happy living there, just visiting would be all I could take. Like Emily, I am too conservative and family oriented for the rat race.      I really enjoyed the parts about Emily's boss's quirks.  I laughed out loud over the part when he comes to work dressed as Darth Vadar.        Seeing Emily dump her hypocrite \\"Christian\\" boyfriend was awesome.  It was great seeing how her feelings for her small town geeky guy friend changed.  He was so likable and I was relieved when she started being less superficial and starting looking at the heart of men, rather than just the outward appearance.      I have only one complaint about this book.  (That is why I didn't give it 5 stars)  I did not like that Emily started drinking on a regular basis.  She came to New York with very little drinking experience, and by the end of the book she was going out for drinks with her friends several times a week.  What a waste of money, not to mention a poor witness to her non believer coworkers.  I know it is okay to drink once in awhile, like Jesus did, but she seemed to really become passionate about wine and martinis.  It is easy for anyone to become an alchoholic, none of us are immune. I think she could've matured more and learned to spend her money in a Christ-like way, not on booze and designer clothing she couldn't afford.      Other than that, it was a fabulous book for young women and I sincerely hope the authors write a sequel.  I am dying to know if Emily marries, if Lane becomes a Christian, if her friendship with Jenna continues, and what kind of new job she gets. I was amazed when I saw a picture of the authors at theback of the book.  They don't look over 25!  What talented young ladies.	2005-07-05

I had been looking forward to reading it for years, but just didn't get around to it. I was pretty disapointed when I finally did.  It is about a teenage girl named Annie who weds at a young age in part to escape her sexually abusive step father.  She longs for an education like her husband Carl has.  Even though she cannot afford college, she does learn a lot by sitting outside the college classrooms and listening to the professor's lectures.  I found the parts about their scruffy stray dog \\"Jello\\"  pretty amusing, but not much else.  I guess I expected it to be as good as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn which only took me about 4 days to read.  Joy in the Morning took me about 6 weeks to finish.  It was so slow.  However, I can see it being inspiring for teens I guess who long for a better home life and education.	2005-07-02

Obviously, this was one of my favorite childhood books. It is a book about a ten year old girl who goes to a cottage on a lake with her parents and annoying older sister for a summer vacation.  Sheila is terrfied of the whole experience- meeting new people, the weird dog they have to take care of, participating in a play, and taking swimming lessons. I still get a kick out of it, because when I was Sheila's age, I was a lot like her- fearful of most everything, especially swimming.  The wonderful thing is though, like Sheila, I got over most of my fears, in large part due to my parents' encouragement and determination.  I love all the characters especially  Sheila's new pal \\"Mouse\\" who is a yo- yo champion who helps her get over some of her fears.  I think all kids, both male and female, between 8-12 would love this book.  It is one of the few non- trashy/gross Judy Blume books that I would recommend to children.

Anyhoo, this book is about a 15 year old named Isobel that has a perfect life, but then one day her world is turned upside down after getting in the car with a drunk driver. The driver, her teen date Marco, crashes into a tree which injures Isobel and causes her to have her leg removed.  Marco never apologizes for what he did, which ticked me off to you know where.  I wish there was a sequel to this book so you could see Marco get punished and a bit of justice done for Isobel and her family.  This book is pretty depressing, definitely not for a kid under 13, but is a great story about how bad things can happen to nice people and how breaking the law never pays. It is also about discovering whom your real friends are and learning not to judge people simply by their outward appearance.  This would be a great book I think for high school freshman to read.	2005-06-28

It is a touching and humorous story about a young girl named Opal forced to deal with the absense of her mother, a distraught preacher father, and the difficulty of  making friends. She finally makes some friends with the help of a stray mutt that comes into her life.  She names him Winn Dixie after the grocery store where she finds him.  She takes him home to meet her dad and begs him to let her keep him.  The dog's charms immediately melt his heart and help him start feeling more joy and connection to his daughter whom he has been emotionally distant from ever since his wife left.  Opal learns to make friends with people who are considered outcasts.  What I learned most from the book is the importance of not judging someone based on their outward appearance or on rumors and gossip.  You have to take people as you find them, and give them a chance to show their true selves. That requires patience, faith, and forgiveness. I think this book would be great for the 8-11 year old crowd, because they are just leaving their childhood innocence and starting to become \\"wordly\\" and judge and fear others based on superficial things. However, I think it appeals to adults as well.  This would be a great book for grandparents to read with their grandkids.  I don't think this book would be appropriate for a kid under 8, though.	2005-06-26

His book on dating is based on the truths stated in the Word of God, not his own made up rules.  I really like how he made the point that God is who we are supposed to love most. If you are't complete in him, you will never have a good dating or married life.  You cannot find everything you need in a significant other, only in God.  I also liked how he mentioned that is okay to desire romance and sex.  God made us that way.  It's just not supposed to be our obsession. I deeply appreciated Jeramy's wisdom and humility.  He certainly doesn't claim to have all the answers nor promote a cookie cutter way of dating.  I personally believe the Holy Spirit is to be our guide more than anyone or anything else.  God himself is the creator or romance and wants to be control of that aspect of our lives.     Prov. 3:5-6	2005-05-09

He is so in love with God and his word, and is so funny and uplifting.  This book was very helpful to me when I went through a very difficult time due to illness.  I especially loved the part about Joseph, the man in the old testament who was betrayed by his brothers and thrown into prison, but about a dozen years later became a powerful leader. What I learned most from this book is that God works in mysterious ways and makes all things beautiul in his time.  With him all things are possible, and all things work together for good to those who love him and are called according to his purpose.  God cannot forget about his children, even if he does allow pain.  He does finish the good work he began in us.  What I appreciate too about this book is that it is short and to the point. When you are in pain and tired physically and emotionally, is can be hard to read a long, heavy book.  This encouraging and  empathizing book is perfect.	2005-05-09

I started watching Life Goes On back in 1989 through 1993.  It is still my favorite all time show.  I taped about half the episodes. ( I just wish i could find out where you can buy them...I'd love to have the whole show on tape) I had no idea how many obstacles, due to his condition of Down Syndrome, Chris had to overcome before becoming an actor.  His faith in God and himself is so inspiring.  Even his family tried to discourage him from thinking he was going to be a Hollywood star someday, but he obviously had a vision and stopped at nothing to achieve his dreams.  I love that his disabilty is not his identity.  He rises far above any trial.  I also found out many interesing facts from his Life Goes On costars.  He and Kellie Martin's friendship was so strong, they were like siblings. He sometimes had to deal with actors who thought they were above him and were very impatient and patronizing with Chris.  Chris really is a \\"normal\\" person with normal desires- to fall in love, be treated with respect, make his own living, and take care of his loved ones.  Whether or not you have seen his show or movies, I recommend you read this book, especially if you are disabled or know someone who is. You don't have to be afraid of someone who looks and sounds a bit different than you. Chris really changed my heart and mind.  He has more wisdom than anyone I know.    P.S.( afew months later) Hey Life Goes on fans, I just found out the first season of the show will be released in the summer of 2006!  I can't wait to buy it. I hope they will release all four seasons.	2005-05-09
US	14250989	R3GV0AL5GEKCII	0310205719	36906356	The Purpose Driven Life	Books	4	1	7	N	N	good book for fellowship groups and adult sunday school	My 2nd review.....   I decided to add more to my review after reading all the terrible reviews of this book.     One of the reviewers said that the Old Testament wasn't quoted at all. That is a lie. It is not quoted as much as the new, but about 25 % of the verses are from the OT. Just check out the notes section at the back of the book if you don't believe me. There are scriptures from Job, the Psalms, Proverbs, Jeremiah, etc.   A lot of people criticized this book for sounding like a name it and claim it kind of thing. Nothing could be further from the truth. Just reread chapter 10 and you will see what I mean. We are hear for God's enjoyment and eternal plan. We are all called to seek his kingdom first and then all these things shall be added unto you as well. In other words, we are to seek holiness first, and then happiness will follow. Not happiness as in getting every single thing we want in life and having all our dreams come true, but a different kind- peace,deep-down joy, and contentment, things that wordly people don't know personally.  I didn't read anything unbiblical in this book. Yeah, I agree with the reviewers who said all the different scripture translations were overwhelming, but since I am so used to either the NIV or King James, it was nice to hear some familiar verses phrased slightly (and I do mean slightly) differently. The original bible was written in Greek and since I don't know Greek, I can't read it exactly the way the prophets wrote it, so I don't judge all the interpretations. In Romans 1 we are told not to quarrel too much over words.  Rick Warren is not perfect. Neither am I. Only Jesus Christ is. So if you put your all your hope in Rick(or any other Christian or other person) you will be disapointed. Instead let the Holy spirit teach you through Rick's book and especially the Bible verses and keep your eyes on Christ. God does use his children to spread the word, be leaders, etc, but he is a jealous God who wants us to look to Him as the final authority.   I couldn't believe the nerve of the reviewer who said Rick Warren isn't a Christian. While he does sound like a Christian to me, of course I cannot know for certain because I am not God. There are many false teachers and prophets. But his teaching is Biblical and the word tells us that false teachers twist scripture and that they don't practice what they preach.  The bible also tells us to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling, so I think you should leave the judging up to Jesus Christ, the head of the church.  I recommend everyone to pray before each chapter and ask the Holy Spirit to speak to you. Let Him be your guide. Everyone needs to hear different things and focus on different verses, so let God speak to you as an individual.  Ok, here is my original review........      My young adult bible study read and discussed this book about 2 years ago.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, but didn't find all the answers  I was looking for.  Rick Warren seemed to focus mainly on God's generic plan for all our lives, rather than his individual plan for our lives.  So, if you are looking for a quick fix book with all the answers, this isn't it.  However I still got a lot out of it, even though I did't receive a vision like I hoped to.  I was reminded of how important my personal relationship with Jesus Christ is, how the main ways to get to know him are praying to him, listening to him, and reading and obeying the Bible (basically seeking the kingdom first).  I also was reminded of the importance of fellowship with  other believers.  They are in no way supposed to take the place of the Holy Spirit, but they are used by God to correct, encourage, pray with me, etc.They also remind me that I am not crazy for believing that Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven.  I appreciated that Rick didn't try to promote any one denomination.  His emphasis was on the gospel of Christ.  His book reminded me that God does have a purpose for me, even if I don'tyet know what exactly it is.  All of us have one same purpose, to love God and become more like his son Jesus Christ and to follow him wherever he leads us. That is what life is all about - to be friends with God!  That is possible because of the sacrifice of Jesus which opened the door to forgivness and eternal life.  Life on earth is just a preperation for heaven -if you believe in Christ. Without Christ, eternal life wouldn't be possible, only eternal death.	2005-05-09
US	14250989	R2J4B1S6VYT0CD	0449208281	678031855	The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax	Books	5	5	5	N	N	terrific cozy mystery	If you are like me and crave a good mystery but one without a lot of gory violence, than the Mrs. Pollifax series is for you.  We are introduced to the sweet widow in this first book as someone who is nieve, honest, a bit depressed, but by the end of the book becomes more openminded, guarded and purposeful.  She tells her doctor she is depressed and bored and secretly longs to be a spy.  He of course just laughs and prescribes and antidepressant.  She however takes control and marches down to the CIA headquarters and volunteers her services.  Through a mix up she does in fact become an agent and a darn good one at that.  She travels to 3 countries within a week and even commits her first murder. (It was really just self defence.) Her escape is intense and yet humorous.  When I first read this book as a teen, I didn't really see much humor in it, but I do now.  One of the funniest parts to me is when Mrs. Pollifax learns to cuss( but then of course apologizes.) I think this book would interest males of females over 16 years old.	2005-04-04

When I was in junior high, my mom and grandmother recommended I read it, but it sounded so dorky and old fashioned that I never gave it a try.  Even my best friend whom I considered \\"cool\\" told me how great it was, but I didn't believe her.  I saw the 1998 movie when I was about 22 and that led me to finally read the book.  I was surprised that the book was even better than the movie.  I think this should be on teen's summer reading lists. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is definitely still relavant.	2005-03-19
US	14250989	R2OEXCVT5GCXKY	0671004239	589139798	The Locket	Books	5	3	3	N	N	marvelous book	If you are looking for a romance that is based on true love, not lust, then this is the book for you.  The first book I read by the extremely talented Richard Paul Evans was The Carousel, the sequel to The Locket.  I didn't realize it was part of a series, I just thought the cover looked interesting, so I checked it out.  I fell in love with the characters and knew I had to read the first.  Both are excellent.  I appreciate the parts about the importance of forgiveness.  It is so hard to forgive our enemies, but when we do, we finally have peace.  The story was very realistic, and I liked how blunt the author was with Faye's parents' snobbiness and superficiality.  I think the point of The Locket is to show that love is all.  If you live to be 100, but you don't have people in your life whom you truly love, what is the point? We all need uncondional love. Everyone is deserving of love, because God loves everyone.	2005-03-18
US	14250989	R3N5DUFRAMM6H9	061306531X	483428038	Day of the Storm	Books	4	8	8	N	N	terrific, light romance	This is not only my favorite Rosamunde Pilcher novel, but one of my favorite novels of all time.  In it, 21 year old Rebecca Bayliss searches for her estranged relatives shortly after her mother's death. On the way to her relatives, she meets a mysterious stranger, Joss Gardner, an attractive young man who at first seems almost like her stalker, but winds up being her hero.  The descriptions of Cornwall are breathtaking. There was just one disturbing scene to me, when her cousin kissed her dead on the mouth and when she tried to get away, he grabbed her and slapped her.  Luckily she was a strong enough young woman to not put up with that or fear him. You will fall in love with all the characters in this book.  Well, maybe not the violent cousin, but everyone else.  Buy a copy off amazon today.  You won't regret it.  I think this book appeals mainly to young women.  I fell in love with it at 22.	2005-03-14

I have read all three of the series, the fourth is coming out in April. The first one is the best in my opinion.  I love the honesty of the characters.  Mae's and Tessa's quirkiness is a bit annoying, but hilarious. It is very interesting to see how 5 females of varying personalities learn to get along in a boardinghouse without going crazy. I do think occationally they do get into each other's business to much and demand to know everything so they don't break the \\"circle'.  It kinda reminds me of a sorority- a bit creepy!  That is the only part I sort of disliked.  Eveyone is entitled to a bit of privacy. I love how they all change through God's grace and their desire to connect with each other is amazing. Since reading the book, I have had many daydreams about how fun it would be to live in a boarding house with kind women.  If I start a book club at my church someday like I hope to, this will be the first book we read. I loaned it to some of my female relatives, and they loved it too. This is a terrific book to share with your female loved ones.  Anyone 18 to 80 would  enjoy this fine piece of work.  Nancy Moser and Vonnette Bright are soooooo incredibly talented.  I don't want this series to ever end.  I hope they continue writing books together, even if they discontinue writing more sister circle ones.	2005-03-06

I didn't really enjoy it at first, simply because I was too young. I read it again at 13 and adored it.  I could totatlly relate to Emily and Angel.  The book deals with friendships, romance, school spirit, and discovering your identity.  Even though it is old, it is still relavant.  I still have my 17 year old copy and I read it every few years, because it brings back fond memories.  I still occationally read other books I loved as a preteen/teen including \\"Hail, Hail Camp Timberwood\\", Gordon Korman books, \\"Taking Care of Terrific\\", Janette Oke's historical fiction, and the Elizabeth Gail series.  IF you are a parent of a preteen girl, please buy atleast one of these books for your daughter.  She will treasure them.	2005-03-06

It was one of my favorite books when I was about 12. I could relate to Enid's dislike for her name and her love of baby-sitting, and drawing.  I received it as a gift at 9, but couldn't get into it.  I wasn't allowed to babysit and didn't understand a lot of the vocabulary. I also was confused as to why a 14 year old girl would be so disobedient to her folks and her employer. Her parent's obvious disinterest in her was disturbing to me. However, it was nice to see her parents seemed to pay more attention to her at the end. I think a kid should be atleast 11 before reading this book. About once a year I still read this book.  I still want to go to Boston and ride the swan boats because of this book's incredible discription of it. The subject of homelessness is compassionately dealt with.  Enid just wants to recieve and give love. Her parents and  her friends's competitive, snooty parents were blind to that. Kids need love and acceptance more than rules and regulations.	2005-03-06

Boy, am I glad I did.  It is inspiring to see the love and commitment of Janey's family.  It is touching to see pale, blonde Janey befriend a little hispanic girl, Lupe.  If you are a teacher who wants to encourage unity amoung kids of different races, read this book to your students.  It is a bit slow, but I think kids today would still enjoy it.  As a result of reading this book, I started collecting Blue Willow china.	2005-03-06

My brother, a year older than me had recommended it. 18 years later and I still love it. It is about an 11 year old girl who is pretty calm and normal despite the fact that her parents and sister are borderline nutcases.  Her dad bikes everywhere with an umbrella on his bike, has weird hair and is a science geek.  Her mom has crazy hair and always wears bright red tennis shoes and a jogging suit.  Her sister collects can labels for a hobby and has a pet sea urchin.  Their doorbell plays \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" and they eat dinner every night out of one giant pot that they all share from.  They have a drinking fountain in their living room and don't watch tv, because they prefer acting out dramas themselves. Things get pretty funny when an exchange student comes to stay with them.  I bought a paperback copy off Ebay 2 years ago and found it just as funny as when I was 10. It was comforting to me when I was a kid, because I thought my family was soooooo weird.  I discovered we are not as weird as I thought. The illustrations are great. I wish it would come back to bookstores.  It is timeless humor.  I hope some teachers read this review and buy a copy to read to their students.  Kids 9-12 would be appropriate. Of course, I am a grown adult and still like kids' books the best, so if you aren't a teacher, that's ok.  Buy one for yourself to cheer you up on yucky days.	2005-03-05

I have never laughed so hard( to this day!) over 'I want to go home\\". Korman's books are geared to the 10 to 14 crowd, but they are still appealing to adults. Even my grandma who roared over this book.  If you like summer camp books, check this one out.  I think many camp councelors as well as teachers who deal with trying teens,would benefit from this book.	2005-03-05

I read it when I was 21 and couldn't put it down.  I bought it for my best friend and she loved it too.  Ariana's faith in God's mercy and power was so comforting and inspirational.God totally used this book to help keep my eyes on him and his word when I was going through a situation just as scary as Ariana's.  I loaned it to my grandma and she adored it. too.  I think it's appropriate for age 12 and up. One of the reasons I love J. oke so much is that her books appeal to people of almost any age.  She is not ashamed of presenting the gospel and standing on the unchanging word and character of God.  If you haven't read it, buy a copy from amazon.  You can share it with others if you trust them not to keep it!	2005-03-05

It was one of the few required reading books I actually enjoyed. To this day it is still one of my favorites. I learned a lot about the Great Depression.  It was a very realisitc books about the struggles families went through back then.  It had it's sad parts but the end was very happy. The determination and love of the two brothers was inspiring.  I hope more teachers promote this book.  Irene Hunt is such a talented author.	2005-03-04

This is a preteen book about a very sheltered 13 yr.old girl named Melanie who is forced to go away to camp for about 6 weeks.( Her Aunt Katherine,a pyschologist, strongly suggest that to her folks and they finally agree that Mel needs to grow up a bit and learn new things and meet new people.) At first Mel is quite homesick and scared of all the new activities, but she starts to really enjoy herself and grow up.She makes new friends and learns assertiveness,especially when it comes to dealing with a bully.     I could definitely relate to shy, sheltered, insecure Melanie when I was a preteen, which is partly why I adored it so much.  I did attend summer camp when I was 10, 12 and 13.  When I was 12 and 13 I had a mad crush on 1 hot blonde guy at the camp. His good looks and cool demeanor reminded me of \\"Steve\\", Melanie's boyfriend in the book.     Even though this book was written in the 70's, it is still relevant for today's preteens.  I hope this book comes back in print some day and I hope no changes are made. I think this would also make a great made for tv movie.  Parents, do your preteens(especially girls) a favor and buy them this book. I can't see how any kid couldn't relate to the story.	2005-03-04

I have read several from that series.  Half were boring and a complete waste of time. \\"A Groom Worth Waiting For\\" is the best.  It is about a young woman, just out of college who is sort of lost and trying to make her way in the world.  She bumps into Mr. Perfect in a conveince store during a hold up.  He helps to save her life.  She winds up becoming friends with his dear aunt Lila and draws closer to God.  The characters are charming and honest.  I think any young woman over 16 would enjoy this book. It is a cozy read for a chilly day.	2005-03-04

It is in my opinion one of the greatest books for girls ages 9-12.  I could relate to Ginnie so much when I was 10.  I, like Ginnie, desperately wanted to babysit, but of course was not allowed to until I was 12. I howver, like Ginnie was allowed to babysit at my house with my mom present.  Not only does Ginnie babysit in this book, but she also hikes, cooks, and plays with her two best pals, spunky, blunt Geneva and Peter, the boy next door.  Some people might think of the Ginnie books as outdated. Ginnie's mom was always at home cooking wonderful meals and never raised her voice. (Think June Cleaver). Ginnie was a bit shelterd from being home schooled for many years. But, the innocence, honesty, and optimism of Ginnie is touching.  The pictures are cute, but a little geeky looking.  I wish all the ginnie books would come back to print, especially Ginnie and her Juniors. I look forward to someday sharing the ones I have with my daughters.	2005-03-04

I saw the movie about 12 years ago and instantly fell in love with it. I  think Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates are some of the most talented actresses ever. In the movie you get the impression that Ruth and Iggie are just great female friends, almost sisters.  In the book, it sound like they are homosexual lovers, or atleast that is what Iggie seems to want.  I was sad to see that once I read the book a year ago.  However, it was definitely an interesting and sometimes downright hilarious book.  You definitely get to know the characters better from reading the book. It made me want to take a trip down to Alabama. I think kids over 15 would enjoy it.	2005-03-04
