The result is having a pool of students that are exam smart but does not have any commensense. <br />Robert always insist that our school system does not teach our student the concept of money, which is the reson why many of us still trap in this rat race of getting a job, spend every single cent and live on credit.<br />I strongly recommend any educator to read this book.	2000-11-18

First, it lacks the thrill of a financial market background. While the whole story is built around the venture capital firm, but seriously, anyone can write such a story. I expect more on financial market story from Michael.<br />And how Simon solve the murder case seems to be too easy, with help just around the corner when he needs it. He seems to be able to rope in the person he needs to help him solved the murder case, which I think it is unlikely in real life (but this is a fiction anyway).<br />I hope that Michael will do better in his next book.	2000-11-06

The chapter on buying office equipments, I think, is a waste of time.<br />All in all, I hope to see some specfic example, but were disappointed. But still, this is quite an inspirational book.	2000-10-22

In contrast to those celebrities that live in big houses and drive flashy cars, the millioairs are those that live in ordinary neigbourhood and drive a second-hand car.<br />By living frugally and invest for the long term, those people achieve a high net-worth, with plenty of money tucked aside. In contrast, many people that looks rich on the surface may be runing out of cash if the next paycheck does not arrive in time.<br />A book worth reading.	2000-10-21

I first read Ravi's book &quot;The Great Depression of 1990&quot; in 1988 and was worried that Ravi's prediction will come true. The result is that I missed the most stunning bull run in the financial market. This time Ravi, Ravi again predicted some doom and gloom picture, which we all know now that the crash never materalise in 1999.<br />Ravi keep saying about his prediction record, but the funny thing is that for the two books that I read by him, both predictions made in the book are wrong.... so much about track record.<br />In this book, Ravi, as usual, try to look through the past history on inflation, unemployment, past depression etc. to predict what will happen. However, little, as far as I could remember, of what the changes in the New economy was mentioned. <br />My advice to the readers? Save your money and put it into mutual funds instead.	2000-10-21

For one, I realised the magic of compounded returns and the importance of living frugally.<br />A history lesson on the financial market is interesting as well, and Lynch certainly advocate invest for the long term. He also question the validity of worrying about the GDP number, trade number, etc. when one should be worrying about buying the right company's share.<br />I would recommend readers to buy &quot;one up on wall street&quot; after this book.	2000-10-19

Books	5	3	4	N	N	This book will change your outlook.	Robert Kiyosaki never fail to point out that our education system is a failure by not teaching our children the concept of money.<br />He uses the concept of cashflow to illustrate the wealth accumulating process, and redefine the meaning of asset and libility. To him, anything that drain away your money, or leading to a cash outflow is a liability. You may be shock to learn that under this definiation, your greatest asset - your own house, is cobsider to be a liability as well.<br />Robert emphasize the importance of accumulating income producing assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. To him, building a business is the best way of building wealth, follow by real estate.<br />However, the complaint I have with this book is that it is too general. If you wanted to get some real tips and example, you are heading for a great disappointment.	2000-10-15

This approach sounds logical. Just imagine, if you like the products, chances are that other consumers will share your taste. And if the product contributes to a large percentage of the company sales and profits, then it is logical to buy and own the stocks.<br />Of course, all said and done, I have to say that being an investment professional, Lynch had the edge of calling the company's key person to double check his hypothesis, whereby an amatuer like you and me can hardly have a chance.<br />Please also be mindful of applying this strategy in countries like mine. With a population of only 3 million, and taste are not homogenious, this strategy can fail miserably.	2000-10-14

While I agree that you have to control your expenses and invest for the future as a strategy in this book, I am not sure if other strategies work. <br />For example, he likes to preach the nothing-down strategy in buying real estate. However, in my country, at least, it is govern by the law that 20% downpayment is a must. Even if one can  borrow to pay an initial downpayment, the interest cost will have killed the buyer.<br />Therefore, I would say that by all means, read this book but with an open mind to decide for oneself as to whether the strategies work for you.	2000-10-14
