Put them all into the kitchen of a Michelin-starred restaurant, throw in a few comic extras (the college teacher with neuroses about food, the barrista determined to brew the best cup of coffee in the universe, \\"quaint\\" Mafioso, etc), add in a diversion in the rural depths of Le Marche and you have a very jolly read.<br /><br />If you like food, then you can smell the cooking and taste the flavours as they can only be experienced in Italy.  You can walk the back streets, visit the markets and learn about the great Roman love of traditional food.<br /><br />My only criticism is that Laura is perhaps a bit over-drawn:  she is too obviously a character created by a man rather than a woman and reminded me a little too much of the much admired Nigella Lawson.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer who enjoyed the little asides of very rude Italian slang - a guide on what not to say when in Rome!<br /><br />I will most certainly be looking for other books by this most welcome new author.	2005-09-30
US	50886639	R2A8665RM2UM9I	006108686X	184544308	Moscow 1812: Napoleon's Fatal March	Books	5	7	10	N	N	Outstanding - moving, poignant and valuable work	This must be the definitive work on the story of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 that was followed by his infamous and catastrophic retreat through the frozen wastes of western Russia, Lithuania and Prussia.  The author comments in his introduction that most people have heard of the retreat, even if they know little of the detail.  Adam Zamoyski gives us the detail in a comprehensive and highly readable form.<br /><br />In sketching in the political background to the invasion, the author spells out Napoleon's vision for Europe.  The author sets out the background and introduces the two protagonists:  Napoleon himself and Tsar Alexander I. Once we understand the political and territorial aims of both, Zamoyski gives us an understanding of the structure of the French and Russian armies.  We quickly come to see that Napoleon was not firing on all cylinders:  he made huge mistakes in the provisioning of his huge force and Alexander relied on conscripted serfs who mistakenly (as it turned out in the end) believed freedom would be their reward for service.<br /><br />The author's set piece on the battle of Borodino was excellent:  the story of the famous Raevsky redoubt is evocative and well done - it brings to mind descriptions of the battle for Badajoz in Spain which took place at about the same time.<br /><br />However, the best part of this book was the harrowing description of the retreat itself - the key point here being that the French had not taken into account the effects of the weather such that when on 6 November the temperatures dropped radically, they were totally unprepared.  By his use of first hand sources, the author paints a graphic picture of men freezing to death whilst walking, cannibalism, horrific treatment by the Russians of prisoners, the squalour, filth, cold, hunger, thirst, selfishness, madness.........<br /><br />There were some heros, of course.  Marshal Ney was the principal French player to come out the story with any real credibility.  The pontoneers at the Berezina river crossing were also amongst those whose dedication to duty brought tears to my eyes - the descriptions of the building of the makeshift bridges used to evacuate tens of thousands across the Berezina whilst being harried by Cossacks and Russian artillery are incredible.  And, the soldiers themselves were often heroes through the self-sacrifice shown in helping their comrades - often the only thing that kept them going on.<br /><br />Kutuzov - the so-called peasant-hero general beloved of the Soviet era historians - comes out of this as a fool, hesitant to the point of total irresponsibility, ignorant and vainglorious.  As a result, many opportunities to finish off the retreating French were lost.<br /><br />I enjoyed this hugely and recommend it highly.  The book is enhanced by the illustrations, many of which were drawn at the events portrayed by those who were actively involved.  The only criticism I have of the book is that the maps were pretty inadequate.  None of them have a distance scale which I found astonishing and they were not brilliant in helping to explain the location and deployment of troops, cavalry and artillery.<br /><br />I am a student of Wellington's Peninsual war and this book added immensely to my knowledge of the period.  It's an excellent source of social history and a beautifully written, painstaking scholarly work.	2005-09-11

For a start, the author writes in a prose style that is brief, spare and to the point.  She moves her characters through a story that is multi-leveled, painful and sometimes sad but allows them, through self-discovery, to leave the past behind.  I thought it was amusing that both the H/H have private erotic thoughts but behave, sometimes, like young rather than the middle-aged lovers they are.  I particularly liked the hero's gradual coming to terms with impending fatherhood; he is amazed, disbelieving and ultimately enamoured of the idea.  Bravo for that!<br /><br />Other reviewers have summed up the story and have written very thoughtful reviews of this story.  Let me just say that I genuinely liked the H/H and found their story poignant and interesting.  My only objection is that the poor author was restricted by the Desire imprint and unable to flesh out her story and characters to the level they deserved.  The whole thing merited the opportunity for a longer and, ultimately, more satisfying read.	2005-08-02

Although she lives in Los Angeles now, her roots are in the logging country of rural British Columbia.  One summer she returns as a beloved father-figure \\"Doc\\" is not well and she travels back home to look after him for a few weeks.<br /><br />Whilst there she comes into contact with Adam Rutherford, the father of her son.  Adam is a hugely successful wildlife photographer and documentary film maker and he is in the area scouting locations for a shoot.<br /><br />When Adam discovers he has a son he is initially outraged and angry but he soon becomes besotted with Patrick and it's a mutual feeling.  Father and son are clearly delighted in each other.<br /><br />However, Natalie has a big secret in her background that has coloured her whole life.  When 16 year old Natalie discovered she was pregnant, before she could tell Adam her stepfather found out.  What then happened was horrific - to say much more would be a spoiler - but the episode caused her to leave for California without even speaking to Adam who therefore never knew he was a father.<br /><br />The story is mainly about how these three people learn about each other and gradually form a proper family unit.  My main quarrel with this story, and the reason why I can't give it 5 stars, is that I feel the author allowed Natalie and Doc to handle the tragedy that occurred just before Patrick was born very badly.  I feel the decisions the author allowed them to make were simply incredulous and I could not accept them as realistic behaviour - indeed, I cannot believe that a hospital would not have reported what had happened to the police.<br /><br />That said, it's a good story in a beautiful setting.  Probably not a keeper but an entertaining read and full of the author's intimate descriptions of domesticity and scenery.	2005-07-20

Judith Duncan's stories are never about sophisticated urban boys and girls but rather about rural people living lives of quiet domesticity.  I particularly liked this old title from the late 1980s.<br /><br />Briefly, Susan Lynton works for a government minister in Ottawa as his assistant.  Nearly 30, she has had a fairly uneventful life but enjoys her job and has a good working and personal relationship with her boss - a man of her own father's generation.  One summer he suggests that she take an extended summer break and travel to rural Alberta to fill in as cook on his nephew's ranch.  She is taken with the idea and travels out to take up the job.<br /><br />45 year old Jason Chisholm's wife left him some years ago, leaving him with a huge ranch and four children to bring up.  Although all concerned have been marked by their experiences, none are dramatically traumatised and life has been moving on.<br /><br />Much of the story takes place, literally, in the ranch kitchen and Susan learns to cope with feeding a family of hungry kids and the adults who do the hard and unending ranch work.  There is much description of the housework, doing the laundry for a large family, gardening, cooking, dressmaking, etc that takes place on an isolated ranch.  Although this might sound boring, the author's intimate descriptions of these domestic activities (which most of us, her readers fulfil ourselves) nevertheless make for satisfying reading.<br /><br />Gradually, of course, Jason and Susan fall in love.  Susan develops a close relationship with his eldest daughter but, one day the daughter catches them embracing and the girl is unable to handle it.  Despite having agreed to marry Jason, Susan feels compelled to leave the ranch.<br /><br />Of course, eventually everyone is reconciled, love wins out and everyone is happy.  Indeed, nothing much dramatichappens in this story - its charm lies in the intimacy, domesticity and sheer likeability of all of the main characters.<br /><br />I highly recommend this old title; it's well written, the descriptive narrative is first class and, overall, it's one of Judith Duncan's best.	2005-07-20

Please let me add to the love and admiration that has been expressed here for this wonderful, unforgettable book.  I first read it in high school and, ten years later, to my great amazement, I found myself living in Kenilworth - 400 yards from Kenilworth Castle, the scene of much of the story's action.  So many times have I walked in the castle grounds, thinking about Katherine whilst gazing on John of Gaunt's fabulous Great Hall.  Although the castle is now one of England's most beautiful ruins, you can still feel you are one with this  magical story and its characters who will be with you to the end of your life.  A treasure to be taken out every two or three years and read again with love and affection.

US	50886639	R21EFUDCR7IDST	0373585136	204577614	Beginnings	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Typical Judith Duncan - great read	Here is another oldie but goodie - an old Judith Duncan title that exemplifies her work.<br /><br />First of all, it's set in rural Alberta, a small prairie town populated by ordinary, working class, decent people living out quiet lives in this rural backwater.<br /><br />Holly Simpson's late husband was a rodeo rider who drifted from job to job and never amounted to much.  Holly married him young and in desperation to get away from home; soon the kids began to arrive.  Life was hard, living in trailer parks, doing odd jobs and trying to keep her little family fed and clothed.<br /><br />A house is left to her by her late grandmother and it seems the answer to her prayers.  It's not much as it's run-down, neglected and on the edge of a small town where jobs are hard to come by.  Holly has grown a bit defensive towards men and is not too inclined to accept help from anyone but she does make some friends and soon picks up cleaning, sewing and bar work.  Life continues to be hard, difficult but at least she has some money coming in as the meagre life insurance money from her husband's death is about gone.<br /><br />One neighbour is Grady O'Neil.  He's a nice guy, attractive and has a trucking business.  It's not making him rich but he has a close and warm extended family and is making a good enough living.  What's more, he likes kids and takes hers under his wing.  (The children in this book are totally believeable and add much to the story.)<br /><br />These two gradually grow close, push each other apart and grow close again.  Really, nothing much exciting happens in this book.  Its great attraction is the way in which the author portrays normal, everyday life - the life that 99.9% of us live.  The difficulties Holly must overcome are those we have all experienced.  So, her triumphs, despite her romantic contretemps ring true for the reader.<br /><br />As ever, my continuing criticism of this writer applies:  she portrays emotions in an overwrought and sometimes amusing way.  Everything is exaggerated.  But, as always, her great characters and the environment in which she places them triumphs.<br /><br />This is an old book but worth seeking out if you like Judith Duncan.  I'd also like to offer a review of another of her old books, \\"Better Than Ever\\" which I enjoyed even more than this title.  Unfortunately, it's not listed on amazon.com so can't do it.  But, if you like hidden baby stories, seek that one out too.  It's a brilliant portrayal of what happens when the guy who made the girl pregnant returns after 20 years to confront her and the boy who married her and took full responsibility.<br /><br />I'm giving this one five stars mainly because it was refreshing to read a well written story of normal people doing ordinary things yet within the framework of a story that holds your attention and makes you wish you lived next door the the heroine.	2005-06-30

Although I initially was going to give it one star, I'm giving it two because I did read the whole of \\"Beloved\\" which is Simon's story.  However, it was so acutely awful that I did not even consider wasting my time by reading \\"Callaghan's Bride\\", the second story in the volume.<br /><br />I guess Diana Palmer sells a lot of books as she has a huge backlist.  But, if this a sample of her usual output, well, words fail me.  I definitely won't be trying again.<br /><br />If you want to read what I would truly like to say here, then have a look at the All About Romance website's take on this double header.  It's puerile, trite fiction with utterly forgettable, one-dimensional, cardboard characters who arouse no interest, sympathy or attraction. Indeed, they are like some dreadful characters out of a 1950s \\"B\\" movie acting out a story about rich folk in Texas with banal, stiff dialogue.  It was so bad I can't go on.  And I cannot even give this to the church fete bookstall - this one is going in the bin.<br /><br />PS - changed my mind - back to one star ............ and although I am sorry to be so negative, I am also trying to be honest here.	2005-06-25

Please, dear readers, don't waste your money.  I had a go with this because I usually agree with the previous reviewers.  On this occasion, I wonder if we all read the same book.  I can't finish it.  It was so very, very awful that it should come with a health warning.<br /><br />I adore Regency fiction but if this is the best Signet can do these days then I guess I will be spending the next couple of years trawling through the keepers I have from some of the better writers in the genre.<br /><br />This book is appalling bad; the quality of the prose is utterly dire and, to demonstrate this, I have marked a number of examples:<br /><br />\\"Since the titled gentry (excuse me, gentry were/are NOT titled; aristocrats have titles) were scarce in Bath this year, the most fashionable choosing to follow The Prinny to Brighton ........\\"  How did this get past the writer's editor?  If you can't get the Prince Regent's nickname of \\"Prinny\\" right, what's the point???<br /><br />\\"His catlike grin was smeared with satisfaction as he supported Lady Lillian's weaving pose.\\"  ?????????????  Is Lillian hunched over a loom?  How does one smear a grin?  I guess I'll have to ask my cat.<br /><br />\\"The quelling glance she sent his way could have burned the oriental paper off his parlor walls.\\"  A mixed metaphor that completely defeats me.  (Perhaps I should not have invested in a wallpaper steamer - next time I'll just give the walls a quelling glance before I hang new paper.)<br /><br />\\"He smiled like a cat that had just tipped over the flour jar\\".  No comment - the author's words say it all.  Could you fall in love with this guy - she's describing the hero!!<br /><br />\\"The fastest way to get them moving again .... was to offer to start the process of heating tea.\\"  The most inane, incorrect, awkward description of brewing or making tea I have ever read!<br /><br />\\"An intricately pressed cravat cascaded from his neck.\\"  Sorry, I thought cravats (or neck cloths) were intricately tied.  Words are failing me again .........<br /><br />Oh botheration.  Surely the foregoing ought to give a good idea why I gave up on page 95.  What more can I possibly say?  The plot was contrived, the descriptions amiss.  Our heroine lives in a \\"cottage\\" in Sydney Gardens in Bath.  The author could have seen what Sydney Gardens looked like by looking at the Bath Tourist Office website.  Golden bath stone Georgian townhouses, for goodness sake.  They are still there today.<br /><br />I am now telling myself to stop writing.  My mother used to tell me if I could not say something nice about someone, I should say nothing.  But, dear reader, if you do look at this review, please take it as my sincere advice not to waste your precious time and money.	2005-06-25

She certainly doesn't spring to mind when thinking about the cateorgy stuff I've encountered over the last 15-20 years.  However she seems to have started producing more light-hearted, chic-lit style stuff whilst out of my line of sight.<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 stars although I see that others have had very divergent opinions and my reason for doing this is that I have nothing to compare it with in her current output.  So, for me, the jury is out on whether she is really capable of putting out some amusing and clever books.  If, indeed, she is to be compared with Susan Andersen, then I'll give the benefit of the doubt until I've read some of her other recent work.<br /><br />What appealed to me in this story was the hero - Ramsey Sage wasn't the usual sort of \\"new man\\" although that's exactly what he is.  I liked his rough and ready attitude, his shambolic appearance and his very high moral standards.  A sexy beast indeed but one wanting very much to be tamed.  I loved it that of all the cars in the world he chose a Volvo estate car - typically middle-class, \\"home counties\\" as they say in England and totally unexpected; it carried some real symbolic implications!  The secondary story was acceptable and the villain lawyer of the piece was an oily creep - loved it that he wound up selling shoes in Wal-Mart somewhere in deepest Missouri - revenge being best when cleverly dished out!<br /><br />I'll look for something else by Elizabeth Bevarly to see if this book is the gold standard or, indeed, she has something better out there.	2005-06-19
US	50886639	R1MT3CZ1NTI5TX	0373712243	900984548	Family Matters: The Wilde Men (Harlequin Superromance No. 1224)	Books	1	2	2	N	N	Extremely disappointed	I rarely give one star reviews - only if I was bored to tears and/or incredibly disappointed.  Well - I was both of these things in struggling through this book.<br /><br />I admit to a yen for the damaged hero and a well written story wherein he overcomes, to the extent of his abilities, the difficulties life has thrown in his path.  When I saw a review of this book on another site, I thought the story line might be interesting for, in some ways, it mirrors a true life event in the UK.  The BBC's security correspondent, Frank Gardiner, was last year shot by terrorists and left for dead in Saudia Arabian street.  As a result of his injuries, he was left paralysed.  I recently saw a TV interview with him and it was brutally frank, honest and painfully moving and I was filled with admiration.  Therefore, when I saw the plot for this story, I was hoping for something that would reproduce some of the courage and honesty Frank Gardiner has shown.  Well, this book was a very big disappointment.<br /><br />Briefly, it is the story of (purportedly) a CNN war correspondent who is injured covering a story and then returns to his home town to brood and recover as best he can.  Unfortunately, the character of Marc Wilde is so immature and one-dimensional that I wanted to scream.  Fiona, the female lead (I refuse to call her heroine) of the piece, is equally one-dimensional and boy does she have some obnoxiously wrong-headed ideas about lots of things in life.  Add in an emotionally retarded but disabled younger brother, then you have the picture:  the story is populated by cardboard characters acting out a potentially good story that suffers from some of the most banal and trite dialogue I have come across in quite a while.<br /><br />So, I won't be looking for the other two books in the Wilde Men trilogy.  I really don't wish to inflict them on myself.  Sadly this author has missed a huge opportunity to give us sympathetic, believable characters and she has failed to entertainme with her thin story and bland dialogue.  Too bad.  If you want to read a similar story done 100% better than this, check out \\"A Marriage to Fight For\\" by Raina Lynn which I have also reviewed.	2005-06-08

This book was recommended to me by Ian Fletcher, one of the UK's foremost authorities on Wellington and the Peninsular war.  I have just put it down, having read it non-stop at a great rate of knots!<br /><br />I am very interested in the Peninsular war but am more interested in the social history of the era than the strategic facts.  If you want to know what soldiers and officers ate, drank, thought, collected, visited and how they slept, bivouaced, billeted, communicated with those back home, fraternised with the Spanish, Portugese and French, then read this book.  If you want to know about the difficulties of moving, feeding and caring for large numbers of horses, donkeys, mules, sheep, goats, bullocks, etc, then read this book.  If you want to know about the women who followed the army, the Portugese, Spanish and French women encountered over the 6 years the army spent pursuing the French to Toulouse, then read this book.  If you want to know about religion amongst the troops, amateur dramatics, dances, singing, impromptu horse racing and field sports (Wellington had a habit of taking tumbles!), then read this book.  It will even tell you what the contents of a soldier's pack was including the weight of each item.<br /><br />Drawn almost exclusively from original, eyewitness accounts, this is without doubt the most lively and enjoyable book on the Peninsular war I have read over a number of years study.  I have visited the battlefields described but this book has immeasurably enhanced the experience.  I only wish I had read it 20 years ago when I started reading on the subject.  If you are new to the topic, then start here - you could not ask for a better introduction to the subject.	2005-05-31
US	50886639	R3ROSJ6ERGYGVG	0451143531	950503275	Opera Dancer	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Different and worth seeking out	I sought out a copy of this based on kellytwo's review below.  And, although I did enjoy this book, I find I am unable to give it 5 stars.<br /><br />It is, as kellytwo points out most carefully, not the usual sort of Regency novel.  Sandra Heath's plot is very much out of the ordinary and she has applied great skill and story-telling ability to give us a very different style of story.  However, although I accept that the main characters (particularly the H/H) were not acting out a typical Regency romance, I found it very hard to warm to them.<br /><br />For a start, Nonny Lambert struck me as a little hard.  Yes, she had to be to a certain degree, bearing in mind that she was a woman alone, turned onto the streets.  However, I did not find her particularly likable - I could not imagine having much in common with her or her outlook on life.  She seemed, at times, to be both a bit of a tease and a \\"touch me not\\" woman.  The hero, Sir Philip Hastings just did not work for me.  A hard man, selfish and determined to have his own way in life, he could not arouse in me a spark of passion.  I believe most strongly that readers of romance need to fall a little in love with their heros or else there is no real satisfaction in the reading.<br /><br />So, I give this book 4 stars because it was so unusual and because it was so well written.  But, because the H/H could not arouse in me any deep sympathy, empathy or \\"passion\\" I cannot give it 5 and I can't call it a keeper.	2005-05-23

I have read many of Judith Duncan's books over the years; the first was \\"Tender Rhapsody\\" and I was completely hooked.  Another keeper is \\"Beyond All Reason\\" and some of the characters from that story reappear in this one.  Judith Duncan's Canadian prairie stories are wonderful.  She has built for the reader a community of interesting characters who live out their lives in the ranch country of southern Alberta.  You feel the wind, smell the snow on the way and can see the Rockies on the distant horizon.<br /><br />\\"If Wishes Were Horses\\" is a fairly simple tale of how the elder of two brothers has always loved his younger brother's wife.  The younger brother dies, having wasted his potential, leaving behind a vulnerable yet feisty widow and two children.  Elder brother rides to her rescue when life deals her one bad hand after the other and he carries her and her children off to his ranch in order to look after them.<br /><br />There is a \\"hidden baby\\" (well, two to be exact) in this story and this device touches on AI and surrogacy.  I don't want to say any more - it would spoil things but it is fairly realistically and sensitively handled.<br /><br />However, I have to say why I read this author in spite of myself.  I enjoy her setting - rather like I love Rachel Lee's Conard County, Wyoming.  Duncan writes incredibly angst ridden stories that are full of high emotions.  Unfortunately, though, and here is where I must criticise her, her wrenching emotions are always portrayed the same in her books.  Here are some examples of what I feel is ridiculously over-drawn emotionalism:<br /><br />.... \\"Dazed and devoid of coherent thought in her head, she reached for the chair, her knees so wobbly they wanted to buckle ..... heart pounding and her pulse thundering in hear ears\\"  (No they have not had sex; he merely looked at her.)<br /><br />.... \\"she bounced from one thing to another like a ricocheting tennis ball.\\"<br /><br />.... \\"he turned and walked out of the room his heart thundering like an express train in his chest.\\"<br /><br />....\\"His gut knotted and he suddenly found it hard to breathe.\\"<br /><br />My problem is that in order to convey emotion, the author constantly has her characters in tears, so choked up they cannot breath, their jaws locked, their hearts exploding, etc, etc.  After a while it's just annoying and silly.<br /><br />I give this one 4 stars because the story line was great and I really liked the hero despite the fact he spends half of his time unable to breathe, choked up with his gut twisted and dizzy with emotions.  Indeed, a physician would wonder why the H/H were not about to expire from the physical side-effects of their emotions by the end of the story.<br /><br />The author does tell a good tale, she writes with intensity but ever since I read her first novel some 18 years ago, I note that this tendancy for her characters to be so emotional as to be physical wrecks is getting worse.  Please, Judith Duncan, take note.  You don't need your wonderful heros to expire from heart, chest and lung problems.  They are usually lovely just as they are, breathing normally, with a good digestive tract and hearts that beat normally!	2005-05-10

I congratulate her for dealing with some very serious issues with humour, wit and great insight.  This is a very well-plotted story and it moves along with good pace - everything is worked out and there are no loose ends.<br /><br />The story has been summarised by other reviewers so let me say only that I've not read another Regency that revolves around the expansion of the canal and railway systems in early 19th century England before and it would appear that the author has done some careful research.  I know that part of Derbyshire quite well and love the Peak District for its great beauty, wonderful stately homes and contrast of the industrial and quaintly rural.<br /><br />I liked the characters in this book.  Alistair Carsington is both physically disabled following his experiences at war and suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome following near death at Waterloo.  There is enough reference made to the horrors of injury and death on a battlefield to let you understand why this very charming man has some private weaknesses.  Mirabel Oldridge is an unusual heroine - strong, purposeful and vulnerable, she has a strong sense of responsibility.  On the surface, the two of them appear to be opposites but, in reality, they are yin and yang - mirroring each other's strengths.<br /><br />There are some comic characters who add some further humour to the story although I must admit I found Mirabel's father a bit tedious.  I did, however, like Crewe, Mr Carsington's oh so discreet valet.<br /><br />All in all, a five star read.  I must see about the next Carsington story!	2005-05-03
US	50886639	R159UBDBLINFCP	0446613584	313607866	Blind Curve (Warner Forever)	Books	3	3	8	N	N	An airplane read; not outstanding	I bought this at an airport to read on a plane.  OK - it was adequate for the purpose.  What I am not sure about is whether it was meant to be a thriller or romantic fiction as it contained elements of both.  Although others have summed up the plot, I must criticise the author's somewhat unbelieveable villain.  I thought the plot device of a gubernatorial candidate's aide plotting to blow up a nuclear power station in order to get someone elected was just a tad too thin.  The story might have worked better in a one hour TV programme because condensing the thriller aspect would have forced some focus into the plot.<br /><br />Now to the characters.  I kept thinking as I read this that I had read something similar before and looking back, I see that it was Julie Miller's \\"In the Blink of an Eye\\" - another \\"cop goes blind but copes beyond a mere mortal's ability\\" story.<br /><br />Although superfically, the author appears to have done her research about sudden blindness and the rehabilitative process, I really do question the depth and quality of that research.  Unfortunately, our hero learns to cope at the speed of light and, like Miller's book, I felt this was unrealistic.  I simply do not accept that a suddenly blind man could cope as our hero, Danny, does.  A blind friend of mine, who lost his sight as an adult, has told me that learning to cope, even learning to retain your balance, takes months, maybe for some even years - not a couple of hours.  The process Danny is going through is far too foreshortened to be credible.  OK, OK - it's fiction but even so ....<br /><br />Our heroine, Martha, just did not work for me.  An intelligent woman whose job is helping others to cope with trauma hasn't healed herself very well at all.  Yes, she had a rotten deal growing up but her insistence in hiding behind some sort of supposed lack of plastic Hollywood looks is very, very trying to the reader.  I got so tired of it that I wanted Danny to get his sight back and look herin the face and say \\"grow up, darling, or see a good plastic surgeon\\".  It would have served her right!<br /><br />For me, four stars means I will look for other titles by an author who is new to me.  Three means that I read the book, in full, and did not bin it out of disgust or irritation.  However, there were too many features of the story and the characters that stretched credibility and so I shan't be reading the author again.	2005-04-25

I am afraid that's the conclusion I have come to on reading The Rules of Marriage.  Wilma Counts does her homework - she has read up on the Peninsular campaign of the Duke of Wellington and she has also read Lawrence Stone - one of the best guides I know to the history of interpersonal relationships in England.  Unfortunately, once again she has set cardboard characters into a rich and fertile setting.  And, very sadly, she hasn't got a good ear for dialogue, putting modern speech into early 19th century mouths.  This never, never works for me; it simply irritates and disturbs the rhythm of the story.<br /><br />I have said in a number of reviews how interested I am in Wellington's Peninsular battles but sadly, I have been disappointed in the author's failure to utilise such opportune events.  I am fully convinced that had Carla Kelly written this book all of the reviewers who have commented on it would have been restrained by the limit of 5 stars.<br /><br />I am now giving up on Wilma Counts.  Although it was a \\"good enough\\" read, The Rules of Marriage did not manage to entertain me and I certainly found it impossible to empathise with the hero and heroine.  A shame, really.	2005-04-22

I read a reference to this novel at one of the romantic fiction review sites and ordered a secondhand copy to see for myself if it was \\"up to snuff\\" as they say!  Oh, yes indeed!  What a surprise!  I love well-written stories with characters who can capture my imagination by virtue of being believeable, a little flawed and possessed of good conversation.  A small point:  Our heroine is always referred to by the author as \\"Miss Denny\\" - a little bit of formality that helped plant the story firmly in Regency soil.<br /><br />Briefly, Miss Judith Denny's sister, Lady Spicer, has married well and is hosting Miss Denny for the season.  Miss Denny, being the daughter of a country vicar, is not particularly ambitious.  Indeed, her sister's marital problems (excellently portrayed) make her keen to secure the right sort of relationship for herself.  And, in the kindest and mildest way, she is keen to facilitate a rapproachement between Lord and Lady Spicer.<br /><br />One night, she meets James, Duke of Ashland.  An incredibly wealthy and powerful man, the Duke is nonetheless a man of excellent character: honest and humble and in no way impressed by his own self-worth.  Indeed, he shies away from the pomp and ceremony of his position and is very much attracted to the plain spoken, kindly and serene Miss Denny.  The conversations between them are a joy to read.<br /><br />There is no real \\"crisis\\" in the story; no \\"alarums and excursions\\" as Georgette Heyer used to mention.  Although Miss Denny hesitates to accept a man whom she views as out of her league, because both of them are honest and direct, they are clearly destined for each other - and they both know it in their hearts.<br /><br />I recommend this highly.  Exquistely written with characters who engage and entertain - you feel you would like to know them personally.  One reviewer commented that she has read this book many, many times.  It's definitely going on my keeper shelf to be enjoyed again and I shall seek outother novels by Joy Reed.	2005-04-22

She has nice parents, brothers and friends.  However, she is, perhaps, a little spoilt as a result and upon meeting The Hon Mr Anthony Talbot, younger brother of the Earl of Rutlidge, she takes him in an unreasonable dislike, attributing to him characteristics and behaviour that is duly sorted out by the novel's end.<br /><br />The author gives us a very complicated plot which tells us about ton life and secretive security work at the highest level.  There is a mystery running through everything - the death of our hero's father in peculiar circumstances.  In a long, long effort to uncover the reasons for his father's early demise, Mr Talbot becomes embroiled in the under-belly of London life and we meet a host of interesting characters peripherally involved with the Luddites.<br /><br />But it is the Earl who most aroused my interest.  Horrifically injured as young boy, in saving his younger brother's life in an appalling accident, the Earl, \\"Geordan\\", suffered a dreadful brain injury which left him forever mentally 12 years old.  However, he is surrounded by love, understanding, patience, tolerance and unending support from those who know and love this gentle, loving man.  Mr Talbot's life work has been to look after the family's affairs, acting as de facto earl whilst encouraging Geordan to live his life to the limits of his capabilities.<br /><br />This unusual scenario is beautifully handled with great sensitivity.  Indeed, it may be that Geordan will find love and marriage himself by the end of the story.  His insights into life and personal relationships are lovely, unclouded as they are but adult cynicism and sophistication.  Insome ways, the deep and abiding love the two brothers have for each other is the \\"main\\" love story in the novel.<br /><br />Recommended for great sensitivity, interesting characters and examination of different types of love.	2005-02-20
US	50886639	RWWI1OCYPGIQK	1400040523	802097993	William Pitt the Younger	Books	5	40	40	N	N	An exceptional first effort!	William Hague's biography of Pitt the Younger has excited much comment and interest in the UK because Hague was one of the youngest men ever to lead a major political party.  As Leader of the Conservative Party in the UK he most certainly had his troubles but he did bring a breath of clean air by virtue of his freshness, commitment and youth.  Therefore, it might be fair to say that his own perspective on Pitt would be of exceptional value.<br /><br />However, he has succeeded in writing a very straightforward and excellently researched biography of Pitt without overlaying his own experiences and views.  This is excellent because I wanted to read a biography, not a polemic.<br /><br />Pitt was the son of one of the most famous politicians of the 18th or any century - William Pitt the Elder.  As a young boy he was brought up in an environment saturated with politics and coloured by scholarship and academia.  He became one of the most polished parliamentary debaters the world has ever seen and his success was down to a firm grounding in how to argue.<br /><br />I am particularly interested in the period during which he served as prime minister:  the 1780s to 1806.  This was a time of great change in Britain:  the industrial revolution, the end of the American wars, increased economic successes, the upheaval in France and the inevitable \\"world war\\" of Napoleon.  Also, there were new liberal ideas coming forth:  Catholic emanicipation, an Irish parliament, an end to slavery.  Pitt's remarkable achievement was that his sound fiscal acumen allowed Britain to stay solvent, able to afford (just) the long, long Napoleonic wars, whilst at the same time keeping a lid on a fractious Parliament dominated by himself and the always fascinating Charles James Fox.  True party politics were evolving into a format recognisable to us today.<br /><br />Some reviewers on the UK amazon site have criticised the author for not drawing out Pitt's personality.  However, I agree with Hague's conclusions that Pitt was, to some extent unknowable in that his entry into high office at 24 and very long tenure meant that essentially the same person at 46 that he was at 24; his dedication and deep sense of public service meant that his political life was akin to a vocation.  His personal qualities of loyalty, discretion and tenacity are shown clearly in this book - a lack of histrionic character traits does not mean we do not learn about his personality:  rather we learn by default of his robustness of character and his innate sense of service.<br /><br />I enjoyed this very much.  It's quite long but not at all difficult to read.  I was particularly struck with the deep and abiding friendship Pitt had with William Wilberforce who encouraged Pitt to end the slave trade.  Although the changes in the law did not occur until after Pitt's death, nonetheless it was something he was keen to do.  Hague has commented in the British press that he is considering writing a biography of either Pitt the Elder or Wilberforce next; I am keeping my fingers crossed for Wilberforce - someone I'd like to learn more about.<br /><br />An excellent first book about a man who was as open as a book and yet will always be something of a mystery to those of the modern and more self-seeking world of today because of those personal attributes that made him such a model of public service.	2005-02-09
US	50886639	R1EDA9QVAM3D45	0821768743	580735775	A Family For Gillian (Zebra Regency Romance)	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Three stars may be a little generous so I'm giving it two	Other reviewers have summed up the plot for this novel and, if better handled, it could have been a wonderful story.  My problem with this book was that the characters were two dimensional, somewhat over-drawn and the hero was so spineless that I wanted to cringe.  Here we have a wealthy aristocrat who seems unable to make any sort of realistic parenting decisions.  Therefore, his children are spoilt, ill-behaved and rude (in an era when children were \\"seen and not heard\\") and yet he seems to be unwilling or unable to deal with the problem.  So Viscount Avery marries our heroine, Gillian, to provide his children with a mother and then refuses to allow her to do her \\"job\\".  Avery seemed to me to be an unattractive sort of person with a weak personality and no real sexual pull.<br /><br />I have some quarrels with the fact that the author gets titles wrong - eg. \\"Lord Prescott Avery\\" instead of Prescott, Viscount Avery.  Also, the author makes a big scene out of Gillian cooking the Christmas pudding.  Sorry, a wealthy viscountess would never even enter the kitchen let alone cook something.  When Lord Avery considers taking up once more his political career, he is said to be going to the Parliament Houses.  Really?  It's \\"the House of Lords\\" or \\"the Lords\\".  It was just silly little things like that I found annoying.  Gillian's mother was another unlikely character who was very ill-conceived.  A harridian to be sure but certainly not the sort of person you would expect to be presented as the wife of a younger son of a duke or marquess (based on the title she was given).<br /><br />I felt this story showed a lack of any background research and the author showed an inability to develop sympathetic, credulous, rounded characters.  I thought the idea for the plot was good but many other writers in this genre have done it and done it much better.  All in all a disappointment and this one goes to the church fete bookstall.	2005-02-04
US	50886639	R2LRQBCBO5PLAI	0451198131	471482854	Midnight Waltz	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Completely out of the usual Regency genre format	One reviewer here suggests that this unusual novel has \\"gothic\\" overtones but I think that is a little strong.  Most \\"gothics\\" (especially those that I remember from the 1960s and 1970s) were normally imbued with more sinister, histrionic overtones than this novel.  What I think the author has done here is to lift the veil of life as normally presented in Regency stories and allowed us a glimpse of life where things are not always sweetness and light and the dramatis personae have genuine human failings.<br /><br />Our heroine in this novel suffers at the hands of a disagreeable family composed of relatives who never have her best interests at heart and who, by nasty behaviour, dubious motives and indifference to the usual standards of morality succeed in overturning the \\"normal\\" expectations we have in this sort of story.<br /><br />Of particular interest is that one character is clearly mentally ill, possibly suffering from schizophrenic tendancies, and another is seemingly a manic depressive.  A third is alluded to as a closet homosexual.  So, lots of interesting and unusual ingredients make this novel move along at a rapid pace, making the reader wholly interested in some characters who are unsympathetic and unlikeable.<br /><br />This story is told in the first person - something I don't relish myself but it worked for this story because it allowed our heroine to comment honestly to the reader about her thoughts and worries.  Unfortunately, because it's told in this voice, we never get inside the head of the hero and he emerges, sadly, as rather one-dimensional.  For this reason, this very different story cannot be, for me, five star.  Four stars because it was very much outside the norm for the genre and, as ever with this author, it's well constructed and highly entertaining.	2005-01-23

I liked it just as much the second time around and here are some comments on it.<br /><br />This author is one of my favourites and I think this particular book is at the top of her list.  Briefly, it's the story of a young, thoughtless and somewhat wild marquess who takes the blame when someone else accidentally kills of one of his closest friends.  He suffers, you see, from terrible guilt thinking he has caused his friend to become addicted to opium.  He must leave the country but, as a friend of the king, he is given a mission to spy for the crown as Europe sinks into war with France.  And, a very successful spy he becomes, known as The Rogue.<br /><br />To the surprise of our hero, his arranged marriage evolves into one of deep and abiding love and loyalty and his wife duly  presents him with four sets of identical twins.  Wonderful characters, these children, who add much to the story.<br /><br />Returning to England after 22 years of exile, now a duke and widowed, he gradually picks up the threads of his life, reacquainting himself with family and friends whilst enduring the opprobrium of those of the ton who don't know the full story.<br /><br />The Duke of Abbercombe has allowed his guilt over the death of his friend to colour much of his life but the greatest triumph in his existence is his eight children and the loving, generous, kind and supportive relationship he has with them.  This man is a father amongst fathers, bringing up his family following the death of his beloved wife with patience and love.<br /><br />Miss Oliva Willburton-Smythe, an independent, wealthy woman of 31 meets the duke and, on seeing how patient and kind he is with his twins, decides to support him in his social regeneration.  Of course, she eventually falls deeply, madly and passionately in love with him!<br /><br />Then, a nicely handled plot of spies, missing officers, and unhealed old wounds allows everything to come right and for everyone concerned to find a loving partner.  A neat and tidy conclusion brings everything together and you know this family will enjoy much happiness and joy in the years to come.<br /><br />I really liked this - a keeper for me - and a jolly fun read with very sympathetic and well drawn characters.	2005-01-23

A delightful story by one of my favourite Regency writers, this is a two level story about young love, middle age regrets and second chances.  Many years ago Harriet Winthrop-Bates was not allowed to marry the friend of her childhood, Marsh Pembroke.  The Pembrokes were of dubious reputation and Marsh's future prospects were not particularly good.  Harriet instead was married off in the fashion of the day to a poet who was older but perhaps not wiser and never really won her love.<br /><br />By a twist of fate and a number of unlooked for deaths, Marsh became the fabulously wealthy and influential Earl of Morland.  However, in his anger and disappointment just before his accession to the earldom, he married a local girl who, though she loved him, never satisfied his own somewhat self-important requirements.  Marsh has turned into a rather cold, arrogant and judgmental man who does not tolerate disobedience to his own wishes.<br /><br />These two have children:  Harriet's 17 year old daughter, Lark, has fallen head over heels in infatuation with Andrew, Marsh's 19 year old, headstrong and immature son.  They eventually run off to Gretna Green to escape the efforts of their respective parents to part them.  Familiarity breeds contempt and they come to loathe the sight of each other as only two thwarted teenagers can.<br /><br />In the meantime, Marsh, rather out of his stern and upright character, gathers up Harriet to pursue the pair to Scotland.  During this chase, they both realise how much they still love each other and, in the end, it is they who \\"marry over the anvil\\" in Gretna.<br /><br />A well-structured story with interesting characters, this is a five star read.  Barbara Hazard writes extremely well and her characters are always three dimensional people whom you feel you would like to meet and pass time with.  Morland is not always a sympathetic character and Harriet sometimes seems rather insipid but both are the products of their respective upbringings (c.f. Harriet's awful mother) and life experiences.  I do recommend this, particularly if you are a fan of this very accomplished author.	2004-12-16

By that I mean she introduces strong themes, three dimensional, very believeable characters and sets her protagonists on sometimes hard and difficult journeys through life.  This novel was not by any means an easy read nor were all of the characters particularly sympathetic.<br /><br />Briefly, four friends have acquired the nicknames \\"Satan's Rakes\\" as a result of their debauchery, gambling, whoring and general insouciance towards accepted behaviour for men of their class and status in life.  Thus, they have become so bored that one night, after finding nothing else to entertain them, their \\"leader\\" Anthony Hawkins, the Earl of Bredon, sets them a wager that he can find a low status, servant-girl and turn her into a young girl who can be successfully presented to the Ton as a lady.  He settles on a young orphan, Anne Ainsworth, aged 11, and the wager is to run over a period of seven years.  He sends her to the vicar holding the living on one his minor estates and he and his wife then educate and mould the girl into a young woman who has completely forgotten her past and who gives the appearance of a genuine, well brought up girl of the modish classes.<br /><br />When Bredon and one of his friends get sight of her seven years later, both are astounded at their immediate attraction to the lively, charming and friendly Anne.  She, for her part, assumes she is Bredon's ward and that all of his motives are benign.<br /><br />Without giving the plot away, suffice it to say that she becomes a hit during the season but eventually discovers how her life is the result of a drunken wager.  Fastidious Bredon can't quite credit the fact that he - who has become somewhat of a misogynist as the result of his rather off-hand upbringing - is actually falling in love with Anne.<br /><br />The four friends separate into two factions with the Earl gradually becoming aware of the harm he has brought about with his wager and behaviour in general and two other of the Rakes becoming completely debauched and so desperate to win the wager that one murders the other.  Ultimately, of course, everything comes right but not until after three of our main characters must make difficult, and soul-searching progress in understanding themselves and their effect on others.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story.  Barbara Hazard could write some incredible books - not your average Regency here - instead we have people who mature but not without facing up to the realities of life.  At first I loathed Bredon:  I could find very little about him that was redeeming but despite his faults, he grows, matures and finds the true meaning of love.  Anne, for all her initial naivete, grows too into a mature and understanding woman.  A strong marriage will no doubt result but both will continue to grow by being in a loving and happy relationship.<br /><br />Highly recommended - do search out a copy if you can.	2004-12-12

The author is very clever in her descriptions of time and place and her command of regency \\"slang\\" seems good - at least it is believeable and not sanitised, Americanised or 21st century slang overlaid on the early 19th - an accomplishment in itself!<br /><br />The story is, however, plot rather than character driven.  The author has given us the story of a philanthropic young woman who comes from a long line of the sort of people who eventually got rid of slavery, chimney sweeps, child labour and other sorts of social ills.  The hero is an outright rake and has killed three men in duels (although we are given no explanation as to why he had not fled abroad for these deeds), gambles, has mistresses and casual sex and really has no obvious redeeming qualities.  However, they come together and face up to an obnoxious relative of our heroine and then the plot takes a really odd turn.<br /><br />Verity Thornrose is imprisoned in a lunatic asylum and suffers great trials and tribulations until Lord Brathmere manages to free her.  Here is where I have some problems with the plot.  I thought it rattled along rather well until the last quarter of the book when suddenly this turn away from the semi-farcial to the semi-tragic seemed like two stories badly welded together.<br /><br />Because this story is plot-driven, the author moves her characters rather like pieces on a chessboard and, sadly, we never get to understand what makes them tick for we never get inside their heads.  Surely our hero was damaged goods but we never really know why - what happened to him to turn him into what superficially is a nasty sort of chap?  Although there is a sexual attraction between him and Verity, we never really gain an understanding of what it is about her actions or character that make him want to have her.  And, I'm not really sure we are certain he will reform completely!<br /><br />Sorry, I think I am rambling.  Although I did enjoy this book, I had trouble evaluating it because there are a lot of strands to it and they don't all knit well together.  I think the author has promise.  I see that she has used one of the minor characters here for another story.  I'll have to check it out!  I recommend this but not with a great deal of conviction.  I'd really prefer to give it 3-1/2 stars ..............	2004-12-06

US	50886639	RAEWPKFV8HRC5	0380791048	516085755	Forever After	Books	4	6	10	N	N	A double review follows!	I bought a copy of this to read on a plane but fell asleep instead (fortunately!) so it had to wait a couple of weeks before I picked it up.  Once I finished it, I thought - hey - I know this plot - and so a look on the shelves found a copy of Susan Andersen's \\"Exposure\\".<br /><br />Both are the story of an abused or misused woman with a small daughter, on the run from someone who wants to possess them in a most nefarious way.  Each fetches up in a remote part of the US and each manages to find accommodation right next door to the local sheriff.  The local sheriff in each case has a traumatic past and is in deep need of the love of the right woman.  Bad man arrives and after some hair raising difficulties, the bad man is seen off by the sheriff (who has fallen love with the daughter and mother) and instant family lives happily ever after.<br /><br />However, where these two stories are very different is in the nature of the heroines - in this book Meredith Kenyon is strong but a bit namby-pamby (and this makes it even more surprising because she is in the middle of an \\"I married the mob\\" story).  In the case of \\"Exposure\\" by Susan Andersen, once you get around the stupid emphasis on our heroine's tacky New Orleans drawl, the heroine, Emma Sands, is feisty, smart, cocky yet very vulnerable.  The two tiny daughters are different in that Meredith's is terribly traumatised (very moving) but Emma's is a chip off her mommy's block and despite the baby talk, she is one of the better child characters I've encountered.<br /><br />Our two sheriffs - Heath Masters in this story and Elvis Aaron (!!!) Donnelly in \\"Exposure\\" are both the survivors of difficult and dysfunctional childhoods but, given the choice, Elvis wins hands down for pure sexual attraction.  I love the fact that his mom was the town trick turner but, despite it all, he loves her, looks out for her and for the most part is just plain infuriated by her.  He's a huge hunk of a man whose vulnerabilities are far more endearing and attractive than Heath Master's problems.<br /><br />I thought the supporting dramatis personae in \\"Exposure\\" was more amusing.  At times \\"Forever After\\" seemed like a two-hander and the other members of the cast added very little to the overall story and development of the two main characters.<br /><br />I'd give \\"Exposure\\" 5 stars - no problem - but this one gets four purely because I found it entertaining and a good read although I was not as \\"involved\\" with the H/H.  However, after two of her books in quick succession, I'm not sure that I will be in  rush to try again soon.  I've not read anything else by Susan Andersen - I'll have to see if she can hit the spot again.	2004-11-28

The author is one of my auto-buys and she rarely lets the discerning reader down for no one, in my view, does the comic regency as well.  The cast of characters in A Perfect Gentleman was wonderful:  the usual collection of romantics, eccentrics, weird and wonderful servants and the obligatory Metzger animals.<br /><br />Aubrey, Viscount Wellstone, was a wonderful hero - and I particularly enjoyed the scenes where he was luxuriating in the long, lustrous and very red hair of Ellianne, our heroine.  This author's sex scenes are always about fostering sexual tensions and reflect the deep passion bubbling below the surface of the relationship between her protagonists:  she does not go in for explicit, mechanical descriptions. I thought the scene of mad, near consumation in the butler's pantry was delicious and very, very funny.  You can't help falling in love with Stony - very well drawn character and a perfect complement for Ellianne whom I also liked very much!<br /><br />However, on this occasion, I have to agree with another reviewer who said that the sub-plots let the story down.  Metzger is obviously making the leap to longer format regencies (hooray!!!) but to do it well, she needs to be sure that the subplots are a little tighter.  The story of Capt Brisbane and Ellianne's missing sister just didn't make the cut, unfortunately.  The subplot with the serial killer was good but very much out of synch with the general tenor of the story.<br /><br />For me, a fun and entertaining read.  I would give this one 4-1/2 stars if I could.  I want to give it five but that would just reflect my love of the author and not an honest assessment of what she had produced.  Roll on the next book!	2004-11-18

So there!  Magic (the theme of this collection), time-travel, fantasy and so forth are not my idea of what to read.  However, as ever the annual Signet Regency Christmas anthology is always an auto-buy.  Well, maybe next year I will have to think again.<br /><br />\\"Upon a Midnight Clear\\" by Amanda McCabe was the least \\"magical\\" offering and was unusual in that it was about a black woman, living in early 19th century Cornwall who has inherited an interesting African legacy of voodoo or some sort of ability to help the suffering and heal the hurt.  So, a very different sort of premise on which to stage her story so - well done.  I liked the somewhat out of the ordinary hero as well!<br /><br />Alison Lane - I skipped this one.  I don't even try with this author any more.<br /><br />Edith Layton's Two Dancing Daughers\\" was just too silly for words.  I guess it was cute but this long time favourite author did not catch my imagination at all with this rather boring offering.  Maybe I just didn't \\"geddit\\".<br /><br />Barbara Metzger's \\"The Enchanted Earl\\" was a little better although as a reworking of Beauty & The Beast crossed with The Sleeping Beauty, it was a litte too twee for my taste.  The reader knows what's coming but at least Metzger's prose is in tune with the concept and she is a talented stylist as always.<br /><br />Sandra Heath's \\"The Green Gauze Gown\\" was probably the best of the lot.  Not quite so fantastical it's the story of an old and unrequited love that gets a second chance.  How nice to have a hero in spectacles!  And one who is literate and clever.  Very attractive he was in an unexpected way.<br /><br />Well, I won't give up on Signet's Christmas anthologies but I do hope for something better next year.  This one filled in a few hours and I have no regrets but it didn't really do the job for me.	2004-11-15

I liked it because each character had to examine him or herself deeply to identify and overcome motives coloured with suspicion of self and others.  I felt that the interaction of the various couples/combinations was well drawn.  The sexual tension was well portrayed and, I think, realistic.  And, of course, the ultimate surprise was the story of the hero's much adored aunt - certainly her own heart required a great deal of self-examination for her life was so nearly wasted.<br /><br />All in all, I thought this was Donna Simpson's best effort thus far.  It is not particularly an easy read and one could easily be frustrated over the behaviour of the various characters.  But, in the end, it was a very mature, well drawn look into the hearts and minds of a group of people I personally found exceptionally interesting.  None has an easy journey to happiness but you feel that you know and understand them when the story ends.  Not \\"lite 'n' fluffy\\" - it takes some degree of commitment to read but I felt truly rewarded when I came to the end.	2004-11-15

Perfect for the plane as it was another of the author's semi-mindless, too good to be true, slightly over-done fairy tales that gives one some hours of sentimental slob-out.  I loved it although it's not my usual sort of read.  If you want to be well-entertained, fall in love with a mega-rich cowboy with a sad past, commiserate with a lady down on her luck mixed with the requisite endearing baby - go for it!  I left it in LA with my mum and she loved it too!  (PS - I bought another one by this author to read on the way back but sadly snoozed most of the way so am saving it for the cold days over the holidays next month!)	2004-11-15

Although I would not rate \\"A Passionate Endeavor\\" as a keeper, I do welcome a talented writer to the Regency genre.  The best thing about this novel was the great imagination of the author in introducing the topic of dyslexia whilst keeping it set within the timeframe of the novel.  In otherwords, although there was a breakthrough for the hero, it was sensitively handled and seemed realistic.<br /><br />The main criticism I have here is the introduction of a sort of \\"counter hero\\", Alexandre, Viscount Gaston.  I was very confused about this character - was he a hero or villain?  I also felt that Charlotte's childhood experiences were not fully exploited.  And, there was a point in the last quarter of the novel where I felt the author was tiring and in some danger of losing the plot line.<br /><br />Some of the characters, such as the two dowager Duchesses, were badly overwrought.  The author gets the name of the 95th Regiment of Rifles wrongly named, over and over.  I was surprised by this as it was something to get easily correct!<br /><br />On the plus points, I was most impressed overall by the sensitive handling of the handicap of illiteracy and the ramifications in terms of self-esteem on a very kind and generous man who deserved the love and encouragement of his family.  The 30 year old Lord Huntington's inability to read had coloured the whole of his life, the way others viewed him and, in the end, had made him ready to step back from his destined role in life.  Very sad.  How lovely that the love of an equally kind woman enabled him to find his true life's path.<br /><br />For a second novel, this was very good although it did not quite reach the excitement I felt on first reading Anne Gracie's debut and follow up novels.  I look forward to seeing what Sophia Nash produces next!	2004-10-11

I am not sure what Katie MacAlister was trying to achieve with this novel.  Others have summed up the plot so I'd rather just give some comments.<br /><br />Yes, it's an amusing story.  The concept of our heroine having written a Guide to Connubial Calisthenics was quite unusual and clever but never really added much to the character of Plum except to give her some surprising sexual tastes and knowledge.  Our heroine was, I am afraid, rather two dimensional and, as one reviewer has said, her actions and overall character were terribly inconsistent.  Harry was amusing - how nice to have a hero wearing spectacles but as a real, genuine man (and father), he was totally unbelieveable.<br /><br />Was this meant to be a regency historical?  If so, I could not find a single sentence that fixed the timeframe.  The story and characters could have been from any genre timeframe you care to mention as there was no narrative description to speak of.<br /><br />All in all, the child characters were so over-drawn that they were beyond even farce - they were simply irritating.  Too bad because I quite like a story with naughty children but Barbara  Mezger could have done them much better.<br /><br />I won't be put off by this author but I do nonetheless feel that the ecstatic rave reviews were a bit surprising.  Not enough meat to the story, characters that were, in the end, non-engaging, and nothing here to indicate this was a regency-set story.  The author's prose is reasonably good and she obviously has a great imagination but as a sum of its parts, this book just was not memorable for me.	2004-10-07

It's 20 years since I first read this book and, having had the pleasure of a re-read, I am still delighted by it.  A road story, a Regency Christmas tale, it's a heart-warming novel peopled by characters of great charm.<br /><br />Dinah Dean tells the story of a party of mail coach travellers, stranded in the remote Lake District in the days before Christmas.  The weather sets in, the snow is drifting and there is the inevitable coach accident.  Miss Dorcas Minster, governess, the poverty-stricken daughter of a suicide, Col Richard Severall (late of the heavy cavalry, now invalided out with a disabling leg wound) and an assortment of servants, coachmen, fellow travellers and a notorious villain make up the party stranded in the snow.<br /><br />The weather plays a significant role in the story as the backdrop to the difficulties the party must go through before reaching a safe haven.  It encapsulates Dorcas's personal misery and the difficulties she must overcome to find happiness.<br /><br />As the previous reviewer said, this is a low key story, no sexual scenes but there is a very real and palpable attraction between Dorcas and Richard and you feel it strongly.<br /><br />Dinah Dean (Majorie May) wrote a number of Regencies, many of which were set in Russia.  Obviously, she, rather like me, enjoys the challenges and wonders of winter.  She writes beautifully - her prose is well crafted and she creates truly charming characters including the landlady at the inn where they shelter who is a jolly good cook.  Even the cat, Maurice, takes his role in the story quite seriously!<br /><br />There are not many books I can honestly say I enjoyed as much after a hiatus of some 20 years.  However, seek this one out - you won't be disappoined especially if you like stories set in winter with a Christmas background and a desirable military man!	2004-09-16

She's probably the master of the damaged hero (well maybe co-master with Gayle Wilson).  Rarely has she disappointed me.  I particularly enjoyed her latest offering because it was in the longer format that category fiction is denied.<br /><br />This is a story of revenge, hatred, and old animosities made to come right by love, tolerance, reparation and forgiveness.  By examining the heart and soul of a man tormented by a crime he perhaps did not truly commit (we are kept guessing), PDR is able to evoke the meaning of true love in both the sexual and non-sexual way.  Rhys Hazard is a man who feels undeserving of love and comfort who has the great good fortune to meet a woman who can offer him both and by doing so achieves a level of love and completion for herself.  Although events conspire against them, their regard for each other makes them complete.<br /><br />Excellent story from a much admired author.  Please can we have her next one soon?	2004-08-15

What struck me was the heart-wrenching intensity of emotion in the story.  Her hero in this novel, the Duke of Wrotherham, may be an alpha hero but he has a capacity for love and feeling that makes him incredibly attractive.  It's a story that stands up to the best of Mary Balogh or Jo Beverley with an emotional level that's not often encountered in Regency fiction.  I fell in love with the Duke and the particular circumstances of the heroine's past make the whole of their affaire that much more poignant.  Truly a touching and wonderful read - one to be savoured a second and perhaps third time.	2004-08-15

So, it's always refreshing to pick up a new book in the field and find you've got an outstandingly entertaining read.<br /><br />Mark Urban's history of the 1st Battalion of the 95th Regiment of Rifles is the first modern work to be published and his copious and in-depth research shines through.  However, his scholarship is lightly worn; drawing on previous research, some newly unearthed materials and  original sources - particularly the diaries of serving Riflemen in the 95th - he makes his subject come to life.  You feel you are marching alongside those wonderful characters like Pte Joseph Almond, Maj Alexander Cameron, Cpl Robert Fairford and many others.<br /><br />His battlefield descriptions, explanations of deployment, discussions of sieges and strategic thinking are excellent but thoroughly entertaining.  Interspersed with chapters devoted to individual battles like Barba del Puerco, Fuentes d'Onoro or the Nive, are chapters more of a social historical nature covering topics like Gentlemen Volunteers, the Wounded or the Regimental Mess.<br /><br />I found this an excellent and thoroughly entertaining book and recommend it highly to readers of social and military history.	2004-08-15

In an attempt to sort out her family's woes, Sydney falls in with some notorious moneylenders and card cheats.  All of this is to raise the necessary cash for a season for her beautiful elder sister, Winifred.<br /><br />Viscount Mayne, heir to the Duke of Mayne, meets Sydney on the doorstep of said moneylenders on an errand of mercy to dig his younger brother out of gambling troubles.  Following a misunderstanding, these two commence a series of adventures through the ensuing season as Mayne plucks Sydney out of one near scandal after another.<br /><br />Add in the usual Metzger complement of servants, animals, villains and eccentric family members and her tried and tested formula scores a real hit.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this old title - read in one sitting and much chuckled over.  The chapter titles are alone worth the price of admission!  Except for failing to get her ducal family correctly titled, this story is nearly perfect.  If you like genuine farce told with a light hand, then this is highly recommended.	2004-08-04

It's always harder to write comedy than tragedy and Metzger's talent shines through another of her clever farces.<br />Weddded Bliss is about a twice-widowed earl who needs a mother for his long neglected young sons; indeed the Earl of Rockford thinks they are cuckoos in the nest.  Alissa Henning (really Lady William Henning - wife of a deceased disowned son of a Duke) is a loving and devoted mother of two young sons.  Well, hey presto - we have the makings of the perfect match and a wonderful story of step families, parenting and an inadvertent and unexpected love.<br />Amongst the things I particularly admire about Metzger is her sparkling prose - she always has a clever turn of phrase to make you smile to yourself.  Although I am not a lover of stories overly dependent on children, her child characters are always well drawn - indeed this lot made me think of the family in Heyer's Frederica.  And no one does the family pet as well and this time we get a pack of four mongrel puppies.  Added bonuses include an infatuated tutor, a drooling villain and Metzger's usual cast of outrageous servants and eccentric relatives.<br />All in all, if you like clever comedy, excellent prose and wonderful characterisations, then you will enjoy this.  If you are a Metzger fan, don't miss it.	2004-07-17

If you like easy to read, but skilfully written holiday novels, then this is for you!  It does just what it says on the label - entertains and amuses and is perfect for the beach or a plane journey.<br />It's the story of a \\"virtual assistant\\" (e.g. on-line secretary) who is sent to the far north of the Scottish Highlands in the cold and snow of the early winter to sort out a failing woollen mill.  Our heroine encounters a cast of characters who range from the sensible to the sublimely impossible and, of course, she has a silly boyfriend whom she eventually dumps for a rich, sexy, gorgeous businessman.<br />Fforde's stories are always a pleasure:  not great literature but very satisfying escapist reads.

I have read all of Elizabeth George's novels after watching the BBC series based on them.  This one was a real dud as far as I was concerned.  The plotting was thick and full of dead ends and the story populated by characters who never caught my imagination.  And although the author does a pretty good interpretation of ordinary daily life in odd corners of Britain (in this case Guernsey) she still just misses making her characters believably British for me.<br />Although Barbara Havers is the UK equivalent of &quot;trailer park trash&quot;, she is without doubt the most successful of George's regulars and I think she is a truly memorable character.  However, when it comes to rich, titled, aristocratic British men, I don't think she comes close to making them believable, sympathetic or attractive.<br />I have always thought that Deborah and Simon had the potential to be George's most interesting characters because their personal backgrounds was fertile ground ripe for exploitation.  However, this time, I just got annoyed.  Sorry, but the way Simon is made to handle his disability, the way he blows it all out of proportion, Deborah's unwillingness to be open and honest with a man who adores her and the generally slovenly development of their characters in this story was just terribly, terribly disappointing.  Also, I should think any reader who had not read the previous novels would have been wondering just what the hell was going on here with Deborah and Simon - too many allusions to the past makes this novel difficult to &quot;stand alone&quot;.<br />Sorry, I nearly gave up after the first 100 pages.  The last 30 pages were a frantic attempt to dig out a believable conclusion (and it was credulous to say the least) and the most interesting character was a council house bully of an elder brother who clearly was nuts!<br />Oh dear; what a disappointment - can't really recommend this and hope the author can do better next time.	2004-05-31

However, if you are fans of the first three, buy the book and ignore or skim the other two offerings.<br />Layton, Metzger and Kelly are auto-buys for me but, please, Signet, spare us from Alison Lane's efforts in these eagerly awaited anthologies.  It was forgettable - I could not be bothered to finish this tepid and ill-written story of a girl fleeing a wicked guardian into the arms of a rake without much cash.  It's part of a series but I won't be tempted to read any of the other stories.  It's intended to be an &quot;action&quot; type of story with evid-doers chasing the heroine but it's just too shallow and written in such stilted prose that, well, I just didn't care at all.<br />Lynn Kerstan can, and has done, better.  Her story is about a penniless ward who is given the opportunity to choose between three sons of a Duke.  The three brothers are OK but Julia is immature, silly, acts like a spolit child (which she is) and the story drags on and on until the final resolution.  Why, please does the author let the heroine refer to a clergyman (not a nice one we gather) as &quot;Pawson Ribble&quot;?  Does she have a speech defect?  What's wrong with Parson Ribble?  The only thing of any interest (and it stretched credulity) was the heir to the dukedom has asthma and his middle brother applies 21st century techniques to get it under control.  Oh botheration, nothing more to be said here.<br />Layton's offering was cleverly written and it had a definite theme:  love across class divisions and it was written with grace and humour.  It was not her best effort but her characters include a cast of characters from an aristocratic family and one of the city type abhored by the ton.  It's a farcical type of tale of two people trying to prevent the marriage of their siblings and, in due course, they fall in love seeing for themselves that love can transcend many obstacles.<br />Metzger, as always,writes with a light hand and spins a fairy tale about good versus evil by having the devil and St Peter fight for the soul of a Marquis who has been a bad boy back in London and now lies near death on a Spanish battlefield.  As always, her prose is light, sparkling and funny and her characters act out a cleverly plotted tale on their way to a happy and romantic conclusion.<br />Kelly, always an admired favourite has a very unusual offering.  Her story of a widowed American sea captain who falls in love with a prickly and unhappy Englishwoman was well written as always with this author and it was charming to read a story of a 40 year old widower falling in love despite himself with a 32 year old spinster.  A background of the press gangs and President Jefferson's imminent Embargo Act of 1807 gave the story a very interesting setting.<br />Buy the book if you like Signet anthologies as much as I do and enjoy the three best stories.  Maybe some readers will enjoy Lane and Kerstan but I'm certain everyone will enjoy Layton, Metzger and Kelly!	2004-05-22
US	50886639	R1AMAZ40TV1AH2	0758204434	399804889	Almost A Gentleman	Books	4	6	6	N	N	An interesting debut novel - some thoughts	There was much interest when this novel first appeared and although it took a while for it to get to the top of the TBR pile, I did enjoy it.  However, there were some issues in the story that did not work for me.<br />Although the \\"cross dressing\\" sub-genre does not particularly appeal to me, I have read better examples (cf Georgette Heyer's These Old Shades or The Masqueraders) wherein the cross dressing and masquerading as a man seems to have some believeable raison d'etre.  However, I felt in reading Almost a Gentleman that it was not wholly a credible action on the part of our heroine, Phoebe.  There was never a fully acceptable explanation for her to do this and it seemed a somewhat strange reaction for her following the death of her husband and children.  Instead, it appeared to be more of a device used to examine the reactions and behaviour of the hero, Lord Linseley.  This was the best aspect of the book - the way he reacts to \\"Philip\\" and the soul searching it causes him.<br />I compliment the author on her prose; excellent quality although she does let the odd Americanism slip in (e.g. \\"vacation\\" instead of \\"holiday\\") but overall, she is easy and delightful to read.<br />With respect to the sexual aspects of the story, although her language is, in my view, too frank for the timeframe of the story, nonetheless it was galaxies ahead of the deplorable Emma Holly.<br />I look forward to reading this author again.  I don't think this was a 5 star effort but for a first novel I was very impressed and recommend this to the discerning reader.	2004-05-14

The next time you invite people for dinner, stop and think about what you do to get ready.  Inviting the right people, planning an exciting menu, decorating the table, arranging the seating plan, the order of the courses : all of these are vestigal remnants of formal dining practices over the centuries.<br />This is a fun book to read.  It's a non-scholarly round-up of many, many academic articles that have appeared on the subject of dining along with a summary of some of most significant historical works on food, dining, entertainment and medicine.<br />If you are interested in food, the evolution of table manners and the developmental history of your family breakfast room, then this is a jolly good read.

I would think anyone looking at the reviews here probably knows the plot anyway!<br />I really think that the whole of my adult reading life has been spent looking for something to fill in the gap left on Georgette Heyer's death.  I first read Austen in high school and discovered Heyer in my freshman year at university when someone suggested to me that she was &quot;the next best thing to Austen&quot;.  I guess that was a truth self-evident.<br />I've read thousands of romances, sandwiched in between the serious history and biography I adore, on buses, trains, in the car, in waiting rooms, during hurried lunch hours and in bed at night to relax after another stressful, hectic day.  But, really, if I am honest with myself, there are just a very, very few authors that are on my keeper shelf.  Hundreds of authors have come and gone for me.  Some I have dismissed after reading a chapter as too puerile, too facetious, too ill-researched, too derelict in the simple use of the English language.<br />Heyer, however, rarely disappointed.  I adore her later books, filled with characters of great wit, insight, morality and self-knowledge who mature and come together through real life experiences - all conveyed in prose of the very highest standard.  I guess that's it - Heyer's exquisitely wrought prose telling stories of genuine human emotional experience, all carefully and perfectly set in the Regency world - immaculately researched and painted for the eager reader.<br />The Nonesuch is, of course, one of my favourites - and I expect I would say that about most of her works.  But Sir Waldo and Ancilla so perfectly epitomise adult love, good works and social constraints and decent moral standards that you have to love them.  Village life is portrayed beautifully - so much remains the same!<br />Rant, rant, rant.  Every time I go back to Heyer, I am demoralised when I pick up a modern &quot;wanna be&quot;.What to do about that?	2004-02-21

However, I was disappointed.  Althought the author has great energy and obviously tried hard, I felt there were too many annoying rough edges to make this a truly sparkling debut.<br />The best thing about the novel is the plot - stuffy businessman unwillingly attracted to aristocratic but poor woman dedicated to charitable work with war widows.  Add in a silly, party-mad mother, various other incredulous relations and OTT friends and you have the beginnings of a farce along the lines of Barbara Metzger.  What let this novel down was that the ingredients were strained and two dimensional.<br />Every decent hero has a flaw; in this case Mr Gabriel Carr is incredibly beautiful (and although reluctantly, he knows it and uses it).  OK.  But his beauty is used in the feminine sense:  eg &quot;I'm so lovely that no one can see beneath the surface&quot;.  It just didn't work for me.  Our heroine, Lady Nola, is the daughter of an earl but the family seems to be on its financial knees.  OK.  But where did she acquire the urge to look after Peninsular war widows with such business acumen?<br />The characters behave in exaggerated ways; they throw things, they bump into each other, they shout, they lunge, they slam, they loom.  They act without any of the refinement of behaviour you would expect in the genre.  The hero's middle aged mother parties all night yet is purported to know everyone of importance in society:  sorry but this strained credulity a bit. She is described as &quot;lurching to the table in a billowing purple dress like a round grape rolling down a matron's heaving bosom&quot;.  I realise this is meant to be funny but, really, it's just silly.<br />And, our hero falls down a flight of stairs, &quot;shatters&quot; his knee yet is up and walking within days.  And this before the benefit of x-rays, orthopaedic surgery, physiotherapists, etc.Sorry, just did not work for me.<br />The author has tried to amuse us.  She has made a good effort and no one reading this can doubt her enthusiasm but I think she needs to polish her work a bit more and strive for a little more irony in her humour rather than making it so slap-stick.  I will try again with her but she will have to improve on this to keep my interest.  Three stars because this is a debut; two might have been nearer the mark.	2004-02-18

I'm not sure I should not give it two stars having initially decided on three.<br />The problem for me was that this book was just simply sloppy and at times I struggled to keep my attention on it.<br />For a start, the names of the main characters were completely inappropriate for the time and place setting.  Men named Madison, Lane, Bayard ????  Females named Hetty and Jenna?  At times I had the feeling of being in a time and space warp and that they were escapees from something set in the ante bellum South when Jenna insists on calling her late husband's brothers \\"Cousin Lane\\" and \\"Cousin Bayard\\".<br />There were time-line inaccuraces that, unfortunately, annoyed me and thus devalued the story.  For example, the author on the last page speaks of 25 June being the anniversary of Waterloo.  Well, it's 18 June for Waterloo!  Our heroine, Jenna, talks of nursing her husband for two weeks after the battle before he sadly dies yet before Christmas she is dancing at balls.  Really?  Surely not!  And, at one point she talks about her difficulties in the 8 months since Waterloo and it's not even December yet!  What???<br />Then, in an effort to make the story have some interest, the author turns it into a murder mystery.  Someone takes a pot shot at our heroine.  The author lets our hero, Viscount Nelthorpe find a \\"bullet casing\\" from the \\"rifle bullet\\" in a nearby tree.  By this time, I was getting really irritated.  Bullets with casings were really a mid 19th century development.  All pistols, muskets and rifles of the time were loaded with ball, patch and powder.<br />What we have here is a shallow, ill-developed story of a rake-ish nobleman who became a soldier who returns to London and chases Jenna - a lady he tried to seduce years before.  Before this story ends, she has seduced him pretty comprehensively in a scene without a frisson of sexual magic so perfunctorily is it written.  (Don't forget Jenna is a widow of about 3 months and only several weeks post-miscarriage - it just doesn't add up, does it?)<br />Jenna is not particularly likeable and I didn't find Tony, Viscount Nelthorpe exciting either.  Both were two dimensional and caught up in a boring story where no one stood out.  Indeed, at first I thought Col Madison Vernier would be interesting but then he turns into a cad in the course of a short conversation.  Sorry, but the quality of the author's prose does not sparkle (it veers from stilted to silly - using 'twas to indicate this is an historical novel!!).<br />I can't rcommend this and have changed my mind and am going gack to give it two stars.  I also think I must re-read Scandalous Proposal to see what went wrong for this author.	2004-02-06
US	50886639	R326NBUOJ29S52	0451204409	3794394	The Rake and the Wallflower	Books	2	8	12	N	N	Dull, stilted and boring	I did try to persist with this - mainly because it had received good reviews here but, in the end, because I was so jaw-droppingly amazed at the silly plot.<br />It all hinges on a family of three sisters and our heroine, Mary, is the youngest.  She is shown both as vulnerable and intellectual but she has a mouth on her when she chooses and acts like a 21st century city girl.<br />Our hero, Lord Grayson, is flawed; the man is made faint at the site of blood - described over and over again.  Also, the author uses this as a polemic against blood sports.  Oh well.  Rather a modern polemic - in those days no one would have given much thought to it at all.  Portrayed as a really nice chap, he nonetheless has an overt talent for attracting mentally ill/unstable women.  Really!  Never came across that in a Regency novel before!<br />The storyline is a bit thin and I won't bore you with the details.  The problem here is that the middle sister, Laura, was the only reason to read this book - shown to us as just about completely unhinged, she behaves so badly that you turn the pages to see what the author will make her do next.  I really expected her to be murdered by one of the characters who would scream as the pistol discharges, &quot;Help - get me out of this wretched novel!&quot;  Sadly, though hauled off to the country, she lives to fight another day.  Surely the author didn't do a sequel to this?  I can't bear to look and see.  I would certainly not read it in any event!<br />Sorry - this was a silly, pointless and very boring novel.  The characters acted out a storyline that was shallow and ultimately unbelievable and their conversations were so badly done that I truly struggled to finish this effort.<br />I can't recommend it.  Two stars because I've read worse.	2004-01-20

Along with its companion novel, An Unforgettable Rogue, this novel was sluggish, the characters did not engage and the story was thinly plotted.  I found it difficult to keep my attention on it; there was that old feeling of a modern characters in a sometimes saccharine, Americanized story wrapped up in long dresses and neckcloths.  Unfortunately, others have already done series about rogues and the like (and done them much better) and this one came across like a very faint copy.  Undeniably forgettable, sadly.	2004-01-03

I've tried several times but she just doesn't do it for me.  This is a shallow story, much contrived with characters that neither engage nor entertain.  The beauty and the beast story and its variations can be extremely entertaining and there are countless examples in romantic and, particularly, regency fiction - too countless to name here.  Any of the romantic review sites will give you long lists in this sub-genre.  This one, however was just simply credulous.  Angela Lacewood never aroused any sympathy in me and Lucius (and boy did the author make a mull of his title - it was given in several ways and usually wrongly) was too ill-drawn to make me at all attracted to him (a &quot;must&quot; with romantic fiction!).  The story was not particularly well thought out and sadly, I admit I skimmed the last quarter of this in an effort to justify the expense of purchasing it.	2004-01-03

I did manage to finish this but only just - as a lover of regency Christmas stories, I always am willing to give them a chance.  Sadly, this one did not live up to expectations.  It was not so much that the story was inadequate as that the writer seemed to be trying too hard to make us engage with her characters.  Sorry to say that Geoffrey (one of my least favourite male forenames!) was boring, did not spark any attraction to me as the reader and Eleanor and her band of E-sisters (wasn't that cute - all the females in her family had a forename starting with E - yuck!) were too 21st century in their actions and thus annoying in the extreme.  I always think it curious how American writers of English-set Christmas regencies over-do it on the Christmas traditions, particularly the mistletoe or kissing bough - and there's always lots of snow!  A white Chrismas here in England is pretty rare so it's kind of amusing to read these stories set in such idealised settings.<br />Getting back to the story, I felt that a man like Geoffrey who allowed himself to believe he is some sort of ogre because a passionless woman shrank from a kiss was a bit juvenile.  And why did we not get an explanation as to why the regrettable Cynthia married such a jerk as the totally incomprehensible rector?<br />Oh well, another contribution for the charity shop.	2004-01-03

Me, too!  Damerel is the very best rake in the Regency canon in my view.<br />However, re-reading this over the holidays I was struck by the great achievement Heyer made in fixing her characters firmly in Regency soil.  So many of the more recent pretenders in this genre insist on applying the moral and ethical values of their own time to characters fixed in a fictional world 200 years old.<br />So here we have Damerel admitting to his shortcomings, Venetia on the verge of being &quot;cabined, cribbed &amp; confined&quot; to Edward, a young man with a disability that won't magically be cured and a host of friends and relatives whose moral outlook isn't crammed into the garments of 21st century behaviour.  Brilliant!<br />Although first published in 1958, this novel is charming, witty, cleverly plotted and exquistely written.  It is full of engaging characters who are allowed to act out an amusing and clever story without bowing to modern prejudices.  Invaluable!<br />If you have never read anything by Heyer, try this one first.  You will fall in love with Damerel and be charmed by Venetia and find yourself lost in a long-gone world that Heyer makes come truly alive on a private stage for us between the covers of this novel.	2003-12-30
US	50886639	RUMWDEC2Y9XO4	0451210441	472214106	Regency Christmas Wishes (Signet Regency Romance)	Books	3	5	9	N	N	A pleasant enough read but ultimately a disappointment	Every year I look forward to Signet's Regency Christmas anthology with great anticipation because it nearly always is a showcase for their best writers.  Unfortunately, this time, these authors (some of whom are auto-buys for me) did not come up to scratch.<br />The exception in the collection was Carla Kelly who has written another of her exquisitely polished little gems.  As ever, she gives us a beta hero caught in a poignant situation helped by a wise and understanding heroine.  Edith Layton's story, however, was no way up to her usual high standards.  Emma Jensen's offering was simply too boring to catch my attention and Sandra Heath's shallow and a little absurd.  Barbara Metzger's story was light and amusing but she can do better.<br />Worth reading but not as good a Signet's previous offerings.  I wonder if this is because Mary Balogh has her own Christmas anthology this year and did not appear in this one.	2003-11-28

Exactly what was needed to keep me interested and amused whilst enduring the flight.<br />I have always had a soft spot for this novel because Miles Calverleigh is someone, when I was 16, I was desparate to find.  Yes, and then keep him all to myself.  Georgette Heyer does the Rake better than anyone who has ever tried to do it.  Although Damerel in Venetia is my all time favourite Rake, Miles Calverleigh, with his sense of humour, his relaxed attitude towards life and his acute insight into human foibles is amusing, admirable and fanciable.  The ruthless way he sets up his despicable nephew, Stacy, is hilarious.<br />Black Sheep is written with Heyer's usual flair and insight, the dialogue is first class and the heroine, Abigail Wendover, is the sort you'd like as a friend.<br />Read it - read it and see how the regency genre ought to be and realise how few writers since Heyer have managed to achieve it!	2003-11-28
US	50886639	RL4TQBKD1SORN	0399101446	196766806	A Civil Contract	Books	5	6	7	N	N	The benchmark for writers in the regency genre	One of my great treasures is my collection of the complete works of Georgette Heyer, started when I was still at university and completed with the publication of Lady of Quality.  I haven't read any of them for over 20 years but they have travelled with me all over the world, carefully packed up every time I have moved.<br />In preparation for a recent long-haul flight, I picked out several Heyers including A Civil Contract to re-read.  The story is outlined by other reviewers and indeed it is exquisitely plotted, moving slowly through the seasons and the social, political and economic events of the times.  Essentially, it is the story of unlikely opposites marrying much in accordance with the customs of the time and building a deep and affectionate relationship despite themselves.<br />The characters are all well drawn (although perhaps Mr Chawleigh is a bit two dimensional) and they slowly grow on you so that you care what happens to them and you cheer them on as they find their way through a situation that initially seems unlikely to offer any personal happiness.<br />What struck me when re-reading this novel was just how few writers of the regency genre have come anywhere near reaching Heyer's standards.  Her intimate knowledge of every aspect of life during the Regency, her acute literary skills and sheer ability to tell a good story have never been equalled by her aspirants.  She continues, to this day, to be the ultimate benchmark for regency fiction.	2003-11-28

As a lover of well written biography and history, it's wonderful to indulge in a such a well-informed, witty and charming picture of one man's life in the London of Cromwell and the Restoration.<br />I think Pepys would have loved the internet, chat rooms, gossip columns in the Sunday papers and probably reality TV.  Tomalin has introduced me to a man who had inexhaustible curiosity about the world around him but, most significantly of all, curiosity about himself.  Everything and anything was worth noting down for Pepys and the minutiae of his daily life is a treasure.<br />I've never read the diary itself but after reading this, I don't see the need.  The author has captured exquisitely Pepys's life and times including plague, fire, war, peace, domesticity, ill health and extended family - all coloured by Pepys's endearing self-examination (and self-importance!!).  Fortunately, Pepys loved himself and I found myself liking him as he liked himself.  As such, we get a wonderful picture of a man's life and times without politically correct, turgid self-examination and self-criticism; this man loved life!  Hooray for him!<br />For a micro and macro view of the London of Cromwell, the Restoration, the coming of age of the British Navy, the evolution of literature, art, science, architecture and the embryo of the British empire, you can't beat this book.<br />Highly recommended - Tomalin gives a fresh, clear view of a man who seems so immediate you can well imagine him living next door!	2003-10-10

On a lazy summer day, this very old Barbara Hazard novel fits the bill.<br />Lady Patricia Westerly, the only daughter of a wastrel marquess, was sold to a vulgar, disgusting, avaricious Cit, Mr Alvin J Biddles.  Alvin is by trade a moneylender and, to be sure, is unloved and despised by all and sundry.  However, Patricia is determined to do her duty and stand by her marriage vows despite living with a nasty sort who chews with his mouth open and commits so many ghastly faux pas that no one in the ton will speak to her let alone befriend her.  Alvin purchases an estate near Bath which he over-gilds to an unbelieveably horrifying degree and they are domiciled there when our hero, Guy Leighton, Viscount Reading comes on the scene.<br />Guy sees her across a busy high street and is immediately struck by the proverbial coup de foudre and despite all obstacles, this pair manage to fall in love.  However, it takes them two years of chaste and discreet behaviour before they are able to be together.  During this time Guy leaves behind rakery in order to present to Patrica the man he feels she deserves by growing into his role as a landowner.  We meet family members and friends from both sides who gently stir the plot and expedite the affair.<br />It all comes to grief when Alvin is murdered and the finger of suspicion points to Patrica.  Eventually, of course, for ths is a romance, it all comes out right in the end.<br />Peopled by some rather unambiguous characters, the novel does have a dark side too for spousal abuse both mental and physical plays a role as does fidelity, personal growth and deep, abiding love.  This is a good read and I recommend it highly if you like good, traditional regencies written with panache.	2003-08-15
US	50886639	R1ZZOLCCZF3L8M	0451180496	997575875	Lord Ashford's Wager (Signet Regency Romance, 8049)	Books	4	8	10	N	N	A very unusual story - something completely different!	I had to think about this book for a few days before posting a review because it was completely outside the usual Regency parameters.  And, it's unlike the rest of this author's work.  Although I have given this book 4 stars, it ought to be 4.5 stars.<br />First of all, this is a book without a hero or heroine - at least in my view!  All of the characters are flawed, some very deeply, and none of them behaves in an exemplary manner.  There is also a thread of earthiness in the novel without it descending into overt sexual scenes.<br />In brief, it is the story of Tony Varden, Earl of Ashford.  A second son, he went into the Army and was fighting in Spain when he was recalled to England following the death of first his father and then, very soon after, his brother.  The estate he has inherited is deeply encumbered and without any training (or inclination) Ashford is thrust into a role for which he is totally unprepared.  Because he is not really very mature, he thinks that gambling will give him the chance to win enough to pay off his debts.  He is soon a dedicated gambler and, interestingly, the author allows him to enjoy his gambling to a degree rather than castigating him for it.  He meets a fabulously wealthy widow, a few years older than he and pursues her, borrowing money from her to fund his gambling and eventually the pair decide to marry.  The widowed Lady Fairhaven goes into the relationship with eyes wide open, knowing Ashford for what he is but wishful for the relationship after a marriage to a man 30 years her senior.<br />In the background is the \\"childhood sweetheart\\", Joanna Barrand, who has loved Ashford since she was a girl.  Non-requited, sadly, but nonetheless her love for him causes her to support him unhesitatingly when he is accused of murder.  For Lady Fairhaven is indeed murdered.<br />In this story the reader knows the identify of the murder immediately so there is no mystery here.  Instead, a Bow Street Runner named Gideon Naylor is introduced and a large part of the novel follows his investigations.  We are taken into Newgate Prison where Ashford is taken after being charged with killing Lady Fairhaven.  Here the author describes the \\"protection\\" rackets in the prison, the homosexual favours granted for money or survival, etc.  This is all realistically described almost in a clinical fashion.  She also describes the workings of a brothel in much the same way, describing \\"alternative\\" tastes and practices.<br />Eventually the real killer is brought to justice, Lord Ashford grows up, his debts are resolved and he and Joanna are set to live happily ever after.  However, this does not happen until each character in the story has had to examine closely his or her own motives and psyche.  All act from less than altruistic motives or even admirable and, although one sometimes dislikes the main players, at least their behaviour is fairly realistic.<br />This story struck me as something of a docu-drama.  It was unlike anything between the covers of a Signet Regency that I have ever before encountered.  Although I wasn't particularly sympathetic with the characters or their motives, I was still drawn deeply into the action.  Curious book.  Not quite 5 stars because I could never \\"fancy\\" the purported hero, Lord Ashford - something you have to do when reading romantic fiction.  Nonetheless, like everthing else by this excellentwriter, it was tightly plotted and well written.  I just wish I knew what she was thinking when she wrote it!	2003-08-08

As such, if you liked the first and second stories (part two was \\"Autumn Rose\\"), then you will want to read this one too.<br />This novel is a little shorter than the other two but still has the author's trademarks of grown ups dealing in an adult way with realistic problems, memorably sketched characters and tight plotting.<br />Again we have a dual level story with two heroines:  Lady Barbara Stanley, the close friend of Judith Ware Ballance, and Deborah Cohen, a Jewish resident of the old London East End.  The heros are Lord Alexander MacLeod and Sir David Treves.<br />The story is about how Lady Barbara, hoping for a marriage like that of the Suttons, makes a false start by becoming betrothed to the Marquess of Wardour.  Through a lovely platonic friendship with Sir David, she comes to learn a lot about herself and her life views such that she breaks her engagement when she realises that Wardour does not come up to her most personal criteria as a life partner.  Sir David accidentally meets Deborah Cohen and through her re-examines his Jewish faith and his role in both the Jewish and wider English community.  He is loosely modelled on the Rothschilds who were so invaluable to Wellington's peninsular campaign.<br />Alexander MacLeod is the grandson of a duke who wishes to make music his life's work in a time when being a working musician or composer was simply not acceptable to the higher echelons of the aristocracy and \\"polite\\" world of regency times.  He has a critical impact on all of the main characters.<br />The author writes about music, Judiaism, Tory-Whig politics and the class and social barriers of the times with authority and without \\"preaching\\" or \\"teaching\\".  She wears her research lightly and makes such an unlikely topic come brilliantly alive in this story.  Everything works out in the end but you realise that you have spent a few hoursin the company of characters who have become very much alive.  She particularly celebrates close friendship as demonstrated by some very touching scenes between Lady Barbara and the Duchess of Sutton.<br />I could read a number of stories about the people we meet in these three novels if only the author provided them and I highly recommend this one as well as the other two in the trilogy.	2003-07-29

I must admit I was a little hesitant to commence proceedings because I love Miss Ware's Refusal so much that it is in my personal Top Ten All Time Keepers.  I read the first review of the book and wondered whether it would live up to expectations afterall.<br />First of all, I agree with the first reviewer - there is simply NO excuse for getting the titles as badly wrong as they are in this book.  It's annoying, irritating and indicative of careless editing and questionable research.  However, in this instance, the book in all its other attributes rises above this.<br />This is a story on three levels.  Like everything else I have read by this author, it is serious stuff, dealing with difficult, adult issues in an unflinching and satisfying way.<br />H/H 1 - Miranda, the illegitimate daughter of Nora Dillon and Jeremy, the very young Earl of Alverstone.  They are two young people who articulate the expression &quot;old head on young shoulders&quot; very well.  Although faced with family objections (some apparent and some not), in a mature manner, they overcome the pitfalls in their path and find a true and lasting love.  They care deeply for each other and love their parents.  Not rebels, these two!<br />H/H 2 - Nora Dillon, the daughter of a marquess, lost her mother young, responded to the attention and superficial love of a rake and then ran off with him.  Pregnant and alone, believing herself cut off after the rake dies before he can marry her, she makes a life for herself and her daughter on her own in a way that ensures they both become well rounded, independent and loving women.  Hero #2 is Sam, Viscount Acland, 39 years old, well-travelled, well-read, a politician, a perennial bachelor who suddenly, in middle age, unexpectedly finds himself deeply in love.<br />H/H 3 - the Duke and Duchess of Sutton, of course!  Simon has matured into a man of great insight, patience and understanding.  He is allowed in this novel to be the means of untangling the misunderstandings, the hurt, the pain and the difficulties of the first two pairs of lovers.  It was delightful to be allowed to see how his marriage to Judith has matured and mellowed now that they are new parents.<br />The action in this story is stately, slow and every piece of the puzzle eventually slips into place.  There are no unanswered questions, all issues are realistically resolved.  Nora, really the main heroine, finds that although we cannot wipe out the past, we can live with it, grow from it and even be grateful for it.<br />A real tour de force, in my view.  Exquisitely written, as always, by this wonderful writer and another keeper for me.  I am now about the read the third installment, Lady Barbara's Dilemma.  Very highly recommended.	2003-07-28

I don't think the author intended to have just one for this is the story of two sisters, raised in slighty unusual circumstances who fall in love (with reservations!) with two friends who are as close as brothers and who are themselves very unlike each other.  We have two heroines and two heros - and, why not?<br />Harry, Marquess of Sidmouth, against the wishes of his family took a commission and fought in Wellington's Spanish campaign. As a young and impressionable man, he witnessed the terrible atrocities that followed the successful siege at Badajoz.  What happened to him caused him to lose some of his faith in humanity and most certainly the the value of love and the sexual expression of love.  He needs healing but is unaware of this.<br />His friend James, Lord Clitheroe, had always done what his somewhat stuffy and proud family demanded but, by the time we meet him, he is having doubts about the merit of letting others run his life.<br />Kate Richmond, always the sensible one in a family of eccentrics, and Lynette, beautiful but scholarly, meet these two men and despite a few false starts, each ends with the right man.<br />Farrell brings in a May Day celebration in Cornwall as a plot device to allow everyone to shed some of their inhibitions and pre-conceived notions.  Although not an ideal device, it does get the point across and is the turning point for all concerned.<br />Farrell does not write amusing, frothy stories about mindless love.  She makes you think and she lets her characters act out the story in a way that fits their timeframe.  Cheers for this.  In this story, one of our heroines experienced molestation as a child and the sexual implictions of this are part of the focus ofthe story.  Although not my favourite of her novels, nonetheless, I recommend this to those of you who like a good story with excellent characters who grow and learn about themselves in a credible way.	2003-07-24

A very early effort by this author who has had a long and prolific career.  I remember it fondly as a precursor, for me at any rate, to my foray into Georgette Heyer and, as such, it has always remained a standard by which to judge much regency and historical fiction.<br />Briefly, it is the story of young Marianne, victim of amnesia who arrives at Maulever Hall with a small boy in tow not knowing who she is or where she was bound or, indeed, who the small boy is.  The owner of the Hall, Mr Mark Mauleverer, is a forbidding (never sinister - indeed, he's too sexy to be that and at 13 or 14 when I first read this, I was MOST impressed!!) character, a politician and former soldier, a battle-scarred veteran of Waterloo.  There is a mystery, of course, which gets solved but also allows the H/H to be developed, fleshed out and fall in love.  There are peripheral characters comically drawn including the hero's mother and a duchess who gardens in gum-boots.<br />Worth seeking out if only to see how few authors writing in this genre today have managed to achieve Jane Aiken Hodge's early standards!  I simply cannot believe my copy is a 1967 edition!!!	2003-07-23

I see that a second-hand copy of this book now costs an extortionate amount!  Well, mine will stay on the keeper shelf, thank you!  I started reading Elsie Lee in high school and think I have every book she wrote carefully packed away.  But, without doubt (with a nod to Second Season), this one was my favourite of her regency stories.  Her contemporary novels were vaguely \\"suspense\\" stories but, in my opinion, she really hit her forte with her regency-set novels.<br />Elsie Lee will always be remembered by me for witty writing and crisp, clever dialogue.  This is the story of a handsome and witty marquess who returns to London to find his uncle's 20 year old widow, siamese cats and various servants ensconced in his townhouse having just returned from India.  The action takes place over Christmas (always a favourite time frame for me) and brings in a large and well-drawn extended family.<br />Faith Baldwin was quoted on the back cover my my copy as saying \\"an enchanting book ... it has wit, humor, marvelous characterisations and atmosphere\\".  Indeed it does.  Would I pay to replace my copy?  Yes!	2003-07-23

As a slice of Americana, of California history, of young love, of adventure, of character growth, I think this book is better than Gone With the Wind.  Garnet Cameron, a lovely, passionate, gently bred girl follows her dream across the American continent in the days before the gold rush.  Oliver Hale, her first husband is an adventurer, handsome and exciting but not quite grown up.  Florinda, the tart with a heart, a wonderful woman, strong and vulnerable fortunately comes back to us in Calico Palace.  And John Ives, the hero of the piece, is a man in love with a woman he thinks he can't have, a true \\"founding father\\" of pre 1849-California, strong, loving and brave.<br />The settings, actions, geography, food, clothing, politics and weather all come to life in this wonderful adventure.  The reader becomes so enmeshed in the story that when you finally close the book, you are surprised to find you were not in old Los Angeles.	2003-07-23
US	50886639	R3LIHCGWVVVIAH	0373835752	295071831	The Wedding Chase	Books	2	5	10	N	N	A HUGE disappointment	I admire Gayle Wilson very much and have read nearly all of her books and particularly like her historical novels.  Despite Wilson's &quot;Prisoner of the Tower&quot; contribution to this anthology, I simply cannot recommend it.<br />Kasey Michaels was new to me.  This will be the last of her books/stories, however, as it was rather one-dimensional peopled with over-drawn and unsympathetic characters in a plot that defied belief.  Just for starters, it was never and is not now legal to get married in England on the spur of the moment, without banns or license and in an inn!  What was the author thinking of here?  Sadly, this effort was juvenile, unpolished and stretched credibility too far for me.<br />Lyn Stone is also new to me and, again, I won't be seeking out anything further from her either.  Her contribution was boring, stilted, contained credulous dialogue and action and the characters had nothing to cause me to give them a second thought.  I struggled to finish it.<br />Gayle Wilson has a certain speciality which her fans will recognise and most probably relish.  She creates flawed, imperfect heros who, despite this, are strong alpha men who don't let a disability stand in their way; instead it becomes a positive attraction to them!  However, this time in her contribution, she has created a hero who milks his flaw (scarred face) far beyond anything acceptable and thus his actions are really unbelievably silly.  If he is meant to be strong and heroic, he certainly does not behave that way.  Wilson's &quot;My Darling Echo&quot; contribution to the anthology &quot;Bride by Arrangement&quot; was so superior to this effort that it makes this one quite insipid.  Sorry to be so negative about a writer I always enjoy but in all honesty, I don't understand why she allowed this one to get published.  It was not at all up to her usual standards.<br />So, we have a good author's dubious effort here, sandwiched between two totally forgettable stories.  The end result -a sandwich not worth tasting.  I'm hugely disappointed!	2003-07-21

She is one of my favourite Regency writers but this one was quite striking for its level of introspection, internal action and fey-ish quality.  The language employed by the author is almost quaint; her sentence structure is seems formally old-fashioned which adds to the charm of this story.<br />The plot has been summed admirably elsewhere so I want only to say that if you like novels that allow you to get inside the head of your hero, here is a splendid example.  Our heroine does not become as intimately known to us but we do learn a lot about our hero by how he reacts to her.  Cheers for his family and background - here is an earl who once worked with his hands.  Cheers, too, for the family of slum-bred children he adopts, takes to his heart and thereby, inadvertently, breaks a centuries-old family curse.<br />Oh for more examples of such witty, well-wrought prose in the Regency setting!!	2003-07-18

When it came out in paperback, I opened it with great anticipation.  I was never let down - Dalrymple, known mainly for his highly evocative and well received travel books, has turned historian and historiographer to produce this wonderful, exquisite book.<br />Although on one level it tells the story of James Achilles Kirkpatrick, British Resident in Hyderabad at the close of the 18th century, this book is a beautifully written examination of a number of white men from all over Europe (and America) who went adventuring in India from the time of Elizabeth I.  Many of them became \\"white mughals\\", immersing themselves in the lifestyle and religions (both Hindu and Muslim) of the various princely states.  Eventually, though, and most sadly, racist attitudes and unreasonable demands on local rulers made it more and more difficult for these men to carry on and eventually too many of the British in India became narrow minded, intolerant and xenophobic.  The British presence in India eventually became intolerable and so ended the British Empire in due course.  The author is particularly scathing of Lord Wellesley's governor-generalship.<br />The author has created a wonderful tapestry of various men, their Indian wives and Anglo-Indian children, the art, literature, architecture, politics, military adventures, food, domestic arrangements, etc of a short but poignant era in Indian and British/western history.  His scholarship is evident (the footnotes often fascinating) and he was very lucky to happen upon some original, never seen, sources which help make this book so vibrant.<br />The sad story of James and his Khair was both a tragedy and a triumph - I shall never forget them and, should I ever travel to India, Hyderabad and the old Residency are a must-see for me.	2003-07-02

Well, Marjorie Farrell has done it again for me. I have been overwhelmed by this book and hope anyone reading this review will not hesitate to obtain a copy and read it. This is a story about a battered wife and the personal growth of those closest to her following the incredible crescendo of the heroine killing her husband.<br />Lady Clare Dysart, a late in life child, grows up in the summertime company of twins Giles, Viscount Whitton and his twin sister Lady Sabrina Whitton. Over time, Giles falls deeply in love with Clare but hesitates to make an official proposal of marriage until she has enjoyed an unfettered first season. This allows her the opportunity to fall in love with Justin, Earl of Rainsborough. Sadly, Justin is a man who has two faces, two personalities. One is sensual, loving and giving but the other is crazed by alcohol and turns vicious, violent and jealous. He and Clare marry and, at first, their marriage is a flurry of passion and sexual satisfaction. However, his mental flaw soon brings out the insane jealousy that leads him to abusing Clare.<br />The author has portrayed the breakdown of the marriage of an insane man and his battered wife with incredible honesty. You flinch as you read it but are gratified at her amazing honesty portraying this sad, sad situation.<br />Eventually, Justin threatens to kill his wife in a jealous, irrational rage, and she finds the strength to fight him off and, in so doing, kills him. A trial ensues which deals (thank goodness !!!! ) with the issue of violence in marriage honestly within the historical context. Wives were chattel; a man could \\"chastise\\" his wife in any way he wished in those days and so the various characters in the story view the situation with historically contemporaneous rather than modern attitudes. Nonetheless, the message about the utter horror and degredation wife beating causes was well portrayed and Clare is found to have killed her husband in self-defence.<br />Now Giles is able to marry her and live happily ever after with the woman he has always adored. WRONG! Rather than end the novel here, Marjorie Farrell brings in a sub-plot which allows Sabrina to eventually secure the love of barrister Andrew More who had defended Clare in the coroner's court. The point of the sub-plot, however, was to deal honestly with the after effects of the trial, Clare's acceptance of herself for the woman she has become, and Giles's difficulties in admitting his own hurt and anger. She has grown and changed as a result of her disasterous marriage; he must accept her and love her on those terms - not in a gallant but misguided way based on who she was before the tragedy of her experiences.<br />I cannot praise this book highly enough. All of the characters, although very young, behave in an honest, open fashion. Serious issues are raised and the characters discuss them and deal with them in wholly believable ways. This book is a celebration of inner strength, loyalty, friendship and love whilst at the same time dealing with a highly emotive and awful issue: wife battering. The author is courageous enough to have written a book firmly set within its historical context without an overlay of unnecessary 21st century PC overtones. The message therefore is strong and clear but at the same time makes for an un-putdownable read. Although you sometimes feel the book is almost leisurely in its pace - something this author usually manages - it allows proper development of the plot and wholly credible character growth.<br />Please try to find a copy. If you enjoyed Mary Jo Putney's \\"The Rake\\" you will relish this novel. Ignore the tacky, tasteless and stupid cover. If you like your regency historicals strongly written with unforgettable characters acting out a thoroughly credible but satisfying storyline, find a copy - you won't be disappointed.	2003-06-12
US	50886639	R3BQM0I2QNTH4X	0451406788	15119664	Desert Hearts	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Thoughtful, poignant and satisfying read	I am an admitted fan of Marjorie Farrell and have been in the process of mopping up her back list.  Desert Hearts was not what I expected, particularly as it came with the usual tasteless, moronic Topaz cover.<br />In the broadest sense, this novel is a comparison and contrast of cultures in the mid 19th century. Although on the surface, an examination of the relations between an Irish Catholic, a Bostoninan of Puritan descent and the mysticism of the Navajo might seem unworkable, Marjorie Farrell has produced a deeply moving, very sympathetic and carefully researched story.<br />In brief, 12 year old Michael Joseph Burke is sent from famine-stricken western Ireland in 1848 by his father to America - a last ditch attempt to keep at least one of his family alive and provided with opportunity.  Elizabeth Rush is 14 when her family migrate west from Boston and she is the only survivor when the family are attacked by Comancheros.  Significantly, at this very important juncture in her life, she witnesses the rape of her mother.<br />Rescued by the US Cavalry and, particular, Lt Thomas Woolcott, she survives and eventually marries her rescuer.  She has been married happily to a good man, and living at Ft Defiance (now on the Navajo Reservation) when Master Sergeant Michael Burke comes in to her life.<br />Elizabeth begins a struggle:  to overcome her prejudices against \\"shanty Irish\\", against her growing and surprising attraction to Michael and to have friendships with a Navajo couple despite the ire and distaste of many of those at Ft Defiance.  Michael struggles too - against his growing, deep and full love for Elizabeth - everything he thinks he cannot have.<br />Widowed, she eventually marries Michael and they have a deeply passionate relationship in due course.  However, the story moves to focus on the exile of the Navajo from their own lands to a remote and inhospitable part of New Mexico.  This is a tale of great sadness and is exceptionally well drawn.  If you have read \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" or any other works about such events as the \\"trail of tears\\" you will be deeply moved by how the author portrays the prejudice, ignorance, and hatred that people displayed against the Navajo.  And yet, the point of the story is that Michael, as diaspora Irish, can wholly sympathise with the Navajo.  Elizabeth, as an orphan, artist and very compassionate woman is deeply moved and she, too, comes to empathise with the Navajo.<br />The author does an excellent job of integrating the faith of a devout Catholic with that of the mystical Navajo and Elizabeth, somewhat in the middle, eventually can see the common spirituality and humanity deep within us all.<br />High praise for this work.  Reading it, as I did, soon after Carla Kelly's \\"Here's to the Ladies\\", I have been pleasantly surprised to read two such excellent works about the American frontier west set during the Indian wars.  Marjorie Farrell is an excellent and underrated novelist.  Her prose is first class, her research shines through and she creates deeply interesting characters that stay with you long after the story has closed.	2003-06-09

I did persist and finished it but really don't see how this can be \\"love inspired\\" in any size, shape or form.  If it is supposed to be about people of faith, it gave us a man who handled his lady roughly, raged at her and never seemed to me, at any rate, to grow up, find any spiritual dimension or develop any real feeling towards those around him.  The inference made to the heroine's mother being better off dead, bearing in mind she had been an unhappy alcoholic, was incredible to say the least and was really quite offensive.  The dialogue was strictly B movie and stilted and strained.  Also, the book was clearly given a bit of a re-write to bring it up to date (eg the use of computer technology circa 2003 and not the early 1980s when it originally appeared) but it didn't work...	2003-06-05

It pains me to give this book 4 instead of 5 stars because Mary Balogh is without doubt one of the best in the genre.  Indeed, she always makes me feel she is writing for me personally, meeting all of my own personal and private criteria in romantic historical fiction.  However, I am sorry to note that Slightly Married was a wee bit of a disappointment.<br />The opening salvo in the saga of the Bedwyns introduced the family of the Duke of Bewcastle and I will follow it eagerly.  I will probably like some of the players more than others and Col Lord Aidan Bedwyn will be a hard act to follow although the story of the Duke himself promises to be something quite out of the ordinary!<br />My problem with this book was the peripheral characters in our heroine's family.  Let's just say that Aunt Mari, Cousin Cecil, the over-drawn domestic servants and even the poor deceased brother Percy were one-dimensional and ill-drawn.  Also, although Balogh is herself British (from Wales), she let a number of awkward Americanisms slip into this novel, particularly in the first quarter of it.  This, for me at any rate, disturbed the rythym of the narrative and was rather distracting.<br />The story of our two very different protaganists, once the action moved to London, picked up and became more like the Mary Balogh we all love and admire and I felt she got her stride back after a rocky start.  Bewcastle is going to be a wonderful irritant to his brothers and sisters and the saga looks promising.  Lord Aidan was a different sort of hero and although his volte face in the closing chapters was hasty and hurried, I liked him; he was not the usual sort of man Balogh presents.<br />Of course I have to recommend this if only as the start of the Bedwyn tales but I felt it wanted a last re-write and polish.  It was an entertaining if sometimes slightly less than perfect Balogh read.	2003-06-05

I reviewed this book some while ago and have come back to look at ensuing comments from time to time with great interest.  I do think it curious that readers of historical fiction so very often insist on applying contemporary behavioral standards to characters who peopled a world that is so different from our own that, if suddenly transported back, most of us would find life incomprehensible.<br />Domestic and marital law and attitudes have changed so much in the last 100 years that even our grandmothers would seem to have lived lives of deepest deprivation in what was, in fact, a &quot;man's world&quot; - you can't change the past!<br />So, why such vituperation at Jo Beverly for daring to present characters acting out situations from another world all together with a different set of morals and code of behaviour?  The castigation she has received here seems to me to be ill-conceived at best.  Would these critics be so scathing if reviewing science fiction?  I doubt it but there is some similarity here in reading of a world radically unlike our own.  Why read historical fiction if you prefer your stories and characters to be contemporary people dressed up in historical costume?<br />I believe this was an excellently written, brilliantly peopled story and should be read with an eye to historical context and understanding that one is reading about a very different world which, whether we like it or not, we cannot go back and change.	2003-05-31

Mary Balogh is so talented that she rarely fails to please and those who may have been disappointed by this story perhaps prefer stories which are not quite so introspective as this one.<br />One aspect of this novel I enjoyed was that it brought a happy outcome for some of those wonderful characters in One Night for Love.  It also allowed us to watch a deeply hurt and misunderstood man and woman reach tentatively, hesitatingly for mutual fulfilment and and happiness.  Kit Butler, Lt Col Viscount Ravensberg had, from all outward appearances, a brilliant military career working under particularly dangerous circumstances.  Balogh alludes to this sparingly but with great effect as she explores the impact that war and command can have on a man.  However, he is damaged and confused and hurt as a result of his experiences and this has helped to bring about a collapse of relations with each member of his family.<br />Miss Lauren Edgeworth was the jilted bride from One Night for Love who, we now find out, has turned inward on herself because of loss of her parents at a young and vulnerable age.  She has some rather deep psychological scarring which needs to be expunged if ever she is to find true happiness and serenity of spirit.  Her calm and cool manner hides a deeply passionate and loving woman who, sadly, all her life has felt she must exist to please others and never herself.  Balogh writes with great insight into Lauren's character.<br />Balogh has written a novel examining the psychological make-up of two very interesting and sympathetic characters.  They think and behave in a wholly credible and believeable fashion.  She has truly made them come alive for me and, by placing them in a setting of a large extended family, she shows how sadly isolated both of them are, despite the surroundings of the comings and goings of everyday family activity.<br />I am truly interested to see if the author can make me like Lady Freyja Bedwyn who makes her somewhat alarming debut here.  I look forward to reading about her and her family in the Bedwyn saga.  I also hope that Sydnam Butler, Kit's younger brother will find a happy outcome in a future story.  Much of the torment and turmoil experienced by Kit is directly attributable to his relationship with Sydnam.  Sydnam deserves \\"fleshing out\\" and I hope to read more of him.<br />All in all, another marvel from Mary Balogh and not to be missed if you like heart-wrenching, immaculately plotted fiction with a rounded, mature H/H who mature to loving completion in a most heart-warming way.	2003-05-27

As a Regency novel devotee (and not especially enamoured of short stories), I must admit I wondered what this volume would bring for it is often the case that romance writers have a special niche and crossing genres is not always successful.  &quot;Here's to the Ladies&quot; was, for me, one of the best books I have read this year.<br />This is a delightful collection of stories of men, and their women and families, serving in the Army, Cavalry and Army Medical Corps during the period of the Indian Wars.  Living and working in remote, isolated and difficult circumstances in frontier forts in the Dakotas, Nevada, Arizona and Wyoming, the people in these stories come to brilliant life in Kelly's hands.  She writes with economy and brevity yet breathes life into her characters so that the reader feels they know each one intimately, their foibles, their fears and their deepest emotions.<br />Some of the stories are told from the masculine POV and Kelly is a past master at creating male characters of great sympathy and humour.  My personal favourite is Capt Jesse MacGregor, a surgeon in Arizona whose story reads like a thrilling dime novel.  In &quot;Kathleen Flaherty's Long Winter&quot; we have a shy hero and a heroine who turns tragedy into triumph.  &quot;Casually at Post&quot; is the story of a man named God and is written with wit and charm.  &quot;A Season for Heros&quot; tells of courage and heroism amongst the famous Buffalo Soldiers and is touching and poignant.<br />I don't usually read the &quot;western&quot; genre but feel this collection is as good as Nancy Turner's much applauded &quot;These is My Words&quot; or Penelope Williamson's &quot;Hearts of the West&quot;.  I expect to read this volume again and again and have passed it to the man in my life to read for the themes Kelly writes about are those which are central to all meaningful fiction:  honour, courage, pathos, tenderness, humour and meaningful, satisfying personal relationships.<br />A keeper; please read it and relish the sterling quality of Carla Kelly's beautifully wrought prose.	2003-05-21

As a baby-boomer American living in England, looking at the sometimes foolishness of both Roosevelt and Churchill in dealing with the threat of Stalin's ambitions was an eye-opener.  The utter deviousness of Stalin and the inability of so many to see what he had in mind was a sorry episode for us all.  The daily life of civilians and soldiers was vividly portrayed including the helplessness of women at the mercy of Soviet troops.  Beevor does bring out brief examples of humanity and honour but, overall, I can't decide whom he loathes more - Hitler or Stalin.<br />Stalingrad was a more elegaic work and moved me very much when I read it.  Berlin angered me and made me realise that some issues are never dead.<br />I am interested in military history, albeit of a much earlier era (Wellington and the Peninsula).  I do think this book was let down by the maps which I found annoying and difficult to interpret.  Also, the selection of photographs was frustrating - I wished for pictures of the key figures in the story.<br />A good read and worthwhile although I feel Stalingrad was better all round.	2003-05-19

Others have summed up the plot well so there is no point in going over it again.  As always, with this author, it is the witty writing, colourful characters and bizarre supporting cast that makes her work so attractive.<br />Metzger's command of farcical writing is brilliant.  She uses word-play so effectively and gives us wonderful comedic situations so very well.  I love her use, in particular, of alliteration such as &quot;preening pea-geese&quot; which gives a bright sparkiness to her writing.<br />The best running joke in this novel was the search for the perfect valet for our delicious hero, Lord Ingall.  Torrie, our heroine was not Metzger's best (hence 4 instead of 5 stars) as she was a bit two dimensional which made her effect on the plot a little heavy.  However, Ingall grows in the reader's eyes throughout the story and you want to cheer for him at the end.  By the way, the last chapter is a delight!	2003-04-26

Lord Monteith's Gift (a cabin/road romance) is an entertaining story with characters who are, in the main, well rounded and satisfactory.<br />Lord Monteith, a dour Scot and former military man, is now a politician working on reform matters.  The heroine, Evelynne Marriott, is a young woman somewhat down on her luck.  In a plot which combines intrigue with comedic misunderstanding, the author gives us a satisfying read.<br />However, I felt somewhat disappointed that the author resorts to allowing the hero behaving in a somewhat incredulous in order to facilitate the climax of the story.  I felt she could have found another way rather than allowing him what was, by that point in the relationship with the heroine, caddish behaviour.  This, for me, was a weakness in the plotting.<br />I was enchanted by one of the secondary characters, Arkady, Marquess of Mitford, a half Russian man of mystery and many facets.  I can't see evidence that Nancy Butler has given him his own story; shame, that - he was great fun and very attractive!<br />Although perhaps not a keeper, I do recommend Lord Monteith's gift as a good read, peopled by three dimensional characters and a satisfying love story.  I do feel, however, that the plot was perhaps the weakest point here although not overly so.	2003-04-24

It was very good and the setting in Russia, just as Napoleon was closing on Moscow in 1812 was very good.  It reminded me a little of Dinah Dean's books in the 1980s which were set in Russia during the same timeframe.<br />The characters were also good:  a very strong, intelligent and mature heroine, Miss Octavia Hadley, who accepts the hand fate has dealt her with dignity and stoicism.  The hero, Lord Alexander Sheffield (though the author gets his title wrong), is less mature when we first meet him but grows up through this story, enabling him to reassess his own actions and come to accept himself.  He has some good qualities and, of course this being romantic fiction, needs the love of a good woman to bring them forth!<br />The two children, Emma and Nicholas, are the instigators of the plot action, are well done and realistic.<br />This is a prodigal son story and one of redemption.  I liked it but must agree with others that there were annoying errors.  The titles of the hero's family were wrongly done and there were silly dialogue problems like &quot;sussing out&quot; and &quot;dossing down&quot; both of which are modernisms as far as I am aware.<br />I can recommend this book as a good read, a little different and peopled by some interesting characters.  Not a keeper but worth a look.	2003-04-17
US	50886639	R1FEPEOO4XN2EO	0821771930	520333787	A Rake's Redemption	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Thoughtful and contemplative	I have now read four of Donna Simpson's novels and, judging from the reviews posted about all of her books, I think I have read the best of them.<br />A Rake's Redemption is about just that with a consideration of the power of love in redemption from evil - but to say that does not really do it justice.  There is a measure of philosophical reflection in this story that allows the reader to understand how the hero comes to terms with his own past, learns to deal with the results of his own actions and to watch the heroine deal frankly with her own awakening sexuality.<br />There is also an examination of the rules of life then applicable to men and to women without denigrating either.  The H/H also examine the ramifications of gambling and look at the morality of the code of honour then attached to it.  Both the Earl of Hardcastle and Miss Phaedra Gillian feel very sincerely that they have the right of moral argument presented but have the grace and courage to learn to see the other's perspective.<br />There is little action and not a great deal of conversation in this novel and what conversation there is is not fluffy or unfocused - every interaction furthers the moral argument.<br />I seem to have made some rather heavy comments here but I have to say that I enjoyed this novel immensely - it was a pleasure to watch two people struggle with their hearts and minds over serious issues.  Yet, love was always the key here and the growing attraction and deep love that develops between them makes this a very satisfying read.	2003-04-11

The whole plot seemed too artificial, too contrived and ultimately could not achieve my involvement as the reader.  The H/H are not especially attractive and nothing in the narrative makes them sparkle and I found it hard to empathise with either of them.  The Duchess frankly annoyed me to the point where I wanted to scream.  I barely finished this one; I had nothing else to read whilst waiting for someone at a prolonged medical appointment.  I can't recommend it and hovered between 2 and 3 stars for this novel.	2003-04-07

And here is the last of the troika of Christmas regencies I bought at my favourite UBS in Southern California recently.  It was the best of the lot but I don't think I will be seeking out the author's backlist.  The plot was clever and I thought it was good but I could not warm to the H/H although the little boy was not too terribly obnoxious.  Getting the ankle-biters right in romance (both contemporary and modern) is difficult.  It is interesting to note that the owner of the UBS was contacted by one of the major US romance publishers and asked her what annoyed her customers most about current romance publishing.  She told them that overwhelmingly, readers are fed up by &quot;baby&quot; books.  Well, damn right!<br />Anyway, getting back to the book, the problem here for me was that the heroine acted with immaturity and silliness when she should have behaved like an adult.  Unfortunately, the hero was unable to provide for me, as the reader, that spark of attraction that is so necessary.  If the reader can't find something to admire, lust after or just simply sympathise with in the hero, a romantic novel becomes a bit of a chore.<br />An OK read but not anywhere near a keeper.	2003-04-07

I love regency fiction and Christmas stories are private little comfort reads.  However this one was so drab, so dull and so ill-written with a silly plot, one dimensional characters and boring dialogue that I tossed it into the bin after the first 75 pages or so.  The most attractive feature was the cover.  My only excuse was that I was pigging out in my favourite UBS in California whilst on a recent visit and wasn't paying full attention when I added this to my pile of purchases.  Sorry to be so negative but I cannot recommend this at all.	2003-04-07

An enlisted man (not Captain as the cover of the book says) finds that whilst recovering from severe wounds he can offer solace and comfort to a woman who has suffered the trauma of breast cancer - an older woman who holds him at arms length but whose doubts he overcomes.  The charming peripheral characters (Mrs Bee and her ladies, the pussycat and his MREs for cats) add to the story.  Cheryl Reavis is a good writer although sometimes fails to live up to her potential.  However, she did very well in this one in handling difficult issues.  I passed this one on to my mother who also enjoyed it.	2003-04-07

However, it failed, in my view, to live up to its potential and was, in the end, thin, superficial and a disappointment.  Three stars because of the subject matter!<br />Others have summed up the plot of a young woman of a socially mixed marriage getting into a social pickle and joining her general father in Portugal.  Whilst following the drum during Wellington's push towards Toulouse and the exile of Napoleon, we learn about the difficulties of campaigning for those who accompanied the armies of Wellington.  However, the characterisations of the main players, the quality of the dialogue and the superficiality of some of the plot streams in this novel only made me wish someone else had written it.  I think Carla Kelly would, without doubt, have realised the potential here or Emma Drummond could have added great depth and power to the story.<br />So, sadly, one of those disappointments that crop up from time to time.  Two stars for characters and three for the plot.  I really would not recommend this one.	2003-04-07

After reading The Parfait Knight, I spent a lot of time (and a silly amount of money) finding a copy of Lucifer's Champion.  Yes, it was worth it.  The \\"Georgian\\" novel tends to move at a lanquid, stately pace and, if well written, ought to contain witty and sparkling dialogue.  This work fitted the bill exactly.<br />Briefly, \\"Lucifer\\" is Francis Courtenay, 5th Duke of Lyndhurst, a reprobate who, as he says himself, has made his reputation fit only to spit on.  A highly educated man, a surprisingly moral man despite his history, he is also a loyal friend.  He has, nonetheless, made a mess of his life and, looking 40 in the face, finds his life empty of any significant meaning.<br />Vanessa Tremaine, young, orphaned, alone and escaping the obligatory evil cousin, flees her home in Cornwall and becomes, through circumstances, Lyndhurst's ward.<br />We are then treated to a stately gavotte of a London season in mid-18th century London.  There are excellent descriptions of clothing (how much like peacocks men were then!), social occasions, a memorable evocation of a game of piquet, dueling and so forth.  But the hub of the story is the unfolding relationship between \\"Lucifer\\" Lyndhurst and his ward.  There is verbal sparring, high emotion, interferring relations, kidnappings and frissons of deep sexual tension in this novel.  All of the action seems credible and both the H/H do suffer before each can see truly what is in their own hearts.<br />A shame this author appears to have had an output of only two books.  She writes beautifully, uses the occasional archaic but contemporary word to evoke the flavour of Georgian ton life and brings her characters to resounding life.<br />I recommend it highly if you can find a copy.	2003-03-24

I've now read a number of Nancy Butler's novels and, thus far, this one is the very best. A story of a mature woman and a rake with a sad and bad past is always a pleasurable plot for me. But this one was certainly one of the finest I've read and put me in mind of Heyer's Venetia and her beloved Damerel.<br />Jemima Vale - mature, intelligent and strong is missing something in her life - love, true companionship and (unbeknownst to her) sexual fulfilment. She meets, through the subplot of intrique and espionage, Mr Beecham Bryce - rake, reprobate, fallen angel with a hardened heart. Of course, in this sort of scenario, the H/H are never quite what they seem. Jemima is wise and caring but eager to love a man who, superficially at any rate, appears to be totally inappropriate. Bryce is a man who has willfully brought on his own downfall yet retains strong family ties and yearns to find love and completion with Jemima, a woman who proves to be his true \\"other half\\".<br />This is a tightly plotted story with wholly believable characters (and some brilliant secondary characters) and the story is enlivened by some of the wittiest dialague I have read in a regency novel for a very long time. Just one tiny example:<br />Jemima looked up at the sky, assessing the position of the sun. \\"I see that it is past noon. And that your innuendoes have returned, right on schedule.\\"<br />Bryce's mouth drew up into a crooked grin. \\"I don't flatter before lunchtime; innuendo I can furnish round the clock.\\"<br />Butler handles her mature heroine and flawed hero with great skill and gusto in this novel. Both are characters who come bursting to life for the reader. It's definitely a keeper and it's made me realise it is time to re-read Heyer's \\"Venetia\\" again. Very highly recommended for its plot, characters, dialogue and high levels of emotion and sexual tension.	2003-03-18

It is, briefly, the story of a young woman from a good background who finds that the arranged marriage she is about to enter is unacceptable to her.  Diana learns that her fiance is full of flaws that cause her to lose any esteem for him.  She flees, precipitately, and nearly drowns in the Thames.  Rescued by the hero, Romulus, she elects to pretend amnesia in order to stay with him and, ultimately learn more about both him and herself.<br />Romulus lives on a small island in the Thames and is a gamekeeper looking after the waterfowl in the immediate area to keep them safe from poachers.  Rom is a man with A Past.  There are secrets, allusions to madness and a whiff of a foreign background.  Gradually we learn more of his sad background and heroic military past but always there is a little hint that Rom is not what he seems.<br />There are peripheral secondary characters, gypsies, suspicious villagers and poacher-villains who move the plot along but, in essence, this is a Lost Heir story which I had guessed in the first couple of chapters and, indeed, I figured out who early on.<br />The main surprise is the redemption of the original villain, the purportedly &quot;nasty&quot; fiance from whom Diana flees.<br />There is a somewhat mystical aspect to this story which I felt could have been set in any timeframe you care to mention.  If you like fairy tales with happy endings where the players must suffer in order to triumph, then you will like this.  It's quite sweet but the hero is damaged ehough to make him and his spiritual journey and recovery very poignant.  It was not quite a keeper for me and I don't think I will want to read it again.  But the author writes very well and her story line and island setting are satisfying and attractive.	2003-03-12
US	50886639	RYTOQYQGNNLFH	0060508108	371901411	Duchess in Love	Books	2	28	40	N	N	Oh dear .............	I hovered between 2 and 3 stars for this one as 2.5 is not an option.  Unfortunately, 2 stars it will have to be.  This book failed to reach its potential and, for me, was too full of errors and required too much stretching of reality to keep my attention.  Others have summed up the plot which, on the whole, was probably the best aspect of the book.  I just kept thinking that other writers, perhaps Julia Quinn or Barbara Metzger could have given it a bit more polish and credibility.  It had the potential to be very funny but sadly lacked wit and depth.<br />Too many errors crept in which stopped the narrative from flowing smoothly.  Here are a few examples:<br />.... \\"we will never pay another red cent\\" - an American expression which I doubt was used in the timeframe on either side of the pond.<br />\\"Marquess Bonnington\\" - should be The Marquess of Bonnington.  Small point but silly error.<br />\\"She took a bite of chicken.  It tasted like a wrung-out piece of dishcloth\\"  I doubt very much if a duchess of immense wealth even knew what a dishcloth was!<br />\\"I am the Duchess of Girton ... I have been the duchess for twelve years and I've run the estate for eight, since your father (eg the duke's father) became incapacitated.\\"  Wait a minute!  The duke must have died 12 years ago for Cam and Gina to become duke and duchess - he couldn't succeed to the title just because his father was incapacitated.<br />Later on one of the other characters talks of her clothing size and going up two sizes.  In those days no-one, least of all aristocrats with hand made clothing, had sizes.<br />I marked more instances in my copy of the book but you will see my annoyance.<br />I'm afraid I was very disappointed in this book.  I struggled to finish it and was surprised at its silliness.  The dialogue is incredulous at times and it detracted even more than the errors from the whole.  I'm not sure whether to try again with the author and unfortunately, can't really recommend this book to readers who like well developed characters acting out credible stories speaking witty and believeable dialogue.	2003-03-05

Not the usual sort of Regency fare, it is somewhat darker than many and there is a lot of anger and hurt for the H/H to work through. I think that the scenario the author presents of a man returning home after a long and somewhat inexplicable absence to a wife he doubts who has presented him with a son he disputes was very good and the author utilises the emotions and problems arising very well. The hero, Lord Thomas Kepley seems, on the surface to be unreasonable and hostile in his dealings with his wife, Lisbeth, upon returning from a somewhat implausbile absence and she, in turn, sometimes seems to avoid dealing with his misgivings in a mature way. And yet, despite all of this, I do think both behave in a manner that is most probably in keeping with the manners and mores of the time in which they act out their story.<br />This novel explores the results of real and supposed infidelity and turns upon the keeping of secrets. The kidnapping of the heroine is a little stagey but it allows the author to expedite the resolution of the various questions hanging over the main characters.<br />I think Kihlstrom writes well - although I have nothing to compare this book with - and my curiosity has been piqued. I now want to read the first two stories in the trilogy particularly as in the closing chapters the story of one of the previous heros is resolved in a most unusual way.<br />All in all a book worth reading. There is a lot of anger in this book; there is a reluctance (in modern eyes perhaps) for people to communicate effectively and trust each other yet the reactions of the H/H ring true for me. Lord Thomas is likeable but frustrating yet it is easy to see why Lisbeth loves him and never shows any desire to do other than mend their marriage.	2003-02-24

Truly bittersweet, this is a story of farce, fear, love, hope and redemption.  Metzger has a gift for comedy which is second to none amongst the genre but what other author could write of a young girl dying of grief and a pregnancy gone horribly wrong, a successful (for the times) ceasarian birth, parents who learn from grevious error, a girl rescued from prostitution, death on the battlefield, ardent honour and bravery and still, despite all of this, make it a comedy?<br />At times whilst reading this book I hoped no one was looking over my shoulder because I was almost embarrassed to be so amused despite the utter tragedy that forms the framework for the plot ot this book.  In one day there is a marriage, a death and a baptism yet through the tragedy, people are falling in love, planning for the future and reacting with real, human emotions.  I still cannot figure out how the author managed it.<br />The H/H are both lovely:  he is an over-sized macho military major with a soft heart and divine sense of honour.  She is a feisty yet loyally loving girl with maturity beyond those she must look after, all of whom are older but not wiser.  And, as always with Metzger's work, there is the usual cast of strange and wierd villains, wonderfully quirky servants, relatives from hell, babies, children and animals that form part of the fabric of the story.<br />Loved it.  Absolutely loved it and recommend it most highly.  If you want something different, something poignant yet funny peopled with endearing characters and nasty villains, then do read this.  You won't be disappointed!	2003-02-19

I bought 4 of Nancy Butler's novels a while ago and put them aside on the TBR pile.  The Discarded Duke was the first one I picked up and I was extremely impressed.  Not quite so impressed with The Prodigal Hero although I liked it very much.<br />I think that Nancy Butler, somewhat in the same vein as Carla Kelly, is good with characters who are not \\"top drawer\\" and are either from a humble and/or hurt background.  MacHeath, our hero, is from both.  Alexa, our heroine, is from a family in trade with roots even lower than his.  So, in the world of Regency fiction, they are pretty unusual.  Both are drawn well but the villain of the piece, a semi-aristocratic cousin of Alexa, is a little incredulous (and therefore, to a certain extent the plot) and I found him and his actions not quite believable.  There is a large cast of supporting characters on both the side of good and evil and there is also some violence in the story.<br />My problem is with MacHeath.  For a man of obvious intelligence, he seems to let an overweening sense of honour to get in his way almost until the last page.  Also, I thought too many of his personal behavioural traits were attributed to his Scottish roots which, frankly, did not really add to the development to his character.  Although falsly accused 10 years before the action begins, he let his over-inflated sense of pride get in the way of clearing up the situation - a somewhat immature stance to be sure.  As a result, he is unable to find personal happiness in a meaningful relationship with a woman and allows himself to sink to a seamier side of life (albeit we are told without impugning his honour!). Alexa just rebels against what her father wants for her and develops a pretty thick skin and makes no headway at all in finding a suitable role for herself as she is shown as having carried a torch for MacHeath since she was 11 and is unable to move past it.  Thus, it is only when circumstances bring them together that either of them make anyprogress and for a man of 33 and a woman of 24, they have left it rather late in life.  So, of course, there are lots of obstacles to overcome.<br />Nany Butler uses a metaphor (MacHeath's prosthetic hand) for false pride rather well but unfortunately, I think his view of his amputation is a little sensitive in a time when a successful amputation was a triumph over clumsy surgery and rampant infections.  Nor was it unusual in a time when maiming was not as uncommon as it is today.<br />This is an author of considerable talent.  Although there are a few awkward turns of phrase scattered through the book, overall, her prose is excellent and her dialogue well constructed.  I think that the Discarded Duke was better but here, nevertheless, is a very good story about people maturing and leaving behind sad and hurt pasts.  I recommend this one but did not feel it was a keeper.	2003-02-06

The Discarded Duke offers a carefully crafted plot which is full of twists and surprises.  It also gives us a set of characters (both the H/H and the secondary characters) who are particularly well drawn and who act out the story in a wholly human and believable way.<br />The most significant thing about this book is that it explores very deep emotions and offers insights into some of our darkest thoughts, fears and guilts.  It touches on the issues of insanity and how, in not so distant times, even the medical profession looked upon such diseases as epilepsy as evidence of madness.  It explores the manipulation and devious nature of borderline psycopathic behaviour and it also offers some hints as to why fortune hunting must be viewed with some sympathy.<br />This is a &quot;lost heir&quot; story told with careful consideration and thorough explanation of motive and outcome.  There is a damaged but strong, sweet hero who hides more than a few secrets.  The heroine is strong too and yet, through her own difficult past, is understanding, tolerant and supportive.  The secondary characters either will or have lost much but what they gain in replacement is satisfactory beyond question.<br />I do highly recommend this novel.  It was not your typical Regency offering and is strongly written and well-conceived.  Definitely one to be read again.	2003-01-29

This is a fast-paced novel within a novel focusing on one man's legacy of exposure to envy without equal.  Parker Evans is a man of many layers who has suffered a painful disability, humiliation, incarceration and disgrace but who, as a man of exceptional talents, ultimately finds the strength through love and self-acceptance to triumph over hatred of an old friend turned bitter enemy.  Noah Reed is somewhat two dimensional as the villain of the piece and his wife, Maris Matherly-Reed is a little naive.  However, both of them, along with Parker Evans, are necessary for the intricate and well realised plot to run its course.<br />I don't understand one reviewer's comments about what happened to Howard the attorney because this episode was meant to portray the utter evil inherent in Noah - a true psychopath.  It was a difficult passage but got the point home.<br />I enjoyed this; it was a jolly good read.	2003-01-23

A Matchmaker's Christmas combines four love stories well told against a holiday house party in the bleak north Yorkshire countryside.  And, well done for getting the descriptions of the countryside, the weather and the travelling conditions accurately done!<br />An elderly widow, the comtesse Bournard, conspires to bring five people to her home for Christmas with the admitted goal of matchmaking.  A sixth person, Lord Vaughan, conveniently appears, seeking refuge from a winter storm.  The Rev Mark Rowland, a serious, handsome and sweet man hankers after Lady Silvia, the daughter of a haughty earl although Lady Bournard wants to attach him to Verity Allen, a boisterous but friendly girl from the wilds of Canada.<br />Watching over all of this with increasing concern is the comtesse's companion of more than a decade, Beatrice Copland.  She is meant to be matched to Sir David Chappell, the protege of the comtesse.<br />Of course, Lady Bournard's plans go askew but, in this novel, it is not a comedic pen the author uses.  Rather, there is a lot of introspection and saddness which contributes to misunderstandings and some initial unhappiness for the three couples.  In the end (although not until a full year later) everything comes right.<br />I enjoyed this book and each couple was well drawn.  It was particularly gratifying that Sir David and Beatrice are middle aged yet they, too, enjoy that frisson we all feel when we find true love and meet our soul mates.<br />And the fourth love story?  It is, of course, Lady Bournard, married at 40 to a French emigre and widowed for 20 years.  Still in love with him, still yearning for him and waiting to be with him again.<br />Highly recommended; not frothy but an extremely entertaining and satisfying read which highlights the true meaning of the sprirt of the Christmas season - love, giving, sacrifice and second chances.	2003-01-15

Signet Regency Christmas collections are the best on the market if you like this sort of thing and I do - very much.  However, this year's was not the best but, still, anything by Kelly, Layton and Metzger is a Must Read for me.  They did not let me down.<br />Sandra Heath's contribution, &quot;The Solid Silver Chess Set&quot; irked me, sadly, although it was clever and amusing enough.  I just don't like fantasy and especially not mixed with Regency fare.  Sorry - this one gave me indigestion!  Elves.  Yeech!<br />Amanda McCabe's &quot;Partridge in a Pear Tree&quot; is better.  She has used a tried and perfected &quot;winner takes all format&quot; where through the machinations of a rich elderly relative, a poor woman and a poor man trump everyone and walk away with the prize of the inheritance.  Using a &quot;scavenger hunt&quot; (in England more likely to be called a treasure hunt) a couple win the ultimate prize as well as riches - true love.  Well enough done.<br />Edith Layton's story is a reworking of the Scrooge story with a twist.  A poor woman (and not in her first youth!) wins her love when she is set up by her particular Scrooge.  There is sparkling conversation here and a fun few pages.  Layton always does this sort of thing well.<br />You can rely on Barbara Metzger for comedy and wit.  Here is a sample &quot;His lordship (our hero) was known to be pockets-to-let, seeking to repair his tattered fortune with a dowry darning needle&quot;.  And another:  &quot;She (our heroine) was used to Hanbury House and Ravencroft, not a ramshackle residence for rats and bats and down-at-heels aristocrats&quot;.  Enough said - this story is delicious and peopled with amusing characters.  Gregory and Claire deserve each other and it was fun to watch them!<br />Carla Kelly is simply one of the best in the business and she NEVER lets you down.  Her story of Mary McIntyre, suddenly set adrift from all she has ever known, and Joe Shepard, a not-so-ordinary simple man from ahumble background, is peopled by wonderful secondary characters all of whom add to the story in a tight-knit tale of love, greed, humility and acceptance - all in a few short pages which sum up so well all that is important about Christmas.  This woman never ceases to amaze me with her huge talents.<br />A lovely Christmas holiday read; highly recommended particularly for the Layton, Metzger and Kelly contributions.	2003-01-12

I bought a copy of this novel based on comments I read about it here and elsewhere.  Although not flashy, glamorous or palpitating with sexual innuendo, it nonetheless deserves reading for its unashamedly \\"normal\\" people who do everyday things in a somewhat bleak and uninviting environment.  I know the area of California in which this story is set and the author captures the heat, dust, boredom and low key atmosphere that I remember from driving through it on many occasions.<br />A story of mother love - both reluctant and trimphant, a story of the need to adopt grim measures to deal with bereaved children and an honest assessment of some of those who live their lives at the edges of acceptability, this novel is so firmly based in the realities many of us face on a daily basis that it almost seems like reportage rather than fiction.  Indeed, the least successful element (for me) of this story is the relationship between the hero and heroine although maybe it would be better to think of them as survivors rather then heroic.  Dana and Brady mke difficult decisions about how to manage three orphaned and abondoned sisters and then get on with the prosaic everyday life we all must lead.<br />My Three Girls gets its point across well - we are all selfish in our selflessness but altruism has its rewards.  In this case, love grows out of necessity and children deserve nurture and love.	2003-01-12
US	50886639	R36UBLLX164KHR	0373292317	407617721	Gifts of the Season	Books	2	4	5	N	N	Very disappointing except for Anne Gracie	I read this book ...and struggle now to recall the Jarrett and Stone stories - they simply made no impact and they did not capture my attention.  I had read the Gracie story elsewhere so this volume was very unsatisfactory for me.<br />In Jarrett's story, Sara Blake, brought up in India, has been reduced to being the governess to an eight year old child (Clarissa) who is an incredulous character to say the least!  She behaves neither like an eight year old nor like a child of the early 19th century.  Yeech!  Lord Revell Claremont, younger son of a Duke, had the Great Misunderstanding with Sara many years ago and, over a Christmas house party, everything is sorted out.  Sorry - I could not bring myself to care about the characters or their dilemma; they did not attract me at all and the story line was tired and not especially interesting.<br />Lyn Stone's story of a marraige of convenience, mystery children, mistaken identities, etc (every trite and well used theme you can think of) was played out in a stiff and what appeared to me to be a hastily written format.  The prose never seemed to lift or sparkle as one might reasonably expect in a Regency Christmas story.  Again, Bethany and Jack are not people I could get interested in; too one-dimensional for me.<br />Anne Gracie's story was at least better written.  Again, a case of mistaken identity through the means of amnesia, this is the story of a man set upon and near death rescued by a penurious widow and her small daughter.  Although the story was simplistic and credulous at times, at least Gracie has the manifest talent of writing prose that holds one's attention.  I didn't think this was her best effort but at least one could care about the characters and one can at least be cheered when poor Ellie snags her Lord Rothbury.<br />I think Harlequin failed with this anthology.  I love Christmas Regency short stories but this  volume was flat, sometimes turgid and sadly filled with uninteresting characters trapped in uninspiring stories.  Don't bother.	2003-01-12

Words almost fail me as I have been overwhelmed by it. Others have summed up the plot very well so I won't go over it again. I just want to add to the cheers and applause that have already been registered. I am very interested in military history, most specifically Wellington's Peninsular campaign as I have said in several reviews I have posted about Kelly and other authors so this story was particularly of interest to me; I was truly rewarded by reading it. (Marjorie Farrell writes well about this episode of British history as well.)<br />The Wedding Journey was unlike anything I (and I am sure most Regency fans) have ever encountered. It is the story of ordinary people caught up in momentous and dangerous circumstances who become truly heroic in the truest and most meaningful sense of the word.<br />The way that Kelly portrays the circumstances of a \\"daughter of the regiment\\", the internal frustrations and spiritual journey of a surgeon from a Catholic Scottish family (well done here for educating him abroad, Carla Kelly - I hope others picked up on what this was all about!), the redemption of some of Wellington's \\"scum of the earth\\" - eg Harper and Wilkes, and the meaning of friendship (the French surgeon Phillipe) is a humbling experience for the reader. Against a backdrop of fear, filth and fraught circumstances, a deep and abiding love develops between Captain Jesse Cameron Randall and Elinore Mason. Everything that happens to them on their \\"wedding journey\\" is so well portrayed that you can feel the mud encrusting their clothes, feel the pain of their hunger, the depths of their despair, their fear of exposure and hostility of their Spanish hosts.<br />I can only hope most sincerely that Kelly continues writing for Signet. I understood from an on-line interview that she had agreed to a 2 book contract and this would be the second book, I believe. This novel is her best effort to date - it is deeply satisfying and,whilst sometimes painful to read, her best \\"love\\" story. Read it and then consider some of the other offerings available in this genre. Sometimes there is no comparison. If this book does not win a few awards, there is something wrong with those who judge such contests. I feel honoured to have read it.	2003-01-12

Here is a story of a man's mental anguish, self doubt and difficult path to recovery.  How often we read of dashing heros at Waterloo: how infrequently we see them as real people, full of the inevitable self loathing a sensitive man might bring home as a souvenir.<br />Our heroine is sweet but not cloying, a clergyman's daughter with high ideals but a strong streak of self-knowledge - a woman well up to helping a man in torment to find some inner peace and utterly deserving of the deep and abiding love he develops for her.<br />This is also a novel about mother love.  Sadly, the previous reviewer here misses the point - yes Lady Leathorpe is a good \\"mom\\" (!!!) but she is firmly fixed in her own regency timeframe and she makes decisions wholly credibly in this historical context and social strictures of the times.<br />Donna Simpson is an interesting writer; she deals with issues that are slightly different in her books and often not quite what one would expect.  I adore the regency genre but sometimes, too often in fact, it is hard to find a novel with a slightly different perspective.  This one is different but well pleasing.  A satisfying and worthwhile read on a cold winter's day.	2003-01-01

A self-confessed admirer of Edith Layton, I wish to say only how very much I enjoyed this, the last of the 5 volume \\"C\\" series. I found it more introspective than the previous four stories with much of the book's action taking place in verbal and internal conversation. Indeed, the well done episode of the kidnapping and imprisonment of the hero, the Earl of Drummond, and the heroine, Alexandria Gascoyne, comes as somewhat of a surprise as it takes place in a novel which is largely of much internal anguish. It does, however, act as a catalyst for the hero and heroine manage to come to terms with their situations in life and, despite reluctant acknowledgement of the difficulties of turning on its head the social mores of the times, they find the courage to do so.<br />There is a lot about love in this novel: the earl's love for his father which is indisputably returned; the love Alexandria has for her adoptive brothers; the love a woman who made a bad match had for her husband; the love of friends for each other. There is also a well drawn background here pointing to the social strictures of the times which too often in regency fiction are ignored allowing characters to behave like modern folk in costume.<br />Drum, in finally getting his story told, seems to me to be the most credible, most rounded and most desirable of the \\"C\\" heros. He must, in this well crafted novel, address certain aspects of his own character and upbringing and, in largely credible way allow himself to love and be loved by a woman from an entirely different social class. How this happens is believeable and well told. This man is brilliant, kind, honest, caring and a good friend but it is, in the end, through the experience of helplessness following a serious injury, that he comes to see that love is the apsect of his life that is missing. How satisfying to see him find it with his spiritual if not social equal.<br />Excellent stuff and a wonderful culmination to the \\"C\\" series.	2002-12-21
US	50886639	RBF4KS7TKXSQG	0061014346	542686910	The Chance	Books	5	9	9	N	N	The series continues .....	So much rubbish and dross is on the romantic fiction market that I can't help myself in sticking to certain authors who nearly always please.  Layton, in The Chance, once again provides a well written read with believeable characters with whom the reader becomes closely involved.<br />This is, I suppose, in some ways meant to be a Beauty and the Beast story but it is more than that.  Rafe, amongst the five rogues, is a man whose deeply troubled past moulds him into a stronger man than circumstances would indicate.  The second son of a somewehat emotionally imbalanced marquess and his simply awful wife, Rafe has learnt to be self reliant.  He has no high opinion of himself yet he has sterling character traits which many have overlooked though his male friends value him highly.<br />Brenna, the lady with whom he becomes involved by default, suffers from a damaged reputation through no fault of her own.  These two less than happy people come together through circumstances which are massaged by Anabelle - the lady who lost Damon Ryder.  Is she malevolent, misguided or mischievious?  The jury is still out and I await Layton's denoument next year!<br />What I particularly liked about this book was the slow development of liking, love, passion and completion that Rafe and Brenna undergo.  Each is unsure about their own merits yet each have such wonderful qualities to offer each other.  A slightly bumpy path to happiness makes their journey that much more poignant.  Dear red-headed Rafe, truly a product of his genes, certainly deserves the happiness that the passionate yet dutiful Brenna gives him.  Well done and a good read to be savoured.	2002-12-14

Excellent, thus far, although I believe this one is the best.  Why?  Because, for once, we have mature people - a 32 year old heroine and a man in his mid 40s - well set in the Regency world.  (Afterall most romance readers are adults and I for one get tired of 18 year old heroines!)  Further, we have some transatlantic action which is well done - nothing twee about the English half of the story and nothing unreal in the American half.<br />I won't summarise the plot again because the one thing I would like to focus on for anyone reading this review, is that as always, Layton has given us a truly wonderful hero.  Hathaway (what a name!) Lord Wycoff is a damaged hero but his scars are internal and his &quot;disability&quot; is his past and his reputation.  He has, however, truly lovely qualitites which came to the fore in The Choice.  Wycoff is a husband who suffered a perniciously unfaithful wife but he is a kind, doting and loving father.  He has a mother whom one wants to slap but he is a loving and respectful son to both his father and mother.  Wycoff's behaviour, ultimately, disgusts him when he holds up a mirror to peer closely at himself.  It is, in the end, as always in the best fiction about redemption, the mirror (eg Lucy Stone) that brings him up sharp and gives him the impetus to find his way back to social and, more importantly, self-acceptance.<br />Well done, Edith Layton - as ever you have given us a well constructed, carefully crafted novel with believeable characters whose actions and thoughts are realistic and moving.  A wonderful hero and heroine, some delightful supporting players and a satisfying and thoughtful read.  I do recommend this highly.	2002-11-28

A mixed bag of reviews, I note, for this Barbara Metzger story.  I liked it immensley.  Not only do we have a sweet heroine and a kind-hearted hero but we also have an entertaining adventure and mystery.  The concept of a duke's second son (and a spectacle wearer at that!) setting up as a regency Lord Peter Wimsey was clever and unusual.<br />Minerva, the widowed Lady Sparrowdale is the daughter of a cit and Lord Lowell, the endearing second son who doesn't have enough money to live up to the standards expected of him, gradually fall in love whilst looking for a seemingly unlimited number of by-blows from Minerva's late husband.<br />Although Metzger is a master of the beautifully written regency comedy, she does here hit on a number of serious points.  Minerva's late husband pursued virgins in a quest for a &quot;cure&quot; for rampant VD (based on fact - this was a well known belief at the time); the by-blows grow up in poverty; Lord Lowell denies himself a family because of his straightened financial circumstances and Minerva shoulders responsibility for a financial empire.  Some meaty issues here which provide a background note to the banter and comedy Metzger does so well.  I particularly liked Harkness, the multi-purpose butler - especially with a noted butler in the news right now!<br />I always enjoy Metzger and this was no exception.  I think Lord Peter Wimsey would have recognised his predecessor, Lord Lowell the Regency PI.  I do recommend this!	2002-11-05
US	50886639	RPZXYHM2MGJA5	0708947069	115606246	Jack Of Hearts	Books	5	4	4	N	N	An interesting exploration of some overlooked Regency themes	Although not as brilliant as Red Red Rose, nonetheless, Jack of Hearts merits 5 stars for me.  Other reviewers seemed not to like it because of the fact that the themes this book explores are somewhat superficially divergent.  Rather, I think, the themes run parallel and the author explores some interesting ideas and some not often used historical events.<br />This is the story of a younger son, Jack Belden, first met in Red Red Rose who, like many younger sons in those days had a choice of church or army and he found purpose and meaning in his life by choosing the army.  Rather than a front line officer, he became, because of his Spanish heritage, a fighter behind the lines with the Spanish guerrilleros - unusual for a fictional regency hero.  After the end of the war, Jack is at loose ends, and has recently inherited a title and a load of debts and responsibilities.  He has always found it easy to charm women although there is nothing malicious in how he does it.<br />Anne Heriot is the daughter of a deceased mill owner, fabulously rich but commonsensical and down to earth.  To fulfill her father's most passionate wishes, she seeks to buy a title for herself.  Nothing unusual here - it happened frequently and still does in the British aristocracy!  As she evaluates her options, she learns much about herself and grows into a likeable and loveable woman.<br />However, neither Jack nor Anne are what they seem.  He is, in fact, quite a romantic and she, for all her apparent strength and common sense is painfully in need of love and reassurance.<br />The great merit in Marjorie Farrell's writing is that she allows us to get inside her characters' heads and, most especially, she is excellent at portraying her male characters realistically and believably.  Her stories move at a somewhat stately pace but you realise, as you go along, that this allows her to develop the plot, the characters and their relationships in such a way that they are wholly credible and we feel weknow them intimately.<br />Her characters, as always, are adults dealing with adult issues.  Here we have the issue of the Combination Acts and the Luddites used to show the characters developing embryonic social consciences - hats off for this - it was well done.<br />It was good to see Val Aston, his wife and his father again.  We see that they have become a happy family group and that they are able to offer Jack and Anne love and support in a wholly believable and realistic way.<br />I do admire this author.  This was not a regency romp; it was not intended to be.  Rather, I thought it was a serious novel dealing, again, with grown up issues by adult, well rounded and sympathetic characters.  Well recommended!	2002-10-31

I have The Disdainful Marquis waiting in the TBR pile for later.<br />Edith Layton is simply one of the best and she did not let me down.  I recently moved house and kept a bag of books easily accessible and to hand for reading until my boxes of books have all been unpacked.  I deliberately put in a few Laytons as special treats - and boy, I was not disappointed with this one!<br />Like Balogh, Layton can be almost elegaic in her writing; often her novels are full of an almost philosophical element of introspection.  With her heros, in particular, we become so intimate with their inner thoughts that we seem to know everything that makes them tick.<br />I don't want to resummarise the plot here but would instead like to point to some of the themes that Layton so skilfully develops.  We have an abandoned bride from a common background whose parents displayed wholly inappropriate judgement, allowing their daughter to very nearly ruin her life.  We have a hero who was badly burnt by an unscrupulous woman who still, thanks to a strong father figure in his life, and a loving family of mother and sisters, loves women and their company.  We have a young man who is homosexual and whose dilemmas in life are very accurately portrayed.  We have scrupulous evocation of period, landscape, food, politics and conversation that is fantastic between two people who at first loathe and then, finally, adore each other.  We have misjudgements and restitution.  We have a traitor and we have a host of fantastically interesting peripheral characters, servants, etc.<br />What we have here, in short, is a story that is carefully crafted and brilliantly realised.  Layton truly works magic here.  (I forgive her, again (!), stupid mistakes in correct use of titles - she is one of only a very few authors where I can overlook this because it truly, for once, matters not.)<br />Don't miss this one if you like intelligent, beautifully written, character-driven, introspective novels of people who truly, through love, grow and change - all for the better.	2002-10-24

I have to say that it won't go on my keeper shelf but it was a pleasant read.<br />Briefly, this is the story of a young, tom-boyish girl who is the daughter of an impoverished country vicar. Charlotte Trowbridge is meant to be a madcap but unfortunately, the author has a struggle to keep Charlotte's behaviour realistically planted in regency soil.<br />The hero is Maximillian, the Earl of Wycliffe - a young man so pokered up that you just want to shake him. A little too full of himself, he is somewhat stiff and unapproachable when we meet him but, of course, Charlotte and the Trowbridge progeny are designed to melt him and make him come to life.<br />There is a villain of the piece, a kidnapping on the day of Charlotte and Max's wedding and even some rather nice sex scenes although they anticipate their vows - something I can't imagine a vicar's daughter of the times would have done with such relish! Unfortunately, herein lies my criticism. The actions that drive the plot and the behaviour of the characters is just a little too out of synch for me. This means that sometimes the story is a little too much modernity dressed in empire line dreses and I find this sort of thing irritating.<br />However, it is a sweet enough story and I have a few other books by the author in the queue so I shall be interested to see how her opus develops.	2002-10-24

It was, for me somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.<br />The problem was that it was more of an adventure story than romance, although adventure can add to rather than detract from romance if it is skilfully done and an enhancement to character development.<br />However, my problem with this book was that I never really warmed to the hero who was very juvenile and underdeveloped.  He made astoundingly bad judgements repeatedly and seemed slow to learn.  Handled correctly, these could have been sympathetic flaws but I am afraid I found them simply annoying.<br />The book gets 4 stars from me because the author examined and developed the theme of Judaism in early 19th century Britain and she did her homework.  This is a subject I doubt has been much used in historical romantic fiction set in the Regency and the author did a super job of explaining the difficulties and problems Jews had at that time.  In fact, the most romantic and sympathetic character in the story is the heroine's brother, James Nathanson.<br />The book's story of intrigue and adventure in Wellington's Quatermaster General's department is done well and the author has done her research.  My main problem is that Capt Richard Drayton just does not stand out in the setting in which the author places him.<br />I have Nita Abrams next book in what appears to be a mini-series and hope to find her improving with this book.  She clearly has talent and writes well.	2002-10-23

I had meant, for a long time, to write a little review of this incredible, seemingly perfect Balogh novel but did not get round to it. WMR-UK has really said everything I would have done so I would just like to say to anyone who loves heart-wrenching, stylishly written, character-driven, immaculately plotted fiction - do not miss this one. Once read, it will stay with you for ever after.<br />This is a story of two lonely, hurt people reaching out as best they can in the sad circumstances of their lives towards each other in an effort to find love, solace and completeness. The reader gains immense satisfaction in watching them achieve this.<br />I agree with WMR-UK -- I wouldn't part with my copy either -- it's firmly on the keeper shelf and I've read it more than once.<br />Mary Balogh is simply one of the very best writers around for the Regency period and she rarely disappoints.	2002-10-23

Although the author does not tell us the exact date for the events in the novel, it is fair to say that it is probably more of a &quot;Georgian&quot; than a &quot;Regency&quot;.  Probably the main difference in these two subgenre, when they are done well, is that the Georgian presents a more languid and stately scheme of events and behaviour.  In this novel, the hero Lord Amberley, is elegant and refined with some characteristics that are best described as languid rather than energetic.  After many years he encounters Rosalind Vernon who was the victim of an accident in which he was involved but for which he was not truly responsible.  Much of the frame of this novel sets out his inner thoughts and feelings as he comes to terms with loving a woman for whom he fosters much guilt.  Whilst sponsoring Rosalind to a season in London, thinking he will allow her to blossom, Rosalind sets him free and he comes to depend upon her more than she upon him despite her blindness.  Her clarity of thought, brightness of spirit and love and loyalty allow him to focus his own life so that they may join together in what will be, one feels, a truly happy marriage.<br />The author seems to have had a brief output.  A shame, this, because this book was terribly attractive, well written with interesting and well-rounded adult characters.<br />I do recommend this - look out for a copy!	2002-09-10

I just finished Edith Layton's deep and somewhat dark \\"The Devil's Bargain\\".  Ergo, I needed some light relief!  Bingo - Barbara to the rescue!<br />This author produces some very light, frothy but excellently written and tightly constructed regencies.  They say it is harder to be a comedian than a tragedian and I think Metzger demonstrates this.  Lord Heartless is one of my favourite examples of this.<br />The story strains credibility and is certainly told with tongue firmly in cheek.  Just allow yourself to be swept up into the nonsensical story of Viscount Hartleigh and his prim, proper and titled housekeeper, Mrs Carissa Kane.  There is an abandoned wife, a rake, a foundling, an enchanting child, assorted silly and profane animals and a supporting cast of weird and wonderful servants.<br />Take it at face value and give yourself a laugh - a farcical tour de force which gave me a moment's amusement whilst unpacking too many boxes off the moving van!	2002-08-14

I am very fond of authors who consistently achieve high standards of story-telling, well developed characters, evocative descriptions, historical accuracy and honed, polished prose.  Edith Layton rarely fails on any of these points.<br />Layton usually tells her stories from the masculine point of view, again, something which I relish, and in this novel, Sir Alasdair St Erth is a man whom we learn has some very dark secrets.  The author often has exceptionally deep, troubled heroes and here is another!  He has many redeeming qualities but there is enough about him that is flawed and troublesome to make him a most attractive and sympathetic hero.<br />At first, her heroines often try the sceptical reader but, in this as in others of her novels, the heroine, Kate Corbet, develops into a wholly credible figure who is the ultimate salvation of the hero.<br />As always with this brilliant author, a wonderful read and highly recommended.	2002-08-14

Hibbert is an author for whom I have a great regard and this early work clearly demonstrates not only his sturdy research but also his elegiac and polished prose.  In such a short book, long descriptions and deep discussion of tactics are not possible.  However, he explains to the reader who may not be familiar with this episode of British military history exactly how the retreat came about whilst sketching the personalities, foibles and strengths of the major characters of the campaign.<br />The generals such as Moore, Napier, Paget, Craufurd and so on are not the only people we learn about because Hibbert draws on memoirs and other materials written by the junior officers and the enlisted men such as the famous Rifleman Harris of the 95th.  There are little vignettes such as the dumping of silver money to lighten the load, high up in the frozen Cantabrian Mountains, women giving birth at the side the road in the mud and rain and the hooves of the horses and mules bleeding as they struggled to haul artillery pieces.<br />A truly beautiful and unforgettable early book by this brilliant historian. A moving, sad and poignant story which still causes debate today.  Very highly recommended	2002-07-18

However, this one, as far as I can determine, was never published in the UK.  We met the hero, Mitch Scanlon, in Once Upon a Wedding briefly.  I must confess I always wondered if he would have his own story.  Years later, looking at some of the romance review websites I discovered that he did, indeed, have his own story.  It was then a case of tracking the book down.<br />This book has attracted controversy in the past because it deals with date rape - a subject which is often in the news these days because of the concern over the legal fraternity in getting it treated fairly in our politically correct world.  So, here is a subject to be handled carefully and, to be fair, PDR does so in the main.  However, I did not really warm to her heroine.  Frankly, Carly Anderson is not someone I would like for a friend.  There is just a touch of hollering \\"no\\" at the point of no return and that is, of course, the problem with the whole topic of date rape.  Also, for a very intelligent woman, she allows this one episode to cause her to make some questionable choices in her life; she is not a happy woman when we meet her and you really have to wonder why she has not been able to be more pragmatic about herself.<br />Her hero, Mitch, is made to suffer disproportionately, in my own view, for something which he did at a very young age.  PDR makes this man a paraplegic at the height of a fantastically successful career as a professional athlete.  He does, in the main, rebuild his life but he still suffers - there is no truly meaningful relationship in his life and his physical disabilities are horrendous although he does cope very well with them.  He is a very charming man and desirable one.<br />There is a \\"hidden baby\\" in this book.  And, sadly, this is where PDR lets herself down.  Although Mitch meets and loves his daughter when finally he is allowed to know her, Carly and he (really Carly in my opinion) decide to keep her paternity a secret.  This is where the plot becomes clouded and departs from what some may view as the reality of the modern world.  Denying a child knowledge of its paternity is, I think, probably a worse \\"crime\\" than date rape especially when the father is loving, caring and willing to take full responsibility.<br />The issue of IVF for paraplegics is explored here as well which is interesting because it allows Carly and Mitch to start again.  However, this child will know its parents but not its sister.  This issue has provoked discussion elsewhere and is never resolved by the author.<br />I liked Mitch.  He was gritty yet realistic in handling his disability.  He suffers and is tortured about his actions and their outcomes but handles them better and more maturely, I think, than Carly.  Carly is, I think, the character that is a little bit two dimensional.<br />A book which continues to cause discussion.  If you like PDR then it is not to be missed.  I have always wondered why it never got released, as far as I can tell, in the UK.  It is PDR at her angst-ridden, tortured hero best.  I loved Mitch but would not like to have lunch with Carly.  Highly recommended for the issues raised here:  date rape, retribution, suffering, disability and paternity.	2002-07-09

This one was a satisfying but not particularly memorable read and suffered from a few little things which prevented it fulfilling the author's intentions.<br />It is a story of a slightly soiled heroine reduced to governessing as a result of a scandal during her London season when she surrendered to the wiles of an experienced and somewhat distasteful man-about-the-ton.  Cassandra Aldrich has, however, finally fetched up with a family with five daughters of varying degrees of niceness and nastiness.  One day she learns that the new Earl of Lynton who was a childhood object of worship has taken up residence at his family seat.  Not in the direct line of the succession, Nicholas St John was a boy sailor who went to sea very young as many did in the times of the Napoleonic wars and so never acquired the ton polish of his contemporaries or a direct heir.<br />They meet again and, although you know they will eventually come together, sometimes Nicholas, for all his sensitivity, is a real disappointment for his mannerisms, way of speech and actions are a little contrived.  He never really rings true as a desirable man to me.  I think the author failed a little with him and the Cassie Aldrich is a better rounded character.  She is a more mature individual and we get to know her much better than Nicholas.<br />This book also contains The Big Misunderstanding - a somewhat trite device here because it is used to raise the whole issue of double standards and, sadly, not quite successfully.  Within the frame of Regency morals and ethics, the issue seemed slightly out of synch and context in the way it was handled.  Too bad; a missed opportunity perhaps.  Jo Beverley does it better!<br />I have a few more of her early books to read.  Certainly Marrying Miss Bumblebroth was delightful and it has been interesting to read the alpha and the omega of her output.  Definitely worth reading but not a keeper.	2002-07-04

Tregatt has summed up the plot and made some excellent comments about the story and characterisations.  I would like only to add the following.<br />This book addresses a very subtle issue - bullying.  I work with an internationally know charity which supports the despairing and suicidal and, sadly, increasingly we deal with victims of bullying - something not just confined to children and something which has life-long consequences.<br />The heroine, Chloe Russell was bullied by her cousin Edwin throughout her childhood and even into young adulthood.  The consequences of this shape her character and world view.  It is early on apparent that only a very special man will be able to recognise what is wrong and help her deal with it - thereby allowing recovery.<br />Michael, Vicount Lyndon, seemingly, on the suface would hardly be the man to help Chloe.  A Corinthian, an athlete and man who lives very much in a man's world is about the last person one would expect to demonstrate the empathy and understanding to allow Chloe to evolve into the wholly functioning woman she can be.  However, Michael is indeed the man and we learn why ultimately for he is a man with his own sadness and trauma.  Together, they are able to help each other to heal thereby strengthing an already strong marriage.<br />Their relationship is lovely; they grow together into a couple destined for much happiness.<br />A lovely story, wonderful characters, a good deal of care taken by the author in dealing with a sad problem and well done within the historical framework of the novel.  Bullying is not to be taken lightly and the author is to be congratulated for working it into a romanic novel without slipping into bathos.  Excellent and worth a re-read in future.	2002-06-23
US	50886639	R22LN75HSR1557	0821737023	59345802	A Maddening Minx	Books	4	3	3	N	N	An early romance by a talented author	I picked up a copy of this at a UBS last winter and just finished reading it.  I liked it, without doubt, though the latter parts of the book irritated me.<br />Basically, it is the story of Philip Thornton, Marquess of Pembroke, widowed in circumstances which appear slightly sinister.  He is, we learn, the victim of some worrying but undoubtedly contrived \\"accidents\\".  Enter Sarah Chadwick, a governess dismissed from her job after rebuffing the usual lecherous master (you know the thing!).<br />Sarah is a bit too much \\"in your face\\" sometimes to make her a wholly realistic character within the Regency timeframe of the novel.  Philip, whom she meets in the course of one of the \\"accidents\\" is a highly intelligent man who has withdrawn from society because of suspicions surrounding the death of his late wife.  He was injured in the fire which killed her and lost an eye which makes him believe that no reasonable woman could love him (heard this one before?).  However, irritatingly, he believes that despite what appears to be a serendipitous marriage, Sarah is cheating on him with his cousin Richard.<br />Richard, of course, is after the title and money, Sarah is not cheating and Philip suffers from wounded price as well as his partial blindness.  Indeed, the eyepatch he must wear is a metaphor for his irritatingly silly acceptance of Richard's attempts to undermine his marriage, this leading him \\"blindly\\" to believe Sarah to be false and even pregnant by Richard.  This is, sadly, a somewhat trite device so often used in romantic fiction.<br />All this having been said, I did enjoy the story, the premise was a little different than usual and so were the H/H.  The author writes well, her command of language and evidence of careful research is pretty well done and she makes few of the often silly mistakes which pervade some Regency romances.  Well done - worth reading but probably not a keeper.	2002-06-23

It was to be expected that, after keeping her reading public waiting so long, Jean Auel would attract some pretty harsh criticism for this book.  I think this is because, sadly, readers want to \\"punish\\" her for making them wait.  I would agree that this part of the saga is not as sharply written as the first four books but, perhaps this is because, the first book especially was such a phenomenon that all succeeding stories would suffer by comparison.<br />Although some of the descriptive passages are rather tedious, if one was coming new to Auel and the Earth's Children series, the background is necessary to understanding the setting and parameters within which the author places her narrative and characters.  However, the author does tackle some pretty universal issues here even if the development of them is less than completely satisfying.  There is a core of a love story; a romance, if you will.  However, I can't really see how else Auel could move the story along unless she centred it on domestic (eg emotional) interaction.  This is, afterall fiction and entertainment!<br />I felt the criticism some of have made of her justifying years of research a little unfair for she does use a great deal of intuitive and imaginative flair to create and people a world that, frankly, none of us can really comprehend.  I usually run a mile from anything that smacks of fantasy or sci-fi.  I had, in the beginning, to be dragged kicking and screaming to the Earth's Children series many years ago but have come to appreciate the great original effort and unquestioned reflective scholarship that has brought such entertainment to so many around the world.<br />I hope to see the concluding book soon and I hope to see it more sharply written.  I will, undoubtedly, read it!	2002-06-03

There is not a lot available about, specifically, the retreat to Corunna in 1809.  Christopher Hibbert's short book, &quot;Corunna&quot; is one of the few but you have to look hard to find a copy these days.  In anticipation of a trip this summer to Spain organised to follow Sir John Moore's retreat and stand at Corunna, I found a copy of this and just finished it.<br />Excellent in that it gives a good broad brush picture of Sir John's life and military career but, as pure biography, I found it left too many questions unanswered.  As a minor point, there is a brilliant cover on this book (my copy picked up second hand fortunately still had its dust-jacket) of Moore by Lawrence.  I have seen the painting myself at the National Army Museum in Chelsea.  However, we never learn in the book how Moore came to sit for the painting.  Also, we never learn much about his relationship with Lady Hester Stanhope, surely one of the most fascinating female characters of the period.  Then, too, we never learn whether Moore's promotions during his career, right up to General, were by merit or purchase.  This is a fundamenal point to have omitted, in my view, as knowing the answer tells a lot about the man - both his personal fortune and his personal achievements.  Moore came from a lower middle class family; there was no apparent money although in his very early years he had a noble patron in the Duke of Hamilton.<br />Too many questions for me, an avid reader of biography and a lover of this particular period of history for me to give this 5 stars.  However, it was a cracking read, well illustrated and carefully based on the original sources, eg Moore's own journal, Napier and Oman (the foremost 19th c writers on the Peninsular War).  A good addition to the little library my husband and I have on this period.	2002-05-24

I do love haunting the secondhand bookstores for they often yield up some real treats.  I found this one recently and just finished reading it.  This was a very satisfying pleasure to read.<br />It is the story of Owen Kingsley, the Duke of Graves, ineligible to serve in the army because of a crippling birth defect, who chooses espionage as his method of serving his country at the Congress of Vienna in 1814/15.  A somewhat dark character, he is committed to his cause and disciplined in his approach.  He is, of course since this is a romantic novel, a man of many layers who needs a loving and sympathetic woman to bring him out of himself.  Although the vehicle of the disabled man believing himself to be of no merit and unworthy of love is often used, it is very well done here.<br />Erica Stone, newly widowed and stranded in Vienna, is taken  under Graves's wing and agrees to spy for him.  The story that unfolds is set against the political machinations of the Congress which attempted to restore equilibrium in Europe following Napoleon's abdication and exile to Elba.<br />The Congress of Vienna is an interesting backdrop to the story and the author brings in many characters from real life such as Lord Castlereagh, Tallyrand, Wellington and various other luminaries of the times.  The research is evident in the author's handling of this often overlooked interlude between Napoleon's exile to Elba and his return to France in the months leading up to Waterloo.  So, for those of you who are interested in the military, political and social history of this fascinating time, here is a wonderful read.<br />The way the relationship between Erica and Graves develops is beautifully developed.  Two people, so obviously made for each other, have many obtacles to overcome before they can reach happiness and contentment in a happy and loving relationship.<br />I enjoyed the secondary characters in this story and the strong yet loving, loyal and sympathtic Erica.  Owen Kinglsey is a wonderful hero and eventually finds, in his mid 30s, the sweet happiness he thought he would always be denied him but which he richly deserves.<br />Well worth seeking out a copy of this; an excellent read and highly recommended.	2002-05-12

So, as I have just re-read it, I thought I would take the opportunity to spread the word that this book is one of the Regency genre's hidden treasures.  If you like Kelly, Balogh, Putney, Layton and Beverley, please do make the effort to get a copy of this wonderful novel.  Marjorie Farrell, like Kelly, et al above, is absolutely scrupulous in her research and she tends to present her stories from a masculine perspective.  So, if you like getting inside the mind and heart of the hero, she has given us one in this novel who is memorable and, as the saying goes, is one to die for.<br />Simon Ballance, the Duke of Sutton, went into the army and fought as a staff officer under Wellington in the Peninsula.  As in Red, Red Rose, Farrell writes with brilliant command about army life and the effect of combat on the mind, heart and soul of a man.  After sustaining a head wound, Simon is invalided home permanently blind.  The descriptions of him in hospital, the relationship with a fellow patient and the terrible traumatic effects of his blinding are absolutely brilliant.  In a poignant scene, he is so helpless and desparate that he suffers lying in his own urine while those around him cry out in pain.  This scene was as moving as Anne Gracie's ballroom scene in Gallant Waif or the hospital scenes in Carla Kelly's With This Ring.<br />On his return to England, Simon at first is unaccepting of his fate and sinks into a predictable depression.  As an orphan, his household staff fill in as family and are very supportive of their master, giving help where they can and waiting for signs of improvement.  The improvement comes in the form of Miss Judith Ware, a slight acquaintance from the past and a woman of good family fallen on hard times.  Simon's secretary Francis and his closest friend conspire to have Judith hired as a reader for Simon.<br />Then, the developing relationship between these two highly intelligent and thoughtful people develops through a mutual passion for books, philosophy and interest in people and events.  They truly are the other halves of each other but, of course, there are many trials to be overcome before they can be happily together.  Through the false start of a suggested marriage of convenience (and Miss Ware's \\"refusal\\" of it), they go down a wrong track but, as in any romance, they find their was back to each other in the end.<br />What was truly remarkable about this book was the author's unflinching insistence on portraying the disability of blindness in the true context of the historical setting.  Every mis-step Simon takes, the reader feels it along with him.  We know his frustrations, anxiety, disbelief, anger and pride.  We understand how this desirable and wonderful man shuts himself off believing himself an object of pity, undesirable, unloveable and isolated.  How Judith brings him out of himself is memorably portrayed.<br />I simply cannot rate this book high enough.  It is one of my personal keepers and I believe a book overlooked very deserving of reading by those of you who prefer your Regencies to have substance, character and polished writing.  Please do seek it out and enjoy an author who truly stands high in the genre and deserves far more acclaim than she has received.	2002-04-27
US	50886639	R15QO1MO51IC3Q	0821744887	756239827	Forbidden	Books	5	7	7	N	N	The story continues ......	I must confess that I opened this book with a little trepidation for I wondered if Jo Beverley could keep the Rogue series going at the same pace and level as the first three books.  I was not disappointed for this one was rather remarkable.  She is to be congratulated for making each member of the Company of Rogues so very individual despite the collective adventures and settings in which she places them.<br />Serena Riverton is a most unusual heroine as others have described.  The premise of using a slightly \\"soiled\\" yet very innocent woman as the partner for a man very sophisticated yet virginal was intriguing to say the least.  Very few authors, in my view, could have carried it off so well.  I do recall Mary Balogh's \\"Secret Pearl\\" as another example of the author taking a heroine somewhat outside the tight strictures of Regency society and letting her triumph through the love of an exceptional man.<br />I agree that the secondary romance was not well done; it sometimes smacked of French bedroom farce particularly when held up to Serena and Francis Middlethorpe's misunderstandings, angst and inability to communicate.  However, the main story is so well done that it matters very little.<br />Great to meet the wonderful Lucien and Beth - my favourite Rogue couple - and Nicholas and his Eleanor once again.  The author is to be congratulated for sustaining these characters from previous books so well and for showing them growing and developing in their happy marriages.<br />Incidentally, the scene where Francis visits Blanche Hardcastle was a little gem and revealed some tantalising details about Lucien's past.<br />Well, on to Dangerous Joy.The Dragon's Bride and The Devil's Heiress; I should be finished with them by the time Hazard lands on my doorstep...  Wonderful series, exceptional characters and great satisfaction in the Rogue stories.  Highly recommened!	2002-04-22

Jo Beverley's Rogue series is a delight - stories that hold your attention and satisfy deeply.  I have now finished the third book in the series and have enjoyed this one as much as the first two.<br />Christmas Angel is a very different Christmas story for the season of goodwill is really only a frame to the whole picture and the action leads up to Christmas in only a very subliminal way.<br />This is a gentler story than the first two Rogue books for Leander Knollis, Earl of Charrington, is presented to us as a much milder man in some ways but one whose passions run so deep beneath the surface that he is in danger of missing great happiness.  Nicholas Delaney and Lucien de Vaux, the heros of the first two Rogue books, are seemingly much more passionate and volatile men.  Leander is a man who believes self control is of high esteem and, much to his amazement, a woman who is largely fooling herself about her first marriage knocks all of his preconceived notions about love, marriage and partnership askew.<br />Others have summed up the plot so I won't go into it.  I would like to point out that, in this book, conversational interaction is very important and deserves thoughtful reading.  The child characters of Bastian and Rosie are well drawn.  I laughed out loud at Rosie's conversation with Hal Beaumont (a Rogue I sincerely hope will one day get his own book!!) when she wonders about the loss of his arm, wild animals and death.  In a few brief paragraphs, Jo Beverley captures childish innocence and curiosity so well.<br />Judith Rossiter, our heroine, for all her experience of 13 years of marriage and two children, is virginal and naive in a charming way.  How delightful to watch her and Leander dance round each other, striving for something neither can identify!<br />Nicholas Delaney and his wife Eleanor continue to be a linchpin in all of the Rogue stories and it is very satisfying to follow their progress and that of Lucien and his marchioness.  I loved this - and look forward to starting the fourth book.  Excellent and subtle, this one!	2002-04-13

In An Unwilling Bride she has created a domestic situation which, whilst not unheard of in the Regency era (cf Lord Egremont for one!) is nonetheless an exciting framework for this novel.  The lead characters are strong, arrogant, stubborn and well rounded although each is deeply flawed.  In a story of infidelity, diametrically opposing life-views and a whiff of violence the author excites and even tillilates the reader.<br />Lucien de Vaux, the Marquess of Arden and Beth Armitage are so fundamenally different yet so closely linked through an accident of birth that you just know they are going to have mountains to climb before reaching a somewhat volatile truce.  Beth Armitage is a fabulous heroine for, although one might think her a 20th century girl in Regency dress, she does accurately represent the philosophy of Mary Wollstonecroft and her followers.  Arden is an archetypal Regency buck yet has throughout his life sustained a love of the most erudite of learning and he has a very powerful intellect which, when he meets Beth is challenged as never before.  Arden's parents, the Duke and Duchess of Belcraven are unlike any parents in a Regency novel that I can recall!  They, too, are flawed people but they rise above it magnificently.<br />I truly enjoyed this book, I was drawn into the high emotion and drama.  The verbal fencing was a delight!  Despite some somewhat shocking scenes of domestic violence, like Liz Carlyle did with bondage in one of her novels, it fits the parameters of the book.  Don't be put off - it truly adds another dimension to the characters and although perhaps today such behaviour would be unforgiveable, within the context of the time, the laws then governing marriage and the absolute rights of a husband, it rings true and does add to the story.<br />Jo Beverley really amazes me.  She is one of the very best writing in this genre today.	2002-04-12

I first read about her here at amazon and a few of the other romantic review sites.  I was intrigued and, having read a couple of her short novellas, plunged in.  I am the type who has to have the WHOLE series first and so with some effort, managed to get all of the Rogue (and three Georges) books before settling down to read them all in order.<br />Wow!  What a delight this author is.  The best word I can think of to describe her work is \\"integrity\\".  She is true to her craft, careful, literate and polished.  She creates great angst, tension and the development of her characters is well complemented by her well thought through plots.<br />This first of the Rogue books was wonderful.  I enjoyed ever minute of it and have already read the next one and started the third Rogue story.<br />Nicholas Delaney and his wife Eleanor will, I have no doubt, serve well as the fulcrum of the Rogue series.  They are delightful and deeply interesting people.  You feel you know them personally.<br />I am also impressed by the fact that Jo Beverley makes herself available to her readers, her website is excellent and her notes at the end of her books delightful.<br />I am so glad I have found her!	2002-04-04

I bought this one not really knowing much about it except that it was a regency historical.  The story is, basically, a two way &quot;beauty and the beast&quot; story with a very damaged hero who, through the encouragement and example of the feisty heroine, recovers himself and the pair live happily ever after once they overcome some very difficult physical and social impediments.<br />My main concerns were that there were some errors in titles, a child character who seemed to go from birth to riding her pony in a period of less than two years and some silly mistakes like the heroine staying the same age for several years.<br />The villain of the piece was well done and the villainess gets involved in something rather daring for a regency historical.  Quite unique in my experience!<br />The quality of the prose needed sharpening up.  I had the feeling that this book had not been as carefully edited as it deserved.  Overall, I enjoyed the story, the character development of the H/H and the unusual premises that the author used to develop her story.<br />There are some good writers being published in e-books and they are worth seeking out.	2002-03-24
US	50886639	R37K8UZVAXLQ78	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Excellent - a thoughtful and provocative biography	I'm an American who has lived in England for nearly 25 years.  As a devoted and frequent reader of biography and straight history, my readings over that time have focused on British history.  So, in some ways, reading this book was a bit of a homecoming for me.<br />It was satisfying to revisit the exciting, turbulent and seminal times of the American Revolution (or Revolt of the Colonies!) after so long for, in some ways, perhaps I must admit to having lost sight of my own roots.<br />Careful reading of this book confirmed to me that many issues in the fields of politics, economics and social devlopment have changed very little since the times of John Adams.  Some particular current issues in the UK and Europe (eg the single currency, some of the increasing federalism of the EU, etc) were the very meat of the debates in Boston, New York and Philadelphia.  The author brings those debates to life in such a way that you can almost see and hear the participants arguing and struggling to carry off perhaps the most important event in modern world history.<br />John Adams himself and his astounding contribution to the birth of the United States has always been somewhat overlooked in US history with characters like Jefferson and Washington dominating our view of events.  However, Adams's fundamental philosopy of &quot;be good and do good&quot; is wholly admirable and something more of us ought to emulate.  The poignant and enduring romance between John and his loyal Abigail was also well portrayed in this book and, again, their marriage is something we would all (and most particularly politicians) do well to study.<br />This was a wonderfully evocative book, well researched and well written.  Despite its length, the pages seemed to turn themselves.  Highly recommended.	2002-03-24

I see now, from looking at Amazon that this is the third in Miller's series about the Taylor family and they are, in this book at least, portrayed as a little bit too good to be true.<br />Mac Taylor (\\"the professor\\" according to the Taylor clan details) is a forensic cop who gets blinded in a lab explosion which kills one of his staff. He is released from the hospital, only 6 weeks after the accident, which I thought a bit strange as he goes to live on his own and not into some serious rehab to learn some basic daily living skills.  Anyway, his interfering but loving mother gets old neighbour hiding a hurt, Julia Dalton, RN, to come and look after him aided and abetted by Julia's own mother.<br />Without going into too many plot details, Mac and Julia become caught up in a rather complicated conspiracy which has been fomented by an Internal Affairs cop gone bad.  The \\"mystery\\" of the novel is OK - probably about averagely portrayed.  The main focus of the story is on the relationship between Mac and Julia.<br />I felt there were some really pretty silly details here about sudden loss of sight and the impact it has on a man's life.  Mac becomes able, almost immediately Julia arrives on the scene, to cope with his blindness and solve a complicated crime whilst on the run and in hiding.  Sorry, I believe this stretched reality a bit too much.  Julia, for an intelligent woman, aged 30, still sees herself as an ugly 15 year old because she has a poor body image.<br /> Mac loves Julie and Julie has always loved Mac.  So, ergo, they are destined for a deep and abiding love.  Whilst that is OK and quite satisfying for the reader as well as our H/H, the peripheral details of Mac's blindness, the idea that he could solve a complicated crime with the unhesitating and unquestioning support of his family (mainly cops themselves) who, although unquestionably loyal, should have known better is a bit too much for me.<br />I have problems with Intrigues because they are \\"neither fish nor fowl\\".  I think I will stick to Faye Kellerman or Elizabeth George when I want a detective story, and revert to my usual sorts of traditional contemporaries, historicals and regencies for romance.<br />A good enough book but nothing here that would make me want to read it again.	2002-03-09

I read her novella in The Officer's Bride but was not particulary impressed.  Looking at other comments about her work, it would appear that she started off not pleasing the reviewers but, fortunately,is growing with each additional work.  Well, this one was terrific!  It is a very evocative portrayal of a man and woman who, through circumstances beyond their control, knowingly and willingly enter into an illicit relationship which is fraught with the possibility of scandal.  This creates a true frisson to their mutual passion which is shown in scene after scene to be deep, true and moving.<br />Emily Spencer eloped with her first husband and had a son.  Both of them were disowned by their families but she was happy with him, following the drum during the Peninsular campaign.  After his death, Emily returns to England and, to avoid her husband's family, she does not use his name and sets herself up as a designer and maker of hats.  This makes her beyond the pale and a social outcast.<br />Until she is threatened with extortion by her landlord her life is as she wishes, her son safe and being privately educated by a priest.  However, when her world is shaken by threats, she is rescued by the son of a customer, Evan Mansfield, the Earl of Cheverley.  In order to \\"repay\\" him, she offers the only currency available to her - her body.  He accepts, for he is terribly attracted to her, and they embark on a secret affair which becomes a \\"marriage blanc\\".<br />Unfortunately, a deathbed promise to his best friend means that Cheverley must marry his friend's sister, Andrea, and so the affair must end although, with reluctance but with helpless attraction, they continue to meet.  Eventually, Cheverley goes abroad on government espionage business and eventually returns, injured and ill.  Emily returns to nurse him and is discovered by her family, being taken into the family home, protected by the new head of the family, her husband's middle brother and one of her close friends from her army days.<br />Eventually Emily and Evan are reconciled although their path is not smooth.  Both are full of self-doubts and both have been hurt by their pasts.  However, their deep and abiding love help them to overcome the odds and their passion is finally satisfied.<br />This book is very well done; the plot is carefully executed, the descriptions of the ton, clothes, etc, are well done.  The secondary characters are also good.  I particularly liked Emily's brother and sister in law and Andrea.  If you like adult characters with grown up emotions, behaving in a manner in context with the times in which the author places them, then you will enjoy this book.  I look forward to trying some of the author's other work.	2002-03-05

Others have summed up the story well so I won't do that here.  I would like to say that I fell in love with her hero, Thomas X Devlin, and enjoyed the peripheral characters of Anne Davis's family, eg her niece Maggie and her sister Gabrielle and brother in law Steve and even the society on the unnamed island on which they all lived.<br />However, there were, in my view, some weaknesses here.  In particular, her ex-husband was very one dimensional and Maggie's circle of friends were rather over-drawn.<br />The grisly accident scene at the end of the book was very well done but the way in which Matt, the two-timing ex-husband, appears to undergo some divine revelation leading to his reformation into a saddened and chastened husband was too much to bear.  His grief was examined but not developed.  Thank goodness Anne had already seen through him!<br />This novelist was at her very best in describing grief and loss and also in showing the path to recovery.	2002-02-08
US	50886639	RQIQOMUQHSUHZ	0440236711	788144187	The Bridal Season	Books	2	3	6	N	N	All froth and no substance	My first foray with Connie Brockway was \\"All Through The Night\\".  Too bad - it created rather high expectations from this author!.  Unfortunately, \\"The Bridal Season\\" was silly, shallow, weakly plotted and poplulated by one dimensional characters.  I think that the author can really crank up the angst when she goes for the more serious side of romance and she is not cut out to be a writer of what is essentially light comedy.  I agree wholeheartedly with reviewers Darlene and Jane Harrison; the author is clearly capable of much, much more.  I struggled to read this and found my mind wandering almost from the first page.  The narrative was full of out of context flavour which did not make it easier to digest.  I won't give up on the author, however, as she is very talented.  However, I don't believe this sort of nonsense is her true forte.	2002-02-08
US	50886639	R3V8XMRFU71KR0	0451186842	90674218	The Lady's Companion	Books	5	28	28	N	N	Down a Different Path	Carla Kelly never fails to present us with very real characters who are, sometimes, caught up in painful circumstances which they must work through.<br />In The Lady's Companion, she has presented us with Susan Hampton, the daughter of a profligate and selfish baronet who has sqandered his fortune and, therefore, her future amongst her own class.  Susan takes courage into both hands and looks for a paid post outside her own circle.  She meets the delightful Joel Steinman, proprietor of an employment agency, and is sent to the Dowager Lady Bushnell as a lady's companion.  In fact, she has been sent, unbeknownst to her, as a gift from Joel to David Wiggins, former Regimental Sergeant Major, now the bailiff to Lady Bushnell at her manor, Quilling, in the heart of the Cotswolds.  This is one thread of the story and it is beguiling in its unfolding.<br />The battle of Waterloo plays a big role in this story for it colours the actions and the characters of David, Joel, Lady Bushnell and her family.  A beautiful metaphorical device, a strain of wheat bred from a handful of grain picked up at La Haye Sainte farmhouse during the battle, becomes a symbol of hope, of forgiveness, of coming to terms with the death, destruction, cowardice, heroism and trial by fire that those who survived must deal with in its aftermath.<br />All in all, this is a radically different book - nothing like most traditional regencies.  It's not just a cross-class romance, it is about endurance, faithfulness, courage and honour.  The love the various characters develop for each other is moving and poignant.  The ending of the novel is emotional and sad but also full of hope for the future.  Despite their superficial differences, Susan and David are well matched.	2002-02-06

One Good Turn has been a long awaited book for those of us who greatly admire Carla Kelly so, first of all, a simple and heartfelt thank you to the author for this book - one I thought she might never write.<br />It's been interesting to read the comments about it.  I won't go into the plot because it has been well summed up elsewhere.  I would, however, like to make a few brief comments about other matters.<br />First of all, yes, as a &quot;reader from Europe&quot; says, there are a few inaccuracies and &quot;Americanisms&quot; in this book.  This is something I myself am often critical of as an American living in England for it really annoys me when authors make what appear to me as very obvious blunders.  However, I have to say I didn't see the errors here as particularly significant as when Edith Layton has made similar.  Kelly, like Layton, creates characters who are so strong and believable that you just don't care because they shine through any mistakes.<br />This is a book about growing up, in essence.  We met Benedict Nesbitt, Duke of Knare, in Libby's London Merchant.  Again, this was a book which has a flaw in research but which Kelly magnificently owned up to in the recent reissue.  In LLM, Nez did not get his lady; she instead gave herself to a man who had fully matured, was comfortable in his own skin and knew where he was going.  In LLM, and at the beginning of OGT, Nez was still looking for a life path.<br />The reader who said that the historical setting seemed unreal perhaps is not familiar with the history of the Peninsular War.  Those who are will know that Badajoz was a turning point in the struggle against Napoleon.  By 1812, the British troops were hardened from a long and hard campaign, the seige of the city was grim and losses on the allied side incredibly high.  I have been to Badajoz and Cuidad Rodrigo (site of another difficult seige) and have seen the places the British Army fought. Descriptions I have read of the fight before the glacis are horrible; layers of still warm bodies as others climbed over them to get ladders to the walls and bastions.  It was, as Wellington himself admitted, unforgiveable what the troops on entering the city did but it does not compare with some of the things the French did.  And, Kelly describes it and the feelings it left in some of those involved so well.  I have read memoires from survivors and she has truly let us have an informed look at the whole event.  So, hats off for this; she has done a wonderful job.<br />Nez grows up in this book.  He looks at his relationships with his fellow Army officers and his troops, with his father, mother and sister, his former love, Libby and her wonderful husband Dr Tony Cook.  What he does is learn to accept the past knowing that he cannot change it and then to look forward by giving love and support to another victim of the past, Liria and her little son Juan.  The relationship between Nez and his wonderful butler, Luster, is very well drawn; rather like the wonderful servants in Gayle Wilson's historical books.  Who can help but fall in love with Nez, a man who finally learns his self worth and is capable of offering so much.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful, superior read.  When I compare it with some of the other regency fiction around, it truly transcends some of it.  Carla Kelly creates high tension, adult relationships, strong characterisations and draws settings which for the most part are believable and accurate.  I love the way she often tells her stories from the male perspective, letting us share their thoughts and emotions.  Please, please, Carla Kelly, keep writing.  Please, please, please.	2002-02-01

I adore biography - especially those of the great characters of the second half of the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries.  I knew of Jane Digby el Mezrab from Irving Wallace's Nymphos and Other Maniacs which I read many years ago and also via several biographies of Sir Richard Burton.  This is a well written, carefully and extensively researched book which benefited enormously from the author's good luck in uncovering much new, previously unseen and unpublished family material in Dorset and New Zealand.  This, the author says in her acknowledgements, is more satisfying than the publication of the book itself.  I agree, for this sort of discovery is palpably thrilling and the author's excitement shines through her narrative.<br />This biography reads like fiction and Jane Digby, firstly Lady Ellenborough, was one of those larger than life people who followed their own path, irrespective of the mores of their own time.  Following Jane's life is a tour through the drawing rooms of Regency England, several European and Balkan courts to the deserts of Syria and Arabia.  It is the story of a woman (thrice divorced) who eventually found happiness and fulfilment with a man of great nobility from an entirely different race, culture and religion.  Jane's interest in the minutiae of life in Damascus in the mid 19th century makes fascinating reading and her wit and fondness for her adopted &quot;tribe&quot; in the desert is moving.<br />Highly recommended!	2002-01-25

I have spent a lot of time, effort and money collecting all of Carla Kelly's books over the last year or so.  I deliberately forced myself to spread out my reading of them over this period rather than gobbling up whole the entire opus, thus spinning out the utter delight I get from reading them.  I have, to my great relief, still three to read!  I bought this one even though I had already paid a lot of money for individual copies at auction because I wanted Carla Kelly to enjoy the royalties so as to encourage her to write more.<br />Reviewer Tregatt has already given details about the actual plots, etc.  I only wish to say that the author's outstanding abilities in terms of accuracy (owing to good, sound research), her ability to bring utterly delectable characters to life and her elegant and pristine prose have given me some of the most enjoyable reading in my life.  If only some of the paler regency wannabees took note and could achieve half of her standard. Georgette Heyer would recognise a fellow perfectionist.<br />Thank you, thank you, thank you Carla Kelly.  You are a beacon in the dark to those of us who love well written regencies of high emotion (never maudlin) with characters we can love and believe in.	2002-01-09
US	50886639	RE5USVQNMEDEH	0440235537	503029624	Red Roses Mean Love	Books	3	28	37	N	N	OK but not memorable	No doubt if anyone bothers, I shall receive a few &quot;not helpfuls&quot; for this review.  Usually I only comment on books I really enjoyed or those which sadly disappointed me, having expected much better.  Based on the comments here about RRML, I expected rather more of this book and it did not, in my view, add up to much more than a reasonable read and an average first effort.  However, there is too much about it that smacks of first book and sloppy editing.  Sometimes I think that editors deserve more criticism than writers for the sometimes silly final results we see in romantic historical fiction.<br />The problem with RRML is that it is full of silly little errors which either the author or editor should have picked up.  These add up to enormous distraction.  Some examples of this are met on the very first page of the book.  The setting is described as a pine forest with the sounds of chirping crickets.  Pine forests do not and did not exist on the &quot;outskirts&quot; of London (try the Scottish Highlands for that!) and crickets do not feature in the natural fauna like they do in the author's home of Georgia.  A &quot;three piece orchestra&quot; is referred to; it should be a string trio.  A house has &quot;tall Palladian windows&quot;; the house is a brick London townhouse.  Palladian architectural style is really best used in connection with large country mansions.  The main characters get married in St Paul's Cathedral rather than their own parish churches as required then under English canon and secular law.  The silliest folly is in suggesting that a woman could, by writing short stories, afford to keep a large family.  Jane Austen received only pin money (perhaps only £100 or so) for Pride and Prejudice.  Writing during the Regency era was not a career option which would provide any sort of reasonable income for either men or women.  Even Sir Walter Scott had a day job!  I could go on and on.<br />Unfortunately, the above merely accentuates the problems with the story because the characters cannot rise above them.  Hayley Albright and Stephen Barrett are very one dimensional cardboard cutouts.  They don't really seem to have adult emotions, conflicts or feelings.  The peripheral characters, especially the old family retainers, are burlesques of reality.<br />The conversational language used by the H/H and virtually everyone else is out of synch with the time period the author wishes to place them in.  They are all boisterous, they flop and plop into chairs, their hearts &quot;slam against their ribs&quot;; words &quot;erupt from his lips like steam from a boiling kettle&quot;.  Sorry this is just to silly to swallow!<br />The plot line is not too bad although mixing a murder with the slapstick behaviour of the main characters is jarring and I was left not sure if the author was writing a comedy or a mystery.<br />The book was plainly a labour of love - look at all of the thanks and so on the author has included.  But, she needs to get a grip on her research, make sure she has a better understanding of the physicallity of her timeframe and settings and learn to round out her characters into people one can believe in (and care about).  Unfortunately, I had to force myself to read this book to the end and although it was pleasant enough, the errors and lack of sharp development was annoying and in the end I was just simply bored.  When I think what Carla Kelly or Mary Balogh or Edith Layton can do with a 60 page short story in terms of characterisation, conflict and plot development, I wondered why everyone seems so taken with this book.  It is, ultimately, at least 100 pages too long.<br />C+ for the author for a first effort; D- for the editor.	2002-01-03
US	50886639	R3Q0ZTMAR4PPV	0451186664	873275611	The Rake's Rainbow	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Portrait of a disfunctional marriage	My first experience with Allison Lane (The Beleaguered Earl) was a disappointment for the book was so full of flaws that I was reluctant to try again.  I am pleased to say that I was very much surprised with The Rake's Rainbow and recommend it highly.<br />The story of The Hon Thomas Mannering and Miss Caroline Cummings is not an easy read.  If you like your regencies lite 'n' fluffy, then this book is not for you.  It is dark, distressing and depressing but, ultimately, full of hope and triumph against what seem to be pretty overwhelming odds.<br />Thomas and Caroline marry in order to escape - for her poverty and governessing and for him in order to gain an inheritance.  Thomas had become ensnared by Alicia - a heartless, fickle nymphomaniac who strings him along never intending to marry an earl's mere second son.  He slips into a deep depression, drinking and gambling and nearly slipping over the edge into madness.<br />Caroline is the stronger of the two for, with astute insight into human nature, she is able to save him by letting matters run their course, never giving up hope that the man she sees beneath the hopeless despair is worth nurturing and loving.  Some might say she is a bit of a sacrificial lamb but, within the social context of the times, she did what she had to in times when divorce was virtually impossible.  The descriptions of her meeting Thomas's family for the first time and finding her way through the Season were excellent for she does it without the support of her husband who, by this time, is so depressed that he ignores her completely.<br />I liked the way the author developed Thomas's family; each member, particularly his father, the Earl of Marchgate and his foppish but sweet elder brother, had a significant role to play in the development of the story.<br />There is a great deal of pain, angst and high emotion in this story.  Tempers flare, characters sometimes act against their own best intentions and the hero is flawed but honourable.The heroine is strong but tender and loving. Sometimes the reader will want to point a pistol at Thomas and at others will want to love him - for this story is a real emotional roller coaster.<br />I will read another of Allison Lane's books to see if my first experience was atypical.  It's just too bad she did not meet in The Beleaguered Earl the exceptionally high standards that she set with The Rake's Rainbow.  It was very well done; polished prose and obvious careful research gives it a very authentic air.  Her depiction of the Season, the Ton and marriage and family life in the Regency era were very good and most realistic.	2001-12-19

I picked this one up whilst on holiday recently and just read it; what a pleasure it was!  I don't ordinarly seek out short stories as a matter of course but I am very fond of this particular little mini sub-genre. Three of the contributions stood out for me.<br />&quot;The Rake's Christmas&quot; by Edith Layton is the poignant story of a young man, back from the Peninsular wars, saddened and a little self loathing, who throws himself into some half-hearted rakery in order to put the wars behind him.  He is taken up by a truly accomplished rake, Lord Shelton.  During a Christmas house party, the elder rake plays deus ex machina to young Ian, Viscount Hunt in order to bring him together with Miss Eve Thompkins.  Eve is the daughter Shelton never had - the offspring of his true life-long secret and unrequited love.  So, he stands in an almost fatherly way over Hunt, helping him to overcome his sombre loneliness and sad boyhood in making a match for him and Eve.  Edith Layton is a favourite of mine and she packs a lot of emotion into just a few short pages.<br />Jo Beverley is a writer whose books I have been collecting with the aim of indulging myself.  Why she and Layton and Balogh are not published in the UK is beyone my comprehension - such a shame!  I was delighted with her contribution to this anthology.  &quot;A Mummer's Play&quot; is the story of Col &quot;Lucky Jack&quot; Beaufort, by default the new Duke of Cranmoore.  Justina Travers lost her fiance in the Peninsula when he was under the command of his close friend, Jack.  Justina has some reason to suspect that Cranmoore may have been a traitor and, therefore, the cause of her fiance's death.  She insinuates herself into Jack's first Christmas house party as the new duke by hiding herself amongst the mummers who come to perform.  Her aim is to expose him as a traitor and murderer.  The story takes place during the course of just one evening and, in just a few intense, emotional pages, Jo Beverley brings an almost unbearably high degree of tension and emotion as these two lonely, hurt but passionate people find an extraordinary and unexpected love and mutual redemption.  Simply excellent.<br />Mary Balogh's contribution is, as always, as near to perfection as you can get.  Hers is the story of three young orphaned children whose wastrel parents largely ignored them.  Their maternal uncle, Viscount Morsey, and paternal aunt, Lady Carlyle, reluctantly leave London to come to the depths of the countryside to &quot;do their duty&quot; and make some half-hearted provision for their upbringing.  It emerges that the two adults were once engaged but huge family problems, anger and recriminations tore them apart.  The story is largely told through the eyes of the children and the theme of the story, as Lady Carlyle discovers, is that Christmas is about birth, parenthood, love, hope and commitment.  In the context of this very brief piece, all five players find themselves turned into a loving family.  Mary Balogh is pure magic.  She writes such poignant, moving and emotional stories which are refined to pure gold.  Wonderful.<br />Do find yourself a second hand copy of this anthology; reading it is simply a pleasure worth the effort.	2001-12-13

I see that this book has had mixed comments but, for me, this was one of the best books I have read this year or, indeed, any year.  It fulfilled all of my personal criteria:  well researched, beautifully written, strong, adult characters and a solid story line.  In addition, the author addressed some really difficult issues and handled them superbly well.<br />The story is of Valentine Aston, the bastard son of an earl who, following the death of his beloved mother, is taken to live with relations and then brought up in rough circumstances.  However, he is taken out of this environment when his half brother Charlie (the earl's legitimate heir) seeks him out and he is sent to a rather typical English public (eg private) school.  It is here that the future circumstances of his life are set in motion and also where he meets, as a teenager, the boys who will have a large role in his adult life.  It is at this point that Marjorie Farrell is to be highly congratulated.  For, she has portrayed the naive and not so naive homosexuality that has for centuries been part of the English single sex public school system.  She has done this sympathetically and very realistically.  She has far exceeded the efforts of Emma Holly here in portraying sympathetically a homosexual man in another time frame - something most authors would never attempt and could probably never get &quot;right&quot;.  The Marquess of Wimborne is a lovely man and the friendship between him and Val, despite their differences, is exquistely portrayed.  Lord Stanton, a sadistic man, probably bisexual is also well done and the conflicts the three deal with in the novel are wonderfully drawn.<br />The other fundamental male relationships in this book are also outstanding.  Val and his father have their ups and downs but Val is eventually reconciled to him and finds out that the relationship between his mother and her lover was not at all what he had expected.  Val and his brother Charlie enjoy a close relationship and the nature of the loving and close brotherhood they develop is moving and poignant.<br />The story is set in a military background - Wellington's forays in Portugal in 1810 against Napoleon's army.  I adore stories with a military setting and know enough about this particular period to know when an author has done her research.  I think that Bernard Cornwell of the Sharpe stories (she mentions these in her preface) would admire the quality of her evocation of this thrilling time.  Indeed, I recall an academic comment I read some years ago that the best fictionalised account of the battle of Waterloo was &quot;An Infamous Army&quot; by Georgette Heyer.  So, women can write this sort of thing well and some of us like reading it too!  The author gets the tone right, the descriptions right and the social setting correct.  In this book we have an enlisted man made up to an officer and unlike Deborah Hale's book dealing with this, Ms Farrell has excelled in getting the social and cultural problems dealing with this on target.  Excellent stuff!<br />The heroine, Elspeth comes from a family where the women follow the drum.  She is excellent; she is adult, strong and perfect for the hero and her parents add greatly to the tale.  The story is not rushed, the author takes the time to develop it and her characters.  Indeed, I wanted it to go on further - I could happily follow them over several books as I did with Richard Sharpe.<br />I understand that Val and Elspeth reappear in Jack of Hearts.  I have obtained a copy and look forward to reading it.  I rate Marjorie Farrell's work very highly - I have read several of her books now.  If you want an intelligent read with strong characters behaving like adults, set accurately in their time frame, then I cannot recommend her highly enough.  Do read this book.  Please consider what I have said against the other comments here; this book is a real keeper.p and the nature of the loving and close brotherhood they develop is moving and poignant.<br />The story is set in a military background - Wellington's forays in Portugal in 1810 against Napoleon's army.

Jackson Rule, a victim of abuse, is a loving and caring man whose story we gradually learn while he finds his way in life following 15 years in a maximum security facility.  Rebecca Hill is a strong woman who accepts and loves him and gives him the strength to find a role for himself in society.  A tremendously moving and  emotionally wrenching story.

It is a very sweet, moving and inspiring story of a man whose love knows no limits, a woman who is learning to find herself and an extraordinary marriage which, ultimately, brings poignant happiness and completion to a man and a woman who truly deserve it.<br />Rebecca is pregnant by another man (a juvenile, hormone inspired first lust who is not what she thought) and is married to Jake, a man who has overcome a past of pain, humiliation and rejection.  However, he has a bottomless heart and a love for Rebecca which allows him to let her walk away.  Ultimately, however (this is a romance after all!) she returns giving him (and therefore herself) such happiness that you just know these two will continue on in one of those very special marriages which brings completion to both partners and the children they produce.<br />This is a keeper to be reread from time to time for the pleasure of watching these two people find their happiness and love.	2001-11-19

How refreshing to find an author who does not assume her readers are either immature or ill-informed.  I appreciate that Liz Carlyle does meticulous research and makes every effort to ensure the peripheral details in her work are spot on.  I was well entertained although I had figured out &quot;whodunit&quot; well before the denoument of the book.<br />What draws me to LC's work are her well-drawn characters whom she lets play out a story in fully believable settings.  Without patronising her readers, she sketches out men and women who are troubled, driven, passionate and emotional.  The psychological implications are there for the scrupulous reader to pick up and consider.<br />I won't go over the plot - others have done this very well.  I won't &quot;defend&quot; the S&amp;M scene to those who found it offensive.  I have seen a lot of discussion about it here and elsewhere.  However, I thought it fit into the story, fit into the mood, fit into the profile of the characters she had built.  Cole Amherst is riven by internal conflict - the drive towards good (and he is an inherently good man) and the pull towards straying from his chosen path really are what the book is about.  Therefore, that particular scene, which I thought was very exciting and well written, only add to his internal conflict as he &quot;acts out&quot; some of this with Jonet who loves him enough to allow this within the context of their loving relationship.  Jonet is a strong woman; some of the readers who did not like her perhaps miss the point that she was srong as a result of her insidious and deeply rooted fears.  A woman who has been used, particularly as she was by her father, may react in a different way from one who has been lovingly cherished by her parents.<br />The other sex scenes were, in my view, excellent without detracting from the story line and I thought they were beautifully written.<br />All in all, a tourde force.  This is not an easy novel to read; it requires that the reader grow along with the characters and experience the torment they must endure to grow together.  You feel, at the conclusion of the novel, that this couple fully deserve the ecstatic happiness they appear to have found together.<br />I look forward to reading Beauty Like the Night and A Woman of Virtue.	2001-10-25

I always treat myself to the various Christmas anthologies because they make a particularly nice read at the holiday season when things get so frantic you begin to wish Christmas had never been invented!  I recently obtained a few of the old Signet Regency Christmas anthologies now out of print and it was truly worth the effort.<br />If you never read another Christmas regency novella, may I recommend Mary Balogh's &quot;The Porcelain Madonna&quot;.  This exquisitely written (what else would you expect from Mary Balogh?), emotionally tender and moving story is the best I have ever read in the Christmas setting, either contemporary or historical.  The painfully tragic story of the difficult, prickly but kind hearted Darcy Austin, the Earl of Kevern, and the gentle, sympathetic Julie Bevan, is full of healing, joy, compassion and love.  Their personal &quot;go between&quot;, the little boy from the slums, Charlie Cobban, is also a memorable character whose family, through the birth of yet another mouth to fill, brings real peace and healing to the bereaved Earl.<br />I simply cannot speak highly enough of this charming little story - it is the sort you will want to turn to again and again when you need a little inspiration and comfort.<br />The other stories are also good; I was quite surprised by Emma Lange's as I don't know her and she presented a well written study of a large family which is mindful of Georgette Heyer's &quot;A Civil Contract&quot;.  Marjorie Farrell is a favourite of mine; she writes very well and her contribution, &quot;Christmas Rose&quot; tells a poignant story of a couple who have drifted apart through the curse of infertility (told within the proper context of the times and painfully realistic).  How a foundling child first brings them together, then drives a wedge between them and then ultimately brings them peace and joy is also awonderfully heartwarming illustration of what Christmas really means.<br />I do recommend this collection. It's worth the effort to obtain an out of print copy.  What a star is Mary Balogh!	2001-10-10
US	50886639	R338AE9EMHRJK4	0373291639	572476524	The Wedding Wager (Harlequin Historical Series, No. 563)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	An entertaining read but not a keeper	My second foray with Deborah Hale - I read &quot;A Gentleman of Substance&quot; last year.<br />The plot of this novel was an interesting idea although I have seen the reverse Pygmalion concept better done; Judith Ivory's The Proposition is better, in my view.  Ivory's quality of prose is better than Hale's and her characters are better rounded.  My main problem with this story was that the male protagonist was not well enough developed.  The idea of using an enlisted man (rather than an officer/member of the nobility, etc, etc) was good but it just did not stand up to scrutiny as we do not know enough about his army experiences to understand the adult man.  We know about his past as a footman and are given insight into how this effected him (eg he enlisted)and although we are given to understand Morse Archer was something of a hero in the Peninsula, we aren't given enough detail to sketch in his character.<br />Although Richard Sharpe (of the famous Bernard Cornwell series) was an enlisted man promoted from the ranks to officer, he never was accepted in the drawing room as Morse Archer is and Sharpe had more &quot;elevated&quot; tutoresses than Archer.  So, this is a rather dangerous idea to write about without some better understanding of the social and military history of the times.<br />I don't think that Leonora was particularly sympathetic although eventually she does come to a good degree of personal insight and I was glad she woke up and went after her man!  I don't think her behaviour was particularly beliveable within the contemporary context of her times.  However, she matured and developed in a more believeable way than Sgt Archer.<br />I also question the plot device of having Algie fall in love with and expect to marry a servant - no matter how clever and sweet she might have been (and stupid but sweet he was), they both would have been ostracised from polite society and most certainly never accepted by her class either.  A nice idea but ultimately completely unbelievable and therefore unsustainable.<br />I found the first half the the book somewhat boring and it was not until I was into the second half that the characters and the story began to satisfy.  The pace was too slow; not enough happened and I kept waiting for some satisfying character development.<br />The author clearly has some talent but needs sharper editing to crisp up her writing and plotting.  I shan't give up on her yet as I think she has potential and she was not afraid to take an unusual plot device and try it out.	2001-09-29

It is the story of Valentina, the Countess Grunowska, a Polish patriot trapped into a marriage with a vindictive and violent husband. She meets a French officer, Colonel de Chavel (we never learn his first name) at a ball and they fall in love with a passion that I have rarely ever seen equalled in fiction.<br />He joins the march to Russia although he is an independent thinker amongst the political intrigue and espionage at the Polish Court - a true French patriot and not just one of Napoleon's minions. She follows him, fearing the wrath and sadism of her husband and, incredibly, she finds him during the freezing, snowy and tragic retreat from Moscow. Wounded, de Chavel has lost his right arm and is near death when Valentina finally locates him in a scene of such emotion that I have always remembered it. She nurses him tenderly, joining the French army as it retreats back to Poland.<br />Finally, they settle quietly and blissfully happy on one of her properties in rural Poland until she becomes pregnant with his child. Despite the handicap of his lost sword arm, de Chavel challenges Valentina's husband to a pistol duel in order to kill him and thus make her free to marry him. However, fate intervenes and one of Valentina's old and faithful retainers murders Count Grunowski before the duel can take place. And so de Chavel returns to Valentina, now heavily pregant and fearful for his life, in a shimmer of summer light and poignant, tender love.<br />I shall NEVER, EVER, forget this book, reread it from time to time and guard my two tattered copies well. Do try to find a copy and read it - it is magical. I would give it 10 stars if I could.	2001-09-29
US	50886639	R2IXZEPHGHNNZ9	0515130990	612858686	Beyond Innocence	Books	2	7	11	N	N	Sadly, a disappointment	I wanted so very much to like this book. I bought it because I thought it would be an interesting change from some of the usual sorts of historical and regency fiction which I prefer. Erotic elements are not a problem - I have read several works by writers like Robin Schone so prudery is not a problem for me!<br />However, I was very disappointed with this book. Sometimes I had the feeling that there was more than one writer at work as the quality of the writing was highly erratic - sometimes the author used short, choppy almost juvenile sentences (for example the description of the journey into Derbyshire in the first part of the book) and at other times the prose was markedly improved. I felt, at times, a screaming need for a blue pencil whilst reading it!<br />Sometimes the erotic scenes were good and at other times the use of out of synch and rather coarse language was terribly jarring and broke the rhythm of the story. I felt the overall concept of the plot was very good and, in the hands of a better editor, the book would have come to life. Instead, I felt the main characters were very one-dimensional and that we never really got to know the heroine in particular.<br />As I have never read anything else by this author, I cannot tell if this sort of prose is at her usual level of competence or not but, in this case, I have to admit that I skimmed the last third of the book because I simply lost interest.<br />Erotic scenes are something that can add or detract to a story. However, I think writers like Stephanie Laurens or Gayle Wilson can evoke a far more heightend sexual tension in their books than Emma Holly has managed to do here. Her editor really needs changing; if it were me I would be very angry to have been let down like this.<br />Also, the continual and multiple errors in this book in terms of the titles the main characters held was simply ridiculous. Why do writers want to set their stories in the context of the English aristocracy and then fail to do such elementary research on this topic? Too many readers know the right forms; this sort of thing is incredibly distracting.  What are the editors doing????<br />Again, I wanted to like this book; my expectations were very high but, sadly, very much let down.  I gave it two stars purely because the plot was fairly original even if the execution of it was so poor.	2001-09-13

I've had Liz Carlyle's books in my TBR pile for some time and have just finished My False Heart. I found the plot to be well developed (if perhaps leisurely) and the characters rounded and believeable - people about whom I could care. The peripheral members of the cast, most especially the children and young people, were memorable and added great value to the overall story. Rannoch's gay valet, Kemble, was a real delight and an excellent foil to his master and his dissolute, overtly masculine circle of friends.<br />If every woman loves a rake, then Elliot Armstrong, the Marquis of Ranoch, is truly delicious. His reformation and redemption make for a read full of angst and tension. Perhaps Evie is not quite as well drawn for sometimes I wanted to shake her and remind her that for such an intelligent woman she easily allowed herself to head down the wrong track where Rannoch was concerned.<br />I particularly appreciated the evocative descriptions of every day life (for example the family meals and lively discussions) and the healing effects of a happy domesticity on the Marquis. It was a demonstration of true healing through the little things of life. Sometimes the author's word pictures reminded me a bit of the tranquility of a Vermeer painting.<br />I now look forward to reading the rest of her books. I'm going on holiday soon and two of them will be in the luggage!	2001-09-10

Raina Lynn's debut novel was just released in the UK this month although I see from the copyright date that it must have come out in the USA in 1997/8. I bought it, purely on a whim, yesterday during my lunch hour without even opening the book or doing more than glancing at the blurb on the back. Not my usual style as I like to read about books and look carefully at reader reviews most of the time. Wow! Wow! Wow!<br />I could not put this book down and feel quite overwhelmed by it. This is category romance (so often unfairly derided) at its very best.<br />Briefly, the story concerns the relationships in a family where personalities are strong, tempers sometimes short, emotions deep but love is steadfast. The daily hurdles of life are truly brought out for this family to overcome. Maggie was a product of the foster care system who met the boy next door, Garrett Hughes, when she was 16. They fell deeply in love, married when Garrett graduated from the police academy and had a much loved son, Rick. However, Garrett was a fully committed cop who transferred to the DEA and got involved in an undercover case which dragged on for years. It signaled the end of their marriage. Maggie could not take being married to a cop who had previously suffered several injuries on the job and, like many who have been hurt in their formative years, she pushed him away before he could &quot;leave&quot; her, eg by being killed on the job. Rick, like all kids in this sort of situation, was caught in the middle and deeply hurt and confused.<br />After the undercover job ended, Garrett decided to get his family back and so flew out to San Francisco to begin an attempt at reconciliation. However, fate intervened and the first of the hurdles this family faces arises in the form of a tragic Lockerbie type incident. Badly hurt, Garrett suffers from multiple injuries and winds up in a coma, nearly dead following three resucitations after coronaries on the table and in ICU. Maggie, a physiotherapist and health professional herself, takes up a bedside vigil. Whilst in the coma, Garrett nonetheless is able to hear what is happening around him and even seems to read Maggie's thoughts as she pours out her love, grief and frustrations to the ex-husband she thinks is unconscious. The opening few chapters in this book are really excellent in portraying the surroundings of an ICU and in describing Garrett's near death experiences in a fully believeable way.<br />Unfortunately, the first hurdle is now in place - Garrett has fractured his spine and will be a paraplegic. A long period of rehab and readjustment is started. Ms Lynn describes very accurately not just the physical rehab required but also gives us an intimate and honest portrayal of the grief, shock, mourning, disbelief, anger, feelings of inadequacy and the highs and lows of a man and his family coming to terms with a life turned completely upside down. Excellent, simply excellent how she lets us into the private thoughts and the angry interaction between these two people who have so much on their plates yet still madly and passionately love and want each other both physically.<br />Like all romantic stories, they come together, push each other apart and then come together again. He is convinced he will be a burden to Maggie; she is terrified of letting him back into her life lest she be hurt again by losing him - particularly when after the first 6 months or so he begins to want to return to police work, albeit as a trainer.<br />Eventually, this family accept each other for what each of them truly is and not what they want each other to be. Maggie, in particular, realises that she must love the whole man, not the man she things she has always wanted. Rick learns that his parents are not perfect (they even have sex!) and learns to love his father despite typical adolescent hormonal rages and feelings of rejection which came about because of the nature of  Garrett's job. Garrett learns that he has some verydeep rooted strengths on which he can draw to put his life back together with the love of his family.<br />One particularly poignant issue dealt with in this book is that of impotence. Yes, it sometimes arises in stories where the hero is disabled as it does here, but I have never read a more realistic portrayal of the impact it can have on a man, particularly one who suffers, as Maggie says, from &quot;testosterone poisoning&quot;. How this couple deal with it and over come it is wonderful to read. At the conclusion of the novel they are trying for a second family. Although life will still put up hurdles for them, you feel that all three members of this family have come through their experiences wiser, more courageous, more tolerant, more unified and loving than they would have been without the experiences Ms Lynn writes of.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book; it was well written and the author writes about marriage and disability with true insight. Well done!	2001-09-05
US	50886639	R2IZJZMTBSOO2	0440223725	792718288	All Through the Night	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Evocative and truly memorable	My interest in this novel was piqued by a reviewer at another website who gave it 100 marks out of 100. Quite a triumph, I thought, as the reviewer is, I think, tough but consistent in her views. I was NOT disappointed! All Through the Night is a difficult, dark and demanding book. It is not an easy read. Sometimes I felt I was almost intruding into the private emotional dance that Mrs Wilder and Col Seward were performing. The hero is a man from an impossibly horrible background who, through sharp intelligence, profound skills of observation and self-knowledge and an almost puritanical morality has literally created himself from nothing. The heroine is also from a less than salubrious background and profoundly damaged by her first marriage to a man who nearly broke her spirit through impossible demands and relentless criticism. He is a spy; she is a thief. They are caught up in the fathomless machinations and devious plots of politicians who only think they control the puppet strings of these two strong willed people. There is hot but very believable sexual tension between the two and the build up to their ultimate coming together is exquisitely drawn. The author truly is clever in painting a picture which requires the reader to fill in the gaps. Some things are never explained (how Jack injured his hand, for example) and others are hinted at obliquely but effectively. I shall now have to organise copies of her other books for I hope to be pleased again with Ms Brockway's work. She is to be complimented on the quality of her prose, her immaculate plotting and the brilliantly developed characters. Some of the peripheral characters in this novel are very well done and added to the intricate layers of the story. Only one small criticism. As I so often find, editors let authors down repeatedly with stupid, totally preventable errors about aristocratic titles. Why, why, why does this happen?	2001-08-25

The last time this happened for me was with Anne Gracie's Gallant Waif.  So, I look for a happy future with Shannon Donnelly.<br />The plot for A Compromising Situation has been summed up well by other reviewers so I won't go over it again.  I would simply like to agree with others who found this adult story about grown up people a real treat.  This book is a little dark; not much in the way of light relief appears.  Indeed, at first I thought that the dowager Lady Rothe would be a comic character but we eventually see that she, like the Colonel and Maeve, has her own sadness and regrets.<br />Another reviewer has mentioned the slightly odd choice of the heroine's surname - Midden - and I have to say I agree; afterall the word means dunghill!  However, overlook this little distraction and enjoy some excellent story telling, quality prose, well-drawn characters and follow Maeve and Lord Rothe as they find a deep and unexpected happiness with each other.<br />I look forward to joining Clarissa in her London debut and hope to meet the newly married Lord and Lady Rothe again in A Dangerous Compromise.	2001-08-22

I think it is best viewed in terms of its fairy tale quality and chacterisations.  This is most definitly not, in my view, an historical novel; indeed, it does not even pretend realistically to picture daily life, politics, historical context, social structure, etc, at all.  It really is, ultimately, a well-written paean to the power of love which can heal so many of the tribulations which make up our lives.<br />Gillian has been cruelly misused and undervalued; Christopher has lost his sight and with it his own sense of self-worth.  Through the love these two find for each other, they learn to put their pasts behind them and temper their individual and collective strengths.  She is set free from her childhood into a deep and abiding love; he comes to know that he is valued for his inner strengths and loving heart.<br />What a treat this book was.  Overlook the sense of unreality and language and plot details which are clearly out of time synch.  Instead, just let yourself come to love and admire the H/H and their extended family and devoted friends.  I know I will return to this book again in the future knowing that the emotions it engenders will be of comfort.	2001-08-15

I can't decide which book I preferred - both are so splendidly written with beautifully crafted prose and intricate stories. However, like the Duke's Wager, Lord of Dishonour is character-driven and the author is outstanding at giving us men and women who are believeable whilst being both difficult and loveable. The conflict in the story is really quite fundamental - are we what we make of ourselves in life or are we purely the result of how others see us, forever quantified by social strictures?<br />In this book, we have two people from less than &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot; backgrounds. The hero, Viscount (&quot;Vice Count&quot;) North, and the heroine, Lady Amanda Amberley, come from that risque sector of Regency life made up of &quot;legitimate&quot; illegitimates, the product of husbands and wives going their separate ways following the birth of an unquestionable and unimpeachable heir. Lack of divorce meant that social leaders like the Duke of Devonshire and Lady Harley (The Harleian Miscellaney) got away with it but this book examines the effect on the innocent results - the offspring.<br />Viscount North is a many layered character, a man of immense talent, charm and innate goodwill who is close to squandering it all for what are, in the end, really quite honourable reasons. Lady Amanda is a young woman who feels she has been driven to the edges of acceptability and is so desperate for the veneer of respectability that she looks for love in the wrong places and very nearly misses out on the opportunity for a relationship of courage, honour, loyalty, love and mutual understanding. How these two overcome their personal circumstances makes for a rewarding story.<br />Only one criticism - it is not and never has been the case under English law that an adoptee can inherit a title; they can inherit unentailed lands and income but never a title which must descend through direct bloodlines. This error is unfortunate because the story is predicated on bending the rules but I forgive the author - she is such a delight to read that I overlooked it. Besides, no doubt more than a few aristocrats did get away with a scenario much like this book!	2001-08-09

Although I am not 110% comfortable with the format (I am sure I will be one day soon), the book itself, its content, plot and characters was simply wonderful.  Ms Voght has created some very, very special characters in this book and one can't help but fall in love with Arthur Lyndered, Baron Sanvrain.  In Susan, Lady Carwell, the author has given the hero the perfect heroine - she truly is his &quot;other half&quot; and how they overcome their circumstances and difficulties to be together is truly a triumph.<br />I was impressed by the author's refusal to glorify Arthur's war career - she lets him mock it and quantify it brilliantly.  I have a huge interest in Wellington's Peninsular campaign and what the author has to say about it always rings true.  Arthur's resulting disability is handled with grace and tact.  How he reacts to it and the impact on his life is very realistic.<br />I hope very much to see a sequel to this novel.  There were some very vague hints in the final pages that Charlotte, Susan's disappointing daughter, had yet to find her way in life and it would be very rewarding to see her develop, guided by her mother and new step-father.<br />A truly beautiful novel, well crafted, strongly written and highly recommended.	2001-08-06

I was deeply moved by this story - it was not the usual Regency novel - it was dark, deep and difficult - sometimes almost painful to read.  Others have summarised the plot (and the very few faults which appear) and pointed out the main area of conflict betwen two seemingly similar but ultimately different men.  <br />From the start I was attracted to the &quot;Black Duke&quot;.  Very recently I read an outstanding new biography published in the UK of the 2nd Earl of Rochester by Cephas Goldsworthy (&quot;The Satyr&quot;).  Lord Rochester is best known as a Restoration Poet and is given a bit of coverage to high school students.  However, what your teacher never told you was that he was not only a poet but a rake, debauchee (possibly bi-sexual), pornographer in chief to Charles II, sufferer of syphillis and a man bent on self-destruction who was redeemed on his deathbed (I think) by his love of life, the arts, women and the passions of friendship.  The character of the Duke of Torquay in many facets of his personality, attitudes and experiences put me in mind of Rochester.  However, Torquay is able to redeem himself before sinking into the abyss of total despair, self-loathing and possibly, even, a prolonged and ugly death from venereal disease.   How he does this is the core of the novel.  That the heroine was able to allow and encourage him to do it made me admire her when at first I despaired of her good qualities.<br />I have found a copy of &quot;The Disdainful Marquis&quot; and will now read that to see if the Marquis of Bessacarr is able to put his experiences in this story to his advantage.<br />A well written, passionate, deep and unusual story.  I am so glad I read it - thank you, Edith Layton!	2001-07-26

Elisabeth Fairchild does not shy away from making her readers think carefully about difficult issues.  In this book about honour, loyalty, honesty and loneliness the central issue is the destructive and demoralising results of malicious gossip.  As others have said here, the H/H are both victims of a breach of promise but their recovery from the situation is hindered by local gossip.  In this book, the action takes place in a village and it made a refreshing change from gossip at Almacks or Carlton House, etc.<br />It was, for me, nice to read a story set in Chipping Campden as I live nearby and know it very well.  The descriptions were quite evocative and obviously the author has visited and walked around the village!<br />Only one problem with this book which crops up in so many Regency novels.  Why oh why don't authors (or, particularly, their editors) purchase a paperback guide to titles and forms of address?  In this case, the Marquess of Chalmondeley and Earl of Rockforth is constantly referred to as the Earl.  In the case of two titles such as this, he is a Marquess and the Earldom is what is known as a &quot;courtesy title&quot; and is held by the eldest son.  If there are three titles in a family (often the case with a Dukedom) then the third (and lowest) title would devolve on to the eldest son's eldest son.  Confusing perhaps but the mistakes made in this book really are annoying on my side of the &quot;pond&quot; or, indeed, to anyone who does know the correct form.  Also, the second son (and all other sons) of a Marquess, eg the villain of this piece, does have a title and they are known as &quot;Lord First Name/Family Name, or in this case Lord Brett Chalmondeley.  Sorry to be pedantic - wmr-uk who also reviews Regencies finds this annoying too!<br />All in all, a lyrical and emotional story - well done!	2001-06-12

Mary Jo Putney is also a favourite whose work I greatly admire.  Merline Lovelace's contribution was OK but not particularly memorable. It is really Gayle Wilson's story which was for me, my raison d'etre for writing this review.<br />Gayle Wilson unashamedly specialises in imperfect heros and, for those of us who prefer this type of man, she has given us one to die for in the Earl of Huntington.  It is interesting that in her story &quot;My Darling Echo&quot; the hero has been blind for ten years and, on the whole, has learnt to cope with this disability which in the 1820s must have been incredibly difficult. Therefore there is none of the usual &quot;nursing&quot; scenario of the heroine giving the hero a reason to live; Huntington has a full, rich and vigorous life well established when we first meet him. The heroine, Mrs Arabella Simmons, is delightful, intelligent and responsible and how she and her little son, Kit, spread some light, love and laughter into the Earl's life is wonderful to read.  The valet, Ingalls, is another Wilson speciality - the devoted and convincingly loving manservant - another of her well drawn deus ex machinae!<br />I think that I know of only one other novel which portrays a blind hero in this time frame so well: Marjorie Farrell's &quot;Miss Ware's Refusal&quot;.  In this novel, as well as this novella by Ms Wilson, the utter lack of sentimentality gives real honesty and forthrightness in the character portrayals.<br />My only complaint, as another reader has said, is that &quot;My Darling Echo&quot; was too short and so much deserved a full length novel; I could see so many paths for development.  Or, perhaps, if I am honest, the very briefness of this story added to its poignancy anc charm.	2001-06-07

The hero, Chad, is particularly attractive and it is rewarding to watch him come to terms with his huge disability.  How he does this, supported by a particularly feisty heroine, Jennifer, is well worth the read.  The other characters are strong and well drawn.<br />The only quibble I have is that the actions the lead characters take, the situations they deal with and, most especially, their sexual behaviour is rather out of synch for the timeframe (I believe it is meant to be the 1890s).  Although this is somewhat of a distraction, if you can get past this, then the storyline is strong, the prose pretty good and you will enjoy the book.<br />A further problem is, again, one of synch.  The hero faces a pretty big challenge for he is severely disabled (paralysed and in a wheelchair).  In those times, a man who had an accident and injury such as his would been unlikely to survive or, at least, for very many years.  If you compare his experiences to those of Mac McCandless in A Man Like Mac, (eg bladder problems which in the 1890s would have been, probabably, fatal) you will see what I mean.  The heroine handles him very well but, again, she is out of context of her times I think and the author does use some rather &quot;politically correct&quot; terminology in describing the situation.  However, they are a truly likeable pair and you can't help but be pleased for their personal outcome.	2001-05-22

Well, I simply cannot finish this book - it's so boring and slow moving that I cannot bring myself to carry on any further.  The hero is immature (at 30 he really ought to be a bit more of a man and not chafing under his daddy's thumb!) and the heroine really is off-putting and unlikeable to the point that I just can't empathise at all!  So, sorry, this one is going to the charity bookshop forthwith!<br />A big disappointment!	2001-05-14
US	50886639	RDBOI7NOHN1XR	0373291523	625237216	Anne's Perfect Husband	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Another wonderful story	I don't even need to look at reviews for Gayle Wilson's books - I just order them and then allow myself the joy of reading them.  Yes, she certainly specialises in a certain type of Regency hero of which Ian Sinclair is one and I, like many other readers, love them.  Whilst admiring her contemporary suspense novels, it is her historicals that I love deeply.  I look forward to reading Sebastian's story - preferably next week!!<br />Thank you, Gayle, for your wonderfully emotional books.	2001-05-08
US	50886639	R1LZH5OC7XPTOE	0373709110	909929105	A Man Like Mac	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Simply brilliant	I can add very little to what others have said except to join the list of those praising this very well thought out and excellently executed book.  Books dealing with relationships where one partner is disabled often are puerile and totally unrealistic.  From personal experience, I can say that this is a terrible shame.  Disabilities are infinitely varied but, in the end, mutual acceptance, courage, patience and love are what make such relationships work and these are the themes which make wonderful romantic books.  Readers who are interested in this particular theme may like to seek out a copy of Lyn Dycoty's Pocketful of Dreams - an old Harelquin Temptation title from 1984 which is one of the few books I've read that comes up to Ms Robinson's standards.  I hope other authors are encouraged to tell such stories with such honesty and integrity.  Well done and thank you!	2001-05-03
US	50886639	R2CSSD7ZHSJNA4	051512866X	477226687	Winter Garden	Books	2	10	20	N	N	Such a disappointment	I bought this book based on the reviews posted here.  With the exception of the character of Thomas, the whole thing was a huge disappointment.  The descriptions of the village, the domestic interiors, the clothing, the food, etc were so badly done and riven with errors that the distraction put me off.  Really, it is not too difficult to get simple things like menus correct.  You only have to pick up a copy of Mrs Beeton to see what mid-Victorian English diners were consuming!  American writers who set their books in England ought to get the details right otherwise it is really pathetic.  (I'm an American who has lived in England for 20 years so it particularly makes me sad when I come across this sloppy type of writing.)<br /><br />The whole plot defies imagination as well and you really have to suspend disbelief to follow it at all.  As I live in England, believe me, there is just no where at all that even remotely resembles Winter Garden. (The name Winter Garden even sounds like a carnival rather than an ancient English village!) OK - if you want to read fantasy or fairy tales you might be able to swallow it but, overall, this book just is very over-rated.  The book made me think of a 20th century story stuck in long skirts - a sort of Bridget Jones Diary in crinolines!  Ugh!!!<br /><br />Perhaps this author will be able to pull up her socks and get her background detail in line.  In historical fiction, the sort of naive errors such as abound in this book ruin the whole experience.<br /><br />Please try again!	2001-04-26

Miss Fairchild does not fear tackling hard issues in her books and this one, dealing as it does with the subject of acute bereavement, is excellent.  As with the themes in Miss Dornton's Hero and Captain Cupid Calls the Shots, the author is not shy of making the reader confront some of our inner most fears - particularly those fears we face when we don't know how to talk to and help those suffering with suicidal thoughts, depression or bereavement.  I have been so pleased with her careful and empathetical treatment.  Very well done indeed!<br />She is also to be congratulated for the excellence of her research and the quality of her language.  Thank you!	2001-04-21

The other reviewers have made valid and careful comments and summed up the plot.  I would only add that I found this book to be very moving and it raised some uncomfortable issues which were very well handled.  I have read the &quot;masculine&quot; regencies, eg Cornwell, Kent, Mallinson et al, and felt that the author portrayed her two main male characters very well, particularly with respect to their experiences and feelings about their actions in the Peninsular campaign.  I work with the suicidal through a well-known charity so found Val an especially poignant character who fully deserves to have his own tale told to see if he is able to redeem himself and come to terms with his experiences thereby moving on to accpetance of himself and, hopefully, ultimate happiness.<br />Well done, Ms Fairchild and thank you.	2001-04-09
US	50886639	R2DLKXE6PU0IWC	0263161188	686704956	Gallant Waif (Large Print)	Books	5	45	46	N	N	A Most Welcome New Author	Every now and then one picks up a book by an unfamiliar author and it like coming home - everything fits and is comfortable and all expectations are  fulfilled.  I had that experience with Carla Kelly's books and now with  Anne Gracie.  I first read her second book, Tallie's Knight, and was so  impressed that I sought out her first book, Gallant Waif.  I was  enchanted.<br />The story of Major Jack Carstairs, recently returned from the  Peninsular campaign badly wounded in body and spirit, and Kate Farleigh,  who is hiding a shameful secret, is exceptionally well told.  Anne Gracie  writes with excellent knowledge of the period and draws her characters  exceedingly well.  It is very clear that she has done her research and the  quality of her prose is excellent.  Some of the peripheral characters in  the story (particularly Jack and Kate's friends from the Peninsula) are  briefly but memorably portrayed.<br />This is a story of high emotion, courage  and heroism but never slips into sentimentality.  There is sexual tension  without sex scenes and the growing relationship between Jack and Kate is  believable and moving.  The scene at the ball near the end of the book is  one of the most highly charged, emotional and poignant scenes I have ever  read in a book of this type - it moved me to tears.<br />I hope that Anne  Gracie's books are soon available in the USA in paperback for I think she  will attract a wide and devoted following if she keeps up the level of her  future efforts to the standards she has already achieved.  I was delighted  to note that she had been nominated for a RITA for Gallant Waif and I am  also delighted to write the first review for this book for amazon.com.  I  look forward to more from her in future.	2000-08-14
