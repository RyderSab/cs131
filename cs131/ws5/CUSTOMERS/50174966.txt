I stumbled upon this accomplished writer entirely by accident, and it turned out to be a great discovery.  This story holds more meaning today before September 11th.  The cover depicts the New York City skyline with the title \\"Hope Was Here\\" over it.  But the inside is an even better treat.  The story is about an aspiring young waitress and the hardships that come along with moving to a new place.  It is also about the struggle she goes through to understand why her mother left her to be raised by her aunt when she was young.  Hope and her aunt, a wonderful chef, set out for Welcome Stairways diner in Wisconsin from years of city life in New York and Atlanta.  The diner is owned by the kind-hearted G.T. Stoop, who has just announced he will be running for mayor although he has been diagnosed with cancer.  The other candidate for mayor has been the mayor for two terms, and many people are not ready to let their town's fate into the hands of a dying man.  From there, Hope sets out on the campaign trail and learns about dirty politics, life, and love.	2001-11-05

She reunites us with characters from her beloved time trilogy. Meg and Calvin's oldest daughter, Polly, is on an educational trip to Greece and Cyprus. Once she is there, she starts to relive her recent troubling past. One year before she arrives in Greece, Polly meets Maxa, an intelligent and wise elderly woman. Polly idolizes Maxa, because Maxa helps Polly to overcome her troubles. One day, a drunken Maxa makes the mistake of hurting Polly, and she discovers the startling truth that Maxa is only human. Will Polly learn to forgive Maxa? The novel has many controversial issues in it, and should not be in the young adult section. But the book still shows the meaning of trust, love and honesty.	2001-08-24

After reading Madeleine L'Engle's Camilla, I just had to find out what had become of her.  A Live Coal in the Sea introduces new characters and reunites us with old friends.  Written in the style of A House Like a Lotus, with flashbacks every few pages, the reader will never be confused about the time.  The main character is Camilla Dickinson, who is happy until her granddaughter, Raffi, comes to her home asking &quot;Are you or aren't you my grandmother?&quot; Camilla is forced to deal with something that happened long ago.  So she tells the story of her life, beginning at her senior year of college, when she met her husband which all lead up to the discovery of Raffi's father Taxi's parentage.  There is a surprise twist at the end of the book.  Ms. L'Engle deals with complicated issues in a subtle way.  This book should be read by more mature readers, but everyone will learn something from it.	2001-08-17

It's about a Hispanic-American girl named Stephanie who is struggling to understand growing up.  Her life has changed after her father's death, which we know absolutely nothing about.  She is supposed to be the main character, but the author barely ever talks about her.  Instead, her dressmaker for her quincenera (sweet fifteen) party, Rita, has the lead role.  She owns a small dress shop which is in financial trouble because her partner ran away with the money.  Oh, and Rita is in love deeply with Stephanie's uncle after seeing him twice in her life.  The plot is boring, there is absolutely no climax.  Rita solves Stephanie's problems in the first few pages of the book.  I do think that those who like realistic fiction-very realistic fiction-may like this book a bit.  [Or], read Camilla by Madeleine L'Engle.	2001-08-01

When I first picked up Camilla, I thought it would be just another teen romance with a happy ending and lots of fluffiness without much of a problem.  I was very wrong.  The book turned out to be much better than I had expected.  Camilla, a fifteen year-old girl, is dealing with many problems.  Her mother and father are having problems with their marraige.  She becomes very good friends with her best friend, Luisa, brother.  This makes Camilla and Luisa get in numerous fights.  And she has trouble accepting herself as an adult.  The characters are well devoloped, and there is never any unecessary dialogue.  The dialogue is in itself very beautiful if you look at the meanings.  Camilla, indeed, is a book not to be missed by anyone.	2001-07-25

But most are told in the female perspective.  Judy Blume's Then Again, Maybe I won't, is written in the male perspective.  This is a nice changein young adult literature.  Tony is a typical boy who lives in a suburb and his life is pretty normal.  That is until his father invents some type of electrical circuit which gets his family extremely rich.  Tony and his family move to a rich, classy neighborhood.  There, he realizes how money changes people.  He also makes a friend who has a terrible shoplifting habit.  Should Tony tell someone?  Tony also is growing up.  The one flaw to the story was the ending.  But, as far as YA fiction goes, it is well-done.	2001-07-21

Finally, an author who knows her books will sell well, but is willing to give a portion of the profit to a great cause.  I was so happy when I found out that some of the profit would go to a good cause that I bought the books right away.  The books are essential necessities for every Potter fan and every reader.  The books five readers a closer look at Rowling's imaginery world.  My favorite was Quidditch Through the ages, because it was so near perfect.  My only complaint was that there were no footnotes or scribbles like in Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.  However, I greatly enjoyed reading about the sport and the &quot;Praise for Quidditch Through the Ages&quot; page.  Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them was enjoyable, too.  But, since I am such a Potter Fanatic, I found that many creatures mentioned in the series were not included.  I also wish both of the books could have been longer...enough to last me until book 5 in November.  Overall, both books are sure to entertain you.	2001-06-12

Although I think this was a great book in terms of children's books, I think L'Engle could have done more with the plot.  The novel is about a girl who has to deal with life's problems.  Her father has put her in a Swiss boarding school so he can paint pictures of children in WWII.  FLip is an outlaw at the boarding school and her only friend is Paul, a French boy she met in the Alps.  Though she is happy with Paul, he is a mysterious character.

I have never read a book so touching and moving ever in my life.  This will be my favorite book until my death.  This book solves all the mysteries of the past books and brings everything to a final conclusion.  There are no more cliff hangers.  All the characters change in this installment, every one of them.  Lyra and Will grow up and all of the worlds depend on what they do.  New and wonderful characters are introduced like the Galivespian spies, mulefa, and Balthamos and Baruch, the angels.  The old characters like Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel make a return.  All the while the war in heaven rages on.  This book will make you cry, laugh, and it will break your heart at the end.  As you read the book, you feel the pain, joy, and sadness of each and every character.  It is as if you are really there with the characters.  The book can truly change your life if you want it to.  Adults will probably start a controversy over certain themes in the book instead of seeing the beauty of it.  There is no need for me to tell you the story, because it is so much better if you experience it yourself.

Frodo is heir to the  ring of power and knows the terrible ringwraiths were searching for him to  steal the ring which would enable the dark lord Sauron to destroy all that  was good in the Middle-Earth.  His journey is full of sights and  adventures, both good and bad.  I would like to journey to the Middle-Earth  after reading this magnificent book.

When I had finally memorized every sentence of every  book including book four, I got sick and went out and bought &quot;The  Hobbit,&quot; and the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy set.  After  reading the splendid and spectacular &quot;Hobbit,&quot; Harry Potter was  forgotten for a while.  The book is the one of the most breath taking books  I have ever read in my entire life.  It is about a creature called  a  hobbit.  The hobbits are a little people, smaller than dwarves, and were a  peaceful and lovable people.  &quot;The Hobbit&quot; concerns a hobbit  called Bilbo Baggins who embarks on many adventures when a band of homeless  dwarves turn up at his hobbit-hole  with the famous wizard Gandalf.  The  dwarves are in search of the east where the dragon Smaug took their gold  and ruined their city.  They go on so many adventures, it is hard to count.

The book is about a girl named Lyra who live in Jordan College with old and  wise scholars in Oxford, England.  We soon learn that this is not the same  Oxford as ours.  Animal daemons, or the human's spirit, follow the human  around.  Lyra's daemon is called Pantamalion or Pan.  Lyra has a carefree  life, most of the time going to the rooftops with her friend Roger, the  kitchen boy.  She enjoys throwing plums from the roof toward the scholar's  heads, hooting like an owl when various tutoriols are going on in the  college, and challenging other children to wars and such, most of them  being the children of gyptians.  But then her amazing and carefree life  turns upside down.  Her uncle, the Lord Asriel, a powerful figure in their  world, shows the scholars slides with Dust and a severed child, and Lyra  just happens to be there.  Reports of missing children grow larger and  larger.  Lyra is taken to Mrs. Coulter, a beautiful lady who is not what  she seems to be.  Lyra runs away and goes on a voyage to the north to  rescue the children on a Gyptian ship.  Will she find them?  I recommend  this book to anybody over 8.

At age one she can write her name.  At three she can  read perfectly.  But, while most parents would be proud of this, Matilda's  parents treat her like dirt.  She would rather read than sit around the  television.  Matilda is sent off to school and finally is appreciated in  her class.  But there is a problem at school.  The Trunchbull is the  headmaster and throws children, puts them in cupboards full of nails, and  claims she was never a child.  Matilda discovers she has magic powers and  will try her best to get rid of the Trunchbull.	2000-07-05

I tried to avoid buying it until November, but then I had to see what all the hype was about.   I read the first book and I probably read it eight times by now.  Then I read the third book and it is way beyond five stars.   If you think your money might be wasted you are very wrong.  You will enjoy  this book so much, you'll think it was the most expensive in the world.   The one thing I noticed was different from other  children's books was that  its plot was different from any other book I have read in my life, and I've  probably read at least a thousand.  normal children's books are either a  mystery a person solves or something happens in the end to make you put it  down.  Harry Potter boks are different because they leave you hanging for  more.     You will savor the thought of reading the unreleased book, and if  you read it on a weekend, you will not do any of your chores.  You will  just curl up with the book and read it until midnight.  at times I found  myself getting up early to read the book over and over.  i hope you make  the right decision and buy this book.	2000-01-26
