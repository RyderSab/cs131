And do you wonder what it would be like if you were this boy and then all of a sudden the coffee shop you are in gets held up in a robbery and you suddenly become a hostage? This book will show you just how much of a weapon of self-destruction a mind can be. This book is very unique and is absolutely wonderful.

Taking place in probably the medieval times this is the story of Marnie, a 16 year old peasant girl who has just been married to a lord who's twice the age of herself and is a drunk. Marnie is unhappy with her marriage because she didn't marry for love but for the land her father lives on. Her father was an overseer for the lord of the land and when he had a stroke the nice land and home they lived in was going to be given away unless Marnie married the lord. So she did. After two days of living hell (Marnie's marriage) Marnie's husband dies and she cant help feeling a twinge of relief for she does not have to spend the rest of her life unhappily married to a retch of a man. After her husband's death Marnie soon befriends a `possessed' young man whom she later finds out isn't possessed but a warm hearted deaf boy that has no way of communication. So she learns to talk to him with a sceries of hand words. The village called this wild boy Raver for he raved but Marnie calls him Raven because it suits him better. Marnie and Raven become the best of friends. But the villagers become suspicious about this friendship and Ravens new found gentleness and they suspect witchcraft. And I'll leave the rest for you to read about because it is such an awesome book. This book shows how in the end the power of friendship prevails above all.	2005-09-11

This doesn't go to well with the school (duh) and because there was no evidence he was going to do this he gets suspended for three days. But then Ursala Riggs (aka Big Ursala, Ugly Girl - in my opinion is cool) comes to the rescue and gets Mat out of suspension (she heard what mat actually said that got misinterpreted as a bomb threat). When Mat comes back to school he is life isn't what it used to be. He gets ostracized for the mishap and no one is his friend. Then Ursala comes back into his life and (because she is also a outcast) become friends. Full of twists and turns this is a thoroughly entertaining story.	2005-07-08

Each teen has there own short story and they (the short stories) all fit together and let the plot unfold. This book deals with tough issues many teens deal with today (i.e. sex, drugs, abuse, self-mutilation rape ect.) and it shows how these teens face each of these problems. This is I must say one of my all time favorite stories because it shows how life is for a lot of people and how some cope with these situations. I think this book is great for EVERYONE over the age of 11 because of some of the content. One of the best novels I've read this year.	2005-06-28
