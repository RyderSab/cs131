Only she happens to have a friend who became president of the United States and her business became handling his affairs and advising his administration.  Moreover, she had to perform her duties through one of the most embattled elections in presidential history and through the first attack on American shores since Pearl Harbor - and do it all while still maintaining a working relationship with her husband and son!<br /><br />A master of communication, Karen Hughes weaves an exciting tale of her life from journalism student to trusted aide of the most powerful man in the world.  The first chapter of \\"Ten Minutes From Normal\\" (a phrase which Hughes plucked from a train conductor on a long train ride during the campaign) summarizes her tug-of-war with career and family and why she left what many would consider a dream job in order to move back to Texas with her family and live a normal life.  The first chapter quickly flashes back to the roots of the author's childhood, replete with a number of stories that helped shape her early life.  We then learn of Hughes's developing interest in journalism, her crossover from television news to chairwoman of the Texas Republican Party, and eventually, her first meeting with George W. Bush.<br /><br />Hughes goes into great detail in recounting her first meeting with the man who would one day be president.  Her affection and loyalty for Bush is evident to even the most disinterested reader, reinforcing the pain of her decision to leave the president in the midst of war for the best interests of her family.<br /><br />\\"Ten Minutes From Normal\\" lacks the knock-down, drag-`em out partisan bickering and commentary typical of most books put out by today's political figures.  What it does give the reader is something far better (and a more lasting contribution to the literary world) - a complete, behind-the-scenes look at American politics.  Hughes lets the reader into her world, a world where politics is real, decisions cost lives, and war is real.

This book, along with author's daily radio program, literally launched a revolution - touching everything from the composition of Congress in 1994 to the resurrection of AM talk radio.<br />Unlike his second book, &quot;See, I Told You So&quot;, which deals in great part with the infant Clinton administration and the current events of the early 1990's, &quot;The Way Things Ought To Be&quot; is just what its title suggests - a point-by-point analysis of what ails America.  The first four chapters of the book tackle Rush's personal road to success, the birth of his nationally-syndicated radio show, and the groundswell of popular support that rose up to embrace it.<br />The remainder of the book deals with timeless issues such as abortion, defending the 1980's (and specifically Ronald Reagan's record), AIDS, congressional malfeasance, animal rights, radical environmentalism, multiculturalism, feminism, the homeless, and Hollywood elitists.  For the most part, all of these issues are at the forefront of the national debate to this day, making &quot;The Way Things Ought To Be&quot; as relevant for our time as when it was first published.<br />Concluding his book, Rush inserts a special chapter titled \\"Ronald Reagan: Setting Things Straight\\".  Here, he tells the true story of the 1980's and the Reagan presidency, one you will never hear from your friends in the mainstream media.  The book ends with an optimistic look at where the nation is headed, as well as section titled &quot;The Limbaugh Lexicon&quot; that acts as a dictionary for people unfamiliar with the show and its unique vocabulary.  In short, the Maha Rushie (in collaboration with Bo Snerdley) writes a book certain to leave feminazis and environmentalist wackos across the Fruited Plain on the near brink of assuming room temperature as they read statements that are documented to be almost always right; 97.9 percent of the time!<br />If you love The Rush Limbaugh Show, this book is a treasured classic.  If you've never heard the show, then this book may well be the method by which you are drawn in.  So be warned...

The stories he tells reveal life lessons that anyone can implement in his own life, and they provide the reader with personal inspiration in addition to entertainment value.  According to Rush, the American Dream is still alive...  To achieve your dreams you only need passion, hard work, and the pursuit of excellence...  Too often these ideals are lost in the everyday bickering of political life, and by injecting them back into the national debate, Rush Limbaugh brings a bit of Jimmy Stewart back into the political landscape.<br />As he did in his first book, Rush then moves into a full-fledged examination of the American culture war, highlighting the liberal bias of school textbooks, the degradation of traditional values, and the dumbing-down of America.  As always the book is filled with tidbits of humor, written in a witty style unique to the author and pleasing to the reader.  Other aspects of the book assess the then future Clinton presidency and Rush's opinions on how such an administration would govern.  These chapters seem almost prophetic in nature following the aftermath of an administration bereft with corruption and scandal (and a president that was impeached, just as Rush predicted)...<br />Overall, if you enjoy The Rush Limbaugh Show, then you'll love \\"See, I Told You So\\".

A nationally syndicated columnist and bestselling author of two books, David Limbaugh performs the duties the mainstream media used to perform decades ago with his page-turning expose \\"Absolute Power: The Legacy of Corruption in the Clinton-Reno Justice Department\\".  Few non-fiction books in the past ten years have held me captive like this one.<br /><br />During the 1992 campaign, and throughout the Clinton presidency, Americans heard reports of various Clinton administration improprieties.  Sometimes, as was the case with Monica Lewinsky, we actually witnessed the scandals unfold.  But rarely would the mainstream media afford the public more than a cursory overview of such activities.  Simply put, David Limbaugh does the job the mainstream media should have.<br /><br />With chapters that run the gambit on such topics as Waco, the Tobacco Wars, Billy Dale and The White House Travel Office, Monica Lewinsky, presidential pardons to benefit Hillary's Senate campaign, and Elian Gonzalez, Absolute Power is one of the premiere historical records cataloguing the innumerable scandals that plagued Bill Clinton's presidency.  Surprisingly, readers will find little commentary.  I can find no instance of the author offering his own opinion.  Instead, his book reads like a newspaper description of a public event (or at least in the days before liberal media bias).  The book contains extensive footnotes and source references, quoting FBI agents and high-ranking officials on the record by name, rather than by quoting \\"anonymous sources\\"...<br /><br />The result is a genuine breath of fresh air.  I was fifteen when the storming of the Waco compound took place.  Yet despite the abundance of media coverage, I knew few details regarding the incident itself and the people surrounding it before reading this book.  David Limbaugh fills in the details about the life of David Koresh, the history of Waco, and all of the other topics previously listed in a way the major media outlets have failed to do since those events occurred.<br /><br />Readers of Absolute Power will be left breathless by its vivid illustration of a presidential administration willing to use the courts and agents of federal law enforcement to achieve its own political ends.  Had David Limbaugh published this book just one year earlier, no American would have been surprised by Al Gore's attempts to circumvent election law in Florida.  Although, optimist that I am, I'd like to believe that had this book been published one year earlier, the 2000 presidential election would not have been so close...<br /><br />Britt Gillette<br />Author of \\"The Dittohead's Guide To Adult Beverages\\"events occurred.

Now, his bestselling book \\"Arrogance\\" catalogues the outright contempt and condescension he encountered from the media elites he criticized.  His account is simply astonishing in nature.<br /><br />Rather than make a concerted effort to address an obvious problem within their ranks, the major newspapers and news networks in America impugn the reputations of, fire, and outright ignore those who buck the system.  In an industry where employees take pride in their willingness to shake the status quo, to uncover \\"the big story\\" - journalists are ignoring one of the biggest stories in American history - a blatant media bias within their own ranks.<br /><br />Now despite what some may say, Goldberg does not assert that media bias is the outcome of some grand conspiracy.  Instead, it is the natural state of being for a clique of elite media journalists who all reside in the same neighborhoods, walk the same halls at work, attend the same cocktail parties, and live within the same isolated \\"media-sphere\\".  What we have is an enormous case of \\"group think\\" at work.  Although quite unlike the widget industry, the media's business is truth, and Goldberg (as well as millions of American viewers) are convinced the media is selling an inferior product.  That's why CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC and others are watching their ratings plummet, while FoxNews (the \\"fair and balanced\\" network) is climbing to new ratings highs every month.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Goldberg recounts a number of personal instances where bias or outright ignorance permeated the media community.  The best part of \\"Arrogance\\" is the conclusion, where the author lays out a \\"Twelve Step program\\" (much like one for a recovering alcoholic) that will enable the media to rid itself of its liberal bias once and for all.  Goldberg suggests intellectual and political diversity be implemented into hiring practices alongside the longstanding policies of racial and gender diversity.  My favorite suggestion of all is to move the news headquarters of CBS, NBC, or ABC to one of these five locations:<br /><br />1. Tupelo, Mississippi<br />2. Mitchell, South Dakota<br />3. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma<br />4. Indianapolis, Indiana<br />5. Laughlin, Nevada<br /><br />I can just see the media elite cringe!  Maybe one day I'll own a major news network.

Written by conservative commentator Ann Coulter, \\"Slander\\" showcases the author's quick wit and endless passion for politics in the best conservative book since Rush Limbaugh's \\"See, I Told You So\\".  The focus of \\"Slander\\", Coulter's second book, is mainstream liberalism - its missteps, half-truths, and outright slanders.  Coulter presents her case in a well-reasoned, concisely written treatise that will leave its reader wanting for more.<br /><br />Inside-the-beltway politicos and talk radio junkies will find that this book reads fast.  If you read it while you're walking, you're certain to smash face-first into a wall...  \\"Slander\\" tackles a number of subjects within the realm of conservative-liberal politics.  The left-wing media assault on the Fox News Channel and the \\"religious right\\" are two such examples.  Coulter exposes the myth of the \\"religious right\\" with a barrage of facts and footnotes, proving that if such a group exists at all, its numbers are miniscule at best.<br /><br />The most interesting claim Coulter makes is that liberals don't read, at least not as much as conservatives...  She points out that almost half of all the bookstores in the United States are Christian bookstores (a group that is often maligned as intellectually bankrupt).  She also points out that while one conservative book after another climbs the New York Times bestseller list, only two liberal books of the last five years are worthy of note:  \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\" by Al Franken and \\"Stupid White Men\\" by Michael Moore.  Incidentally, both books contain ad hominem attacks in their titles, illustrating her point that modern liberalism is intellectually bankrupt, and thus, must resort to name-calling and distortions of the truth in order to survive.<br /><br />Whether you like Republicans or Democrats, one thing is certain - you'll love turning the pages of Ann Coulter's \\"Slander\\".

One of the most telling books of the last decade, Bernard Goldberg's \\"Bias\\" answers one of the most important questions of the last several decades:  Does the mainstream media harbor a liberal bias?  Goldberg's answer is yes.  Is that liberal bias a well-planned conspiracy?  Absolutely not.<br /><br />As a thirty-year veteran of CBS news and the recipient of multiple accolades in his field, Bernard Goldberg is certainly in a position to know.  The newsman's thesis is simple:  members of the mainstream media congregate together, they attend the same parties, they stick to the same business circles.  They also tend to harbor a liberal political view, and since differing viewpoints rarely enter into their social circles, when members of the media are confronted with a conservative viewpoint it seems far-right radical and off-the-wall.  Goldberg's position makes perfect sense, and he backs up his claims with a number of personal anecdotes, behind-the-scenes stories, and personal research.<br /><br />Goldberg exposes the method by which the mainstream media skews public perception.  An example he uses is a CBS report by Eric Engberg on February 8, 1996.  Engberg hosted a segment on the evening news titled \\"Reality Check\\" with presidential candidate Steve Forbes as its subject.  The reporter began his segment, \\"Steve Forbes pitches his flat-tax scheme as an economic elixir, good for everything that ails us.\\"  Scheme?  Elixir?  Goldberg goes on to cite the remainder of the report, \\"Then Engberg interviewed three different tax experts.  Every single one of them opposed the flat tax.  Every single one!\\"  He explains that Milton Friedman and Merton Miller, both Nobel Prize winners in economics liked Forbes' flat tax idea, but neither was mentioned in the report.  And Goldberg explains that if Ted Kennedy or Hillary Clinton had come up with a similar flat tax idea, there is NO chance it would have been aired with the same slant and contemptuous tone.<br /><br />If you haven't believed the claims that the mainstream television networks harbor a liberal bias, or if you've never even heard the accusation, then you should definitely read Bernard Goldberg's eye-opening expose \\"Bias\\".  It will change the way you look at the evening news!<br /><br />Britt Gillette<br />Author of \\"The Dittohead's Guide To Adult Beverages\\"at the mainstream television networks harbor a liberal bias, or if you've never even heard the accusation, then you should definitely read Bernard Goldberg's eye-opening expose \\"Bias\\".

As a writer with a marketing background, the first aspect of this book that came to my attention was its title.  Simplistic and to the point, the pages inside are even better.  Because \\"The First Five Pages\\" doesn't tell you how to write a book, but what design elements will make it sell...<br />As a successful literary agent, Noah Lukeman is more than qualified to address the subject of salable manuscripts, and \\"The First Five Pages\\" should be required reading for every writer, both hobbyist and New York Times best-seller alike.  Lukeman's approach is far different from other books in the category because he never tells his reader how to write a great book, or even a good book.  Rather, his purpose is to provide a roadmap for \\"staying out the rejection pile\\".  And by following his guidelines for avoiding the \\"slush pile\\", writers will find that, as a result, their work improves.<br />Although much of what the book reveals can be found in other books, \\"The First Five Pages\\" puts important concepts into easy-to-read language.  And it hammers those concepts into your mind over and over again.  Lukeman explores the use of adjectives and adverbs, unnecessary words, commonplace dialogue, and the ever important \\"showing versus telling\\".  The book is broken down into nineteen chapters, each of which addresses a fundamental characteristic of the type of manuscript he, as an agent, is looking for.  Moreover, his emphasis on \\"the first five pages\\" drives home the concept that every word must be precise, in its proper place, and every sentence should be the best it can be.  If a reader isn't engaged by the fifth page, it doesn't matter how great the rest of your book is.  You must hook the reader, and keep them hooked, which means crafting each word so as to create the best possible manuscript.<br />It's this insight into the selection process of prospective agents that gives \\"The First Five Pages\\" its true value.  If Lukeman uses certain criteria to make a summary judgement of a manuscript, you can bet his peers do as well.  This book will help you figure out what those guidelines are, and how to adjust your manuscript with an eye toward impressing those agents.<br />I've read this book several times, and I recommend it to others.

The first Poet Laureate of the United States, Robert Penn Warren created his life-long masterpiece with \\"All The King's Men\\" (1946).  Drawing upon his first-hand experience in Europe as Germany and Italy invaded their neighbors and Spain fought a bloody civil war, the author makes his best attempt to showcase the ill effects of demagoguery and the fine line Americans tread between freedom and totalitarianism.<br />Set in the 1930s, \\"All The King's Men\\" follows the exploits of Willie Stark - a master politician and an expert in class warfare and corruption, who transforms from an idealistic man of the people into a creature driven by an insatiable lust for power.  Readers would do well to learn more about the life story of Huey \\"Kingfish\\" Long of Louisiana.  In the depths of the depression, he managed to become Governor and Senator of Louisiana (at the same time!!!), and he built a private army that rivaled the state militia and the national guard.  Effectively, he became dictator of Louisiana before his assassination cut short his ambitions.  With his eye on the White House, Long posed a true threat to FDR and the American republic, and his life serves as much of the basis for Warren's novel.<br />\\"All The King's Men\\" is viewed through the eyes of Jack Burden, one of Stark's aides - a man still possessed of idealism, but paralyzed from action.  From an insider's point-of-view, the reader witnesses the rise and fall of Louisiana's \\"man of the people\\".<br />It has been said that \\"imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\\".  If so, \\"All The King's Men\\" should be red in the face.  The book's themes and ideas have been mimicked numerous times, most recently in 1996's best-selling novel \\"Primary Colors\\", a roman a clef with Jack Stanton (Bill Clinton) in place of Willie Stark (Huey Long).  One of the finest novels of the last century, lovers of literature can't afford to miss \\"All The King's Men\\".<br />Britt Gillette	2003-07-12

If you're one of those people wishing to sell or promote a product, Malcolm Gladwell's &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; is a great place to start.  True marketing begins by identifying one's target audience and then tailoring the product's design to meet that core audience's expectations.  &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; examines in-depth the aspects that make &quot;viral marketing&quot; or word-of-mouth epidemics explode.  The number-one method of product promotion is word-of-mouth, and it's free.  People listen to their friends, so this is an important book with concepts marketing professionals need to master.<br />Throughout his book, Gladwell analyzes certain principles that all epidemics have in common.  In chapter two, he focuses on three powerful groups of people: Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen.  Reaching these groups effectively is essential for any grass-roots campaign, whether you're selling a political candidate or computer software.  In addition, the book gives an overview of &quot;stickiness&quot; and the imminent role it plays in successful marketing plans.<br />Small business owners, CEOs, door-to-door salesmen, and artists will find &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; to be one of the best book purchases they've ever made.

In his book \\"Diplomacy\\", Henry Kissinger makes a valiant effort to study the history of international relations.  This in-depth and voluminous book delves into the past, giving a chronological account of the major events that shaped Western diplomacy.  Kissinger covers Richelieu, William of Orange, and follows the exploits of revolutionaries Napoleon III and Bismark.  An entire chapter is devoted to Realpolitik.<br />The downfall of this book is its weak conclusion.  Kissinger only gives a brief overview of the future threats facing America, and for a pre-September 11th book (1996), it offers little in regard to militant Islam and its dangers.  However, the book is valuable in its descriptions of modern diplomacy, especially World War II and the Cold War.  For students of the international realm, this is essential reading.

Written by Mary Buffett, former daughter-in-law of Warren Buffett, and David Clark, a portfolio manager, &quot;The Buffettology Workbook&quot; is the best investment I've ever made.  The financial formulas you'll find in this book are all the ones they should teach in business school, but don't.<br />The book is broken down into 23 chapters, each no more than a few pages, so you can read a chapter a day (and continue to review the chapters for the rest of your investing career).  The first seven chapters give a breakdown of Warren's investment philosophy, value investing.  Here, you learn about the short-sightedness of the market and the bad news phenomenon.  Also, the authors identify the difference between commodity-type businesses and consumer monopolies, and tell you why it's far better to own consumer monopolies.  Once you understand these concepts, you're halfway toward success as an investor.  Now, you need to learn how to identify the correct buying opportunity.  That's where the true value of this book comes into play, offering formulas and equations you won't find most books.<br />The remaining chapters in the book focus on the examination of financial statements, the acquisition of pertinent information (what's important and what's not), then they tell you how determine an investment's desirability.  You'll learn the value of high rates of return on shareholder equity, how to measure management's ability to utilize retained earnings, and Warren's ideas for the Internet and short-term arbitrage commitments.<br />I read this book beginning to end the day I got it, but I'll continue to familiarize myself with its formulas for the rest of my investing career.  Although it marks only the beginning of one's investment knowledge, learning these bedrock principles are what separate successful investors from mere average ones...

Hal Lindsey's \\"The Late Great Planet Earth\\" is truly a landmark work, having sold tens of millions of copies since its original publication over thirty years ago.  Lindsey articulates a clear and concise roadmap for where the world is heading, using Old and New Testament Bible prophecies as the strength of his argument.  The central belief put forth by Lindsey is that Jesus Christ is returning to earth soon, probably in this generation, and the Bible clearly states that certain events will foreshadow the Second Coming.  First among these is the rebirth of Israel as a nation-state, an event predicted long ago by the Old Testament prophets.  Jesus himself pointed this out as the seminal sign that his return was very near when he said, \\"Now learn a lesson from the fig tree.  When its buds become tender and its leaves begin to sprout, you know without being told that summer is near.  Just so, when you see the events I've described beginning to happen, you can know his return is very near, right at the door.\\" (Matthew 24:32-33).  Throughout the Bible, the nation of Israel is often referred to symbolically as a fig tree.<br />Lindsey's argument is straightforward.  The prophets of the Bible predicted the rebirth of Israel in a single day.  It happened (14 May 1948).  The same prophets predicted Israel would again possess Jerusalem.  That also happened (June 1967).  So it makes sense to explore the other assertions made by those same prophets, such as the establishment of a Third Jewish Temple and the ascendance of a powerful individual who will shortly thereafter \\"rule over every tribe and people and language and nation\\" on the earth (Revelation 13:7).  Lindsey explores the personality of this man, traditionally identified as the Antichrist, and also delves into prophecies of predicted political alliances and major end-times events.<br />Overall, this is a great book - although some of the more speculative parts are quite dated.  My version is from 1993, and I don't know if the book has been revised, but the speculative parts and statistics from the early 1970's are few and far in between.  Most of the book focuses on scriptural prophecy, only commenting to inject clear references to the Biblical meaning of words and phrases.  \\"The Late Great Planet Earth\\" is one of the best starting points for those who wish to learn more about what the Bible has to say about humanity's future, and I highly recommend it to students of Bible prophecy.<br />Britt Gillette<br />...w if the book has been revised, but the speculative parts and statistics from the early 1970's are few and far in between.

With \\"The Warren Buffett Way\\", Robert Hagstrom attempts to bring the financial genius of the world's greatest investor within reach of the average man on the street.  The book is a good overview of Buffett's career, outlining the types of companies he looks for, the calculations he uses to determine a company's value, and the type of earnings history he looks for in an investment.  These are basic principles that need to be hammered home to even the most seasoned of investors, and the book serves as a good primer for that reason.  I have bought it as a gift on more than one occasion.  (Although the \\"Buffettology\\" workbook is better.)<br />However, I give the book four stars for the following reason: hindsight is twenty-twenty.  Hagstrom seems to believe that returns comparable to Buffett's are attainable to the average investor.  But the average investor knows little about interpreting financial statements and little credit is given to Buffett's instincts and ability to see opportunity where others do not.  Although it is well within the reach of the average investor to achieve above-average returns, this book should be viewed as a first step in that goal.  There is still much to learn.  I recommend this book solely for its emphasis on investment in companies with consumer-monopoly products, strong earnings histories, etc.  The book helps reinforce the fundamentals of common stock investing, but I like Hagstrom's book \\"The Warren Buffett Portfolio\\" much better...<br />Britt Gillette<br />...	2003-07-04

As the former editor of numerous best-selling books, and the author of best-selling books himself, Sol Stein is more than qualified to offer his advice, and his readers would do well to heed that advice.<br /><br />Whether a beginning novelist or a New York Time's best-selling author, \\"How To Grow A Novel\\" has much to offer.

Stein also gives his thoughts on common mistakes made by writers, including those made during the revision process.<br /><br />But the true value of this book stems from its emphasis on the fundamentals.  Certain elements pertain to all good writing, such as the effort to use no unnecessary words.  Stein stresses those elements, and if applied, they will make fair writers good and good writers great.

LaHaye and Jenkins' \\"Are We Living in the End Times?\\" directly confronts world events and comments on biblical prophecies made thousands of years ago that clearly mirror many of those events.  Written in layman's terms, with a flowing style and chronology, this is a book interested readers can burn through in a couple of hours.  Breaking down the events of The Great Tribulation, the book reads like the non-fiction version of the authors' popular fiction series \\"Left Behind\\".<br />The book is divided into three parts: context, events, and personalities.  The opening chapters explore the context of current events in relation to Biblical prophecy, while providing a background on the unfailing accuracy of Old and New Testament prophets in their predictions.  The second part catalogues the many events of the Tribulation, starting with the coalition of invading forces against Israel and the Rapture, and ending with the last rebellion against God.  The third and final part of the book analyzes the personalities of the age - Satan, the Antichrist, the False Prophet, the Two Witnesses, and the Tribulation Saints and Martyrs.<br />Every student of end-times Bible prophesy, whether a novice or the most seasoned of scholars, will find some merit in reading this book.  Exciting and informative, it will open your eyes to the realities confronting our generation and present new and innovative ways of viewing God and the world in which we live.  If seeing Israel in the news night after night has peaked your interest, read this book and learn more about why such events are not coincidence, but rather part of a divine plan.<br />Britt Gillette<br />...	2003-07-04

Grant Jeffrey's \\"The Signature of God\\" sets out to prove that the Bible is the inspired word of God, passed down through the generations by the writings of Old and New Testament prophets.  The majority of open-minded readers will agree that he succeeds.<br />\\"The Signature of God\\" attempts to prove the Bible as God's word by building a foundation of arguments based on historical documents, archeological discoveries, scientific knowledge, fulfillment of Bible prophecy, and other such evidences.  Those who are not Christian or Jewish (and many of those who are) will find a tremendous amount of information they either didn't know or never before viewed in the way Jeffrey presents.  The author explores the advanced medical knowledge set down in the Torah, where God instructs the Jewish people to undertake certain precautions in dealing with sick people, dead animals, and other sources of infectious disease.  Long before modern science uncovered bacteria and virus, God gave the Jewish nation a means to avoid them.<br />The book also delves into the Bible codes, without citing many of the speculative and statistically insignificant ones espoused by \\"Bible Code\\" author Michael Drosnin.  Recently, many academic institutions have been exploring these \\"codes\\", equidistant letter sequences in the text of the Old Testament books that make up the Torah.  Jeffrey points out many of these codes, such as the name \\"Yeshua\\" (translated \\"Jesus\\") appearing an ordinate and statistically significant number of times within the Old Testament.  In addition, Jeffrey devotes a chapter to the subject of mathematics and the Bible, a subject rarely touched on in modern literature.  He catalogues the work of Ivan Panin, a Harvard mathematician who uncovered a series of alphanumeric codes in the Bible (over 30 separate codes involving the number 7 alone in the first sentence of the Bible)!<br />Jeffrey quite adeptly weaves his arguments together into a cohesive and formidable argument on behalf of divine authorship of the Bible, and this is a book both believers and non-believers in God will enjoy perusing.

Despite a massive assault by its critics, &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; is a truly revolutionary work, and Eric Drexler should be commended for launching a worldwide discussion on the topic of molecular manufacturing, or molecular nanotechnology (MNT), as some refer to it.  First of all, this is a book that needs to be updated (the opening chapters deal in-depth with protein design and a later chapter tries to paint a picture of a future network of information known as &quot;the Internet&quot;).  But the remainder of the book is timeless.<br />The true merit of &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; comes not from the argument of whether or not manipulation of individual molecules is possible.  We already know that it is.  Our bodies are filled with nature's own molecular machines.  But the true worth of this book stems from its assumption that such technology will develop into a worldwide enterprise and will have enormous consequences for the human experience.  The importance of the examination and study of those consequences cannot be overstated, and Drexler formed the Foresight Institute in an attempt to grapple with many of these issues.  (Although personally, I recommend The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology as the best &quot;think-tank&quot; on MNT's benefits and dangers).<br />The power to thoroughly and inexpensively control the structure of matter will effect every aspect of the human experience, and although it is a worthy endeavor to speculate on the implications for medicine, space exploration, ending poverty, etc., none of these benefits will be realized if we fail to work out a reasonable system of governance in the nanotechnic era.  The development of molecular manufacturing will lead to the creation of new weapons of destructive power, possibly give rise to demagogues, and provide the conditions necessary to precipitate a dangerous, and possibly world-threatening, arms race between competing nanotechnic nation-states.  Although we have faced these concerns since the dawn of the Nuclear Age, it remains unclear as to whether or not the same principles of mutually assured destruction will apply.  &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; sparks the debate on how we will deal with the new problems that arise from man's ability to manipulate molecules, and in doing so, it provides an invaluable service to the human race.<br />Those concerned about our future and the world in which we live should read this book, because molecular manufacturing will define that future world...<br />Britt Gillette<br />Author of the nanotechnology thriller &quot;Conquest of Paradise&quot;cerns since the dawn of the Nuclear Age, it remains unclear as to whether or not the same principles of mutually assured destruction will apply.  &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; sparks the debate on how we will deal with the new problems that arise from man's ability to manipulate molecules, and in doing so, it provides an invaluable service to the human race.<br />Those concerned about our future and the world in which we live should read this book, because molecular manufacturing will define that future world... <br />Britt Gillette<BR>Author of the nanotechnology thriller &quot;Conquest of Paradise&quot;	2003-07-03

(Both of which are written in layman's terms and are good books themselves).<br />&quot;Revelation Unveiled&quot; chronologically examines the Bible's most enigmatic book from the Epistles to the Seven Churches on through the Great Tribulation and on to the New Millennium.  Along the way, LaHaye dissects specific passages, unraveling some of the difficulty for those of us who lack his thorough theological background.  I found this book indispensable to my increased understanding of this last and important book in the Bible.  This is a book definitely worth the reader's time and interest.<br />Britt Gillette<BR>Author of &quot;Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller&quot;	2003-07-03

In \\"The Warren Buffett Portfolio\\", author Robert Hagstrom devotes an entire book to debunking the greatest misconception prevalent in the investment world today: the myth of \\"diversification\\".  Hagstrom sets out to prove that Mark Twain was a market wizard when he said \\"put all of your eggs in one basket, and guard the hell out of that basket!\\"<br />The heart of this book rests on the premise that a proper portfolio must be \\"diverse\\" (i.e. must include 40 to 100 different companies) in order to remain \\"safe\\" and avoid a loss of capital.  However, while such a notion may decrease short-term volatility, it does not necessarily increase returns.  Hagstrom examines investment guru Warren Buffett's ideas on the subject, such as \\"knowledge decreases risk, not the number of stocks in your portfolio\\".  Such an approach makes sense.  Which is better, to own a few companies that you know everything about, or a lot of companies that you know little or nothing about?  The less you know about a company, the more likely it is that an unforeseen event will sneak up on you and hammer your portfolio.<br />The book also addresses the fallacy of \\"re-balancing a portfolio\\".  Again, Warren asks, why are you selling off your best company to buy a bunch of under-performing companies?  Such a line of thinking is akin to saying \\"Michael Jordan takes too many shots and makes too much money relative to the other players on his team, so he should be traded to another team for three players so as to decrease the risk of an injury hurting the team...  or we should give more shot opportunities to players of lesser talent so that the team doesn't become dependent on Michael Jordan to win.\\"  Nobody ever won an NBA Championship with run-of-the-mill players, but the Bulls won six NBA titles by relying on Michael Jordan.<br />It's this stalwart advance in the face of conventional wisdom that separates this book from most in the stock investment genre.  Give it a try.

LaHaye and Jenkins' \\"Are We Living in the End Times?\\" directly confronts world events and comments on biblical prophecies made thousands of years ago that clearly mirror many of those events.  Written in layman's terms, with a flowing style and chronology, this is a book interested readers can burn through in a couple of hours.  Breaking down the events of The Great Tribulation, the book reads like the non-fiction version of the authors' popular fiction series \\"Left Behind\\".<br />The book is divided into three parts: context, events, and personalities.  The opening chapters explore the context of current events in relation to Biblical prophecy, while providing a background on the unfailing accuracy of Old and New Testament prophets in their predictions.  The second part catalogues the many events of the Tribulation, starting with the coalition of invading forces against Israel and the Rapture, and ending with the last rebellion against God.  The third and final part of the book analyzes the personalities of the age - Satan, the Antichrist, the False Prophet, the Two Witnesses, and the Tribulation Saints and Martyrs.<br />Every student of end-times Bible prophesy, whether a novice or the most seasoned of scholars, will find some merit in reading this book.  Exciting and informative, it will open your eyes to the realities confronting our generation and present new and innovative ways of viewing God and the world in which we live.  If seeing Israel in the news night after night has peaked your interest, read this book and learn more about why such events are not coincidence, but rather part of a divine plan.<br />Britt Gillette<BR>Author of \\"Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller\\"	2003-07-03

Hal Lindsey's \\"The Late Great Planet Earth\\" is truly a landmark work, having sold tens of millions of copies since its original publication over thirty years ago.  Lindsey articulates a clear and concise roadmap for where the world is heading, using Old and New Testament Bible prophecies as the strength of his argument.  The central belief put forth by Lindsey is that Jesus Christ is returning to earth soon, probably in this generation, and the Bible clearly states that certain events will foreshadow the Second Coming.  First among these is the rebirth of Israel as a nation-state, an event predicted long ago by the Old Testament prophets.  Jesus himself pointed this out as the seminal sign that his return was very near when he said, \\"Now learn a lesson from the fig tree.  When its buds become tender and its leaves begin to sprout, you know without being told that summer is near.  Just so, when you see the events I've described beginning to happen, you can know his return is very near, right at the door.\\" (Matthew 24:32-33).  Throughout the Bible, the nation of Israel is often referred to symbolically as a fig tree.<br />Lindsey's argument is straightforward.  The prophets of the Bible predicted the rebirth of Israel in a single day.  It happened (14 May 1948).  The same prophets predicted Israel would again possess Jerusalem.  That also happened (June 1967).  So it makes sense to explore the other assertions made by those same prophets, such as the establishment of a Third Jewish Temple and the ascendance of a powerful individual who will shortly thereafter \\"rule over every tribe and people and language and nation\\" on the earth (Revelation 13:7).  Lindsey explores the personality of this man, traditionally identified as the Antichrist, and also delves into prophecies of predicted political alliances and major end-times events.  <br />Overall, this is a great book - although some of the more speculative parts are quite dated.  My version is from 1993, and I don't know if the book has been revised, but the speculative parts and statistics from the early 1970's are few and far in between.  Most of the book focuses on scriptural prophecy, only commenting to inject clear references to the Biblical meaning of words and phrases.  \\"The Late Great Planet Earth\\" is one of the best starting points for those who wish to learn more about what the Bible has to say about humanity's future, and I highly recommend it to students of Bible prophecy.<br />Britt Gillette<BR>Author of \\"Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller\\"	2003-07-02

I first read Josh McDowell's &quot;More Than A Carpenter&quot; when I was a freshman in college.  Someone had given me the book, and although I was already a committed Christian, it literally blew me away with the simultaneous simplicity and depth of its arguments on behalf of Jesus Christ.  Like a prosecutor laying out his case, McDowell presents a series of facts about Jesus of Nazareth and attempts to uncover the truth about his life.  Jesus claimed to be God himself.  So either Jesus was a liar, a lunatic, or the Lord.<br />McDowell performs brilliantly in putting forward his case that Jesus was and is Lord.  Few books better illustrate that believing in Christ is NOT a matter of &quot;blind faith&quot;, but rather part of an intellectual exercise.  Faith is a matter of believing in and trusting in the facts that are presented.  (i.e., Are the words of Jesus trustworthy?)  For most objective readers of McDowell's book, the answer will be a resounding yes...<br />Britt Gillette<br />Author of &quot;Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller&quot;	2003-07-02
