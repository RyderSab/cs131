Easily the best vampire novel written since Dracula, and that's a lot of books. Heck, one of the best horror novels ever written, period. The conclusion to one of the best series (really, the vampire world trilogy is a continuation of the Necroscope trilogy, so you should consider both series as one large series) of books I have ever had the pleasure of reading, and it's well worth every page. There is not one single dull, dry moment in this book. You can read it on its own...but to get the full effect, read the other books (at least the Vampire World trilogy) first. Then be prepared - this book packs one HECK of an emotional wallop!<br />My hat is off to Mr. Lumley. The best book, bar none, I have ever read.	2003-08-31

All three times, I couldn't get into it. This last time, frustrated beyond all get out that I couldn't get into the book, I flipped ahead and read the ending. Wow, glad I didn't waste my time.<br />Basically, nothing of any importance happens for the first 99 percent of the book. I am not exaggerating. Absoulutely NOTHING that has ANYTHING TO DO with what this book promises by the description of the plot on the cover ever happens. Then everything is wrapped up seemingly right out of the blue, leaving the reader feel stupid. This isn't a thriller, nor a mystery, not a political thriller, rather a jumbled mishmash of all three that tries to be complex but ends up cheating the reader. This is an exersise in futility to read, bottom line. The writing is good (if clustered in places), the characters decent, but the plot is just...insulting. Calling this book a mere waste of paper doesn't even do justice. <br />One of the single worst books I have EVER even tried to read. If you liked this book, then good for you. Heck, if you could make yourself read through this five hundred page mess of a novel, you deserve an award for having the patience and tolerance of Job. <br />I hope that I have expressed to you, the reader, what a waste this novel is. Not at all recommended. Unless you're a masochist.	2003-08-02

It's formulaic, the characters are nothing more than cardboard copies of the same characters (beautiful single scientist, Rambo wannabe, man who has GHOSTS IN THE PAST to deal with) that you'd find in most books and movies similar to this. As a matter of fact, the plot and characters rip off a book called Hunter by James Byron Huggins a bit TOO MUCH for my liking. Anyway, if you want a predictable read with chintzy writing and an unbelievably hokey ending, pick this up. For the 95 percent of you that want to read something worth your time, give this a pass.<br />Not recommended.	2003-06-27

This is one of the best novels ever written, bar none. Everything is top notch, the plot (witness how many novels in the nineties and beyond basically steal most if not all of their plots from this book), characters, writing, etc. If a crime novel could be called perfect, this is it. And as with any work of art, the novel will leave a definite impression on you and make you think when you finish it.<br />There's a reason why every book reviewer compares a book's villain(s) to Hannibal Lecter. Read this book and find out why.<br />Highly, VERY HIGHLY, recommended	2003-06-11

First of all, this book has chapters and chapters where things will be meticulously explained and events will happen in lavish detail, then the next section will just pick up after some other events have happened - that we never know about! It's as though someone just cut away pieces of chapters that the reader needs in order to properly follow what's going on. Very, very confusing. I also didn't like the older cop, Gavin - very formulaic. In fact, the plot was pretty formula - nothing really sticks out to seperate this book from dozens of other serial killer novels I've read that are exactly like this. But Strega and Alvarez are good characters overall, and some of the supporting characters are fresh and interesting.<br />My recommendation - pick it up at a library or used book shop and waste a day or two reading it. It's the kind of book you'll read and forget about five minutes later. Mildly recommended	2003-06-10

The ending left everything nice and open and...well then the novel continued for 200 vastly more boring pages. It's like two novels in one, only the first novel is interesting (if disjointed) and the second one is just unbelievably boring. And as usual, the GRAVE DENOUCEMENT at the end that explains it all and shows who the TRUE EVIL of the book is does nothing but make the reader feel cheated - as in you wonder why you even bothered reading the first 180 pages of the novel.<br />Good book up until halfway through, when the second plot kicks in and everything just falls apart. I'd say give it a read as Irene Kelly is pretty interesting. It's a shame the first half of the novel couldn't have been longer and better written (with more emphasis on the killer and his assistant) and the second half could have just been left on the cutting room floor.<br />Eh. Mildly recommended. Just stop after about halfway through to save yourself the dissapointments coming up. And keep a notebook handy so you can keep the plethora of supporting characters straight - too many characters doing too many things weighed this book down heavily.	2003-05-24

I don't care what anyone else says - these books are great, including this one. Know what? Even though it's been a long time since I was a kid, I still love these books, including this one. As a matter of fact, I think anyone who loves vampires and vampire fiction should read this book and the others - because these are all good, quick, and alltogether very FUN reads that you don't have to take seriously. And sometimes, a good quick fun read just hits the spot.<br />And it has to be said - Bunnicula is the most loveable vampire ever. Lestat and Dracula WISH they were this cuddly!	2003-05-20

That word sums up this book entirely, and I need say no more.<br />But I'll give it a shot. To those who say this isn't a vampire novel at all, I question whether you actually read this book. Not only is this a vampire novel, but IMHO one of the best in the genre. The only difference between this and a more 'traditional' vampiric tale is that the vampirism isn't supernatural, rather Dracula is inflicted with the very scary (and very, very real) condition of being a real life vampire - a human who craves blood and has an obsession with death, blood, and the taking blood and life itself. The fact that this vampire novel is in fact grounded in reality makes this work even more horrifying.<br />Again, wow. This book scared me, and I haven't been scared by a novel since I first tried to read IT by Stephen King when I was 12. And like any good novel, not only will it shock and entertain you, but after you read it, it will leave an impression on you, and make you think about how all too real vampirism and the like can be in the real world...<br />My highest recommendation.	2003-05-20

I just don't understand why this book has been garnering all the high marks that everyone's been giving it. This novel, while entertaining at times, is so severly flawed that I wish whomever had edited this book would have taken a bit more time before sending it away to be published. The plot itself has been rehashed before in other reviews, so I won't go into it here save to say that while predictable for the most part, the twists involved make for a compelling story, and the characters (except for the cop) are all interesting.<br />The problem however is twofold. First, the majority of the book is written in alternating chapters detailing the activities of the cop and the killer and his psychologist hostage. Now while this is extremely interesting in theory, it suffers from two major problems (or one huge problem rather) - the sections featuring the cop and his chase of the killer are just not interesting at all, and the character of the cop is bland and uninteresting - nothing more than a Dirty Harry knockoff in my opinion. <br />It's a shame too, because this book really doesn't 'need' the plot with the cop hunting the killer down. The novel would have been just fine, and in fact quite a bit more interesting, if it had fleshed out the killer, his escape, and the growing tension and ordeal the psychologist goes through with the killer. But instead, the author relied on 'formula' characters and predictable plot-twists, and we're left with a book that had so much promise, but in the end was just too disjointed and frustrating to really enjoy.<br />Not really recommended.	2003-05-13

Not as emotionally gripping as earlier books in this series, but a good quick plot that I enjoyed, and Jessica Coran was vastly more interesting in this book than in the previous two Instinct novels. The last hundred and twenty pages fly by, which was a fairly nice surprise. I think my one real quibble with the book (and something I havent' seen mentioned yet) was the guest-starring of Stonecoat and Sanger from Walker's Edge series. That, and the small subplot with the Indian killings in Sioux Falls that Coran and Stonecoat both became involved in, shouldn't have even been written about and frankly took a bit away from the main story of this book, which would have been fine on its own if lengthened just a bit.<br />Overall though, it seems like Mr. Walker is returning to the form that he had last in Darkest Instinct and Extreme Instinct. Let's hope the next book in this series continues the trend of good books in this series.<br />But please, no more cameos from characters in the Edge series, ok?	2003-04-25

Seriously, is this the same Robert W. Walker? The first five books in the instinct series were AWESOME, the next two decent. But this one...[is not good]. The plot is secondary to Jessica finding herself and dealing iwth heartache and finding the strength to move on and...oh yeah by the way there's this killer out there that's not even bothering to worry about getting caught and he merrily piles up the bodies. Then the last hundred pages features a resolution so innate, ridiculous, and just plain horrible that finally I just slammed the book down once I found out who the killer was. And SURPRISE - it wasn't hard to figure out!<br />The worst in the series by far, so verbose and jumpy at times (five paragraphs about Jessica's thoughts and feelings every three or four pages, as just one example - oh yes there are more) that it's literally a struggle to read more then five or six pages at a sitting.

I was surprised when I found out that the movie was based on a novel by the same name. I was even more surprised when I found the novel at my local library a while back. But what took my breath away was that the book was in fact ten times better and a bit different than the movie.<br />You probably know the plot and characters by now, so I won't go into that. What I will say is that the writing is some of the best prose I've read in a thriller novel of this kind, and the bad guy (the husband) is one of the most realistic and most interesting villains in modern fiction. The main character, Sara, has life breathed into her through Ms. Price's writing that the movie never had a hope of matching, and I found myself caring for her and those around her greatly, while at the same time anticipating when her husband would find her.<br />If you've seen the movie, you owe it to yourself to read this book. If you liked the movie, read the book to get an entirely different and much better form of the main plot. If you hated the movie, read the book so you can see how the movie 'should' have been.<br />Great work, Ms. Price, I'll have to be looking for more novels by her. This book gets a high recommendation from me. Pick it up!	2003-04-15

(Fawcett Gold Medal)	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Good, but the last eighty pages nearly sinks the book...	First, let me say this: before the huge glut of vampire novels on the market with similar themes to this book, this novel came out. And this novel and the books that came from it have been quiet influences (and in certain vampiric RPG games and movies certain ideas in this book and series have been outright stolen) in said glut of vampire novels, games, movies, etc, I believe. But is the book itself that good?<br />For the most part, yes. It's a quick, fun, entertaining read, with vampires that you'll hate, love, feel sorry for, cheer for, one that will scare you to death, and one in particular, though he never actually appears within the novel, is nonethenless one of the most ingenious vampiric creations I have ever read (and one that's been duplicated in other works sense). But, sad to say, the last eighty pages are horribly dull. Once the author begins to tell Rasputin's tale (probably spoiling here, so sorry in advance), the book immedietly loses its steam. To give you an idea of perspective - reading this book a second time I finished 150 pages in no time flat, yet it took me three days to finish the last 80 pages. That's how bad it gets.<br />Do I recommend this book? Yes. But for the love of God, stop at Rasputin's story unless you require a cure for insomnia. In fact, because I care, I'll go on ahead and spoil the last eighty pages, to save you good people the time! Stop here if you're insane and would prefer to read this for yourself! I also recommend the next two books in this series - the Vampire Papers and the Vampire Princess, both are EXCELLENT novels that improve upon this one in spades	2003-04-12

I wasn't expecting too much going in, so this book was quite a pleasant surprise. Quite horrific in places, while in other places it actually will make you think, this book is well written, with a main character/detective that is refreshingly different from the hordes of single cops with dark secrets and high sex drives that pervade most books of this genre. <br />The best part about this book though, by far, are the murders and the way the city itself reacts. I think that's what I enjoyed about this book more than everything else, while the plot was good and the characters a treat, the true jem in this book is the realism...I could almost imagine that this had quite possibly really happened. And in fact, there are some real-life murder cases that bear a strong resemblence to this novel...<br />Great job, Mr. Starling! A high recommendation here.	2003-04-07

Know why there's so many backstage-revealing books on the wrestling business, why there's so many biographies of mat grapplers being written? This book right here is why. 500 pages long and one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. You know what the book's premise is by now, so I won't rehash it. But I will say that after reading this book, not only was I still a fan of Mankind/Cactus Jack/Mick Foley the wrestler, but I gained and to this day still have a TREMENDOUS amount of respect for Mick Foley as a human being.<br />If there was ever a book that could ever be called entertaining and inspirational at the same time, here it is. The story of how a young kid from New York fought his way to the top of the wrestling business is amazing and heartwarming, and funny as all heck to boot. <br />My absoulute highest recommendation, if you're a wrestling fan or just want to read a good biography and/or something to make you feel good and laugh your [head] off, pick this up.

Kurt Angle the wrestler is one of my favorites, and I have nothing but respect for him as a persn as well. I wish I had his drive, work ethic, and mental fortitude.<br />That being said - eh, this book is entertaining but nothing special. The fundamental problem is this - the parts detailing his life growing up and his olympic trials, wins, and tribulations is entertaining, but let's face it - people are picking it up to hear about wrestling, and not the amateur kind. And that's where this book falls on its face, as once Kurt and his ghostwriter (whom you can tell wrote great swathing portions of this book without a lick of Kurt's imput at times) get to the wrestling section, it becomes a giant WWE fluff piece. Vince McMahon is a great person, everyone in the WWE works hard and gets along, injuries happen, yadda yeadda yadda. NOTHING is said that could rock anyone's boat here.<br />It's good for a quick read if you're at borders or barnes and noble and want something to do for four hours.

I was expecting a WWE/WWF fluff piece similar to most WWE-published biographies and books that I've read before, sprinkled with some stories, supposedly written by the superstars themselves but we all just KNOW the ghostwriter wrote most of it himself and liberally changed the facts as needed.<br />I was totally wrong here.<br />This book is fantastic. It pulls NO punches with anything, as the brothers are refreshingly honest throughout the entire book. It's obvious that whomever helped the brothers write this took a backseat and just recorded what Matt and Jeff had to say, and the result is an extremely interesting look at the wrestling business and how two fans managed to make it big in the business. I was also SHOCKED at how honest they were with everything. From being critical of their fellow wrestlers, to each other and their friends...the boys pulled zero punches here. The result is, in my opinion, the best book the WWF/WWE has had published since Mick Foley's two biographical books.<br />If you're a wrestling fan, you definetly want this. Non wrestling fans might not be as into this book as they may have been upon giving Foley's books a try, which is my only real criticism of the book itself, but then again the market is so saturated with wrestling biographies as opposed to when Have a Nice Day came out that one really cannot knock the book for this. But for wrestling fans, marks and smart marks alike, this is a wonderful book. For wrestling fans - my highest recommendation!	2003-04-05

You know, if this book had been about two hundred pages shorter, I would have probably given it five stars. Literally, there was no reason for half of this book to have been written. And that half, of course, was the history Slade injected into this book. Pages and pages of it. Chapters and chapters of history. Then fivep ages of good writing. Then MORE history. <br />I hate to admit this, but it's obvious to me that Mr. Slade (or rather Mr. Clarke) was just churning this one out on his own to get it done, and sacrificed expanding the admittingly great plot and usual great characters just to finish the book and make a buck. It's a shame too, because if you discount the textook-esque history sections, there's a GREAT story here. I really wanted to like this book, and I really wanted to care about these characters. But the numerous history sections just got in the way.<br />I think the real main problem with this book is not really Mr. Clarke's (the main writer behind Michael Slade) fault...for unlike this book, he always has one or two writing partners when these books are written. I have the impression that with this novel, there was no one to hold him in 'check,' and thus he expanded on the history sections just to fill a page limit. A shame.<br />Headhunter, Ripper, and Primal Scream are Slade at his best. This one...well this one, sadly, is Slade at his worst. I'm feverently hoping that the addition of Slade's daughter increases the quality of his future books (and I've heard only good things about the new duo behind Slade, so I'm eager to pick up Death's Door).<br />Take a pass on this one unless you have a LOT of patience for dry textbook-esque prose.	2003-03-28

What isn't great is how verbose this book is in places, and how mind-numbingly dry it is in others. There were about ten places in this book where I thought I'd never finish a page, just because of how tedious the writing had gotten. It's a shame too, because as I said before the plot is tremendous, the setting unique and interesting, and three out of the four characters were very well fleshed out and intriguing. The character of Nikki, however, takes the sails out of this narrative...there was no reason why the author needed this character in the book. My other main grievance is - not enough attention was given to the German sniper...this book could have easily benefitted from taking about fifty pages worth of dull descriptions, histories, and chapters and devoting them to Thorvald.<br />Dissapointing, to say the least.

A villain both mysterious and geinuinely scary. There is not one single chapter or sentence in this novel that does not advance the plot or keep the reader hooked. In short - one of the only horror novels I have ever read that truly scared me, and one of the best novels that I have ever read in general.<br />YOU WANT THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW!!!!!	2003-03-16

Almost reads like an eposidic drama instead of a straightforward novel - which is a pleasant change of pace. As cliche as this sounds, I literally could not put this book down.<br />Gets my highest recommendation! YOU WANT THIS BOOK!	2003-03-16

Slade's best book in my opinion for the simple fact that this novel is unashomed to be what it is - a 400 page trip to hell and back.<br />Read this book!<br />((Hoping Burnt Bones and Death's Door are this good...about to read those....))	2003-03-14
US	32443611	RA34X4KBGVNAR	0451406958	155529819	Evil Eye	Books	4	2	2	N	N	One hell of a read	This book is 400 pages long. And in those 400 pages, there is enough sheer chaos in this book for three novels of this length.<br />Slade sometimes gets a bit too verbose, but one thing you can always count on is that things will be nothing short of anarchy with his settings and plots. And while there were a few characters that really could have been left out of this book, I was absoulutely blown away by how cunning, manipulative, and relentless Evil Eye (the main villain) was in this book.<br />Michael Slade has an amazing gift as a writer - he makes you want to root for the bad guys because they're so darn cool. This is one of those books.	2003-03-14

This is quite possibly the most dissapointing novel I have ever read, horror or otherwise. After two GREAT books in the series, the final book is rushed and features every two-bit hackneyed method the author could come up with. It starts off great for the first 200 pages, don't get me wrong. The parts with Elizabeth, Vlad, Harker, and Zsusanna are absoulutely perfect. But once we get to England...it's formula all the way, with some 'twists' thrown in to attempt to keep the reader guessing. This book is deservingly spoiled when I say that the ending to the entire series is cobbled together from the last ten pages of the book, and everything beforehand is utterly pointless.<br />But if you want a good read, you can always just read the first 200 pages and then make up your own ending. That's what I wish I had done before I had unfortunetly kept reading.	2003-03-04

This book is horrible. Absoulutely horrible from start to finish. The writing is grade-schoolish, the plot moves to slowly and is so far fetched that one can't lose one's suspension of disbelief no matter how hard the reater tries, and frankly the monster itself is sleep-inducing.<br />Don't bother with this book. For that matter, don't bother with the movies either. Frankenstein, the book and all things spawned from this book, is the single most overrated work in literature.	2003-03-04

We have the introduction, the main part of the book which is the 'life story' and then a resolution which ties in whatever threads of plot were brought out in the introduction (which usually are forgettable five minutes after reading them) and the main part all together, and usually said ending is a quick flurish of pages (no more than 10-20 pages) that is supposed to wrap things up all nicely, complete seemingly with cute little bow.<br />This book falls into the same trap. The main part with Marius' story is excellent. Tremendous. Probably the most interesting thing Rice has written since Tale of the body thief. But like the rest of her newer vampire books, the shoddily written introduction and the horribly contrived conclusion just left a horrible taste in my mouth. Same with Blackwood Farm. Same with Pandora. Same with Vampire Armand. I could go on and on here.<br />Come on Anne, ditch the formula and bring back the magic that you have from Interview iwth the Vampire through Tale of the Body Thief!	2003-01-29

However, midway through the book the plot just got horribly convoluted and made no sense whatsoever. Or maybe it wasn't the plot but the author's rather haphazard way of writing. It seems as though the author took his time the first third of the book, but the rest was just written with no thought as to explaining things so the reader could follow what was going on and why the characters were doing what they were doing. Very, very dissapointing, especially since the first two books were so good. Let's hope things pick up with book 4.	2003-01-28
