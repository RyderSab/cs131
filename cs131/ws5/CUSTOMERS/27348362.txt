With so much to see and do, everyone is feeling energized and ready for what lies ahead.  But while each person seems to have a different idea of \\"fun\\" on the islands, one thing is and has always been the main focus: dolphins.  Especially for Jody, who has just befriended a spinner dolphin whom she named \\"Twister\\".   <br /> <br />Multiple adventures in the book keep you interested and in a bit of suspense while the less exciting moments make up for in detail and imagination what they lack in excitement.  The book is engulfing and fun, while also being educational.  It's not fantastic literature, but it contains bits and pieces of knowledge about dolphins and the places where Jody and her family visit that readers might not have known before.  My only comment is that the dolphins seem unrealistic in parts.  I know dolphins are intelligent but the chances of Jody befriending a wild dolphin in every group that they come across are very, very, VERY slim.  I guess that it makes the story interesting, but Jody always befriending a wild dolphin in every book and the dolphins always doing things beyond what a normal wild dolphin would even think to do also make the story predictable in parts.  So basically, the story is, as I said above, engulfing, fun, educational, and overall a very good read, but if you're older than...hm...maybe ten or eleven, expect a few kind of eye-rolling parts.	2005-09-21

I do not recommend it to children, as it contains quite a bit of cussing and, of course, a lot of violence.      The book itself (which is a true story) was bittersweet.  It was well-written, descriptive, and engulfing but it was also disturbing and in some parts a tear-jerker.  For the most part, though, I say that the extreme violence was a good thing, as it made me realize how active the Devil is in the world today.  It made me realize how many people there are in the world that are just pure, manipulative, sick-to-the-core evil.  And from that realization I love and appreciate the Lord more, and find more comfort in knowing that thanks to Him, there is also some good in this world.    I highly recommend this book to older teens and adults who are interested in learning more about child abuse or who want a really good book with moral purposes.  I can't wait to read the sequels, \\"The Lost Boy\\" and \\"A Man Named Dave\\".	2005-08-15

I have to say, I was very pleased when I discovered that there was actually some good manga out there that was rated \\"ALL AGES\\", which is the only rating of manga I am allowed to read (since I found higher rated manga to be simply appauling as far as content goes).  But did I ever feel as though I'd been tricked when I skimmed through the book itself!  I had had my dad look over it before I bought it, but he didn't know enough about the story to realize that there was innapropriate content in it.    Okay, listen to this and tell me that it's not bad:    The two main characters (Ayu and Nina) turn into boys to do something or another. (Remember, I only skimmed through it.)  While at this something or another, they \\"interact\\" with flirty GIRLS!  Ayu, in particular (\\"against her will\\"...ha!  Give me a break!) gets kissed!  And of course, the author makes sure that everyone knows that \\"Ayu just got kissed by a girl\\" by making her say, \\"My first kiss...and it was a girl!\\".    Now tell me, does that sound appropriate to you?  Does that sound like it was completely necessary to make the story interesting?  The answer is NO!  The author PURPOSELY put it in there to try to twist the minds of younger girls who don't know how to tell a plotline from a trick!      This is my opinion, although I hope that new manga readers will agree (so that they don't get themselves into the sticky situation I'm in where I'm dying to read manga but I don't want to feel like I'm reading garbage) but I've had enough of manga!  The only manga that I found was entertaining AND clean was \\"Peach Fuzz\\".  But other than that, I have yet to see manga that isn't just trying to force homo-sexuality and pervertedness on innocent readers.  Manga is not something that you \\"grow into\\" like a PG-13 movie.  And it is not \\"appropriate for older kids\\".  The bad stuff may be stuff that older kids already know about, but that doesn't make it any less nasty or uncalled for.    Overall, I recommend Japanese animation-based shows that are marketed at kids such as \\"Totally Spies\\" and \\"Marvin Mystery\\", and anime such as \\"Mew Mew Power\\", \\"One Piece\\", \\"Dragonball GT\\", etc. (Keep in mind that most anime is more for pre-teens and teens than kids.  And even anime marketed at kids can contain a little bit of violence and in some cases adult content.)  But I don't recommend manga.  The only manga that you'll ever catch me reviewing again is manga by the authors of \\"Peach Fuzz\\".  I seriously hope I didn't offend anyone with my opinion, but I'm sorry...I've had enough!	2005-07-16

This time, though, instead of proving that she is worthy of being a part of the Hayes family by becoming a soccer star, she is proving to her parents that she is mature enough to ride bikes to the fall festival at the high school with her friends, and hang out there without her little brother tagging along.  But after doing countless chores and trying to act more adult-like (both seeming to be unimpressive to her parents) Abby is wondering if she's EVER going to be considered \\"mature\\".  Will Abby be able to earn the freedom that she is positive she deserves...or will one mistake ruin everything? <br /> <br />This was a very good book!  It's what I refer to as \\"not fantastic literature, but it requires little thinking and is enjoyable enough that I really like it\\".  I have to say that this book was probably better than the first one. (And now I can't wait to get the third!)  My only comment is that ten years old is pretty young to expect that much freedom!  Whether Abby gets it or not, I'm not telling, though.   <br /> <br />Overall, I say that if you're looking for a fun, light series to read before bedtime, while you're eating a snack, or while you're waiting in a doctor's office, then I recommend \\"The Amazing Days of Abby Hayes\\" to you!  It's not complicated, and it's very entertaining.  I actually waited in anticipation for moments of free time when I could read it!	2005-06-30

But all of a sudden, \\"what he believes is right\\" is changing.  Are bad R-rated movies, explicit music, and trashy friends really the way to go?  Does seeing a lot of things that he shouldn't be seeing make him sophisticated?  And how is he expected to witness to people, when he scarcely thinks of God, himself?<br /><br />This was a really good book!  It has little twists and turns that will surprise you, and an entertaining storyline to keep you interested the rest of the time.  The characters are all likable, but you might find yourself getting a little bit irritated with Hannah sometimes, because she can be pretty obnoxious when she's trying to prove a point about the Bible.  I recommend the \\"Brio Girls\\" series to all girls between the ages of twelve and sixteen.  It teaches you how to handle certain teen issues as a Christian, and it is a well-written series that will keep you wanting more.	2005-05-21

Recently, Solana's non-Christian attitude has left her with a broken heart, and she is left feeling low and depressed.  When the two girls make friends with Katie, who is strong and confident in her beliefs, they find themselves attending special gatherings and neat rituals with her, all in the name of the Lord...or so Becca thought.  Is it possible that Becca could actually be helping Solana to grow even FURTHER from God?      I really liked this book.  It taught me a lot about Wicca, the religion that Katie and her friends practice.  I understand better now why some parents refuse to allow their kids to watch T.V. shows and read books where magic is involved.  Even though I think magic is a really interesting subject for a show, book, or movie, I would NEVER, EVER try to cast spells or be \\"witch-like\\" in real life.  Apparently, that's how those parents feel, too, and why they don't allow their kids to be exposed to things such as witches, wizards, potions, spells, magic, etc.  I also learned that Wiccans don't, in fact, worship Satan, but they do worship a \\"God and a Goddess\\".  Whether the \\"God\\" is the real God or not, I'm not sure.  But on another subject, this book had a good storyline.  I mainly enjoyed learning about Wicca, and why it is considered to be satanic.  The characters didn't tease each other as much in this book as in the last one I read, \\"Stuck in the Sky\\", so I can't really think of anything bad that I have to say about it.  Overall, I recommend \\"Grasping at Moonbeams\\" to girls ages twelve to sixteen (the actual recommended age limit) since some topics came up in this book that would be inappropriate for younger girls.	2005-05-17

The new girl at school, Hannah, has strong beliefs in God, and she isn't afraid to share her beliefs with others.  Where Jacie, on the other hand, gets tongue-tied every time she tries to witness.  Not to mention that, as Hannah points out, Jacie is more focused on getting in to an expensive art conference than anything spiritual or Godly.  Could anything possibly make Jacie even LESS focused on what she believes is right?  Yes, and the answer is:  the school \\"bad boy\\", who Jacie finds herself very attracted to.  She eventually learns that he has a chip on his shoulder, and a grudge against God.  But how can she help him if he is always turning her down every time she tries to talk about God?    This was a fantastic book!  I could relate to Jacie feeling as though God might not really be there, and understanding her feelings helped me to gain a lot from this book.  It inspired me to do daily devotions, and to pray with more heart.  Besides the entertaining storyline, the easy-to-relate-to part is why I rate this book \\"5 stars\\".  The only thing that I didn't like about this book was that the characters were always teasing each other!  Some of the sutff that they would say to each other was much more mean than funny.  That made the \\"Brio Girls\\" seem less like friends some of the time.  But other than that, this is a really good book!  I recommend it to girls ages twelve to sixteen (the recommended age), since it had some parts that would be inappropriate for younger girls.      Also, this is the first \\"Brio Girls\\" book.  I think it would be a great place to start reading and get into the series, since newer books sometimes give away the ending to earlier ones.	2005-05-17

She can already imagine all of the fun that she, Miranda, and Gordo are going to have out in the woods, WITHOUT ADULTS...well, other than her science teacher, of course.  But it looks like things are going a little differently than planned.  The boys and girls are in seperate groups, and the girls' chaperone ate bad cafeteria food and can't make it!  It looks like the girls will be needing a new chaperone.  Who will it be?  Will it be Coach Kelly, the gym teacher?  Or will it be...wait a second!  Who just walked in the door?  It's...MRS. MCGUIRE!  Oh, no!  And since she won't be home to cook dinner, it looks like Mr. McGuire and Matt are left to fend for themselves!  Will it be cooking their own meal, or a disgusting dish of tuna casserole that Mrs. McGuire left for them that they must ultimately face? <br /> <br />SECOND STORY:  Lizzie and Miranda are ready for...okay, I'll just come right out and say it:  They want to buy bras.  But they want to do it on their own, free of embarassment from their only source of transportation, Mrs. McGuire.  Miranda has devised a clever - yet simple - plan to make sure that Mrs. McGuire doesn't tag along.  But Lizzie isn't such a good liar, and it looks like a very unpleasant surprise is going to force the truth out of her!  Also, Matt is entering a contest to be \\"Jet Li's Sidekick\\".  Will he be able to master the art of kung fu and win the contest, or will he remain nothing but a \\"young grasshopper\\"? <br /> <br />What is there to say about this book?  It is basically just two episodes of Lizzie McGuire with a little bit more detail.  When I was just a little under halfway through this book, I went to the bookstore and bought four \\"Brio Girls\\" books, so I couldn't wait to finish this one and start reading them!  Personally, I would much rather just watch \\"Lizzie McGuire\\" on television than read the books.  That way you can have a more enjoyable \\"Lizzie Experience\\",AND have it in half an hour, leaving plenty of time for better, more detailed, and (Please don't get mad at me, Lizzie fans!) less shallow books.  I mean, I could NOT relate to how Lizzie often dislikes and is always embarassed by her mom!  But still, I can't help but find myself actually being disappointed sometimes when \\"Lizzie McGuire\\" is on and my brother changes the channel.  So, overall, I recommend that you only read the \\"Lizzie McGuire\\" books if you don't have cable, because the show is much better!	2005-05-15

Tyler Jennings is stressed when his old girlfriend, Jessica, moves back to town.  Even though he cares about her, he greatly feels that she has interfered with the relationship he has been trying to pursue with Hannah, the new girl at school.  Even though Hannah and her father agree that \\"courtship\\" is the proper way to find a suitable mate, Tyler is still determined that he can make Hannah his.  But now that Jessica is back, Tyler feels as though he is being forced to choose between the two.  Will he pick Jessica?  Even though she is rather possesive and materialistic, she is one of the best-looking girls at school, and she tries hard to be a good girlfriend.  Or will Tyler pick Hannah?  Even though she is pretty and very kind, she has many personal rules that Tyler finds a little bit extreme, and she would never be able to date him even if she liked him back.  And then there's the biggest question of all: If Tyler starts dating a girl seriously, what will become of his relationship with the Brio Girls? <br /> <br />This was a good book.  I enjoyed reading it, and I actually found myself becoming excited when I had free time to read it.  The only parts I didn't like were: <br /> <br />1. The Brio Girls could be pretty rude to Tyler sometimes. <br />2. In real life, Tyler wouldn't hang out with a bunch of girls if he was the only boy.  And if he DID, then he would get seriously made fun of by other boys.  The kind of relationship that Tyler has with the girls is pretty unrealistic and occasionally sickening. <br />3. The characters interrupted each other too much!  I know the author was trying to make it realistic, but people don't interrupt each other THAT much in real life. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to older girls.  Even though it had its times when it could be unrealistic or slightly annoying, it was still a good teen novel.  My only caution is that, since the story focuses around romance, there is a lot of kind of nasty talk in it that younger girls shouldn't be reading.  But if you're between the recommended age limit (which I agree with) then this is a good book that is worth reading if you want a Christian-based romance novel where the characters frown at the trashier kids instead of going along with them as if it's \\"no big deal\\".	2005-05-05

Abby is ready to change...she's ready to be a soccer star!  Soccer is the one sport that Eva has never showed interest in, and the one thing that could make Abby as popular and talented as her parents and \\"Super-Sibs\\".  It's a good thing she has help from her best friend, Jessica, her new friend, Natalie, the \\"Words of Wisdom\\" from her calendars, and her journal, which she will use to record her journey every step of the way! <br /> <br />This book is what I refer to as an \\"easy-read\\".  It's fun, a little refreshing, and isn't so deep that it gives you a sort of thoughtful, depressed feeling.  The characters were pretty stereotypical and even a little unrealistic at times, but they helped the story along.  Abby was a very unique and entertaining character, and I enjoyed the sort of personality that Anne Mazer gave to her.  The only thing I didn't like was that it seemed more like her longing to be good at soccer came more from wanting to \\"fit in\\" with her family than just raw passion for the sport.  Overall, this book had its ups and downs.  It wasn't my favorite book, but I'm still going to buy the second one.	2005-05-02

There were a lot of feelings and troubles that I could relate to, and a lot of good advice and stories that girls, having friendship troubles or not, need to read.  The quizzes were fun to take, but I wouldn't take the results TOO, TOO seriously.  They are about the most accurate quizzes there are friendship-wise, but if you listen too carefully to the ranking, rating, etc. you come out as, you could end up breaking off a friendship that could've been rescued.

Basically, \\"The School Story\\" is more of a relaxing easy-read than a Newbery Book.  But I give the information about the editing and publishing process two thumbs up!

Maybe it was the unique characters, or the sweet, sneezy, smiley Winn-Dixie.  Or maybe it was the well-thought-out story, about a poor, lonely little girl named Opal, who finds a scraggly stray dog that changes her life.  Some parts of the story were sad, others were exciting, and all of them were interesting.  The chapters were short, so I could almost always stop at the beginning of a new chapter if I was interrupted.  The way Kate DiCamillo wrote the book is hard to explain...the writing had this sort of simple, perfectness to it, but it wasn't emotionless.   <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed this book.  It wasn't my favorite, but I'm glad I gave it a chance.  Now I want to see the movie!	2005-03-28

In this story, we follow Nancy, along with her best friends, Bess and George (Georgia), as they try to solve TWO mysteries at once!  So far, there is barely enough information to get a good lead on either case...and the more days go by, the more squash is squashed, and the farther away the valuable egg could be traveling from River Heights.  But Nancy has a feeling...a feeling that the criminals may actually be close by.<br /><br />I have to admit, I don't care for old things.  Don't ask me why, I just don't.  I've always sort of wondered if I'd like the \\"Nancy Drew\\" series, but I was never eager to give it a try.  When my mom recently mentioned that a lot of readers love the \\"Nancy Drew\\" series, I remembered reading in a magazine that a new line of books about the blond detective just came out in 2004.  I bought the first book, excited to give it a try, and loved it!  Almost every chapter ended with a cliffhanger that made me immediatly move on to the next one...actually, I was so curious to find out \\"whodunnit\\" that I could hardly put the book down!  The writing was so descriptive, and the story entertained me, while also keeping me in suspense.  I'm so glad I gave this series a chance, and I can't wait to get a hold of the next book!  I recommend this series to all girls!	2005-03-26

It is the book where all that has kept you wondering, such as whether Jake and Dawn will become a couple, is revealed.  A few of the chapters were rather boring, as though Lurlene McDaniel was simply trying to fill space.  But I was left with a rather content feeling at the end of the book, since there was nothing much left to keep me wondering.  Here is basically the story: <br /> <br />It can't be happening...not again.  Due to an illness (I will leave you to discover what) the whole left side of Dawn's body is paralyzed.  And the timing couldn't be better, considering that cheerleader Tasha is trying to steal Jake away, and every day is bringing the seniors at Hardy High School closer to graduation.  Will Dawn ever be able to live out her dream of going to college and becoming a doctor?  And will she be able to win over Jake before they go their seperate ways? <br /> <br />I am very happy that I tried this series.  It was enjoyable, and I recommend it to all girls.  But be cautioned that this book was slightly more disturbing than the other books.  I know some people might wonder what could possibly be more disturbing than cancer, but imagine being paralyzed...completely helpless when no one else is around to get things for you.  It makes you thankful for good health!   <br /> <br />Good-bye, Dawn Rochelle, and good luck!	2005-03-23

First of all, I love the Zenda series!  It is so original and absorbing.  The characters are likable and most are memorable.  I think this is the best book series I've ever read!  This book did not fall short of my expectations.  It was enjoyable, and I loved the fact that a few different things were happening at once.  Here is what all is on Zenda's mind: <br /> <br />\\"The Astral Summer\\", a time when it is night until the end of the season.  What will it be like now that Zenda has her new powers, kani and aura sight? <br /> <br />Astrid, one of Alexandra's buddies.  She's been acting a little strange, especially around Zenda.  Could she be...jealous? <br /> <br />A strange little creature that Zenda has found.  It is injured and frightened.  Will Zenda be able to help it? <br /> <br />And the biggest thing of all...I won't tell you what, but I will give you this hint: Double.   <br /> <br />This was a wonderful book!  The \\"Zenda\\" series continues to please me!  I recommend this series to girls who love books!	2005-03-18

But that's just the problem!  Jody is so obsessed, that I find myself gravitating more toward Brittany, who is supposed to be the snobby girl.  It's just so sickening how Jody can't have any fun without it involving dolphins!  I actually find myself mentally cheering for Brittany when she makes a remark such as \\"Is dolphins the ONLY thing you can think about?\\".   <br /> <br />Like I said, interesting story.  Even though it is often predictable, I still enjoy this series, and love hearing about the adventures the characters have on \\"Dolphin Dreamer\\".  I also learn a lot!  In this book, I learned that pilot whales are actually dolphins.  This story will keep you entertained, and most readers will be excited to hear that Lauren is back!  But don't feel like you're the odd-one-out if you start disliking Jody and her over-emotional, sickening-and-eye-rolling obsession with dolphins.  I understand her liking for dolphins, they're cool!  But sometimes, she just needs to calm down!	2005-03-18

Let's see...Dawn is turning sixteen soon, and is going to Hardy High with her friend Rhonda.  Dawn is determined to put her memories of cancer behind her, so she isn't thrilled when Kate, the nurse from the hospital where Dawn stayed at when she was in isolation, asks her to be a part of a cancer survivor discussion group at the hospital.  And there are still the memories of cancer and lost friendships that continue to haunt her.  But the most important descision Dawn has to make is deciding between Brent, and Jake, who recently moved back to Columbus! <br /> <br />This book was very good!  So many things happened at once...it was very entertaining.  I have to say, I was disappointed with who Dawn ended up with in the end, but that's just me.  I love the Dawn Rochelle series!  It's so interesting and dramatic, as it mixes the story of a teenage girl with a story about a girl with cancer.  I recommend it to all girls!	2005-03-16

She is tired of cancer, and all the depression that comes along with it. But she reluctantly agrees to be a counselor at cancer camp during the summer, and with a touch of nerves, she trains to become one of the counselors for the two weeks of camp. Finally, after training for three days, it's time for the campers to arrive, and Dawn is feeling more into the idea of helping out girls like herself, who are going through the pain and trauma of cancer. But Dawn is surprised to find that not everyone at camp is pleasent. One of her assigned campers, Marlee, is bitter, rude, and overall, just a mean girl. Can Dawn befriend Marlee...or will she still have bad feelings against the girl when she needs her most?  <br /> <br />This book was sad, but also interesting and entertaining. It is a great follow-up to the last two books as it continues to follow the life of Dawn Rochelle, a teenage girl who is struggling with cancer. The second book was about Dawn's relationship with her brother, but this one is about Dawn's relationship with her friends. Some parts will surprise you, and others will have you absorbed in it. It is a great book that I recommend to pre-teen girls!	2005-03-12

Though she has to be in remission for four more years to be declared \\"cured\\", Dawn's blood tests have been coming out positive, and life continues to go on.  Then Rob, Dawn's older brother, arrives home from college with great news- he's getting married!  His wife-to-be, Darcy, is pretty and nice.  But Dawn senses that Darcy doesn't like her because of her cancer.  At first Dawn wonders if maybe she's just feeling jealous of Darcy's perfect life and attitude, but when Dawn's cancer returns, with only a bone marrow from her brother to save her life, Darcy becomes more and more upset, which causes her brother to become upset, too, and Dawn is afraid that she is ruining her EVERYONE'S life with her cancer.  But that won't last much longer if the transplant doesn't work... <br /> <br />This book was very touching.  It talked about the closeness between Dawn and Rob, and Rob's loyalty to her in this rough time, when death is waiting at Dawn's door.  It was very interesting, and was a page-turner for me.  I ended up reading it from beginning to end in only one morning.  Like the last book, it also talks about cancer, and is educational if you want to know what cancer really is.  I recommend it to girls who love good books!	2005-03-12

She has just discovered that she has leukimia, and that she will have to spend an uncertain amount of time at the hospital, receiving chemotherapy and losing her hair, weight, and happiness.  No one understands what she's going through, even though they try.  Then Dawn meets Sandy, a sweet girl from West Virginia, who is also her roommate at the hospital.  Since they both have leukimia, they are able to comfort, confide, and enjoy each other.  But will either of them survive to be lifelong friends? <br /> <br />\\"Six Months to Live\\" was sad, but enjoyable.  It was truly terrible what Dawn went through, being skinny and bruised, losing hair and constantly nausious.  Even though this is a fictional story, real cancer patients have to go through what she went through.  This book really tugged at my emotions, and it also taught me a lot about cancer.  It was a very entertaining book that mixed the usual pre-teen story about romance, friendship, misery, happiness, etc. with a touching story about a girl with cancer.  I can't wait to read the next book!	2005-03-09

Here is basically the story from each twin's point of view:    Mary-Kate is thrilled!  The carnival is in town, and what starts out as a simple trip to the carnival solely for fun, turns into an amazing encounter with a REAL fortune teller!  At least, the fortune teller's predictions have been coming true for Mary-Kate.  But when the others' predictions don't come true, everyone begins to suspect that Mary-Kate is just being conned.      Ashley has a great idea for the White Oak newspaper: an article about the circus/carnival that is visiting town!  Everyone is super-excited about it, too, except for the newspaper's new photographer, Jill.  It seems to Ashley that Jill wants nothing to do with the project, and she can't figure out why!    Overall, this story was very predictable.  I had figured out the end to Ashley's side of the story just a few pages into it, and the end to Mary-Kate's story just a around the middle of the book.  It was still kind of interesting, though.  I mainly just read the \\"Two of a Kind\\" series for fun, I'm not looking for Newbery material, so I usually enjoy the books no matter how occasionally cheesy or predictable they may be.  If you want a school-drama based easy-read, too, or like Mary-Kate and Ashley, then I recommend this book to you!    P.S. I have no idea why they say in the product description that \\"every decision Mary-Kate makes based on the predictions is destroying her friendships\\".  I think that's very misleading!	2005-03-04

But I am so glad that I gave it a chance!  The back cover description really doesn't tell enough about the story.  But that's why I'm writing this review.  So you can know just what the story is about (free of spoilers), and my opinion on it. <br /> <br />Jonas is a boy who lives in a community where everything is structured and in control.  Babies are birthed by birthwomen, named, and given to couples with only one girl and one boy in each family.  Jobs, husbands, and wives are assigned by the leaders of the community.  Children are not allowed to ride bicycles until they are \\"a nine\\".  All of the people of the community have lives planned out for them, and they can have only as much knowledge as they are allowed.  In this strange world that these people live in, there is only one person who knows of the beauty of originality and love: The Receiver.  He must bear the weight of all the glorious memories of life and the painful ones of death for the entire community, even if it means that he will be the only one to realize how truly emotionless everything is.  When Jonas is assigned this job, he must learn these memories from the past Receiver, who, since he is no longer receiving, refers to himself as \\"The Giver\\". <br /> <br />This unique and entertaining page-turner is unpredictable, and will keep you wondering.  Just when you are content with all that's happening, a new twist makes you wonder and keeps you reading.  This book was very detailed, though the ending was slightly foggy for me.  And it actually pulls you in, and almost makes you feel what the characters are feeling.  I recommend it to all readers!	2005-03-03

I really liked the action parts, since there was usually a lot of romance mixed in with them.  I do think that some parts were unnessecary and simply used to add some inappropriate content to the book.  Being that I love romance, this was one of the best Japanese comics I've ever read!  For me to truly enjoy romance manga (and I know I've said this before) the main boy has to be someone that I would like if I was a manga character.  Tamahome reminded me of Darien from \\"Sailor Moon\\", risking his life to save the main girl!  It was those parts that I enjoyed most. <br /> <br />Overall, if you love romance and Japanese comics, I recommend this to you!  It is very absorbing and enjoyable!  But keep in mind that there IS unnessecary content such as Tamahome walking in on Miaka when she's shirtless.	2005-03-03

I personally preferred the first over the second, but you can't expect every story to be just as good as the last.  Here is a basic run-down of the two stories: <br /> <br />The first one was about Yukino Miyazawa, a girl who is pretty, smart, helpful, and kind...at least when she's at school.  She has always been popular, but when Soichiro Arima comes along, her popularity begins to fade.  He is also good-looking, smart, helpful, and kind.  Miyazawa is so upset by the fact that she isn't the center of attention anymore, that she slowly begins to focus all of her time and energy on Arima...but is it competitive energy, or is it possible that Yukino might have a crush?  And what will she do if her true selfish, snobby self is discovered, and she is left looking like a hypocrite? <br /> <br />The second story is about Koharu Mizumoto, a shy, quiet girl who is incredibly afraid of opening up to anyone.  But when she bumps into supposedly \\"bad\\" Toshiro Sakajo, her glasses are broken, and she finds herself practically sightless.  Feeling as though he is partly responsible for Koharu's glasses being broken, Sakajo offers to be her \\"eyes\\" until her glasses can be fixed, which means he will follow her around at school, carrying her books, sharing his notes with her, and helping her around.  At first Koharu feels awkward, but after a while, she begins to feel more and more attracted to Sakajo, who isn't turning out to be so \\"bad\\" after all. <br /> <br />This was a romantic, entertaining book.  I didn't want to put it down!  The first story is going to be continued in the second book, but I think the second one has come to an end.  I'm going to check out the second volume at the library the next time I go.  The only problem I had with this book is that there was a lot of cussing!  I'm still sort of new to manga, but I've never read one that cussed so much.  It contained all the common cuss-words that aren't the worst you could say, but are still bad.  It also had some words and phrases like \\"Oh my God\\" that I don't approve of that much, even though I'm used to reading it a lot.  I also liked that both boys in the stories were cute.  I just can't get that into romantic manga if the boy isn't attractive to me.  To get into it, it has to be a boy that I would have a crush on if I was a manga character.  Overall, if you like romance, and don't mind all the cussing, then I recommend this book to you.  But keep in mind that this IS romance, and I can't guarantee that future books will have appropriate romance material like this one did.	2005-02-26

Jessica and Bethel have partnered up for a school project where they must contribute a paper, video, etc. telling about what life is like at Sweet Valley to a time capsule.  When they decide to make a video, Jessica reluctantly turns to Lila for help, since she is the only person that Jessica knows who has her own video camera.  The plan is to simply borrow the camera, but before Jessica knows it, she is becoming more eager to be in touch with Lila again, and eventually, Lila becomes a part of the project.  But as if spreading her negativity during a game of frisbee in front of all of Jessica's friends isn't enough, Lila makes extremely hurtful remarks about Bethel to the camera...and Jessica can't find the tape anywhere!  What's the worst that could happen?  Bethel might have it. <br /> <br />This book was really good.  I wished someone would just smack Lila most of the time, but she was still an interesting character, and made the story especially good.  I also liked that you could read her thoughts and feelings, as with the other characters.  I didn't much care for how things turned out in the very end with Jessica and Lila, but that's just me.  I recommend SVJH to those who enjoy teen dramas.	2005-02-24

This was a good book.  Not the best I've read, but interesting.  It also talked about Jessica and Damon's relationship a little bit, and Salvador's parents coming to visit.  That was pretty interesting, since Salvador doesn't get along great with his parents.  Overall, I recommend it if you like the SVJH series.	2005-02-23

Just when Jessica and Damon finally begin to refer to themselves as a \\"couple\\", everything falls apart.  Damon is feeling insecure at home now that his mom has started dating again, and has found Ben.  Ben is kind and thoughtful, and always offering to do things for the family.  That's why Damon can't stand him.  He can't help feeling...replaced.  But he feels guilty for acting so distracted and insecure around Jessica, and tries to be a better boyfriend by being \\"quiet and aloof\\" as Brian put it.  But when he just comes off as strange to Jessica, she feels like something is missing between them, and tries to be a better girlfriend by being romantic...too romantic for Damon's liking.  At the same time, Brian is second guessing how good of a boyfriend HE is to Kristin, and tries to make her feel more special, even though he's just embarassing himself. <br /> <br />Overall, this book was interesting, romantic, and entertaining.  I think Damon and Jessica always have a problem in their relationship, which can be sort of annoying sometimes, but still fun to read about.  I recommend this book to SVJH readers, and the SVJH series to those who enjoy teen dramas.	2005-02-23

It's Me, Margaret\\" is a good book to read if you are interested in learning a little bit more about growing up.  Though not packed with information, it blends the changes that girls go through with an interesting story about a pre-teen girl.  Margaret desires to be grown up, and I think at some times she goes to minor extremes to do so.  The part where she tries to fit in with a certain religion was a bit of a let down, as well.  At least the message was good, though:<br /><br />You don't have to be a certain religion to pray and love God.<br /><br />This wasn't the best book I've ever read, but it was good.  Some parts may be a little bit inappropriate, and the whole \\"growing up\\" thing is definately not appropriate for younger girls to read.  But for older girls who enjoy teen stories and want to read a book that doesn't purposely exclude the truth about some of the facts of growing up, then I recommend this dramatic, sometimes-over-the-top, entertaining story.  It includes a variety of characters, and will keep you reading for quite a while.	2005-02-18

Kristin is such a pushover!  How can someone so sweet and nice get mixed with a snotty brat like Lacey?  I can understand why Kristin would feel sorry for Lacey, after all, she has a horrible family life.  But I certainly would not be apologizing to Lacey when she's the one who embarassed me, embarassed my friends, and tried to make me feel bad.  If this were a real life situation, I would say that Lacey is just friends with Kristin because she's the only one who keeps taking her back, even though she's a terrible friend. <br /> <br />It was interesting to hear about Lacey's home life, even though I wish Lacey would quit trying to be \\"cool\\", and would finally open up and tell her parents exactly how she feels.  It would add a lot of even more interesting drama to the story.  Jessica and Damon's side of the story wasn't that exciting, but it wasn't boring, either.

Finally, it appears as though there is nothing left for the doctors to do...it is time for Nana to come home and wait to die.  \\"Sort of Forever\\" is the story of the struggles of the two friends.  While Nana struggles just to be herself in the midst of the weakening disease, Cady struggles to be there for her whenever possible, knowing that any minute could be Nana's last.  This book was touching, and taught me a lot about cancer.  My great uncle was diagnosed with cancer a few months ago, and it was helpful for me to actually learn about what cancer was and some ways it affects your body.  So I guess \\"Sort of Forever\\" was a two-in-one type of book, and if I could rate the educational value of it, I would give it a four.  I think girls will enjoy this interesting, entertaining book about friendship and finding a silver lining in a dark time.	2005-02-15

But it was quite confusing!  There were a lot of conversations where certain responses and sudden bursts of emotion didn't make sense, and the whole \\"Lotis Master\\" thing wasn't explained very well.  Maybe there is a much-needed explanation in a future book, but I'm not really interested in reading further books.  The story was good, as I said, but besides being very confusing, there just wasn't that \\"thing\\" to the story that made me excited about it.  I also think that there was something unattractive about Kyo.  His face didn't have that certain look to it that makes manga guys so cute.  But even though my opinion of him was kind of bad at first, I got to like him better further into the story.    Overall, an okay book.  I'm glad I checked it out from the library before I bought it.

Maybe I'm just more one for cute manga, but it's still hard to get into the story when you're not following everything.      Parents, note that there is also some content that you may not find appropriate.  Alice's sister seems to be the character that Yu Watase wanted to make most desirable to any male readers, because she shows her once in a loosely buttoned shirt and underwear, and then in a kind of short towel.  The part where a boy trys to make Alice kiss him using force may bother some parents, too.  But hey, that's why it's rated T for teens and not Y for youth.	2005-02-11

I can hardly remember the comic itself, but I do remember the little pictures that Naoko Takeuchi used to decorate her notes to the reader, and a blank part of a page.  One was of the Sailor Scouts, though younger children may be clueless to the TYPE of girl that wears the outfits they were wearing.  And the other was just flat out disgusting and uncalled for, and is probably worse than what is in most adult television shows (I'm serious).    So be warned, parents, the only clean manga in existence is \\"ALL AGES\\" rated manga.  Every rating afterwards means that the comic includes at least ONE part that parents would not approve of.  My advice to parents is: be extremely cautious of what manga you let your child read.  There are books that are supposedly geared at ten-year-olds that have guys that look like girls, and girls in skimpy outfits.    Note that I found questionable content and/or a lot of cussing in:    \\"Sailor Moon\\"  \\"Tokyo Mew Mew\\"  \\"Alice 19th\\"  \\"Fushigi Yugi\\"  \\"Kare Kano\\"	2005-02-09

But the two feel guilty hiding their feelings from Anna, and Salvador decides to break the news to Anna that they like each other as more then just friends.  But when Salvador sees how upset Anna is becoming as it gets closer to the anniversary of her brother's death, he winds up giving her a pity-kiss.  And now Anna thinks that they're boyfriend and girlfriend!  Sounds like a soap opera, right?  It's interesting, though.  Anyway, this all must have happened in the last book, because here in book #8, Salvador is already taking the heat from Elizabeth for not being honest with Anna. <br /> <br />Though not the best book I've read in the series, this book was still good.  One part inparticular was especially juicy and seemed like something that you could only wish would happen to make things more complicated and enjoyable.  If you enjoy Babysitters' Club, Mary-Kate & Ashley, Luna Bay, or Lizzie McGuire books, you'll enjoy this series, almost completely guarenteed.	2005-02-08

His mom has started dating again, and is really enjoying the company of a man named Ben.  Because the two are so close, he is always over...replacing Damon.  Most kids would whine about babysitting their two little sisters, but when Ben constantly offers to do things for the two girls, Damon can't help feeling defensive.  It's like he's not needed anymore.  Then Ms. Serson, Damon's teacher, starts becoming more noticable.  She is young, pretty, a good listener, and is relying on Damon to help her with a literary magazine that she is starting.  For once, Damon feels like he's needed.  But now JESSICA is the one feeling not needed.  Every day it seems like Damon is becoming more distant, and Jessica fears that he is getting ready to break up with her.    Meanwhile, Lacey is feeling bored.  So Gel has a car, big whoop!  There's nothing else interesting about him...but at least he's not Richard Griggs!  Richard is a self-absorbed player who seems to be up in her face a lot lately...what a jerk!  What a loser!  What a...um...cute guy.  What an idiot!  What a dummy!  What a...um...quick-witted...cute guy.    This is a good book!  Not the best I've read from this series, but still good.  I found Lacey's story especially interesting.  I recommend this series to Babysitters' Club, Luna Bay, and Mary-Kate & Ashley book lovers.	2005-02-05

Another thing not mentioned on the back of this book is an unpleasent surprise...the Wakefields are moving to Utah!  How will this mess turn out?

I LOVE Boston Terriers...probably because I own one that I will proudly call my furry little baby!  This calendar is a dream come true for any Boston Terrier lover.  The pictures on each page are so cute that you could just kiss them!  I've cooed over plenty of different Boston Terrier calendars, but this one beats out every single one of them.  The dogs pose on a white background, drawing all of your attention to the dog, and the dog only.  The strange camera angles \\"The Dog\\" uses are a main part of the undeniable cuteness, doing close-ups on their furry faces and posing them in different positions.  The cutest are group shots of puppies, though!  Oh, and the one, I think it's for September, that is a close-up of a dog looking sideways...I always make a fuss over that little cutie! <br /> <br />Okay, I'm sorry.  I sound obsessed.  As far as the calendar goes, there is an extra page combining November and December of last year (not that it's any use now) and special days aren't listed.  If I remember correctly, they just have the abbreviations of countries on the date of a holiday in that country.  Some may find that a big deal, but the Boston Terriers!  They're so cute!  And you usually hear when special days are coming up from other people, anyway.   <br /> <br />Overall:  I'm going to save it until the day I die.	2005-02-05

If you think about it, though, there must have been something great that Tokyopop saw in \\"Kim Possible\\" that made it worthy of this enjoyable first. <br /> <br />The art in this book is in color, and looks basically like freeze-frames from the TV series.  It does lack some of the usual manga items, such as tiny characters on blank pages, and random words, pictures, and notes here and there.  But those things are only for smiling at, and don't affect the story much.  The fact that the book was in color was very attractive, and already having an insight to the characters from the show was nice.  I finally got tired of waiting for future books to come out, but it looks like there is a nice, long line of them now! <br /> <br />I recommend this book to Kim Possible fans, comic book lovers familiar with the show, or people who like comics and would like a taste of KP.  It is the first book, too, so you won't be skipping ahead.	2005-02-03

It isn't very long compared to what I'm used to, but that's okay because I wanted to find out the ending in that one sitting.  The story keeps you in anticipation, though a few parts are predictable.  Here is basically the story for each twin (no spoilers ahead): <br /> <br />Mary-Kate:  It's almost winter break, and Mary-Kate's class has been assigned a last-chance-to-not-fail-the-class group project.  Even though snobby Penelope aced the most recent test (unlike everyone else), she volunteers to be a part of the project anyway.  To Mary-Kate's horror, she is assigned to their group.  How will she get through December when Penelope insists on studying 24/7, and makes jokes about the other kids' Christmas spirit?  And in the midst of all the unwanted emotions, how can Mary-Kate catch cutie Carter Black's eye? <br /> <br />Ashley: Ashley comes up with a great idea: Secret Santa!  All of the students' names will be thrown into a hat, then each student will draw a name.  Then they will have to secretly leave gifts for that person until a party, when everyone will reveal who they were Secret Santa for.  So if Ashley was the one to come up with this bright idea, why did her Secret Santa leave her a half-eaten sandwich, stinky gym socks, and a lump of coal? <br /> <br />Overall, an interesting, enjoyable book from the \\"Two of a Kind\\" series.  Not overly detailed, descriptive, or worthy of an award, but a fun, girly book that I would recommend to girls ages 9-12.	2005-02-02

The \\"Handra\\" is really a human hand, though the ferrets view it as a five-headed monster.  Compared to most manga, I found this book to be very clean, and without any mature content (except for the advertisements for gothic manga in the back of the book).  I also noticed (and I may be wrong) that this book looks like it was originally American, insted of translated Japanese.  First of all, the people who wrote this book don't have Japanese-sounding names.  Second, the book reads from left to right, which, although not completely uncommon, goes with the fact that it doesn't look Japanese.  Lastly, though the manga I read is translated into English, the words on store signs usually still read in Japanese, where the store signs in this book read in English.  That was just a thought, I enjoy all manga, American and Japanese.  Sometimes I got a little bit frustrated, waiting for the time when Amanda and Peach would finally get along, but most of the time I was smiling at cute jokes and pictures.  There was also one part that was rather touching, but I don't want to give the story away. <br /> <br />I didn't like the thought of reading a lot of manga at once (I'm reading Tokyo Mew Mew too) but I couldn't resist!  Just from looking at the colorful, peach-scented cover, I knew this would be something I'd enjoy.  Now I can't wait for the next book!  Bring on more \\"Peach Fuzz\\"!	2005-01-31

The story was very descriptive and enchanting, with fun characters that each had an important role to play.  The scenery was sometimes hard to imagine, and the pathways, stairways, passages and such were almost over-talked-about and described, but those two things are very minor when you're reading a book this good.  It contains almost all genres, including mystery, romance, and adventure.  The little mysteries are a big part of what keeps you reading for hours!  Just a warning, don't hurt yourself trying to make sense of things, because it will all be explained later.  I also really liked that the story was over 200 pages long, because I'm a fast reader when I come across a good book, and this one lasted me quite a while.   <br /> <br />What I liked about this book, is that (though some may disagree) it was a lot like real life.  The characters weren't constantly happy, and their needs weren't easily fulfilled.  Even in the midst of happiness there was worry and a little bit of regret.  Each character also had their own view to them, such as Shahrazad (a hero), Zaynab (the kind little old lady), and the Khatun (the enemy). <br /> <br />I very much enjoyed this book!  There are some parts in it that might disturb younger children (such as the sultan marrying just to kill his wife in the morning) and a little itty bitty bit of older people content.  But other then that, I loved this book, and it is now one of my favorites!	2005-01-29

She was gothic, disturbing, and on the inside, very miserble.  But she found out about God, and started making new friends...nicer friends.  Before she knew it, she was happier and had strong beliefs about God.  Though her relationship with her mother was never completely right, she had made a huge leap from goth to Christian.  From reading this book, you will see that goths are not people who wear black and write strange poetry...they are people who speak and write of such horrible things, they can be disturbing to ADULTS.  I most certainly WOULD NOT recommed this book to young children, and people who are easily disturbed.   <br /> <br />The next part is one that will get you asking yourself questions, and wondering how one 17 year old girl could be so brave.  When Cassie's school was attacked by two boys (disturbing people like she used to be) armed with guns and bombs, everything went into chaos.  Many people, as you will find in this book, sacrificed their safety, and some even their lives to save others from gunfire.  But what Cassie did is something that will continuously amaze you.  One of the gunmen stuck his gun to her head and asked her if she believed in God.  Amazingly, she said \\"Yes\\".  He asked her why, but didn't give her a chance to answer.  He shot her in the head, killing her instantly.  Many would want to say \\"No\\", just to spare their lives.  But she didn't cower. <br /> <br />This book was interesting, though a little boring in some parts.  After all, I wanted more action and less of the aftertaste of Cassie's death.  But I'm sure for the author, Cassie's mother, this book was a good way to get out her feelings of sadness.  There are some hints to cussing and some topics that are not at all appropriate for kids.  I only recommend this book to teens, maybe pre-teens, and adults.  After reading some of this book one night, I felt this feeling of peacefulness.  It just goes to show that you don't have to be wrong with God to learn from this book.  It teaches you to appreciate what you've got, because you never know when you might lose it.	2005-01-28

We tried to return the bag to its owner, but the people who lived at the address in the bag said that it didn't belong to them.  So we kept the things in the bag, including this absorbing story.   <br /> <br />When I first read it, I didn't even know who Lillian Gish was!  But this turned out to be a great book that I've read more then once.  It talks about Lillian's life as an actor, back in the early days.  Described are mistakes on stage, traveling around the country, hard times, and shining moments.  Some may think that the book is simply an ordinary biography that does anything but pull you in and keep you turning pages.  But \\"An Actor's Life For Me\\" is not only educational, but fun!  Lillian Gish truly had a tough life sleeping on benches or on floors while traveling, and acting away from her family for so long.   <br /> <br />Overall, this was a great book!  It really got into the absorbing little details that keep you wondering.  I recommend it.	2005-01-21

If you enjoy playing Pok'emon: Red Version, Pok'emon: Blue Version, and/or Pok'emon: Yellow Version, you will find this handbook quite useful.  It not only lists information about the Pok'emon you'll be catching and training, and information abut the gym leaders you'll be facing, but includes a checklist to keep track of which Pok'emon you've captured.  Information about Pok'emon includes attacks that they can learn, what to do to get them to evolve, what element they are, what elements they're strong against, and what elements they're weak against.  The rest of the information, if I remember correctly, such as height, weight, and the little paragraphs telling about the Pok'emon are kind of useless, but still fun to read if you're bored and the book just happens to be laying nearby.      Overall, I'd say this book isn't that useful anymore, considering the fact that everyone has already moved on to more updated versions of the Pok'emon game.  This book could possibly be helpful to those with Pok'emon: Leaf Green or Pok'emon: Fire Red versions, though I believe there's already a more accurate guide to them.    But if you prefer the older, easier Pok'emon games (like myself), and need more information on what to do and what to expect, I recommend this to you.  It will not only cover a decent amount of information, but because of its age it could possibly be found at a low price.	2005-01-12

It kind of tears at your emotions, but that only makes it more enjoyable.  Once again, the dolphins always, and I mean ALWAYS being super-friendly to Jody as if they were aquatic humans can be quite annoying.  After all, wouldn't mistreated captive dolphins be frightened and a little bit tense around humans?  And Jody's love of dolphins can be eye-rollingly sickening as well.  I mean, it's not like she just really loves them or something, she's practically OBSESSED!  She cries every time something bad happens to a dolphin, and passes up fun activities just so that she can SEE them.  But although those things can be bothersome, I still enjoyed this book.  All of the characters had their time to shine in this book, or so it seemed, and the story, although difficult to imagine in some parts, was interesting and even kind of absorbing.  I recommend this series to dolphin lovers, and girls who like unique and entertaining books.	2005-01-07

When I first saw advertisements for Catwoman, I thought it was going to be a cool superhero movie like the Spiderman movies have been.  I don't know why I assumed she'd be a hero; she was a villain in the Batman series.  Anyway, so I was excited when I found this book at Barnes & Noble!  I bought it, and started reading it not long after I got home. <br /> <br />It was evil, depressing, trashy, and everything that fits into that catergory!  I was very disappointed.  Patience was like a kind-lady-getting-through-life turned psychotic garbage bag.  The book started out good, but once Patience became Catwoman, she was so evil it disgusted me!  You can even tell just by looking at Catwoman that she's supposed to be a no-morals villain who tricks her male foes by making them believe that she's interested in them when really she wants to slit their throat with her diamond claws.  The book also described a lot of creepiness and violence.   <br /> <br />I don't want to give the story away, but I will tell you that no matter how the book ends, it is possible that you will be left a little depressed.  For those of you who, like me, thought that Catwoman was supposed to be a superhero, that is incorrect.  She may have a slightly good side but it only occasionally shows through.  I ended up giving this book to my friend a mere few days after I bought it.  The only thing I can be happy about is that I read the book before I wasted money seeing the movie. <br /> <br />Also, a note to those of you who are still interested in Catwoman even after this review, Patience doesn't die by gunfire, she drowns.  I know that's giving away part of the story, but I found the commercials showing someone firing a gun and then the narrarator saying that she was killed to be very misleading, and I thought I should let you know.	2004-12-24

The book started as decent, but into the middle I began becoming very interested and found myself not wanting to put it down.  The book is so...different...original...to the point where even unessecary details were enjoyable and descriptive enough to picture in my mind.  The characters were so easy to love and so memorably humorous!  I just can't say enough about their strange ways of doing things and their odd-but-entertaining interests.  I almost wish this book was a series instead of a novel, but I feel that it is close enough to the perfect story as it is.  I really liked that it didn't focus completely on Saffy, but also on her artistic and loving family.  I also liked that the characters got right to the point, instead of rambling for pages. <br /> <br />This one has become a major favorite of mine, and will be one that I recommend to all my friends!	2004-12-17

This story made me feel so many emotions...in one sad part, tears literally started welling in my eyes.  This book keeps you in suspense, and there are a few unexpected parts here and there.  Though some characters can be over emotional, and dolphins aren't always as friendly and inviting to people as they make them in Dolphin Diaries, I still enjoy this series, and am now feeling rather anxious to get the next book!

The story is entertaining, although usually unrealistic.  There's a one-in-a-million chance that a wild dolpin would become so understanding, humanly, and attached to Jody as Apollo.  But it makes the story interesting. <br /> <br />This the only part that seriously bugged me: Jody and her family visit a center that uses dolphins for their work.  But they're not captive.  Every Sunday the gate leading to the open ocean is opened, and they're allowed to swim out into the sea.  They always come back, but when one doesn't the owners freak out and start searching for it and trying to lure it back!  Why open the sea gate for the dolphins when they're just going to chase them back?  I thought that was kind of strange. <br /> <br />But if you like dolphins, or love good stories about pre-teen girls, I think you'll enjoy this series.  It is very original, and inspiring.	2004-12-03

This book is very descriptive, and the characters are very expressive and emotional...which can be good and bad, depending on what the character is saying, and what point they're trying to make.  This series is definately for girls between the ages of eight and eleven or twelve.  Any older, and you start noticing unrealistic parts and becoming annoyed with characters that are supposed to be everyones' favorites. <br /> <br />The main thing that bugged me about this book was all of the wild dolphins.  Dolphins are friendly and smart, I know, but the author makes the dolphins a tad too human-like and unrealistic.  The dolphins always seem to fix everything and amaze everyone...all of them, not just the main few. <br /> <br />The characters can also explain too much, especially the men.  Most guys aren't big talkers, but most of the guys in this story are always opening their mouthes.   <br /> <br />But if you like dolphins, you'll love this series!  It is full of facts about dolphins mixed with a very creative storyline.	2004-12-03

But after reading the first few chapters, I found that I was rolling my eyes at the unrealistic storyline, unlikable and self-centered Genny, and the goofy stories she had to tell.  I didn't finish the book, and took it back to the library without an ounce of regret.  I guess I'll never know if the book gets any better, but I didn't want to keep wasting my time finding out.  I found myself to be uninterested, and practically forcing myself to turn the next page.  <br /> <br />If you like magic stories about a teen girl, I recommend Zenda.

The story can be interesting and can sometimes give you that good feeling inside.  When I was a year or two younger, I found this series to be nearly flawless.  I think it is because of my older age that I am noticing more things in the series that bother me. <br /> <br />In this book, inparticular, I did not find many problems, if any at all, though I know that older readers will find the human-like personality and knowledge of the dolphin Apollo to be unrealistic.  It makes for a good story, though, and I think this series should be read in schools as well as at home.  Dolphin lovers will most definately find this series to be fun and enchanting, and girls who aren't interested in dolphins may still find Jody's life on board a boat with family, friends, and enemies to be entertaining, though the story does focus a lot on dolphins.  I give it 4 stars!	2004-12-01

The story was very good, and I found myself practically unable to put the book down until, before I knew it, I'd read the whole book in less then two and a half hours!  Definately the most exciting book in the series, because it tells what all Zenda readers have been waiting anxiously for, this book was well worth my time and money!  The \\"test of mirrors\\" was very entertaining, and I found the way the author described Zenda's emotions then to be very descriptive and realistic.  I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that this book was fantastic, and will be a favorite of any Zenda reader!	2004-11-27

She can't think of any ideas for the latest issue, and every second brings the group closer to the deadline.  Then Blue has a great idea!  He could teach Elizabeth to surf, then he and Elizabeth could each write an article about their surfing experiences.  A little reluctantly, Elizabeth agrees to learn how to surf, and before she knows it, surf lessons have turned into...well, flirting.  In the mean time, Jessica is trying desperately to make Elizabeth admit that she has a crush on Blue.  She makes sneaky plans to make Elizabeth tell the truth that one by one, start backfiring on her. <br /> <br />This book was good, and quite romantic.  I do think the model that's supposed to be Blue on the cover of the book doesn't quite fit the author's description of him, but that leaves room for imagination.  There are some funny parts in this book, as well as parts that are just flat out entertaining.  I recommend this book to Sweet Valley Jr. High readers, as well as The Babysitters' Club, Luna Bay, and Mark-Kate & Ashley readers.	2004-11-24

Pony Pals isn't supposed to be magical in any way, yet the girls must rebuild a grave to rest the soul of a dead pony.  There are some entertaining parts in this book, and some parts that make you feel sad.  But when I first read it years and years ago, I was young enough that it creeped me out.  I liked the Pony Pals because of their imaginative, and detailed adventures.  I especially loved how they would eat at that little restaurant before going on one of their fun trail rides.  This book kind of fell short of my expectations.  Overall, I would say that younger Pony Pal fans will be creeped out like I was, and older Pony Pals fans will find it to be just a tad unreal and childish, though they still might enjoy it.	2004-11-24

She has a perfect idea in her mind of how it will turn out...with her playing one of the leading roles, of course.  So what if she got a D on her math test?  Who cares if she can't understand much of what her Spanish teacher is saying?  What does it matter that she doesn't have a clue what's going on in English class?  She can worry about that AFTER the auditions...right? <br /> <br />This book was good.  Not great, but good.  Larissa never really gets that rebellious attitude to her, although she becomes a bit lazy in certain areas.  I personally would have been upset with her if I were Anna and Toby, instead of trying to help her.  I guess they're pretty good friends, because she was being very rude to them!  This book also talks about the beginning of Big Noise, the band made up of drummer-Blue, guitarist-Damon, saxophone player-Brian, and lead singer-Salvador. <br /> <br />Overall, I would say this was a good book in a great series told from each characters' point of view.  A really cool series if you like The Babysitters' Club, or Luna Bay.	2004-11-20

Not only do you get to record your friends' addresses, but you get to write in some information about them, such as what their favorite color is, what they want to be when they grow up, and fun facts like that.  The pages are colorful and decorative, with spaces to paste in pictures of your friends.  There's also a place to add in information about yourself, which I think is fun.  Every few pages, there are little bits of friendship advice, too.  Not that it's very useful, but still.<br /><br />Overall, I would say this is a really cute address book that's perfect for any American Girl or Coconut fan, and even some not.	2004-11-18

The main characters in this book are Toby, who is nervous about being prepared for opening night, and Anna, who has been assigned the leading role not long before the actual play.  Larissa was also a fun, strong, means-buisness character in this book, and I enjoy reading about her (She's my favorite character).    This book is also about the school Olympics that Sweet Valley Junior High is holding.  Jessica and her team are great, and would probably be better if they didn't have slacker, snotty Lacey on their team.  But let's just say that she starts feeling competitive, and gets a little more into the game.    The story is entertaining, and has little parts here and there that make it memorable.  If you want to find out how opening night went, you have to read this book!  It is a good book, and I highly recommend it and the rest of the series to any girl looking for an entertaining read.	2004-11-16

He's ready to break away from his \\"pushover\\" image, and little by little, he's becoming more confident, strong, and...hard to be around.   <br /> <br />The book doesn't take enough time to make you feel like Brian's actually been taken for granted, I think.  It pretty much gets straight to the part where Brian is sick of being pushed around.  I also think Brian overreacted just a tad, but the book was still good!  The lyrics to the songs Big Noise (Made up of Brian, Blue, Damon, and Salvador.) played were kind of cheesy, but Francine Pascal is an author, not a songwriter.  This book was what got me back into Sweet Valley Junior High, and made me realize what I'd been missing. <br /> <br />If you like The Babysitters' Club, Luna Bay, or the Mary-Kate and Ashley series, then I'm sure you'll enjoy Sweet Valley Junior High.	2004-11-16

But Larissa has been open to Anna about her crush, and hopes that Anna will help set her up with Toby.  Anna is willing to help, of course, although she is secretly heartbroken that she has to choose between two of her good friends.  After all, how would Larissa feel if she found out about Anna's crush on Toby, and that Toby secretly likes Anna, too? <br /> <br />This was a good book, and I enjoyed it very much.  It was similar to a dilemna in The Babysitters' Club books, though.  The blond girl and the Asian girl both like the same guy, except that in The Babysitters' Club, the boy secretly likes the blond girl.  Also, the girls in The Babysitters' Club books became ex-friends when the Asian girl, Claudia, found out that the blond, Stacie, was seeing the guy they both liked.  I personally think the decision is up to the guy, and that Claudia overreacted, but this isn't a review for a Babysitters' Club book, so I'll get off the subject. <br /> <br />The story is told from each person's point of view, making the book more interesting.  The book also talks about an upcoming play at school that lasts at least five books before ending.  It is quite a nice ending, though.  If you like school stories, or easy but entertaining reads, then you'll probably enjoy this series.	2004-11-16

This book is about Blue, and his laid back life.  A messy house, bad grades, lazy speech, and a tattooed, just-as-lazy brother as his legal guardian.  So, what happens when a social services worker complains about Blue's grades, and plans to make a surprise visit?  And as if that isn't enough to make this book interesting, the carnival plans are continued and ended in this book, so everyone anxious to find out how the carnival turns out should read this book!    I love the Sweet Valley Junior High books, and am extremely disappointed to find out that the author ended the series.  The story is neat because of the friendship, romance, drama, and the way that the story is told from each character's point of view.  This book does contain content for slightly older kids, though.    If you like Babysitters' Club books, have read other Sweet Valley Junior High books and enjoyed them, like good books, or want an easy but entertaining read, I recommend this series to you!	2004-11-16

This book was good, but I think that Elizabeth and Jessica's fight was kind of stupid, and the way their friends were so affected by it was kind of overdoing it, too.  The book was pretty much about everyone being miserble the whole time because of Elizabeth and Jessica's meaningless fight. <br /> <br />Like I said, it was good, but I still give it 3 stars because it wasn't as good as the others.  The ending was also kind of sappy, but is also a happy ending.  If you like school drama kinds of books, then you'll love this series.	2004-11-16

It is so interesting, because the story is told from each character's point of view.  Each character has their own personality, which makes the story very entertaining and fun to read.  This book, inparticular, is mostly about Jessica and Elizabeth, and their transfering to Sweet Valley Junior High, having no friends and almsot no idea what lies ahead.  Definately a good introduction book.  I enjoy the books where everyone knows everyone, and has already made friends and enemies, but you might need to read this book to understand the others better.	2004-11-15

The story shows a side of Lacey that not many readers have seen before, a nice, more loving side.  For those of you who have never read a Sweet Valley Junior High book, Lacey is normally the snotty one making rude remarks and causing trouble.  The story also told Kristin's take on everything that was happening when Lacey's real mom, Sonya, came to visit.      Some parts of the story were a little bit...not annoying, but not enjoyable either.  Like when Kristin told Lacey that Kristin's mom said that Sonya was flighty, and not the nicest person in the world.  Kristin told her what her mom said because she didn't want Lacey to get her feelings hurt by Sonya.  I don't think a real friend would ever say something that hurtful to the other, but it did make the story more dramatic.  I also wish that in some part of the story, Lacey would have told her dad or stepmom how she REALLY felt about her home life.    Anyway, if you like Babysitters' Club, or have read other Sweet Valley Junior High books, I almost completely guarentee that you'll enjoy this book.	2004-11-15

Zenda finds out in this great book about not taking life for granted.  At one point, I actually got so absorbed in this book that I felt as though I was in Zenda's world, and had to remind myself that I was really just in my bedroom.  The cover art is, once again, beautiful, and the story is detailed, and easy to picture in your mind.  The characters are memorable, especially Persuaja, who is mysterious and original.  If you like magic, love good books, or want something entertaining to read, I recommend this fantastic series to you!	2004-11-09

It was easy for me to imagine all the glittering crystals that were said to make up this creative planet.  I would have been thrilled to be able to visit such a magical land!  That's what I love about books; you can visit so many places that are impossible to visit in real life. <br /> <br />I thought that Stella, Zenda's trouble-making teenage cousin, made the story very entertaining!  I also felt sad often for Zenda's younger cousin, who always seemed to be bullied and left out by her older sister.  The ending was good, and as in every Zenda book, it made me feel excited for the next book to come out! <br /> <br />Overall, I would say this is a great series if you love to read, love magic, or want an entertaining book.  There is always a good moral to each story, and the awesome covers make the books fun to read and collect.	2004-11-09

In this book, a new character is introduced, Willow.  She is everything a decent friend should be, and that is exactly why Zenda can't stand her.  Zenda continuously tries to convince herself that jealousy is NOT the emotion she is feeling, but deep inside it upsets her that her friends seem less interested in her since Willow came along.  And as if this isn't enough to deal with, Zenda is worried about Persuaja, the kind but mysterious psychic who is one of Zenda's most understanding friends.  Persuaja is very ill, possibly with something incurable.    This story was one that always keeps you feeling Zenda's emotions as though they were your own, and the ending hints that the next book will finish Zenda's quest to collect all the pieces of her gazing ball.  Don't worry, though, it doesn't end the series!  I recommend this series to any girl, and wish that my friends would give it a try as well.	2004-11-09

Most of what you feel while reading this book, though, is minor anticipation!  This book was inspiring, and, as with all of the Zenda books, had a good moral.  The story is about Zenda's class trip to one of Azureblue's moons, Aquaria.  Zenda was nervous to begin with, but what will she do when she, her best friends Michael and Camille, and her worst enemy Alexandra are seperated from the rest of the group?  Alexandra keeps the story interesting, although I'm constantly wishing Zenda would stand up to her more.      The ending hints in to the next book, which makes waiting for the next book more exciting!  If you like good books, then you'll love this book!  It is yet another great addition to the Zenda series.	2004-11-09

It talked about the war some, but the story mainly focused on Lily and how the war affected her life.  The little things in Lily's life made Lily original, and her sense of adventure and mischievous attitude kept you wondering what extremes she would go to next.

What first attracted me to this series was the incredibly creative and colorful cover art.  I was also in the mood for magic, and figured this book would be the perfect thing to satisfy me.  The first few chapters were okay, but it wasn't until the end of the book that I was hooked.  The author is so descriptive, and makes Zenda's world so easy to imagine!  Zenda, herself, is a typical awkward pre-teen trying to get through each day.  She is kind, but tends to be impatient, which causes her much trouble during the story.  This book introduces pretty much all of the main characters, and is a good start for a great series.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves good books, loves magic, or who is a creative person.	2004-11-07

A lot of kids think it's dorky to wear a helmet, and others think that they're a good enough rider that they don't need one.  But have you ever thought that maybe OTHER PEOPLE aren't that great of riders, or drivers?  Or maybe you're a good rider, but at a moment you forget to pay attention, hit a rock, and skid into the back of a passing truck.  Mick was a funny, happy-go-lucky, full of personality character.  It's interesting to hear what happend AFTER he died instead of the author building up your feelings for him and then killing him at the end.  His sister and parents are mourning at his death.  Everything is messy, and off-schedule.  Memories of Mick flow through his sister Phoebe's head as she trys to convince her parents, and herself that they need to move on. <br /> <br />There were a few swear words said here and there, and the subject of \\"death\\" may not be good for kids who always love a happy ending, but I think this book should be read by every kid at least once in their life.  Not only does it have a good message, but it is an entertaining story that you'll want to re-read.	2004-11-07

In the beginning, it was hard for me to get used to reading from back to front, left to right.  But after a chapter or two, it became natural.  The characters are entertaining, especially Ichigo and all her feelings and actions.  With all the cute boys constantly surrounding Ichigo, it's a mystery who she'll end up with in the end.  The cover art is cute, of course, and there are bonus pages at the end of the book that talk about the author and such.      At first, Tokyo Mew Mew wasn't super exciting to me, but after reading this book, I'm glad that I bought the second one, too, because I can't wait long to read the next one!  The story is so funny and romantic, and then there's the \\"searching for fellow Mew Mews\\" concept, which although it's kind of obvious who the girls will be, it's still interesting to see how each one becomes a part of the group.  In this book, three girls are discovered, saving the last two to be introduced in the next book.    There are a few small parts that parents might find a little inappropriate, but if you're a parent looking for a cleaner manga for your child, I'd say this one is the cleanest I've read so far!  It seems like all manga books show something ridiculously mature at some point, but this one remained decent, though I would not recommend it to little kids.    Overall, I'd say that this series is a nice mix of manga art, romance, comedy, and a little bit of action.  I'd recommend it to people who like Sailor Moon, or Cardcaptor Sakura.	2004-11-06

I told myself that I would not put it down until I'd read every page!  The story talks about the duty of Ichigo and her friends to find the last two girls injected with animal genes, and about how thanks to Ichigo's new job as protecter of Tokyo, she and Masaya are growing apart.  Though not quite as romantic as the first book (I wanted more romance between Ichigo and Ryou!), the story was still cute, especially the parts with the adorable little puff ball Masha!  The ending is keeping me in mild suspense, and I want to get the third book soon! <br /> <br />Though the book does contain slightly mature content, it's likely that older children won't look too much into it.  I would not recommend this book to small children, but definately to older children who love shoujo manga!  It is funny, cute, romantic, and though a little goofy in parts, still enjoyable.	2004-11-06

All the other books I'd read bothered me in some way, but this book was just ridiculous!  ANYONE who would even TRY to make voo-doo stuff sound real is weird, and needs to get a grip on reality.  But the Cheetah Girls seem like the type of girls that would believe that junk, anyway.  Overall, I would say that this would have been a cool and popular series if it had been writtin by a different author.

I think the story is, although rather unreal, entertaining, and the characters are full of personality.  But the book series is just...weird.  I mean, the lyrics to the songs the girls are supposed to sing are goofy and retro sounding songs like something about a \\"Jiggy Jungle\\".  The girls pick on each other, and aren't much of friends, if you ask me.  They're always hiding things from one another, and being ridiculously insecure.   <br /> <br />This book was a disappointment.  On the back of the book, it talks about the girls making cheetah collars, but that doesn't happen until two chapters until the end!  I think them making it sound like this book is all about their cheetah collar buisness is very misleading. <br /> <br />Overall, I'd say watch the movie, and don't waste your time on the books.	2004-11-04

I think the Kaya books focused more on Kaya's life then excitment, but that's okay, because even though, looking back, I kind of wish there would have been more going on, I still enjoyed learning about Kaya's world.  Once again, I don't exactly care for the \\"spirit\\" or \\"unknown person\\" used in this book, because I don't believe in anything like that, but it was only a part close to the end that had something like that, so I can't complain too much.  I do think this book had one happy little surprise, which I won't give away.  The history pages in the back of this book were interesting, and helped me to understand and respect the Nez Perce a little more.  The pictures in the story part of the book were beautiful, and I think whoever painted/drew them should continue to make art for American Girl.   <br /> <br />Overall, I would say Kaya was a very good series that I am happy to have read.  I recommend it to any girl who loves to read.	2004-10-24

I felt like I was right there with Kaya, visiting the brave Lone Dog and her puppies.  I think Kaya's relationship with Lone Dog is very entertaining, and I can easily imagine the puppies in my mind's eye.  The ending may not be what readers' desire, but at least it didn't end the way I originally thought it did.      Besides the dogs, this book contained the usual history pages, and pages describing what Kaya and her family/friends do around their Native American camp.      Dog-lovers who read the Kaya books will enjoy this book the way I did, and I personally think any Kaya reader will think of this as a great book about love and friendship (I apologize for how sappy I sound).	2004-10-24

In Book 2, Kaya had to leave her sister behind to escape from an enemy camp, and worried the whole time after that she would never see her sister again.  But in this book, Kaya is reunited with her sister, who has something to say that will alter the happiness Kaya is feeling.  As usual, the art in the book is beautiful, and the history pages in the book were quite interesting.  Sadly, the waterfalls where Kaya's people fished for salmon in this book were ruined by the building of dams, otherwise I might want to see real pictures of what were described as amazing waterfalls.  Kaya and her peoples' story is an interesting one, because there wasn't much civilization back then, and the land was more open and wild.   <br /> <br />I think every girl learning about the Nez Perce, American history, Native Americans, or any girl who loves to read should read the Kaya books.	2004-10-24
US	27348362	R1GK4IVCTD0UAB	1584854278	59238610	Kaya's Hero (American Girl Collection)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Touching	This is the saddest Kaya book.  It shocked me to the point where I just sat and stared at the pages in disbelief.  It had an ending that I never expected, and I'm personally not completely sure that I wanted.  It made the book more interesting, though.  This book is about Kaya's admiration for Swan Circling, who I mentioned in my review of Book 2.  But Kaya fears that Swan Circling will not like her if she finds out how irresponsible she truly is.  The characters in this book are memorable, and, as in the other books, the art is well-done.  Each chapter is rather long, but the book itself is rather short, in my opinion.      Overall, I would say this is a good book to continue the Kaya series, and I recommend it to Kaya readers.	2004-10-24
US	27348362	R3ZXQWTFAK3C1	1892213311	332854534	Meet Sailor Mercury: Ice	Books	5	11	11	N	N	One of My Favorite Scouts	Sailor Mercury is one of my favorite Sailor Scouts, and this book is full of bits of information about her.  The exclusive pictures of Mercury/Amy are really cool, some being cute, and others glamorous.  I especially like the pictures in the background of the poems in the back of the book.  Mercury's transformation and attacks are in better order then the other scouts', but it's still hard to figure out which picture comes first in the Episode Best 5 section.   <br /> <br />Overall, I would say that this is a fun book to read like a magazine, simply flipping pages and reading little bits while you eat a snack, sit on the couch, or when you need something to do to pass a small amount of time.  Although it's 93 pages long, there isn't so much reading material that it takes more then an hour or less to read if you read to the end without stopping.  Almost all of the pictures, except for the exclusive ones, were taken from the TV series and movies, so if you're a die hard Sailor Moon or Sailor Mercury fan who's seen all the seasons of the show, and all of the movies, you might find this book to be uninformative and boring.  But if you want an easy read, a book of info on Sailor Mercury to keep tucked away just in case, are new to Sailor Moon and want info on the scout with the blue hair that might be your favorite, or want to collect everything Sailor Moon or Sailor Mercury in existence, then I would recommend this book to you.   <br /> <br />CAUTION:  This book may contain material that younger children shouldn't be reading.  This book contains much less mature content then the other Scout Guides, but there may still be some hints and bits here and there that may not be appropriate for younger kids.	2004-10-23
US	27348362	R38NKS2E5NSV47	1892213362	563276030	Cardcaptor Sakura 1	Books	4	1	4	N	N	Cute	Cadcaptor Sakura is a cool series about a girl whose goal is to re-collect magical cards that she accidently released from an ancient book, with the help of a pixie-like creature she also released from the book, Keroberos, or Kero for short.  The neat costumes Sakura's best friend makes for her to fight evil in are flashy, lacey, and fluffy dresses with matching hats.  The characters are memorable, and each has something to offer.  The Clow Cards pose a threat, but not so much of one that you can't enjoy Sakura's life outside of battle.<br /><br />Overall, I would say THIS book is good, but the second book contains extremly mature, and...well...kind of gross content that kids shouldn't be reading.  I still re-read the first and second books that I purchased because I know what to expect, and it doesn't change my opinion of the world or bother me much, but I definitely don't plan on buying any other books in this series.<br /><br />I wrote this review for the first manga book, but for some reason it is being shown as a review for the second one.  I'm just telling you so that you don't get the wrong idea.	2004-10-23
US	27348362	R3MM2CHCVI31EM	1584854251	59238610	Kaya's Escape (American Girl Collection)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Exciting	This book is definitely more exciting then the first book, and two new characters are introduced, Two Hawks and Swan Circling.  Two Hawks is a Salish boy who becomes Kaya's friend, despite his bossy attitude.  Swan Circling is a brave woman who is a main character in the third book.  This book is the book where Kaya realizes her lack of responsibility, after making a huge mistake that could keep her from seeing her family, and her beautiful horse, Steps High, ever again.  My only problem with this book is the \\"spirit\\" that Kaya comes across near the end of the book.  I don't believe in \\"spirits\\" or \\"ghosts\\", and I found that part to be very unrealistic.  But other than that, I would say this is a good book about struggle, and finding your way home.    I would recommend it to people who read the first Kaya book.  If you haven't read the first book, then I suggest that you read it before this one, because it will make this one a little bit more enjoyable.	2004-10-23
US	27348362	R1YXZG3EW14OS4	1584854235	59238610	Meet Kaya, Book 1	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Meeting Kaya	Kaya is a Nez Perce Native American girl growing up around Oregon.  This book introduces you to her, and tells you about the way her people do things.  There are also a few pages in the back of the book that tell you about the Nez Perce and show real photographs of Nez Perce people and their things.  The best words to describe Kaya would be brave, adventurous, curious, and loving.  Kaya is also a little cocky, but is learning to bite her tongue when she feels herself bragging.  Actually, it is bragging that gets her into a mess and earns her a bothersome nickname.  There isn't very much action in this book, but that's okay, because I love hearing about the Nez Perce people and their ways.  The art in the book is very colorful, and the writing is very descriptive and makes Kaya's world easy to imagine. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to you if you like American Girl, are learning about the Nez Perce, or want a good series to read about a Native American girl.  I would not recommend this book to you if you are looking for a book about magic, or the typical school-story type of book.	2004-10-23
US	27348362	R3KDVL9E3GXX0N	189221332X	84920152	Meet Sailor Moon: Crystal	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A Little Bit More	It's obvious that because Sailor Moon is the star of the show, more work and information was put into this book then the others.  You can tell by the way the title is written in gold letters that reflect rainbow colors that it is special.  Besides being about the star, this book is also the last Scout Guide.  There are, of course, more transformations and attacks for Sailor Moon because she has developed more over the seasons.  I still think the pictures showing her transformations, attacks, episodes, etc. could have been better organized, and made to be easier to follow for the main audience these Scout Guides should be targeting, new Sailor Moon fans who want to learn more about the anime show that has quickly become their favorite.  Long-time, die hard fans will find the Scout Guides to be boring, because most of the pictures and information is taken from the TV series and movies.  But even though I am a long time fan, I still missed the first few seasons of the show, and enjoy easy reads, so I like the Scout Guides.  I randomly flip to certain pages and read, or compare the pictures with those of other Scout Guides.  I personally think this is an interesting book for any Sailor Moon fan, but if you're a huge fan expecting exclusive information, you might be buying this book for the wrong reason. <br /> <br />CAUTION:  This book contains very mature content.  To parents looking into this book for their children, this is not a childrens' book!  If I remember correctly, it is sold in the young adult section of bookstores, and is not meant to be read by children under twelve or thirteen.	2004-10-23
US	27348362	R1IZFJKQR8G0WG	1892213281	675683479	Meet Sailor Mars : Fire: Sailor Moon Scout Guide	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Behind The Scenes With Sailor Mars	Yet another easy-read Scout Guide with bits of info, and cool pictures.  The most interesting parts of this book for me, were Sailor Mars' transformation and attacks, although they weren't in very good order, the pages showing Raye's different clothes and favorite fashions, and the 50 Secrets Of Sailor Mars section.  I noticed that unlike the other books, the index in this book was in the back, and instead of pictures of the other Scout Guides in the back, it just showed the names in the front.  But those two minor things should not affect your decision on whether or not to buy this book in any way, because they are simply differences, not cons. <br /> <br />I noticed, too, that Sailor Mars/Raye seems to change in every picture.  In some pictures, her face is thin and mature, in others, it's plump and her eyes are big, and some pictures look more like someone who would be Raye's almost-identical older sister.  They're still great pictures, though.  Especially the exclusive ones, which are, in my opinion, prettier then the ones taken from the TV series and from the movies. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book if you are new to Sailor Moon, and are wanting to learn more about Sailor Mars, or if you are a Sailor Mars or Sailor Moon fan in search of an easy and entertaining read.  I would NOT recommend this book to die-hard Sailor Moon fans looking for information they don't already know, because this book, like I said, is basically just stuff taken from the TV series. <br /> <br />CAUTION:  This book contains very mature content, and should not be freely read by children under twelve or thirteen.	2004-10-22
US	27348362	R235I49VKNG0PM	189221329X	793943316	2: Meet Sailor Venus: Love (Sailor Moon Scout Guide)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A Fun Book	Personally, I find this book very simple to read when there's nothing else to do.  It's fun to look at all the pictures, and although there is writing, there aren't so many words and paragraphs to read that it makes your head hurt.  Some of the pictures are exclusive, but most of them are from the TV series, and from the movies.  If you are a die-hard Sailor Moon fan, you will find this book to be rather boring and uninformative.      This book includes a showing of some of the episodes Sailor Venus has been the star of, ten pages of bits of information about Sailor Venus, some brief information about Sailor Venus when she disguised herself as Sailor V, and lots more.    My only problems with Meet Sailor Venus, are that the pictures showing picture-by-picture of her transformation, attacks, and episodes aren't really in order, so it's very easy to get confused.  And I've noticed that in ALL the scout guides, in the \\"50 Secrets About (Name of scout)\\" section, the scouts rarely give away their height, and never give away their weight!  It's not that important, but I just think it's silly for the author to dedicate a small section to them talking about not wanting to tell their weight.    Those aren't big problems, though, considering that there are so many parts of the book, which in-all is 93 pages long.  The book is about the size of a chapter book, and like I said, there are a lot of pictures, so don't expect 93 pages worth of reading material.  I would recommend this book if you are just getting into Sailor Moon, or are somewhat of a Sailor Moon fan and want something light to read while you eat a snack, or sit on the couch.    CAUTION:  This book DOES contain inappropriate content.  You don't want to buy this for your younger child, trust me!  The youngest child I would give this book to for them to freely read would be twelve or thirteen, depending on the child.	2004-10-22
US	27348362	RFSAEW4WYZMBB	1892213303	831714437	3: Meet Sailor Jupiter: Thunder (Sailor Moon Scout Guide)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	The Many Sides of Jupiter	This book shows the many sides of Sailor Jupiter, including her tomboy side, feminine side, romantic side, friendly side, and possibly everyones' favorite side, the strong, protective side of her that beats up bullies, and destroys monsters.  My favorite parts of this book were 50 Secrets Of Sailor Jupiter, and the few pictures scattered around the book that show Lita's Japanese-style lunches...yum!  I love how, like I said above, Sailor Jupiter is a mix of so many different types of girl.  It makes her Scout Guide one of my favorites.    I FINALLY figured out why the stories in the Scout Guides are in such an odd order.  You're supposed to read them like you would a manga book, from right to left.  I can't say the same for the attacks and transformations, though, which are in rather poor order.  You have to have watched Sailor Moon a lot to know what order certain things go in; but if you're a really big Sailor Moon fan, you probably won't enjoy this book anyway, because it basically just talks about stuff you'll already know from watching the TV series.    I would recommend this book to Jupiter fans who haven't seen too much of the show, or any Jupiter fan who wants information about their favorite Sailor Scout in a handy book to keep.    CAUTION:  This book contains very mature content, and should not be freely read by younger children.	2004-10-22
