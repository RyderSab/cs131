To writing about dancing with her father to teaching a student that doesn't like Emily Dickinson and then poems about her mother's death, Browne tells stories that could break your heart, yet then you start to laugh at her wise observations on life. A definite recommendation.	2004-04-30

In her new book, One Small Thing, Barksdale-Inclan explores how secrets can hurt a marriage, and how it can either break it up or make it beter. In the now familar town of Monte Veda (where her book Her Daughter's Eyes took place) Avery and Dan live a comfortable life. She is trying to get pregnant, but so far, no luck. But both of them haunted by the past: Avery with her father's death at a young age, Dan with his teenage past and being estranged from his parents. When one of their secrets come up to the light, it's up to them to determine how much the past weighs in the present. Inclan has a wonderful way desrcibing the Bay Area and how people can shed off the weight of their lives, only to not only be lighter but happier. Another winner!	2004-04-10

Her boyfriend breaks up, and she thinks she's preganant. Only surprise! She's not pregannt. What's a girl to do? Just pretend you're pregnant, that's what!

She manages to write beautiful, heartbreaking, and sometimes funny essays on her daughter raising chickens, biology, growing her own food, writing a \\"sexy\\" novel, the demise of independent bookstores, and the heartbreak of September 11th. You might not always agree with Ms. Kingsolver, but by God, you'll be glad she's around to tell her truth.	2002-04-07

I can't believe some people think that the descrption, character development and the characters are boring in this novel! This is so incredibly well written-and to those of you that say it's not &quot;well  researched&quot; Harper Lee based it on her father, who was a lawyer. He  must've provided her so much &quot;research&quot;! What disturbs me is the  students' reaction to this book. Here's a tip: You might not like this book  because it's too &quot;slow&quot; but wait a couple of years, reread it,  then you might be ashamed that you could ever found this book  &quot;boring&quot;	1999-10-05

To say that Danielle Steel is &quot;captializing&quot; on her son's death is disgusting. She wrote this  book as a tribute to him and to help others with manic depression. Manic  Depression is something you are BORN with. It's not Danielle's fault, not  Nick's dad's fault, not his step-father's fault. No one is to blame for  this.  As to the charges she is a &quot;bad mother&quot; because she stays  up nights writing, Ms. Steel spends her days with her children. She stops  writing to have breakfast with them, writes when they are in school, then  stops after school to spend time with them and when they go back to sleep,  she takes a nap and starts writing all over again.  Before you judge a  person, I urge you to see how they feel in their shoes. Then I think you  would feel differently.	1999-08-19

Traveling Mercies is one of the best books of 1999-funny, wise, gentle-she can make you laugh and cry within one paragraph and that's no small feat. not only is Traveling Mercies is spending its fifteenth week on the  bestseller list-Bird By Bird With Annie a documentary about Ms. Lamott has  opened to rave reviews, and her other book Operating Instructions has been  selected as one of the best non fiction books of the 20th century. And to  those of you who think she's self absorbed or whatever-let me quote Rita  Mae Brown:&quot;If you don't like my books, find books you do like.&quot;  Or as AL would say-life is too short. Meanwhile for the people who love  Anne Lamott like I do-let us congraduate AL on her great success and  commend ourselves on our good taste!	1999-04-30

I was disturbed that some people are not going to read this book because Oprah recommended it. Isn't that... I don't know-narrow minded? And I don't think it's fair to air your disgust about Oprah on a Amazon book review.  Anita Shreve is a great writer. I liked this book a lot and I read it  before Oprah chose it. Oprah gets credit because people are reading  books-and that's something in my book! And to those who won't read this  book or Where the Heart Is, Jewel, or Ellen Foster-you are missing out on  great books. Your snobbery is getting in your way in good reading.	1999-04-04

It was clear that he was very much in love with her, and there's no question why. From Scovell's biography  we come  off with the impression that Oona O'Neill Chaplin was a smart, funny lovely  woman who loved Charlie Chaplin with her whole heart. When he died, her  heart broke and never could be mended. Scovell paints such a sympathetic  portrait of her that we want to travel back in time and tell her.  &quot;It's going to be okay! You're going to get through this!&quot;  Unfortuatly, we can't-but thanks to Scovell's wonderful biography, we can  see who hid in the shadows of her father and husband most of her life.	1998-11-24

Okay, okay, like a lot of people I have made fun of Danielle Steel's  books-but His Bright Light just blew me away and broke my heart. The way  she tells about his struggle with bipolar disease but yet remained charming  and loving is amazing. It reminds me of a quote by Anne Lamott-&quot;To  have written your version is an honorable thing to have done....you have  put it down on paper, so that it won't be lost.&quot; Nick Traina's story  will never be lost, thanks to Danielle Steel.	1998-09-21

Okay, I had my doubts about reading this book because Joyce Maynard talks  about her relationship with Salinger. But I see it as he is her teacher  through life-he teaches her about writing, being honest with herself, and  accepting herself as she is-not anyone else expects her to be. If anything,  I do not see this book about Salinger. I see it as a woman finally coming  to peace with her children,her parents, her sister, and finally herself.  She is, at last, at home in the world.	1998-08-29

After reading some of the reviews below, I get angry that people cannot grasp the effect the book has. YES, the depression  was depressing, YES, there was a lot of description, YES, it might not make you feel really great about that time in America, but God, isn't that's what great literature is supposed to do- take you to a place you would never know about and tell you what it was like?

People might disagree with me, but Jerry Seinfeld and the cast of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; owe her a debt of gratitude for sticking up for herself, saying she deserved more money because she earned it. Although Suzanne didn't suceed with her goal, others have and they should thank her for it. The scene when her husband Alan and her son finally talking had me in tears. And the dedication to her mother who recently passed away broke my heart. Ms. Sommers-if you are reading this-I called on your appearance on HSN and I mentioned your mother and asked how she was doing. You were very gracious, but I did not know that your mother recently passed away a couple of days before. I just wanted to say how sorry I was-I did not mean any harm.

Even when it was difficult to read, I read on. It has helped me with my writing and with life in general. In reading the reviews below, I find it sad that people trash such a personal story and say it's poorly written. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. We should be proud that Dorothy Allison survived what she went through, wrote her  story, then girls who are in similar situations read the book and get out of abusive situations. Isn't that what great books supposed to do-make you think? I guess that's too much for some people.	1998-05-05

I have a problem when someone goes on and on bashing a masterpiece such as Beloved. Yes, the characters might show ignorace. But when you are a  slave, of course you would be ignorant! You never went to school! Now look, people have a right to their opinion, but when they suggest that Toni Morrison should be taken away her Nobel prize just because one reader didn't like it, I have to say something.  As for the book... the lines that haunt me are: Beloved, you are my sister, you are my daughter haunt me. For those lines, Ms. Morrison deserved all the prizes she got for the book.
