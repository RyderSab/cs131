I became thoroughly captivated in the storyline from the first page. This is one of those kind of books that you cannot skim through, where every word needs to be absorbed, therefore it took me some time to get through it. But, I felt like I was transported to another time and place. The story and the characters are clever and written with an engaging sense of humor, yet with a traditional sensibility. I would highly ghly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something like they never have before.	2005-05-27

The story picks up where The Queen's Fool left off - with Elizabeth on the throne and her struggle between her heart and her duty. <br />I don't know what it is about the author's writing style, but, from the very first sentence I just couldn't put this book down until I finished it. Perhaps it is the thoughtful and emotional depth of her characters or her ability to pick out fascinating historical details upon which to base the storyline. She brings the characters and the time peiod to life - in such a way that I feel I am right there, witnessing the story unfold first hand. <br />	2005-03-31

I like a book that both educates and entertains.  <br />The author has a talent of taking a topic in a slice of history that may not seem on the outset interesting, but in the telling of the story the author shines in his clever plotlines, entertaining characters, uncovering sardonic historical intrigue.	2005-03-31

Even though I have never read about Mongolian history before, I must say that this is the best book on Mongolian history that exists. The book reads more like a novel than a history book - which was both entertaining and educational.  <br />I was impressed by the impact that a warrior in some remote region hundreds of years ago had on the course of the world.	2005-03-31

I was a bit hesitant in purchasing this book, because it is the author's debut novel, and recently I have a read a few debut novels that were pretty bad. This book is better than most debuts, but I did not find it extraordinary. The adventure the main character embarked upon was enjoyable to follow - and the story had enough twists and turns to keep me entertained. I'd recommend this book to someone who is interested in the specic time period, but not to anyone who is looking for a good historical mystery page-turner.	2005-02-23

I am impressed that this is the author's first novel - as his writing and character developemnt is superior, with plot twists and turns that kept me engaged till the end.  It was fun to follow the main character, Ben Weaver and his thoughts on his journey from character to character to unravel the mystery. Each character is carefully and thoughtfully crafted for the time period; each person a possible suspect.  The character revelations give incredible insight into 1719 London life - where at first I didn't think a novel about the stock exchange could be that interesting - but this world that the author unveiled through the characters was truly fascinating beyond my expectations.  I can't wait to read the author's other books.	2005-02-15

But, Umberto Eco this is not. Unfortunately, the author is an amatuer in her redimentary storytelling and predictable and unrealistic character development.  <br />The story is an interesting premise, but there were just too many predicatable scenes were Joan just happens to solve various problems, from the plague to avoiding the Frank Army attack on Rome, and save the day.  <br />Joan is portrayed as a child intellectual prodigy, who of course is the shame of her overbearing self-righteous father who thinks her more of a witch. She is more intelligent than everyone around her, with medical skills beyond the centuries, and of course, morally and holier than everyone else. This character got pretty annoying after the first couple chapters. <br />It is also ironic that the one message that Joan lives by, and that the author stresses throughout: \\"Do not give yourself to any man\\", igonores the fact that her reliance and dependance on *good* men (her brother Matthew, her first tutor, Gerald, etc) who protected her, who gave her a chance, is what allowed her to grow to become an intelligent independant thinker. Without them, she would have ended up like the rest of the women of her age - unhappy, battered wives, or just an unhappy, battered old maid. <br />	2005-02-07

The story itself is original and emotionally moving. <br />The author not only uncovered the worlds of 19th century Paris and Japan, but she gracefully uncovered the spirit of these cultures caught in historical change through the insight and thoughts of these wonderful, sensitive characters, who themselves undergo spiritual change.	2005-02-03

I am a big fan of more verbose writers like Umberto Eco, Neal Stephenson, Philippa Gregory - and don't usually expect to become captivated by short novels. <br />The writer posseses a gift in being able to convey the characters' thoughts and essenses without have to go into detail about everything. <br />The day to day life that unfolds of young Griet, from her thoughts to her experiences gives the reader a glimpse into society and culture of that time period - which is truly, once again, mostly due to the author's writing style, quite enlightening.	2004-10-23

Neal Stephenson is the American Umberto Eco, maybe even more knowledgeable and talented than the Italian master story teller himself. <br />Never in my life have I read a book where I didn't skip a few words or skim through a few paragraphs, until now. I immersed myself into every single word and punctuation mark of the 1000+ pages, because I did not want to miss out on any of the author's clever wordplays or ingenious plots that unfolded within the story. And what a story it is... <br />Neal Stephenson rates as my top 5 favorite writers of all time. <br />This book is absolutely incredible, and if you don't read it, then you are missing out on the very essence of life itself.	2004-10-06

Puuu-lease. Will we ever get over such stereotypes? I have several caucasian friends whose fathers were preachers/ministers, not ANY African-American friends with preacher fathers. <br />Another example: The Protagonist hooks up with a Russian Gymnast/Acrobat working in the Moscow circus, whose special talent as a gymnast allows her the ability to gracefully catapult herself into a tree to escape from a menacing gorilla at the zoo as the Russian bad guys are after her. Of course, later in the book the gymnast and Protaganost end up in a romantic embrace. Need I say more? Could this book get more ridiculous? The answer is yes. <br />Don't waste your time on this.	2004-10-06

(Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, Dante Club, Club Dumas, Shadow of the Wind, Codex (which sucks), and any Umberto Eco) <br />2. Steal the formula these books used to interest readers, in this case: Mysterious Murders and Secret Society (Renaissance) Conspiracy Theory based on Knowledge of the Ancients Hidden in Works of Art and Books Stumbled upon by the Protagonist. <br />3. Center the story around a mysterious work that no one can pronounce (Hypnerotomachia Poliphili), therefore making it more exotic and intriguing than it really is. <br />4. Use a marketing strategy that, in its hype, compares this book to the ones on the bestseller list that the story formula was stolen from, therefore implying that it is creatively and intellectually equal/better to these bestseller books.  <br />5. The fact that the writing is boring and sometimes painful to get through doesn't matter. <br />6. The fact that all of the stereotypical characters all have individual \\"intellectual super powers\\" that come in handy quite conveniently to solve one of the puzzles to the greater mystery where no one else can, doesn't matter. And the rest of the characters \\"coincidently\\" fit into the devious plot as it reveals itself. How convenient.  <br />7. The fact that this book sucks on all levels, doesn't matter. The publisher is making a lot of money. <br />	2004-09-20

The author just presents a high level aspect of the Cathar religion itself.  Regardless of my initial expectations, this book gives a good comprehensive look at the region during that time period. The book covered a lot of historical points I was not aware of, and was truly an interesting read. Overall it added to my general understanding of Catharism.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in digging deeper in understanding the history of that region.	2004-09-20

I enjoy the author's contemporary language style, and am a big fan of his, not only because it speaks to me and my generation, but because it is clever clever clever - which only enhances a very intelligent story.  <br />If you really want to read something that is original and different from everything else out there, then any book by Gibson is the the book for you. <br />And when I finish reading a Gibson book, I always start seeing the world a little differently.

Once again, as with \\"The Queen's Fool\\", I was blown away with the amount of daily historical detail and the captivating storyline. By focusing on a character, Mary Boleyn, that doesn't have quite the historical presence as other individuals from that time period, the reader gets to know the other characters through Mary's naive eyes, therefore the reader gets a new perspective from which to view this historical era. It's a perspective that humanizes these individuals, and has added to my love of hisory. <br />I really don't know what it is with Philippa Gregory, but she can truly tell a story that is hard to put down.	2004-09-06

I have never had the desire to read a story about some World's Fair that occured in the 19th century, nor have I ever cared about any historical acpects of Chicago, and I am not an avid reader of serial killers (I don't care for gruesome subjects). <br />But when Erik Larson is telling the story, it's hard not to be captivated and immersed in the storyline. The author is a truly talented original writer, and I am his new fan. <br />What starts out in the first chapters about a few details about architecture and construction adversity in Chicago turns into an incredible story of serendipity that kept me hanging on every word.  <br />There are some reviews here that were negative in terms of how the story was layed out, constantly adding snippets of new information and characters and plot, but that is what I found truly artful. The story built upon itself - and as a work of non-fiction, it is difficult to present a story without being one-dimensional and linear. The author manages to give the reader a multi-dimensional view from all aspects thereby allowing the reader to develop his/her own judgement - which for me was a constant state of awe and shock about the story that unfolded.	2004-09-06

Where alternative religious theory/history is a popular subject these days, this book does a fine job in exposing the reader not only to mainstream thought, but every branch and vein possible.

I did not find the plot to be intriguing nor in the slightest bit believable, instead, it seemed contrived to fit a tidey, neat little literary mystery package.   Instead seek these codexes:  Mathew Pearl's 'Dante Club'  Carlos Ruiz Zafon's 'The Shadow in the Wind'  Arturo Perez-Reverte's 'Club Dumas'  Erik Larson's 'The Devil in the White City'	2004-08-28
