Jaunita Houston's book, Our Golden California, was written for Christian students and can be used from about  third through sixth grades. The book itself is a large 264-page paperback  printed in black-and-white with many illustrations. Large type makes it  easy on young eyes. Children can write in the book if we allow them, but  having them instead do their writing in a separate notebook will allow us  to use the book again with younger children.     &quot;Each chapter is  followed by review questions to check on fact comprehension and by thought  questions to encourage thinking beyond the surface. There are lines for  answering questions in the book. Following the questions is an assignment  sheet for working on a California notebook. The notebook will consist of  written work, drawings, and maps. Those of us who want our children to make  a notebook will appreciate having all of the planning for assignments  already done for us.     &quot;The writing style of the author is very  readable. It is not broken into short, choppy sentences as we aoften find  in texts for this level.. Instead, the author has done a skillful job of  writing on a level children can understand even though sentences are longer  and more involved than is typical for such books. A glossary is included at  the back of the book for words that might be unfamiliar to students.      &quot;References to Christianity and God's providence are apparent  throughout the book. They seem to present a balanced approach, particularly  in regard to the Indians and the missions.     &quot;This book has  everything we need for a thorough study about California. Historical  coverage begins with the explorers and continues up to the present.  Geography is used to enhance learning as children study and draw maps  relating to various topics....Student Tests are available in a separate  reproducible book (forclass use only). A separate Teacher's Guidebook  offers additional teaching and activity suggestions plus the answer keys  for questions in both the student text and test book. It is possible to use  the student text on its own as long as we do not feel the need for an  answer key and teaching suggestions.&quot;	2000-03-16
