The blurb on the book states that this is the tradition of \\"The Forever War\\" and \\"Starship Troopers\\" but these blurbs often lie to sell the book, so I was pleasantly suprised to find the book actually did belong among those two wonderful stories about interplanatary invasions. The author of this book has served in the armed forces and it shows in his writing. The way the soldiers interact with each other, the bonds one makes in wartime and the split decisions one must make with the knowledge that the wrong one will be the last decision ever made is all portrayed here accuratly. I also thought all of the future aspects of the book were nicely done and this includes modes of transportation, medicine (such as Prozac 2), anti-matter drives on starships, weapons, and many other things. In my opinion, a sci-fi book is much more enjoyable if the author is an obvious sci-fi fan as this author definitely is.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.	2005-03-30

This is the second book I have read by Margolin and he sure knows how to keep the reader interested throughout the entire book. The villian\s in this book were truly some of the baddest bad guys I have ever read in a suspense book. In fact, I think Darius could give Hannibal a run for his money in the torture and cruelty department.  <br /> <br />The only reason I gave this book four stars as opposed to five was, unlike his last book I read, I had this one figured out sooner than I would have liked. Also I thought that the response in Hunter's Point was a bit unrealistic. If a serial killer has abducted and possibly killed three women in a city, a small one at that, you think the response from the public would be a strong one and the kidnappings would be in peoples thought for a while. Instead, in an early part of the book Page, a DA, calls Hunters Point and asks about the kidnappings that occured ten years before and the cop says he had only been on the force for five years and he THINKS he MIGHT have heard something about it.....I am pretty sure a cop on a small counties force would have heard about the biggest case that ever occured there. <br /> <br />Anyways, I was really streching to find those two instances because overall this book was a great read and I killed it in one sitting. I recommend this book highly.	2005-02-15
US	27050307	R2YN3R7QYYOU7G	0843953616	5060146	The Devil in Gray	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A definite suspense book	I was really suprised at how much enjoyment I got from this book. The lead character, Detective Decker, had me rolling with laughter at some points with his witty dialouge and the gore factor was pretty high in this book. The way the mysterious killer deals with his victims is pretty gut-wrenching (you'll get this pun once you read the book). I also liked the fact that it involved a theme I haven't had very much experience reading about, in this case it's Santeria, a magic much more powerful than voodoo but similar.  <br /> <br />This book is definitely not a classic piece of literature by any means but if you like suspense and you like it gory with a dab of humour, then this is the book for you. I recommend it for a quick read (I read this in one sitting, it's only 350 pages and the font and type are a respectable size) and I think you'll enjoy it.	2005-01-01

I have read almost all of his books and some are perfect (Hyperion series, Song of Kali) and some are just okay (Children of the Night, Carrion Comfort) but in all of them one thing is consistant, his writing. This book goes in the former category. It is much better than the book that precluded it and once is much better than any suspense/ghost story/mystery that I have read in a while. The way Dale is written really made me feel like I was privy to Dale's thoughts and feeling of insanity. I felt like I was going crazy halfway through the story.  <br /> <br />And the end.....I loved it. You'll know what I mean when you read it. Anyways, I give this five stars and I highly recommend it.	2004-12-31

This is the second book I have read from this author and I have enjoyed both of them. The book starts of at a killer pace and doesn't let up. I thought for a little bit there that it might get too religious and maybe get a bit preachy but to my relief the book didn't go there and kept the suspense up until the last page. I won't say I was suprised at the ending as I had a good idea where it was heading but it did throw me several curveballs that I did not see or predict. If you are a fan of mystery and suspense I highly recommend this book.	2004-12-30

That in itself keeps it from getting the worse review of one star, reserved for books so horrible I can't even finish but that is pretty much the only compliment I can give this book. This is the second Laymon book I have read (the first was Traveling Vampire Show) and his writing, to put it simply, just isn't that good. In the two books I have read it takes forever for anything worth while to happen and the dialouge is really bad. Also, I get this creepy oversexed old man feelings from his writing. It seems like he gets his rocks off writing ON EVERY PAGE about what sex thoughts the characters are thinking. Sex in a book is no big deal but do I need to read throughout the book that when a person moves \\"their skirt climbed up and I can see their skin....ohh man it's so nice and I am sooo hot\\".... That's basically the jist of his writing right there. None of the characters were particularly likable and I really didn't care or have any emotion invested in the ending at all, which ended pretty cheesy in my opinion. I put this guy in the same category I put Bently Little, the hack category. I am sure high school kids who haven't read much in their lives get kicks out of the 'naughty' writing and predictable events in the book but I think I'll go back to real suspense, horror and sci-fi authors like Philip Dick, Straub, F. Paul Wilson, CHUCK PALAHNIUK, BRET EASTON ELLIS, H. P. Lovecraft, Bradbury, Dan Simmons, McCammon and others rather than this junk. I advise you to do the same.	2004-12-25

Let me start with what I liked first as the list is shorter. I found Laymon's writing much better than some in the horror genre (Bentley Little, etc.) and there really wasn't any part of the book that was boring. It moved along at a pretty good pace. Also I though you got to know the characters pretty well. Where they well written? No because they were probably the most unrealistic sixteen year olds I have ever read in a story but at least their characters where fleshed out. <br /> <br />I DIDN'T like how unrealistic the book was though. I am a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan for the record, so I don't require realism in my preferred books but I found this book way over the top. The town is like no town in current existence not to mention the tamer early 60's (compared to now). The main character of the story, Dwight, seems to have no other thought on his mind except sex. Now I was a teen not to long ago and I know that it does go through our minds hundreds of times a day but come on, do I have to read about some teen lusting after his Sister-in-law, neighbor, best friends sister, and any other girl character every other page? It got a little old pretty quick. I also thought the whole vampire thing was done in a sloppy way. This was definitly no Something Wicked This Way Comes that's for sure. It never got 'scary' and I never doubted for a minute the main character would survive. I had really high hopes for this book too as the premise sounded so good. All in all I would not recommend this book but I still have hopes for the author. I am reading Darkness, Tell Us right now and it seems to be better than this book so far.	2004-12-24

One of the main reasons I like it was there was a lot of gray area in this book and the author let's you draw your own conclusions on who was the 'bad' guy and who was the good guy. We know the main character, FBI Agent Mark Beamon, is the/a good guy because it says so on the back but what about the guy he is tracking down? The man whose solution to permanately stop the drug business is to posoin a massive amount of cocaine and heroin at the source and here in the US. Is he truly bad? I loved how the book showed people supporting him and what good he was doing (drug use and drug crimes plummetting). It also showed the other side of his crusade, innocents trying a drug dying horribly and recreational users, Senator's children, etc. also dying and the movement to stop the murder. I loved the ending and how the author didn't rush it like so many other authors do. He resolved everything at a perfect pace and the book keeps you thinking well after you are finished. Is our Drug policy failing miserably? Are we wasting money and time trying to stop them when we could use it for other things? What can we do about it? All good questions that are looked at in this book. <br /> <br />Highly recommend it.	2004-12-24

Some books about comic heroes are done very badly, whether it be bad writing, inaccurate portrayal of the characters, a lack of knowledge of the universe the characters are based in, etc. This book had none of that. It was also the first book in the JLA series (I think as of now, Batman, Flash & Wonder Woman are the only ones to get their own book) that had numerous characters. You could really tell the author had a lot of knowledge on the DC universe and he injects the book with many reservists JLA members at the end and even gives a few some POV scenes like Booster Gold. I also liked the hard ass portrayal of Captian Atom and Aquaman. I never even really thought of Aquaman as a tough guy until I read this book. I also loved how the Teen Titans and other teams made an appearance at the end. <br /> <br />The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because I am such a comic fan and I didn't get a glimpse or even a reference to any villians in the DC universe. I understand that the threat was extra-terrestrial in orgin in the instance but it was such a large threat and the battleground so vast (Hong Kong, almost all of the UK, USA, etc.) that I felt at least a couple of villians should have showed up.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you like comics and even if you really don't, this is a really good book.	2004-11-05

It continues right where Weather left off, Arlian's quest for vengence against the Dragons that made him a Dragonheart and that killed his family and town. He also settles his debt with the surviving members of the Dragon Society that he swore vengence on, just not in the way you would think. <br /> <br />Several new plot twists are introduced in this book and I think they fit in nicely and keep the series flowing well. There were no slow spots in the book that I saw and found it hard to put down. My only complaint I guess, was that Arlian would keep realizing something (an idea, a different viewpoint, a sloution, etc.) after it was plain to everyone else or the reader and sometimes he would not think of a consequence of his actions for a long time and be suprised when he does think of it or is faced with it. His indecisiveness did annoy me at times but not too much. Maybe he just isn't the brightest in the world....lol <br /> <br />Anyways, I can't wait to read the third book. Highly recommended.	2004-10-08

I think McMurtry's Lonesome Dove books are hands down the best western books out there today. It's because of this series that the western genre has become so exciting for me to read. His discription of life in Texas in the mid 1800's is so descriptive, I can close my eyes and envision the places he writes about. <br /> <br />First I read Lonesome Dove about ten years ago. Since then I haven't really read many westerns and have stayed primarily in the sci-fi\fantasy genre, but at the book store a couple weeks back I picked up Dead Man's Walk, the first story of Gus and Call. I bought it because I remembered how much I loved Lonesome Dove. I remembered laughing, crying and sitting there awestruck at how good a book it was. While Dead Man's Walk was not as good as LD, I still though it deserved five stars. It brought me right back to the world of LD. I also laughed out loud several times at the antics of Gus and I really loved that Mr. McMurtry put more humour in this book. After reading that I found out there were a couple of more books in the Lonesome Dove series, Streets of Laredo and Comanche Moon. I immediatley ran out and got Moon and Laredo. <br /> <br />Moon was next in the series and I thought it perfectly showed how Gus and Call become the men in Lonesome Dove. This book wasn't as humorous as parts of LD and Walk as it had a more somber tone and much more death than the other two. Maybe it's because this is the final book McMurtry said he is going to write in the LD saga but that tone of finality is there. Especially with Buffalo Hump and Kicking Wolf I thought.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book and this series to anyone who likes westerns, love stories, grand adventures, great action, funny and poignant dialouge and another trip into the lives of Call and McCrae. Five out of five stars	2004-10-02

I picked it up at the recommendation of an employee at my local bookstore, and while I have read several good books via a strangers recommendation, I have never read one as good as this.  <br /> <br />This book is basically one story split into three sections titled \\"Fiat Homo\\", \\"Fiat Lux\\" and \\"Fiat Voluntas Tua\\". They all take place after the 'Flame Deluge', which is when mankinds ignorance and evil have culmanated into a nuclear holocaust. The story is about an abby named after a man of science who learned the errors of his ways late in life and sought to preserve our knowledge, while ignorance roamed the land in the dark times after the flame deluge. The plot is a straight forward one and I while I was able to speed read some parts of the book, I had to slow down and sometimes reread sections that dealt with some serious philisophical matters that, even now I find myself thinking about. This book is truly thought-provoking and I thought, for once, the jacket aptly described it when it says this book is a book that ranks with 1984 and Brave New World. I even think in some ways it is better than those two. It's very seldom when reading a book of the sci-fi genre (my favorite along with fantasy) that one reads a book that let's one reflect on themselves and human nature in general and provides such valuable insights into life.  <br /> <br />I give this the highest rating I can. I advise you get it as soon as possible. I am glad I did, I had never heard of it and it is almost fifty years old too.	2004-09-27

So what if the ending tries to hard to tie everything up in a couple of pages. Who cares that everything is pretty unrealistic, even in a horror\fantasy type book. And also if the characters are fairly shallow and not very well written.  <br /> <br />It's still Bentley's best book, which isn't saying much. I have only read three of his books and after I read the Store, I swore I would never read another (god was that book awful.) But I swear, whoever this guy has write the back of his books needs a raise because he sure makes the books \\"appear\\" to be good and the \\"Resort\\" is no exception. Anyone who reads a lot of literature (not to sound high and mighty here) knows Bentley Little really isn't that talented a writer. His stories lack too many things to list here to be considered great novels, especially in the early ones he wrote.  <br /> <br />But I gave this one a shot. I finished it and actually liked a large part of it. As far as a 'horror' book goes, it's not that bad and parts were pretty good. Little's writing has also improved vastly from his earlier books. Suprisingly the publisher has put a \\"Great Read gauranteed\\" offer on the book and offers money back to anyone not satisfied. I will not be sending my book in for a refund though I wouldn't say it was a great read either and I probably qualify for one.  <br /> <br />I will say it wasn't bad and I rate it a 2.5, rounded up. And congrat's Mr. Little, it's your best book so far.	2004-09-24

I have lately been looking for good westerns to read having recently read some great Louis L. and Larry McMurtry books and this book looked like a good read (based on the cover and description on the back.) Nothing like the \\"man avenging a lost love\\" storyline to really rev up the action in a book. This book really doesn't accomplish what most books in that type of genre do though. I really wasn't that interested in the hero, Matthew Price, even though I sympathized with his plight and wanted him to catch and kill the bad guys. I think I was more interested because the bad guys were written better, or at least the were more than one-dimensional. I think the book could have used a bit more background into Price.  <br />There were a few other things I didn't particuarly like about the book too but if your a huge western fan (although I like the occasional western I am no 'huge' fan of the genre) I am sure you'll at least enjoy most of the book. <br /> <br />I did the think the action was very well written and liked how Brandt didn't make Price the 'best gunslinger ever' but more of a man who is getting lucky. <br /> <br />I give it a 2.5 (rounded down) <br /> <br />	2004-09-23

It is a great revenge/Hero/coming of age story in where the action doesn't let up and the story just keeps getting better with every page. I have never read anything by this author before and in fact, before last week, I had never heard of him. I am extremely glad I picked this book up and it is always great to find an author who writes good fantasy as this genre has many more sub-par writers than good ones. <br /> <br />It is also refreshing to read a book that has a different take on the fantasy genre. There are no elves, dwarves, or gnomes in this book and while I love reading books that involve those races and other typical fantasy fare (ie. Tolkien, Weis & Hickman, McKiernan, Stasheff, Gemmell, J.V. Jones, etc.), I also love books that are new aren't typical fantasy (ie. G. R. R. Martin, Duncan, Mitchell Graham, Simon Green, etc.) <br /> <br />This book, while not the \\"best\\" ever, had no faults that I could detect offhand. The writing was great and again, the plot and story were amazing.

This is the first written story of Gus and Call and it is one of the best McMurtry has written. There were parts of this book that had me rolling in laughter (especially when Gus gets drunk early in the book). The action is great and doesn't let up and it let's us get to know Call and Gus when they were young and dumb and full of....well, you know the saying. In fact, for about a quarter of all of Gus's dialouge he is talking about whores.  <br /> <br />It really is refreshing to read the story of Gus and Call when they were young and don't know ANYTHING about tracking, shooting, women, and many other things. In Lonesome Dove these two are older men who have seen it all and done it all. In Dead Man's Walk, we get to read about the beggining of it all. <br /> <br />I am not a big western fan. In fact, Lonesome Dove was the first western I ever read. Imagine my suprise when I cried at twice reading that book and still to this day consider it in my top ten. While this book is no Lonesome Dove, it does not dissapoint and I am confident you will agree.	2004-09-04

Everything comes to a head in this last installment of the Sovereign Stone series. The book description sums up the plot and if you've read the previous two, you know where it's heading. A generic desciption would be Dagnarus makes his final play for the stone and the remaining Dominion Lords and other various heroes are there to attempt to stop him.  <br /> <br />What I really liked about this book (and I am not giving any spoilers) is in this one Dagnarus is fleshed out a little more than before. Either that or his character has grown and the reasons for doing what he has done are more apparent. At the end I \\"almost\\" felt sorry for him. The pace of the book is good with only a few slow spots where skimming came into play. I thought the Dragons were a bit under used but maybe Weis is just tired of writing about them (ie. Dragonlance). The character Shadamehr was introduced in the last book and his humour livened it up and while this book is a little darker, he still is the only character (besides the Orks in general) that is humorous at all. At times the lack of humour brought the books down a notch. But again, all in all a really good fantasy series and I do recommend it.	2004-08-27

The danger to the realm is much more dire than in the first book as Dagnarus now has an army plus numerous Vykrls at his command. But in typical fantasy tradition there are always heroes to rise to the challenge and defend their land. The characters in this book are very well written and a few even infuse the book with a little humour, something lacking in the first book.  <br /> <br />All in all this is a really good book and I can't wait to read the third and final book in this series.	2004-08-25

I am happy to say that this series (at least the first book as it's all I have read so far) is in the former category. It's not your typical fantasy novel in the sense that all the races are \\"redesigned\\", example; while elves are still long lived they procreate fast and are a warlike culture, Orken (Orcs) while still \\"barbaric\\" seeming are mostly found on the Ocean sailing, and Dwarves are all accomplished Horsemen and roam the land. <br /> <br />The story is fairly standard fantasy fare, complete with Gods, Mages, and magic stones but Weis and Hickman make the characters interesting and the villians even more so. Everything is not so black and white in the world and you never can tell which way things are going to fall. I recommend this book to all fantasy readers out there. While it's not groundbreaking and isn't in league with G. R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, it is a good read. I am pleased Weis and Hickman are still into world creating and not clinging to Dragonlance (although I do so love when  they dip back into it as all other Dragonlance authors stink...) <br /> <br />Anyways, I liked it and you probably will to.	2004-08-20

I picked it up expecting a quick easy read and while it was a quick read, I enjoyed every page of it.<br /><br />Basically, I don't want to give away anything about the book to you guys. Read the jacket of the book if you want to know what it's about or just trust me when I say it a great novel. I personally had no idea what was going to happen next and that's probably because I was hanging on every last word. You ever read a book and just know, I mean KNOW they are going to make this into a movie eventually? Well this is one of those books. I normally stick to the scf-fi/fantasy genre but I sure am glad I picked this one up (bought it for the wife actually who likes suspense and she made me read it). Sorry if this review doesn't go into detail on the plot but I truly think that it should be explored by you as I wouldn't want to ruin anything.<br /><br />Well, enjoy.	2004-08-14

I picked it up in a used bookstore and can't wait to delve into the rest of Stasheff's books.  <br /> <br />The hero Rod Gallowglass is one of the most enjoyable heroes I have read in a long time. His adventures on a world where elves and magic exist are one of a kind. When the book started I thought I misread the back of the book and was reading a science fiction story but the fantasy element soon came into play and they both combined to make a truly wonderful story. <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly.	2004-08-13

I have most of his books and I usually can't put his books down. I have to say though, I was dissapointed in \\"Once\\".  <br /> <br />First of all, I didn't like the main character Thom. Basically the ENTIRE book he either whines how what he is seeing can't be true or he is amazed that he gets \\"aroused\\" (he recently had a stroke). The character is never really fleshed out and the reader really feels no interest in him. The other characters are even more bland. The \\"plot\\" of the book and the twist at the end were ridiculously easy to figure out and there was no feeling of suspense and I never found myself wondering or even caring what was going to happen next.  <br /> <br />As far as the writing goes, Herbert does a good job describing things and making you almost able to visualize the Castle and it's forest but again since the plot was so bland, I really didn't care what the Castle looked like. The sex scenes are so so, not to frequent but really not contributing to the story. Most fantasy/sci-fi doesn't have many sex scenes and this might be a reason why as it does take away from the action and the story if not written well and the way Herbert writes the scenes in this novel they were more annoying than erotic.  <br /> <br />All in all I don't recommend this book and think you might like The Magic Cottage or one of his other novels instead. It was a good premise, a fairy tale for adults and it's too bad he couldn't make it work.	2004-08-12

It wasn't bad or anything but it was moving at a slow pace early on and I was itching to read some other authors books that I had on my shelf. I am glad I didn't put this one down. It is told almost entirely in first person and while that sometimes doesn't work, I feel this book wouldn't have worked if it wasn't told that way. It is also a stand alone fantasy novel and that originally turned me off as well as I have often found fantasy novels work best in a series form where we truly get to know the world we are reading and the characters.<br /><br />But this one was wonderfully descriptive and had suprising depth. I truly liked the characters and the idea of the main hero of the storyteller not being a warrior, wizard or a Knight but a Storyteller was intriguing. The storytellers are known in the book as a Rememberer or a Mnemonikos, and it is a prestigious rank as they can never forget anything. I found it original and not boring in the least as there was plenty of action to go around.<br /><br />Again this book does start off a bit slow in the sense that you don't really feel any attachment or interest in the main characters until about 60-100 pages in. Or maybe it was just me. But either way, once I got into the book I could not put it down. I recommend this book highly.	2004-08-06

It is your average end of the world story except in this book the action never lets up. I actually give it 3.5 only because I thought the author ended it rather quickly and I was dissapointed in that because he really had some great characters in the book that I wanted to read more about and find out more as to the reasons of Armegeddon starting but these things still did not diminsh my enjoyment of this book.  <br /> <br />If you like fast paced, end of the world, fantasy-horror books then I recommend this one.	2004-07-31

It has a bleak vision of the future in where America has adopted an almost 1984 Orwell feel to it and freedoms are routinely violated all in the name of protecting resources and believe it or not, Asia and Russia are the the lands of opportunity. Throw in a dab of mystery and government intrigue and a man with amnesia and five months missing from his life and you have a great story. <br /> <br />This is the first book I have read from this author and I am looking forward to reading more. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes mystery and sci-fi.	2004-07-30
US	27050307	R1V1OV18FLSBJG	0345384687	858634254	The Guns of the South	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Excellent Read	This was a very well done alternate history story about time travellers who go back and rearm the South with AK-47's to suit their own agenda. That little description does not even come close to describing how good this book is. The author obviously knows his Civil War history and it was very interesting to be reading a story involving Lincoln, Grant and Lee among other real life characters in a fiction story. <br /> <br />I also really liked the Sci-fi angle the book took and most of the time you can't go wrong with a What If? story involving time travellers. I hope he does a book in this flavor again as in this one he didn't go into detail about how the travellers got the time machine or how it works but he just went with the flow of the story. Along those lines, there are a million other scenarios he could do and if they are written as well as this one I will be sure to enjoy them. <br /> <br />Anyways, I recommend this book highly to anyone who likes Alternate History, Sci-Fi, and Civil War literature.	2004-07-29

The premise is a basic spy story, a KGB spy placed in America and awaiting activation who happens to end up being a sort of double agent with the CIA. Basic spy stuff and while interesting, it is nothing spectacular. <br />Oh, I forgot to mention this spy in question has invented a device (a watch) that can control people's minds, hypnotize them in a sense. Which mixed in with a spy book makes a great read. If you see this book in a used store or if hopefully it gets reprinted, grab it!	2004-05-06

He is a tough, no-nonsense guy who is prone to beat the (expletive) out of people who deserve it and he also has a heart. A nice guy vigilante. Doesn't sound possible but Wilson makes it work and every page makes the reader even more interested in what happens next. I also like how he sometimes incorporates a bit of the supernatural in his stories. Sometimes a lot more than a bit. <br />There is an underlying evil that I think will tie all of the novels together, the Adversary or the Otherness and Jack is supposed to be one of the people who stop it (all in later books I assume). In this one he has his hands full with other things though.<br />My only gripe (and it is a small one) is I wish there were more vigilante type scenes with Jack handling up on regular scumbags that don't tie into the main plot somehow. <br />Anyways, a great read and I recommend the series to anyone who likes action/mystery/X-files/ and even a tad of romance.	2004-04-22

Now to be fair I never read the third book, I just couldn't make myself. Like someone else said, I don't mind sex in books, pretty much nothing offends me but this series has so much unneeded sex scenes it is ridiculous. I got the feeling the only fans of this series would have to be sex addicts, people who like their characters written extremely shallow, or young teenagers who get a kick out of the sex scenes.<br />It keeps coming back to the sex scenes, they are like every third page and go on  and on and on and on and on...... The hero is a schlupp and the villian is laughable. I am never this harsh on a book usually but I am trying to hammer home to you people how bad this book and the first one are.<br />Do not waste your time!	2004-04-11

In this book he coninues right where he left off in Homonids. Boddit, Mary, and the rest of the characters return. We also see more of Boddit's world and Boddit unfortunatley sees more of ours. When compared to a world with no chaos, war, and senseless pollution, our world is rather embarressing. I also liked the religious questions raised and thought they were very thought provoking. There were only one or two things that weren't top notch but not diminish my overall enjoyment with this series.	2004-04-11

This was the first book I have read from Duncan and I thought it was a great tale. This story and the stories following are involve a group of swordsman called Blades as they are the Blades of the King. There is magic in this land in the form of conjurations and these swordsman are boned to either their King or someone he decrees by this form of sorcery. It ensures undying loyalty to their bonded. The main Hero of the Blades and the man this story is centered around is a man named Durendal and his adventures.<br />I found this approach to sword and sorcery very refreshing. It didn't seem as though he was rehashing your typical fantasy themes in different words. Instead this book feels very original and the writing doesn't wander aimlessly. This book is aptly called \\"A Tale\\" because thats what it is, a tale, a story; not a long, drawn out, piece of fluff but an action filled tale of loyalty, courage, honor, and friendship and I enjoyed it very much.<br />Also, there are three more books in this series so far (I am about to start the second) but this book has a beginning and an end. It doesn't have a cliffhanger like some other series, so you can be comfortable just buying the first book and if you agree with me and like it, you can get the others at your liesure.<br />Other authors you might like in this same genre; Paul Kearney, George R. R. Martin, Deborah Chester, David Gemmell, J.V. Jones, and Matthew Stover.	2004-03-20

It is an amazing look into what was a difficult time in American history and tells the story of several soldiers in Nam in such a way that the telling of this story will stay with you forever. The Vietnam war was a conflict this nation had never seen the like of before or since and this book is a must read for any one who harbours any illusions that the soldiers over there were doing wrong. They were our citizens, sons, brothers and fathers and the way this nation disregarded them makes me ashamed and glad I wasn't yet born to bear witness.<br />Anyways, I recommend this book and give it five stars.

I thought the character Rachel Sexton was a great character, as was Tollard. I also liked how the secret government agencies in this book have a bit more power and have more power and authorite than they seemed to in Digital Fortress.<br />None of the suprises in this book are truly shocking and if you pay close attention or you are no stranger to this genre than you won't find any unexpected suprises but I did think everything wrapped up nicely and the author did a very good job as far as story goes.<br />I recommend this book and I extrememly recommend Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. 4 out of 5	2004-02-20

It is never predictable, never boring, and always action packed. It is a fun series and there is no other one like it. I only wish more people would pick this up and read it so Simon never stops writing Deathstalker novels. The universe they take place in is like no other universe in any other books.<br />It might seem as though I am overhyping this book and this series, and I might be, but I feel like I can't say enough how much I have enjoyed this series.<br />This latest installment explains things from earlier books that weren't answered (things I had forgotten I once asked because so much is going on) and opens new questions as well (including a major one at the end). The twist at the end I never saw coming. Anyways, if you liked and have read the rest of the series, BUY THIS, it only gets better.	2004-02-20

The summary of the book is at the top so I'll skip that and just go to what a special book this is. It makes you think how every action you do in life has a reaction and it helps you appreciate the people in your life and accept them for who they are. I think this book is the type of book that comes along so rarely, it is the type of book that everyone would like. Fantasy/Sci-fi readers (myself), Classis Literature, regular fiction, thrillers, etc. this book transcends all that and touches something that every person on this planet will have to deal with, death and what comes after.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-02-16

Don't get me wrong, it is a good book and a fast read but there were several things that decreased the overall enjoyment of this book. For one the action seemed forced and the book was fairly predictable, also the book describes the NSA as being a mega powerful, top secret agency with far reaching powers but during the course of the book it seems as though this agency wasn't powerful nor even intelligent. In fact we only see three agents for most of the book. If you need to pass time on a flight or read a book while waiting for your doctors appointment, get this. If your expecting to be entertained and learn as well as enjoy yourself, get Angels and Demons.	2004-02-16

But about two hundred pages into the book I found myself suprised and actually ended up liking it a lot. But lately I have been busy and I found myself immersed in other series and haven't had the time to get the latest but after reading some of the &quot;anti-war&quot; people saying the book preached to much or hearing their inane rhetoric on why war is bad and how the USA is in the wrong and how Goodkind's latest novel was awful because he seems to disagree with them, I knew I had to buy it immediatley. I never understood how someone can read fantasy novels with themes like Good versus Evil, battles that bring out the best in men, justice, and honor but yet be such a coward and a pacifist in real life. <br />To each thier own I guess, but if your going to read a fantasy book that has action packed battles, political intrigue and a good versus evil, us versus them viewpoint, don't cry foul when it doesn't much up with your timid lifestyle. Some of us actually fight for whats right.	2004-02-06

This book takes place two hundred years after the last Deathstalker novel and the galaxy seems to be a better place. But everything is not as it seems and the same evils that plauged the last empire under Lionstone are surfacing here, just with new faces. I loved this book but that's no suprise as I loved the entire Deathstalker series. Lewis is the Deathstalker now as he was a distant cousin and someone had to be named Deathstalker but as the book goes on you can plainly see that he truly is a Deathstalker. The villians in this book are as heartless and as evil as Shub, Valentine, and the Recreated were at their peak. And the Terror.......what I know I won't say but I will say they are bad bad bad. If you have read the other books I know you'll get this one as well, so basically I am preaching to the choir here but I just had to say what an awesome read this was.

I was given a refund for the book on that principle alone. The book is more like a historical piece set in the mid 1600's. Unless it's an amazing book (as the reviews here would suggest) that's not my kind of book already. The only reason this book would possibly be a fantasy book is that the main characters of the book are all homosexual and that is not only accepted but the normal in this book.Not a real big fan of the Hero of a book getting in graphic sex scenes......over and over.<br />The action is bland and the whole book takes place in one little area. The political intrigue isn't really intrigue and overall I thought this book was incredibly boring. I think the reviews here are so glowing becuase some people simply love the fact of a homosexual hero and never let that novilty wear off otherwise they would have noticed the book was awful. If this was marketed in the Romance section, I would not be complaining.<BR>So if you like fantasy, go read George R R Martin, Tolkien, Gemmell, Weiss, Feist, Hobb, etc. but steer clear of this. If you like slow action, bizarre love stories, and a bland plot, but this. Just my opinion.	2004-01-30

These are the people who cringe when they see a car have the American Flag hanging from a window or the antenna. These are the people who get sick when they here of a school that let's kids pray on campus or even say the pledge because it has the word God in it. These are the liberals who proclaim to support womens rights but don't really care about what happens to the women of Iraq or Afghanistan or any other third world country. Liberals are liars and hypocrits among other things. If you listen to Sean or read his book you will hear him critisize Bush and other Conservatives from time to time because he is saying what he believes and not sticking 100% to party policies. You'll never hear a liberal say Bush has done something good. They are not open minded and they certainly don't hold their party to the same standards they hold everyone else to. I suggest you give this book a read and then make the judgement for yourself. I don't agree with everything Sean says, I don't agree with EVERYTHING anyone says. I think for myself and Sean happens to agree with me on many of the same issues.<br />If you read these post's on this site by the liberals you'll see the hatred and the fear. They don't like anyone who disagrees with them and they respond to that with hatred. Not a very noble response if you ask me but that's just my opinion. The fear part amuses me though, they are so scared of becoming obsolete and irrelevant as more and more people realize the liberals are in a small majority and most people disagree with them. Their power is their ability to cry louder than anyone else and that ability is starting to grate on the nerves of the American public and hopefully, that will show in the next election. Anyways, buy this book. You might learn something	2004-01-24

It is apparent that Brown has researched Vatican City and Rome extensiveley and it shows in his writing.

This book is so wonderful I cried numerous times while reading it, (not something I do often.) I lent it to my Father to read and he cried his eyes out. I just picked it up again today to reread and I thought I had to post a review to tell everyone how amazing it is. <br />The description at the top and the glowing reviews on this site don't even begin to compare with how great this book is. I hope I am not overly hyping this book because when that happens often people get let down but honestly, I don't see how it is possible to be let down from this book. <br />This is not like any of McCammon's previous work, so don't expect a thriller or supernatural horror story but do expect a magical wonderful book that will make you feel young again and appreciate life and the little things in life. <br />Zephyr is truly a place where magic lives.	2004-01-17

I thought the description on the back looked decent and I had no expectations going in, so I was very suprised when I discovered an extremely well written science fiction book about the future. <br />This book has several main characters and they are all interesting and well written and the secondary characters are almost just as good. The possible future that Mosley has laid out is terrifying and sad at the same time. Parts of this book simply scared the #$@! out of me. My city just started putting camera's on stop lights and this book had me thinking.....The author has some very fresh takes on the future, such as at work everything is translucent so every move you make can be filmed and analyzed, camera's are in your monitor's and your bosses watch you etc. <br />I am probably making this book sound a little 1984ish and it's not. There are some similarities but really this is a story about people and the human race and the slow but steady slide toward stagnation that we may be traveling. Also Race is a big part of this story but I did not think it overshadowed the main feel of the story.<br />An excellent read and I recommend it.	2004-01-15

I absolutely loved them. I imagine reading Earth X first would have illuminated certain areas of the story but everything was explained very well and I thought the story overall was great. I have always liked alternate reality comics, such as &quot;What If&quot;.....Peter Parker hadn't gotten bitten by the spider?......Germany used the super soldier formula first?....etc.etc. So when I saw a huge graphic novel written and drawn by Ross and Krueger I had to get it.<br />While Universe X mentions in passing what happened to some of the more mainstream hero's and villians in Earth X so you don't get lost, I have to go out tomorrow and buy it to get a more detailed account. I recommend this highly! This series is wonderfully drawn and extremely well told. I found it to be entertaining and very enlightening as Krueger's story was at times very philisophical.<br />Also, since this story is very complex, a high level of knowledge of the Marvel Universe and it's characters is recommended.	2004-01-09

The stories are centered on a Private Invenstigator who is also a Wizard. He battles Vampires, Werewolves, Mob bosses, Faeries, etc. and also has friends who happen to be all of the above as well. I like the fast pace of the books and I also like how Butcher has made all of the supernatural things happen in a modern, real world and we see the things happen but we choose not to believe them.<br />Just a couple of things kept this series as a whole from five stars. The character Murphy kind of gets on my nerves a bit. She is a cop friend of Harry, who is always in a bad mood and really doesn't act like a friend should. I think Harry takes way to much crap from her. <BR>Also, it seems like in each book Harry takes ALOT of punishment from various foe's in which the author describes how banged up Harry is and then the next page he is fighting a new foe. Not a big gripe or anything, I just wish it would be consistant.<br />Overall, a great series and you should read it if you like books like Simon Green's &quot;Nightside&quot; stories or Neal Gaimens &quot;Neverwhere&quot;	2004-01-09

This book explores much more of &quot;Nightside&quot; than the first book and furthers the mystery of Simon's mother. The plot is intriguing and well done.<br />You should be able to read this book in one sitting (if you have two or so hours to spend) as it is a short book much like it's predecessor but it is also a great read, much like the first one. I highly recommend it and hope there are many more in this series.	2003-12-19

This book sits at two hundred and thirty three pages but not a one is wasted. It is about a &quot;PI&quot; who has a gift finding things. The catch is that he is from a place that exists parallel to ours and Magic, Gods, Devils, Monsters and other assorted things exist there. This world is similar to Neil Gaiman's parallel universe and even has many similarities to Simon Green's other famous city of &quot;Haven&quot; set in his Hawk and Fisher novels.<br />I read this book in about two hours and I enjoyed it. It's not often I get a chance to read a really short book that's good and it is refreshing sometimes to have a book jump right to the point and not have pages upon pages of descriptive writing, not that that's bad or anything, it's just not necessary every time.	2003-12-18

That is not to say this book is only in the Action/Adventure category. It is very much a fantasy and sci-fi book as well. It has just the right blend of both to make this a truly worthwhile book.<br />I also liked how the book wrapped everything up nicely at the end and didn't leave the reader hanging. Which worked out great because the sequel wasn't as good anyways.	2003-11-20

Jack is coming to grips with his power and his destiny but takes several lumps along the way and Baralis is bringing his evil schemes to a head. Kylock isn't yet fleshed out in the book except for two quick glimpses and from what we see, he is one &quot;bad&quot; guy. Not a drop of good in him and I hope he gets it in a painful way in the third installment (which I am about to start tonight). Tawl is also going through some rough times but luckily he has Nabber with him to lessen some of the damage.<br />All in all a great book and I only had one or two minor dislikes. They did nothing though to make me dislike the book. Need a good fantasy book to read? Get this series.	2003-11-15

As long as the content of said acts is applicable to the storyline in the book and furthers the story, I am all for it. <br />But the violence in the first two books of the series is written weakly and there are pages upon pages upon pages in these books devoted toward pointless sex. I mean, get as graphic as you want but do it in a page or two and get on with the story. And don't keep throwing it in there every five pages. This series was very poorly written and I do not recommend it at all. The \\"hero\\" Damastes is one of the worst \\"good guys\\" ever. Not because he isn't that \\"good\\" but because his character is so boring and dim-witted. <br />In all fairness to the author, I didn't read the third book so I can't say if the series had a wonderful ending. But unfortunatly I bought all three at the same time and wasted every penny of it. <br />If you have a thing for badly written soft porn and horribly written action sequences, get this series. Otherwise, check out a fantasy series from a more talented author, like George R. R. Martin, J. R. R. Tolkien, Feist, Weiss, J. V. Jones, Kearney, Marco, or any other well received writer. This series stunk.	2003-11-14

It is basically an average fantasy book with above average writing and characters. <br />In this first book she concentrates mostly on introducting the reader into the characters and setting up the conflicts for the two books to come. But don't let that description lead you to believe this book has no action, because it has plenty. The book also has a snippet of humour here and there (two hilariously naive gaurds Grift and Bodger, come to mind) and in other parts the book is actually touching. I also liked how even the bad guys in the book had some redeeming qualities (Kylock excluded) and the good guys aren't exactly perfect.<br />This book and it's ensuing series may not be the best fantasy written, nor is it in the top 20, but it is still a great read and I recommend them strongly. Hope you enjoy them like I did.	2003-11-14

Alot of things are resolved in this book and as always, whenever Weber gets to the fighting, it is amazing. <br />But I must say, I am getting a bit tired of Honor. It was okay when she was an underdog and had challenges to overcome, but now she is one of the richest people in the universe, having telepathic powers, and being one of the highest ranking officers in the Grayson and Manticore Navies. Also, does Weber have to tell me how pretty she is in almost every page? I get the impression that Honor is starting to think she is better than everyone, from arguing with the Queen to receiving praise from EVERYONE, it is getting old.<br />But again, the battles with the peeps are top notch.	2003-10-30

Not only does the name Ann Coulter cause liberals to froth at the mouth and start spouting nonsense (as opposed to what they normally spout) but the book itself is very insightful. I love how she points out the many double standards of Democrats and liberals, and how they claim the high road, when in reality they are either cowards, traitors, mislead, greedy, lying, pampered, HYPOCRITS! Please get this book and then buy Treason. Out of the entire book of quotes, facts, etc. she has documented how she got everything and only made one mistake (the Earnhart death not being on the front page) and she corrected that immediatley after the book was released and I find it so funny that the people who say te book is a lie throw this tidbit out there. Out of everything she said about Cheating Clinton and Cowardly Carter and other quality liberals, thye throw that example out there and say with a straight face since she made that mistake the rest of the book is a lie as well.<br />Stop listening to the idiots who buy Micheal Moore and get this book.	2003-10-23

He is starting to feel time weigh on him and he embarks on a quest (with another great character Skilgannon) that just defines him as one of the best &quot;heroes&quot; ever. This book follows the same track as most of Gemmell's books, larger than life heroes, evil villians, people who started out good than got caught up in power and greed and became &quot;evil&quot;, people who did evil things in the past and are trying to purge the guilt out by only doing just things (or following a &quot;code&quot;) etc. <BR>I love how his heroes aren't perfect, they make mistakes and do things some heroes shouldn't but they have honor and courage and they try to do the right thing in the face of great adversity.<br />Gemmell hasn't written a book yet that I did not like and I don't see him doing so any time soon.

Micheal Moore is a miserable filmaker (his one venture into &quot;fiction&quot; filmaking was a horrible movie called &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; and it was a huge bomb)and an even worse author. He distorts facts and truths to fit his twisted version of what is happening in the US and abroad. His arguements and views are so skewed that it is I wonder if anyone actually listens to him or if they just buy his &quot;work&quot; because they share hating Bush with Moore. <br />Moore ignores anything the left does wrong, any lies they have made, bad policy decisions they have made (and make), ignores anything good done by Bush and any other official of the right, and focuses totally on the negatives. This is the guy who thought we should have done nothing after 9/11. He thought we were &quot;war-mongering&quot; by going after Al-Quaida in Afghanistan. <br />Don't buy this book and support this idiot.<BR>Get Sean Hannity's book instead. Makes a lot more sense as far as I am concerned.	2003-10-17
US	27050307	R20JQRTF8BATMS	0451459350	388434684	Drinking Midnight Wine	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Excellent book!	I think Simon Green's Deathstalker series is one of the best Space Opera, Sci-fi, and Action series out there. So when I saw he was also writing outside that genre, I knew I had to grab it. (For the record, I also love his Hawk and Fisher stories.)<br />This is an excellent book and although it seems to set up sequels, it is a stand alone book. He takes this novel into our present day, which he hasn't done before, but with a nice twist. There is another world that exists parallel to ours that is full of magic. This world wasn't fleshed out enough in this book and hopefully we will see more of it in future installments, but what was shown of it just leaves you hungering for more. The characters are wonderfully written, my favorite being Johnny Thunder (who is a decsendant of the Norse God Thor) but all are equally well written. The main character of the story is a sort of reluctant hero, much like Owen was in the beginning of the Deathstalker series, but he grows into his role soon enough.<br />The only other book that I can equate this to is Neil Gaiman's &quot;American Gods&quot; but to be honest, I liked this book a bit better. Good work Simon and keep it up.	2003-10-11

I didn't have high hopes for it (most of the books that get recommended to me turn out to be of the Koontz &amp; King variety, you know, not good) but I read this as it looked like it had an interesting premise. <br />After the fifth page I could not put this book down. It is simply a smooth, fluid, action packed, beautifully written book and I loved it. Even more amazing is it was this authors first book. I hear there is a movie adaptation of this book and although I haven't seen it, I can't imagine someone watching it without reading this book first. I returned the book to him today and ordered a copy for myself soon after. I don't give five stars to just any book but I think this one deserved it, if I could give six I would.	2003-10-09

You basically know the premise of the book already from the other reviews and have most likely read Ender's Game and loved it (else why are you looking at this book?), so all I can add is this is a great book.<br />I always thought the books after Ender's Game didn't have the same spark and was never to fond of them,  (I can't even remember what Xenocide was about!) but I saw this book and when I realized it was taking place at the time of the Formic war when Ender did what he does best, I thought I had better read it. The fact that it takes place from another perspective and sort of gives you a behind the scenes look at Ender's Game makes this an even better read. So quit reading this and read this book.	2003-09-26

As a comedic writer for SNL he was marginally better. As a political activist, he fails miserably. Though maybe I am biased. I don't agree with basically anything that is in this book and I am grateful he has no say whatsoever in the policies of this nation.<br />Just the fact that he thinks the idea of a &quot;Liberal media&quot; is a lie started by the right who actually own the media speaks volumes for how deep his hatred and ignorance of the &quot;right&quot; is.<br />My advice,<BR>Skip this book.	2003-09-11

This is the first book in the series that wasn't excellent (the next one isn't too hot either.)<br />Let me clear the air on what I liked and what I didn't. I like Honor and think she has been so far a great character. I don't like how every single person in the book idolizes her and thinks she is the best thing that has happens since space travel. She is coddled constantly and she acts as though it is her due. Also I am getting tired of Grayson. There is an entire universe to explore in these books and it always comes back to how special this planet is, how hard their people work compared to everyone else, how tough they are and how smart they are. Enough already Weber. We get it.<br />I do like how the Peeps are in this one a bit more and the political side of the war for them is explored in greater detail. (even though half the peeps seems to be starstruck by Honor as well and in love with her.....) The battles were also well done. I am going to read the 9th book Ashes of Victory and I seriously hope it is better that 7 and 8 and goes back to earlier themes and not this Honor can do no wrong theme that is currently bogging this series down.	2003-09-06

I was really impressed by Graham's writing and imagination and think if the rest of the series continues as this first book did, we might have a supurb fantasy series on our hands. It isn't in the same leauge as Martin, Gemmell and Tolkien (my personall fav's) but so far Graham can definitly hold his own with Weiss, Feist, or Kearney. <br />I thought the hero was very fleshed out and his enemy the King Duren as well. As far as villians go, he was a pretty good one. Also I like how the book wasn't bogged down in magic (not that that's not ok once in a while) but it had just the right element of it. He left alot of things open to explain in the next books as well (such as what happens to the owners of those rings and their civilization?) I won't say anything else for those who haven't read the book yet except, go get it. Today.	2003-09-06

I loved the rest of the series and except for some slow spots gave this series a solid four out of five stars. Ten pages into this book and I had to take a double look at the front to make sure I had the right author. I can't think of a single reason why this book is getting good reviews here on Amazon but I just have to clear the air in case someone has the idea to read this book to cap off a great series. Skip it.<br />I still have about fifty pages to go but even if the ending is wonderful and totally takes me by suprise it still won't make up for this book ever having been written. Now just so it doesn't seem like I am giving such a negative review for no reason, I will tell you why it is so awful.<BR>First, it is very repetitive. You basically know what is going to happen at every turn and even if you didn't, it really is boring. Also, this introduction of Vita, the new underage character who loves sex (not being paid, just doing it for free) is very annoying. As a character she is pretty shallow. Actually all the characters in this book are shallow. Orlene has to ask all the incarnations for a favor and EACH one tests her before they give her the item or perform the favor she asks, even though they all basically are related to her (Mother, Grandmother, Father, Stepfather, Lover, etc.). Very unrealistic (I know it's fantasy but c'mon, a little real human emotion wouldn't hurt.)<br />And the asking of favors and the testing her (them, actually but that is another boring aspect of this book I won't get into) is literally 200 pages. You know she will get the items in the end, so why strech it out? Why have Vita/Jolie/Orlene banging away with the Judge for pages on end? Boring, Boring stuff Piers and I wish you would have stuck to your guns and not wrote this piece, or at least tried to make it interesting.	2003-09-04
