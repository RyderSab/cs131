I immediately fell in love with the hero, Bo, and the heroine, Amber.....and most especially, with Bo's Mom whose personality is a reflection of my own... <br />   A fantastic story that had the right blend of humor, romance and mystery, which is a big bonus in a romance book, in my opinion! <br />   Amber Delaney wanted to find out why her good friend committed suicide....she also had a good reason to get out of town and do some sleuthing on her own.....Bo was back at his family's Texas ranch after his company was caught in a scandal....After rescuing Amber, whose car was broken down near his ranch, he brought her back and there starts a barrel full of laughs as well as good suspense..... <br />   The interactment between the characters, and the lovingly interference Bo's Mom was guilty of, made for sheer pleasure reading.....Bo is my type of hero......strong, willful, intelligent....a bit macho, but not over the edge.....Amber is the type of girl any of us would like to have for a friend... <br />   I've only read a handful of multi-cultural books, and have enjoyed them....but I've really \\"connected\\"  to this author's style and wonderful sense of humor....I'm definitely adding her to my \\"auto-buy\\" list...	2005-08-17

How impressed I was with this author's voice....intelligently written with the perfect blend of romance, suspense, mystery, thrills, and lots of twists to keep me on the edge of my seat! This book didn't give any clues away to allow us readers to determine the true villain(s)....quite a feat, in my humble opinion.... <br />   A small west Texan town setting....a worried, yet determined, heroine, Susan Maddox, who is fighting for her teaching job which was going to be terminated.....who was trying desperately to clear her name from being a suspect in her husband Brian's disappearance eight months before, when he ran off with the banker's wife...and his family's car dealership funds... <br />   An ex-brother-in-law, Luke, a tech whiz, and the fellow who, back in highschool, took her virginity one night in the back of his caddy...A high-faluting, bitter ex-mother-in-law who is helping the fingers to be pointed in Susan's direction....an ailing mother who needs assurance and understanding...the local banker,husband of the woman who ran away with Brian, left to be the caretaker of their young son....the local old-fashioned sheriff....these are just a few of the complex characters whose lives are intertwined..... <br />   A crashed hard drive from Brian's puter might just exonerate Susan.....IF Luke could break into it and obtain any information on it... <br />   House intruders.....hang-up phone calls..... a sinister watcher...Susan has these, and more, to contend with.....while fighting her inner desires towards Luke!  <br />   Watching how this mystery enfolded, made me tune out all other distractions around me.....I couldn't put the book down until it was finished..many twists and turns had me thinking first \\"this person is involved\\" then later on thinking it was someone else.......This author is a truly talented lady, and one whose books I will now glom......I'm clammering for more already!   <br />	2005-08-17

It had me crying, and at other times I felt anger and impatience and incredulity.... <br />   It is the story of Milla Edge, who ten years before, had her infant son, Justin, stolen while they were in a market in Mexico, where she and her doctor husband were living....She didn't just give up the baby without a fight, she almost lost her life trying to proect him!  <br />  Her marriage fell apart due, in part, to her obsessiveness over her baby's abduction... She eventually founded an organization that worked closely with the police called \\"Finders\\"....they help locate missing people, especially children.....She also was constantly trying to find out who \\"Diaz\\" was....as she thought he knew something about the kidnapping... <br />   Ten years later:  She finally gets to meet Diaz, a feared assasin/bounty hunter......one of the DARKEST heroes you'll meet in any book (and one of the sexiest!)  They team up together to eventually get the villains!  The sexual electricity between the h/h is so intense, I felt it right through the pages! <br />   I found it easy....too easy....to know who some of the villains were....hence, I deducted one of the stars from the rating.....I also had a bit of a problem with her handling of the situation when she finally discovered what had happened to her son....I, as a mother, know I would have done the exact opposite to what Milla did.....and yet, I applaud her for being strong enough to do SO..... <br />  This book is for anyone to read....you don't have to be a Howard fan to do so, as this is not typical of her usual style....just make sure you have some tissues nearby!  <br />	2004-08-15

Honestly!  However, I didn't even chuckle once while reading this....I wanted to throw it against the wall I was so irritated.....but I forced myself to finish it, hoping I'd find something to like about it...some witty dialogue perhaps?  Nope, didn't find it. <br />  I've read lots of book with fairytalelike settings and loved them.....unfortunately, I found this author's writing to be choppy and uninteresting.....if I read her again, I'll buy a used copy......	2004-08-15

And what WAS the BIG plan????? (was it the botched bank heist?  Don't think so...)  What about Max's connection to the dead girl, his ex-lover?  WHO murdered her and WHY?  I can speculate, but I'd like the author to have given us some answers...... <br />  Only the author knows these things......Maybe she was rushed to finish the book???   <br />  Another detraction I felt was the constant use of the \\"F\\" word.....it never bothers me when I think it necessary, and/or adds to the story....what DID boyher me was that EVERY person spoke like that, including Grace, the prosecuting attorney!  It seemed way out of character for her in my opinion..... <br />  Will I buy the next h/c from this author?  Of course!  I just won't be in as much of a hurry as I have been in the past....	2004-08-14

The bantering double entendres between Reade and Jackie couldn't have been better..........so very reminiscent of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson and Hepburn/Tracy comedy movies I adore!

A heroine who has a very important decision to make before her 25th birthday.....you see, Zoe Smith is a halfling.......her mother is a mortal, her dad a Protector (from Greek and Roman mythology) and that makes Zoe a &quot;goddess&quot;....If she decides to become a complete mortal, she'll lose all memory and association with her dad and half-brother, Hale..... If she decides to become a Protector (rescuing mortals from various perils, such as fires, car crashes and the likes) she must pass various tests without any advanced notice...AND she must tell her mortal mom, who, years ago, left her husband when she found out he was a Protector!   As if Zoe didn't have enough problems, enter George Bailey Taylor, ex-cop, now turned PI...........as soon as Zoe saw him, her insides were turned all around.....she knew she wanted him, but how could she possibly make love to a man, especially a mortal, when she practically burns at the slightest touch!  Imagine the heat emanating when making love!   Besides having to make these difficult decisions, Zoe had another job...........unbeknownst to her, the fate of the entire human population was in her hands!  Could she save the world??  Could she get her man??  Could she learn how to levitate objects properly??   This book had everything...zaniness, romance, tenderness, unique plot, laughter on every page, best group of characters (including Deena and Hoop from The Cat's Fancy) who could play off each other, thrills,plenty of action, and villains!! ........It reminds me of the great screwball comedies of the 30's....only better (and funnier!) It's the work of a genius (or, at least, of an author who must have been a great stand-up comedienne in another life)   This author hasn't disappointed me yet....for some reason, even though she writes romantic comedies, her characters  not only keep me having to cross my legs from laughing so hard, but they also  warm the cockles of my heart......I find them unforgettable, likeable and certainly not the run-of-the-mill type of heroes/heroines!! I do believe that the author, herself, is not an ordinary author...she, too, is exceptional!   Julie Kenner is one extremely talented woman, whose books I just can't get enough of....I truly and highly recommend this book to one and all!

Abby Di Matteo was  a second year resident at Bayside Hospital in Boston when she was chosen to  be part of the cardiac transplant team....    When she discovered that a  heart was to be given to a rich man's wife, rather than a young 17 year old  boy who was next in line, both Abby and Dr. Chao, took drastic  measures....which had immediate repercussions!    Finding donor records as  being falsified, and knowing that some hearts aren't coming through the  correct channels, Abby starts an investigation........    Since I first  read Harvest when it came out in hardcover in 1996, the details and  characters have stayed with me....this is a book that one can't  forget..........it's an &quot;edge of the seat&quot; thriller, which is  even scarier knowing that it's so easy for this to happen in real  life.............Gerritsen's knowledge of the medical field shines through  without all the jargon that we lay people can't understand!   No matter  where I am, at weddings, wakes, bookstores, beaches, if I see or know  someone who reads, I always recommend any Tess Gerritsen book, so long as  it includes Harvest!!     Better than Cook, Crichton, or Palmer, and they  are great authors, I assure you............This book is a MUST read.....

The dead man's  brother, Chase Tremain, anonymously posts bail without knowing if she was  the murderer or not....hoping to keep an eye on her, he has doubts about  her guilt when he witnesses some attempts on her life!...that is, unless  she's a good actress!!   I liked the emotional roller-coaster  ride..........great climax!	2000-08-22

This book kept me  on the edge of my seat..........a madman who likened himself to the great  Fred Astaire, and his victims to his dancing partner, Ginger  Rogers......this is one of those books that actually made goosebumps appear  on my arms!   Erin and Darcy, best friends,move to NYC together. While each  one of them has their own career, they decided to help a tv  producer who  was doing a documentary on newspaper personal  columns....a study as to  what type of people place and answer these ads; their experiences, good or  bad....   In six weeks of meeting people, they each had some funny stories  to tell.....it all seemed so innocent.,...until the night Erin disappeared  after meeting someone who placed an ad....Her body was found on a pier in  Manhattan, and she was wearing one of her shoes, and one very fancy high  heel shoe.....   Darcy delves into finding out who killed her best  friend...not knowing that she is the murderer's next victim!   This book is  typical MHC style..........plethora of characters to keep us guessing  .......... a building up of tension as the pages fly by.......... a twisted  ending.........   This book has been recommended soooooooo many times by me  to soooo many people.........I've lent out my two copies and I bought quite  a few for presents.....no matter how great her other books are, this is THE  one that's at the top of my list!!   Oh, by the way, don't count on going  to bed at night, until you finish the book..........it's one you can't put  down!!	2000-08-20

This is my  favorite book in the series.......well, actually, EACH Christine Bennett  book is my favorite!  However, I strongly suggest you get your own copy and  sit down for a few hours....once you start this, you won't be making dinner  or cleaning the house till you finish!!   I suggest reading the series in  order if you can, as the author develops the relationship between Christine  and Jack Brooks, a policeman, so realistically that you won't want to wait  long before reading the next one!!      My oldest daughter is reading this  series along with me and we've spent many an hour over a cup of tea,  discussing Christine Bennett!!!

A  brutal murder of a lovely 15 year old girl in Seward Island in the pacific  northwest..........sounds like the beginnng of a great  mystery...........However, the author then went on to concentrate on  anti-Semitism rather than a building up tension, and we knew from the first  who the murderer was......she also left unanswered questions (i.e. just  what WAS going on behind Malcom Purdy's fenced in abode?.........and what  did it even have to do with the story??....) ...It was also totally out of  character for Ginger, a policewoman on the case, to do such a dishonest  thing as to play with the evidence.....see was seen as a morally,  intelligent, law-abiding person.....one who would have even turned in her  lover or family if they were guilty of a crime..........   I'm not saying  the book isn't a good read......it was filled with excitement and  backgrounds on some interesting characters....it's just that it could have  been so much more had she spent less time trying to jam the bigotry issues  down our throats!	2000-08-13

Finally, a romance book that has intelligent and sophisticated characters instead of the so-common &quot;whiners&quot; and &quot;alphas&quot;...... I  LOVED THIS BOOK!   Even readers who shy away from so-called  &quot;romances&quot; will be satisfied....   Five years before, Nick  Tremaine left his love, Chance Macauley, without an explanation.......She  didn't know he thought he had Huntington's disease and didn't want her  pity.... luckily, that proved not to be the case........   Chance is a  senior copywriter for SLF, a Boston advertising  company.......she is  thrilled that the company has a chance to  nab the Martin Foods account, as  she is hoping to financially help her aging parents find a permanent home  in Arizona, for health reasons.   The new account manager hired to help  them with the project is none other than Nick!  Here's where this story  differs from most others..........rather than &quot;you said, you did, you  didn't&quot; bantering back and forth, or each one trying to hurt the  other, this author showed both Nick and Chance to be smart enough to keep  their hurt hidden, and carry on in a businesslike and intelligent manner.    The team was sent up to Vermont where they could better concentrate on the  campaign.  Upon arrival, Chance slipped on ice and was taken to the  emergency room by Nick.  After leaving the hospital, they encountered a  severe snowstorm and weren't able to make it back safely to the cabin where  the others were. Instead, Nick took her to his cabin which was  closer...There they finally got to rekindle the love they felt for one  another....the author knows how to get us to hold our breath during love  scenes, that's for sure...Chance and Nick didn't just fall into bed  together - rather the storyline kept building up the sexual tension until  it was almost too much to bear without satisfying itself!   I loved  everything about this book, from the gorgeous front cover with white birch  trees and snow laden ground, to the last page of this well-written  romance!   This reader can't wait till her next one, due out next year,  called Luck of the Toss!	2000-08-13

Christine is an intelligent,  considerate, warm person who has slowly built up an intimate relationship  over the course of the books, with police-detective Jack Brooks....she  still has kept her friendship up with nuns from the convent and visits them  frequently....There is not a thing NOT to like about Christine, Jack, nor  this series....

With the help of Jack Brooks, a local policeman, Christine solves  this first of many mysteries.....at the same time they are realizing they  each have feelings for the other....(this is only the beginning of a great  relationship.......)

What can I say of a book that I read awhile back, but that will stay with  me forever??  This book is reminiscent of Woodiwiss's The Wolf and the Dove  without the bodice ripping........also much more likable characters......    Gunnar Rutledge saw his parents killed by Baron Luther d'Bussy...it took  him 13 years to devise a plan of revenge...however, upon traveling to  Norworth Castle to take part in the Baron's yearly tournament where he  planned on killing the Baron, he changed his mind after seeing the man who  has aged greatly, and seemed much more mellow.....instead he saw an  opportunity to kidnap the Baron's daughter, Raina.......\   What wonderful  and likeable characters Gunnar and Raina were....yes, there was conflict  between them...,.she couldn't understand why he would want to make up lies  about her father being a cold-hearted murderer.........but eventually she  did understand what drove him to want vengeance.....she also saw through  his facade and fell in love with the man who wasn't afraid to show her  compassion, thoughtfulnes, and consideration (and especially during the  violent times of the 12th century!)    Raina was so lovely a character,  beautiful inside and out...and Gunnar couldn't help but fall in love with  her....   Without giving too much away, let me state that this story has  everything...........a mean and calculating villain, great secondary  characters (we need a sequel!!) the best love story I've read in years, and  a thundering climax (both figuratively and literally!).........   Gone With  the Wind has been my top best romance of all time - Lord of the Vengeance  is my second!!  I've been reading romances for about 40 years now, and no  matter how many more I get to read, this one will NEVER be  forgotten.........as a matter of fact, I'm not one to re-read books, but in  this case, I'll make an exception.

Her newest book, The Waterfall, has something for  everyone - - great dialogue (especially between Lucy and her kids),  beautiful setting, very realistic and likeable hero/heroine, suspense, and  of course, romance..........Now who could ask for more??   Three years ago  when her husband died, Lucy moved herself and her two children from  Washington, DC to a quaint farmhouse in  Vermont.  She owned an  &quot;adventure&quot; travel agency and was planning on taking a tour to  Costa Rica, but forcing herself to make a stop in Wyoming first, to see  Sebastian Redwing, her husband's friend and security agent........Colin  Swift had made Lucy promise that if she ever was in trouble, she would go  to Sebastian..........and, with all the bizarre happenings lately, she had  no other choice......she had been getting late-night phone calls and  hangups, and a bullet was found inside her car.....     Sebastian had loved  Lucy for years even though he didn't let her know.........and even though  he was hesitant to help, he did go back to Vermont to protect her and find  out who was the culprit......    We know who the villain is from the  beginning, but it doesn't detract from the wonderful read.......it builds  up to a great climatic ending..    This author not only uses cute  one-liners, she draws the reader right into the story.......I felt as  though I was Lucy, feeling her emotions - her fears - her  happiness.........

Her naivete' rather shone through her attempts at phone sex........as a reader, I knew she didn't enjoy doing it, but got talked into it by her friend........and she DID rather enjoy it once she got the hang of it &lt;bg&gt;........  Liked both Georgia and Ken Medlock, the policeman whose number she auto-dialed by mistake.........I can see why he didn't have the heart to tell her he wasn't Rob (her boyfriend).......he wasn't kinky, he was more embarrassed (and yes, he did enjoy it also).........Sparks flew the next day when he first met her at the emergency room at the local hospital, where he brought an injured dog to be treated......... You honestly have to read this book to form your own opinion... I thought it had everything - - realistic and likeable hero/heroine (albeit sexually frustrated ones); lots of mix-ups (reminiscent of the 1930-s screwball comedies); laughs galore; and what more could we ask for, than a cute doggie??  Oh, and did I mention, steamy (phone) sex scenes???  This is one romance book I'm sure my two (married) daughters will be happy to borrow from me.......... 	2000-08-12
