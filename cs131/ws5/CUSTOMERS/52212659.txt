Lots of simple ideas very well explained. He  spells out the notion of pattern quite well, and what it means in terms of mathematics. It seems many modern authors just state that math is about patterns and leave it at that. He seems to get to the point on many subjects that a reader has in the back of his mind as he reads about the material.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure this book is really intended for the layman. I'm sure many could handle it. Certainly the material is kept at a very introductory level, but he does seem to be talking to the teacher quite often, and some times to the budding mathematician. <br /> <br />My Dover edition doesn't have an index. Too bad. Hard to believe there wasn't one, or should be one. A little bit of laziness on Dover's part? <br /> <br />I have one bone to pick about a short piece of material. He claims Del Square V is the most widely found pattern in nature,   <br />pp. 13-14. He mentions its applications in physics, magnetism, electrostatics, radiation, waves, etc. I'm sure he's thinking of Del dot Del of V. Oddly, he never describes to the lay reader what it actually is. It seems out of place with the material in the rest of the book.) Anyway, he does provide a foot note, which in part says, \\"It expresses in symbols the law that the value of V at any point equals the average value of V on a sphere with its center at the point. That law treats all points and directions alike, and is the simplest law that does so.\\" Good luck to the layman on that one. <br /> <br />--	2005-08-03

Maltin is by far the best movie viewer of any available. I believe there is a large print version of this for those who do not like small print. Some day I'm sure Maltin will have to break his book into two volumes, put into a even larger format (8x10) or put it on a CD. There are just too many movies to get them all in a book. I applaud his attempt. It's good to have a source that attempts to get them all. Maybe Video Hound is another contender for at least attempting to do what Maltin does. Do I hear a sawing sound?  <br /> <br />As for the \\"Bag O Sha\\" review above, I hope that Amazon has a weighted average that includes a weighting for \\"Did you find this review useful?\\" At least, \\"Bag O\\" declared his intention.	2005-04-25

I'm only 2/3 of the way through the book but thought it would be worth posting a review before completing it for one reason. The reason is that all the many links found in the book do not need to be entered in by hand. The authors recently put the complete list of links on their web page. This makes it a lot more enticing to go off and explore illusions and support information. <br /> <br />I liked the idea of the book, and when I started reading it, it seemed somewhat unengaging. Somewhere after the first 10 hacks or so that changed. I guess I started developing a feel for what it was all about. It's sort of textbook-ish, but nevertheless very interesting. Sort of like a lab manual and you are the lab. <br /> <br />I think other reviewers have given a pretty fair idea of what it's about, so I'll only make a few comments. <br /> <br />I think it's worthwhile reading their comments sprinkled among the references. There's some very good info there and suggestions  about further reading.  <br /> <br />A real show stopper item is how we use the external world as a database to help us see. That's a real twist. See the J. Kevin O'Regan web article, Hack #40. That reminds me. Some of the illusions on the web, particularly those on change blindness, are a little tricky. A good illustration is in this article. There's a section (single line actually) called \\"slow motion\\". You probably won't notice what happens in the animation until it stops, and you try to restart. Suddenly it jumps out at you. My point is that sometimes you have to fidget awhile with the computer. This is not a fault of the book. <br /> <br />Another show stopper (to me at least) is the experiment discussed in the chapter on integration, Hack #61. It appears that language is necessary to integrate information from our senses. In this case, geometry and color. <br /> <br />As of this writing, it's unfortunate the publisher hasn't yet put some of the book online. There are a few items I would like to searchfor that I did not highlight and cannot find in the index. The index is, however, quite good. <br /> <br />Another good current read on the mind is \\"Blink\\" by Malcolm Gladwell. <br /> <br />P.S. I'm looking for the story about the pilots.	2005-03-29

Suddenly it appeared in the middle of some end of the movie features. It was absolutely delightful. I bought the book for my nephews, but could not find it on video. For almost a year now, I've been trying to get anyone's attention, including the author's, TCM and some animators. It was supposed to be shown Feb. 14 on TCM, but I didn't become aware of until Feb. 20th, and was supposed to shown again March 6th. It wasn't. However, supposedly it will be released as a short on the Doris Day \\"Glass Bottom Boat\\" DVD scheduled for April 26, 2005. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Too bad Amazon doesn't provide some other mechanism for me to note this to others than as a review.	2005-03-27

Sometimes the cartoon style gets in the way. Sometimes there's a sizable jump in thinking from section to section. Still, all in all, it's a good read for an introduction to the subject. I did like the Mendel treatment very much. A good story that's very illustrative of how the basics work.    However, my main point in writing this review is that it could use a little updating. I have the \\"Updated\\" edition, which was written in 1991. It's 2005 and the references are way out of date. Check with Amazon to find out if the edition they are selling has a more recent set of references. Despite the age of the book, the material is pretty much independent of recent changes. Amino acids, proteins, Mendel, DNA are still the same today. Some reviewer mentioned that human gene count is out of date. 200,000 in the book vs 20-30K from recent data. OK, but the ideas are still the same. Nevertheless, a newer edition would be welcome.    I would have given the book 4 stars, but the age took away one of the stars.    It's now 2011, and I've occasion to come back to this book. The reason being I came across the Khan Academy of educational videos on the web, and available on YouTube. There is a complete set on genetics.  Although, I've only watched two of the set, I'd definitely suggest the set as a good starting point for those who want to learn more about genetics.  I think Khan himself adds more to the story that's missing here.     I have no college training in biology, but in the 2 or 3 intro books I'm aware of on genetics, there seems to be a difference in how one approaches the modern part of genetics.  Things have certainly changed since Cartoon was published.	2005-02-22

It covered a lot of interesting historical material as well as the main topic. Two items stand out in my mind, but there are many others: 1. the Foucault pendulum discovery severed the ties between science and church. It overturned the Aristolean view the church held that the earth did not move. This is a very important historic event. 2. The event that happened on Dec. 2, 1851. Louis-Napoleon, the elected president of France, overthrew the government and declared himself ruler as Napoleon III. It may seem a stretch, but this may have parallels in our political future of this country. Napoleon III had a strong desire to make France over in the manner he desired. Can we think of someone in our country (U.S.) who might want a make over? Hmmm. Although my background is in mathematics, I liked the historic interplay between the physcists and mathematicians who were essentially insulted and embarrassed by the Foucault discovery.  <br /> <br />Another reviewer above was not happy with the book and remarked that the science was wrong. It would have been good if he gave some references or other details why he felt that way. If one is bent on a scientific treatise about this, perhaps a book like Waves, Vol. 3, of the Berkeley series on physics would fill the needs the reviewer and others. It might be a worthwhile to pass his claims by a newsgroup such as sci.physics.	2004-12-28

A very worthwhile read if you are concerned about our environment, and how it is being trashed behind our (public) back by the Bush administration. The same could be said of our democracy. That is, it's being trashed as well.  <br /> <br />The reviewer who mentioned Bjorn Lomborg should note that Scientific American magazine has argued strongly in several past issues of the magazine against the nonsense peddled by Bjorn Lomborg, in which his book, incidentally, must have set the world record for footnotes.	2004-11-09

He certainly cites enough documents, but, not too unexpectedly, they seem to talk to human events rather than of anything technical. It's good to know about how the sixteen points came about, but he offered no explanation about what I consider the somewhat bizarre naming of the points. Maybe I'm missing something, but is the scheme for name ordering the points between, say, N and E, the same as from, say, E to S?  <br /> <br />The section of Flavio Gioia left me almost as confused about the supposed inventor of the 'modern' (1302?!!) compass as the Italians who erected a statue in 1902 to this apparently fictional character. The name Gioia appears from nowhere. <br /> <br />I would like to have more detail about how early navigators actually did some of their navigation, but what he did supply was still interesting. Not too long ago I was in the Maritime Museum in Greenwich, and saw some interesting devices the Scandinavians used. Unfortunately,  a huge crowd of students made it difficult to really figure out and even see what the exhibit had to offer. It would have been good to see the detail offered there expressed in such a book as this. <br /> <br />I found a section near the very end of the book a little puzzling. He talks about how the Chinese were very secretive about their discoveries, and mentions they had a cure for malaria for some two centuries. Only recently has it become known to the West. It's based on a herb that's not only found in China but in N. America. He never mentions what it is! This is somehow how I felt about the book. It seemed to leave the door open for other answers to items discussed in the book.	2004-11-03

Everything generally looks so peaceful and calm in wildlife areas, but there's poaching, crookedness, thievery and associated danger to animals and game wardens not often heard. These are not simple stories of a warden just ticketing offenders for catching more than their limit. Each chapter is a different story, so one can read whatever story has appeal. This simple organization can wear thin after awhile. It seems like good material for a TV series on his life. Could have used some pictures. Maybe the hardback (if there is one) had them. Often they are omitted from paperbacks.	2004-10-27

It has a good sized map of Oregon in the front with the various trips represented as a dot with a number in it. There are no city or county indications on the map. If you wanted to look for trips in Bend, you'd be guessing what trips are there. There are regional maps in the back, but I don't think there is an index into them. You just have to hunt around. I was thinking of kayaking in Bend on the stretch of the Deschutes from Wiki Up reservoir to Bend, the first easy section, which stops at the falls about 8 miles downstream. It shows the stretch on one map as easy but no mention is made of how to get there or what to expect. <br /> <br />It has a rather large index to its credit.	2004-10-18

I found it an interesting and well researched description of Bridger's life. It has both an excellent index and references. The author gave a fair and balanced assessment of Bridger. It appears that some previous books on him might have been unfair or too praiseworthy about his life. Somehow the descriptions lacked a little spark, although there are a number of vivid passages. Perhaps this has to do with the fact the book was written 100 years after Bridger's death. In fact, this book is now 30 years old, and I believe the author wrote his first book on similar topics back in the 30s. Nevertheless, it's a good and complete description of Bridger's life. <br /> <br />One of the sadder aspects of the story is near the ending when the author reveals that during the last 10-15 years of Bridger's life no writer took the opportunity to interview Bridger. He was  in his sixties and seventies, I believe, but was a rather ignored individual, except by his family. He had an exceptionally good memory. Someone missed the opportunity to get more of his rather amazing life straight from the source. The 2-3 page description of his last years, and his desire to keep moving summarize his deep need for adventure and discovery. <br /> <br />He was apparently quite a wit and teller of tall tales. Only four of five of his short tales are found in the book. Interestingly, he told many of his stories in sign languages to the indians.  <br /> <br />The book contains on chapter of the famous Hugh Glass incident. It's worth reading if you have not heard it. The story was incorporated into a movie, A Man Called Horse , starring Richard Harris, in a slightly different form. I also found the long passage on \\"medicine wolves\\" quite intriguing. <br /> <br />I think this book might disspell a notion that the indian's scalping and body mutiliations of their enemies was derived from copying Europeans might be false. I read such an explanation in another book written at about the same time as this one. However, here we find repeated references to such carnage. In fact, it seems this savagery also been deeply engrained into the mountain men and other early frontiersmen. I suspect such carnages placed on one's enemies has deep roots in all of human history.	2004-09-12
US	52212659	R4IAZZUR5PJQ8	0593051483	877460125	Human Instinct	Books	3	6	9	N	Y	The British Influence Shows Through	Hmmm. This book turned out to be something of a puzzler for me. I saw the one hour TV program derived from the book, or maybe it was the other way around, and really enjoyed it. Somehow the spontaneity and liveliness of the program did not carry into the book. I did enjoy the book, but it seemed more like a jumble of facts than a story, or maybe it lacked a central focus. Human instinct was certainly the topic, but that seemed a bit too loosely the focus.<br />The British style of writing had an impact on me. I recently became interested in a book by another British author that won't be released in the U.S. until later this year. I know it's available in Britain. I asked someone about this and asked the reason why. They replied that it has to be edited for the American market.  I thought to myself that doesn't seem to a big hurdle. Well, perhaps not, but I can see now why that may be important. My version of Human Instinct certainly was not edited for the American market. There are quite a few references that would leave an American reader wondering what the author is referring to. A simple example is a discussion he has about the Wason selection test. What's a Skoda and who is Bryan Adams? I think a Skoda is a car and Bryan Adams might be a singer. I found such references a little distracting. I've read quite a bit of British authors like Fortey and Dawkins, but the British style of writing was not quite as obvious as here.<br />Some of his explanations just came up short in terms of completeness. For example, he talks about why the human population tends towards 50% males and females. He dismisses the monogamous case as obvious. Not to me it wasn't. I asked my wife about his offered description. Not to her either. I think he could have spent a little more time explaining the answer to the Wason test. Google saved the day there. There were several places where I was asking myself, &quot;What was that all about?&quot;<br />I see another reviewer remarked, &quot;Robert Winston is one of the many scientists today who reject God and yet place all their faith in the &quot;infalibilty&quot; of Evolution ...&quot; Did he actually read the final pages of the book?  Winston is quite clear that there's a place for God in evolution. In fact, he spends quite a bit of time at the end of the book on the subject of God and importance of the concept of God to evolution. However, I found it rather a weak ending. It was like he wanted to say something important, but missed. It just seemed like he couldn't bring himself to saying something concrete or really important.<br />Regarding a rating. 4-5 stars for the TV program, but 3 for the book.	2004-06-25

I found it quite informative. Maybe I've missed something in my long marriage, but some of his revelations were new to me. I suspected many of the differences were true but didn't have the supported facts until now. <br />I particularly enjoyed such topics as intimate separateness, \\"earn this\\", the heart vs life journey, \\"wouldn't have war\\" remark (pg. 61), the current decades long dominance of the woman's view, and stages of marriage, among many others. One could quibble with the stages, but it is nevertheless food for thought and gives some good insight into most marriages. Don't miss chapter 7 on the male at home.<br />... Martin Gardner, a science writer of some considerable note and talent, put together something of a quack detection list of 10 or so items. I don't think the term quack has any place here. Gurian does at least give very specific material that one can go to for additional information on sex difference research. This or Gurian's interpretation of it doesn't look like quack information to me. If one can question something about the sex difference argument, it is some educators' views (I think female organiaztion driven) that girl's are equivalent of boys and should be treated as such. There seems to a view that nearly two million years of evolution has not produced brain and other differences between the sexes. That view comes a lot closer to quackery than anything else on this subject.<br />My biggest beef about the books is about some of the organization. Some of the last few chapters seem out of place, but still useful. I did find myself skimming a few sections of the book, since they really do not apply to me. Rearing children, for example. For some reason, he did not include any index. There are plenty of times when I wanted to refer back to info and an index would have been valuable--also for future reference. One saving point on this is that thankfully Amazon has a facility to search the entire book. There's also an abundance of brain terminology that would be served well in an appendix. I finally resorted to taking notes and found a good web site to get additional info ...<br />I'd suggest this book be required reading for men and women.	2004-01-26

It's certainly a very interesting read. <br />I'm kind of an index nut. Some non-fiction authors provide very weak ones. This one is good, but surprisingly misses some important key phrases and words like &quot;founders effect&quot;, his interesting Paleogene description on page  101 (paper back) and his references to dawn redwood early on. I certainly appreciated the color photos in the middle of the book, but, whenever I see such material in a paperbook, wonder if there was even more in the hardback version. Four leafs, 8 pages, were provided in the paperback. Anyone know if that's the same as the hardback? I've come across paperbacks that obviously had photos and figures that were excluded from the book. In some cases, that makes a big difference. I think I found two figures in the book. Maybe one. A few more would have been very helpful, partitcularly on extinctions and a few to summarize points.	2004-01-10

I want to point out some things that other reviewers haven't touched on. There is no index to the Dover edition. Maybe the original one had an index. That automatically knocks off one star in any book rating I give. It has some pretty sturdy exercises at the end of each chapter. There are no answers in the book. That's OK though. One can get some additional sense of the subject by looking at the questions. There is a very good annotated bibliography at the end of the book. It is not tied into page numbers, but I get the feeling the order of the list and their reference in the book are in the same order. There's good and bad news about the list. He makes many of these books sound very appealing, but many are long out of print. Rucker's book was produced around 1975.<br />There are times when I wish the author would have pressed a little harder one some seemingly simple points. Maybe by giving an alternative view. For example, early on in the book he talks about a flatlander being inside a balloon as he expands the balloon from the inside. Suddenly the flatlander is on the outside. Maybe it's me, but how that happens is not clear. I've found other such passages. However, a studious reader will find the topics interesting. The price is certainly right.	2003-11-28

I keep wanting to refer to material read earlier, and foundd it difficult to find. I finally used the glosary as the basis of an index. When I thought there was a term in the book that might also be in the glossary, I wrote the page number down in the glossary. It'll be useful when I return to the book, which I'm sure I will. I can understand why they didn't provide a bibliography, but even a one pager would help. It only needed to be topic driven and not historically driven. Don't need a chronicle of events. I'm sure they didn't want to add to the expense or turn the book into something of an academic book.<br />Much of the material in the first few chapters is available in books like Epstein's Relativity Visualized, which I highly recommend. I really like the last three chapters, which were added to the book. The chapters on how particle accelerators work and on elementary particles were very good. The later was a very insightful treatment on how the particles got their properties. Very well done. Also liked the chapter on space curvature. A reference might be good here on non-euclidean geometry, or naybe a reference to Abbott's Flatland or Ian Stewart's Flatterland, although they aren't on non-euclidean geometry.<br />The introduction of fictional characters in the Tompkins book is quite useful and helpful. It somehow makes the facts more appealing. That alone perhaps encouraged me to read it from cover to cover. It softened the material at appropriate times rather than keep it on a hard track.<br />The book had some trouble with the Andromeda Galaxy. In two places it had the distance wrong and in disagreement with one another. 800K ly (circa 1950s value) and 1M ly (not sure where that came from). I believe the accepted value is 2M ly. In one place it called the galaxy The Great Andromeda Nebula. It's not a nebula.	2003-11-16

It's a very interesting read, but some of the material has probably surfaced elsewhere in the intervening period. It could use an index for future reference, and is missing the some 80 photographs found in the hardback. There are obvious typos in some places, probably because of editing to get the book into paperback form. I'd really suggest buying a used copy of the original, which I would give a 5 star rating to. The photos help a great deal to add to the text.	2003-05-17

One thing I see missing from the customer and editorial reviews is no mention of the fact that it has laboratory experiments. I find that valuable. It seems that most reviewers miss the idea that the book is meant to be supplemental. Perhaps the editorial reviews suggest otherwise, maybe to increase sales, but it hardly seems like one should expect a full treatment of the concepts in this book. <br />Returning to my laboratory comment, I think many books these days omit this aspect. That I think is unfortunate. Perhaps it's just harder to do independently because of limits imposed by 9/11 and our society's touchiness over chemical dangers. The availability of chemicals and labware are not so easily available as they once were. However, I suspect for those who might want to tackle lab exercises that such books exist, although they may be older ones. <br />I don't really feel that I can give the book a fair review at this point, but thought I would at least express the above thoughts. Since Amazon doesnt' really provide a non-review way to comment (Yes, I know they have some supplemental comments form, but it really misses the comment but no review idea.) I've used the review form. My rating just reflects the average review. I'll update it after I've gotten into the book.	2003-04-27

Interestingly, there were no pictures, drawings or figures; however, an appendix contained links to many web sites on related topics of each chapter.

Books	4	39	41	N	N	Interesting Book	I've only had this book for a few days, but have found the projects unusual and offbeat. For the most part, they are not a rehash of old science projects. They are well described and each one has a good description of the science and math behind them. The illustrations are not overly detailed, but they do the job quite well. I found it a little odd that the description of what the project is about is separated from the chapter on the project. The summaries of what is interesting about the projects and simply what they do is in the front of the book. If you open to a project within the book, you'll wonder what the real appeal of the project is until you go to the front of the book.<br />The author is quite a tinkerer and at least one of the project toys is patented. I believe a few others are heading toward patents.<br />Several projects require access to a small amount of Mecanno (or Erector) set parts. These companies almost do not exist it the U.S. any longer. However, Brio recently started distributing Erector sets again. I'm sure one could find substitutes for the Mecanno parts at a local hardware store or maybe even make them.	2001-11-11

I've only gotten about 70 pages into it. The first chapter was a little overly literary. The author finally broke into stride after that, and the book is quite enjoyable. The primary reason for writing this premature review is to point out the large number of figure typos. I'm talking about the american hardbound copy. Figures seem to be misplaced, pages other than where the text says they are, and figure numbers missing.	2001-10-24

It covers a lot of familiar territory found in other books. There were very few interesting or unusual new ideas  presented. It would take more than presented here to get a young student interested in geology.	2001-10-04

The second edition I'm looking at has very current material on microprocessors: Basic Stamp, MindStorms RCX and others. This is a very good book.	2001-08-20

It is certainly a good place to start for information on various projects but comes up short on construction techniques. Perhaps an older source, Procedures in Experimental Physics (Lindsay Pubs), is better. Of course, it was written in 1938, so materials  cited might be out of date, but the construction techniques aren't bad. I recently decided to build a good sized water tank (40&quot; by 6&quot; by 3&quot;) of acrylic and found nothing about construction tips. I was thinking of building something that probably required casting, and found a paltry two pages on the subject.<br />It would be good to see it updated every 5 years or so. I see the pub date is 1991. Things have changed a bit. It has a very good list of references, but with the advent of the web, it would be good to see some the reference material cite the web.	2001-08-13

It has been well reviewed by others here on this page. <br />I was disappointed to find that the still pictures the author took and the drawings by Patturson mentioned in the credits were not found in the paperback De Capo Press book. I guess one has to buy the hardback. I found it a bit odd that the author often referred to Melville's copying (plagurizing) passages of other texts in the production of his book Moby Dick, but did not mention that in the times of its publication it was not uncommon to plagurize other books. Maybe he just didn't know.	2001-07-16

I'm a sometimes listener to their radio show and enjoy their sense of humor. I guess this is what happens when you let celebrities write their own books. It does live up to the subtitle of Rant and Rave. It sounds like two guys who have thought out their ideas under the close scrutiny of patrons at the local barber shop. There's even an admission in it that one of them deliberately drives in the left lane at the posted speed just to slow down those folks who go over the speed limit. That's to show them a lesson. I've heard folks say that people like this exisit, but I was never sure. To me their sense of humor just wasn't evident in this book. Wow, guys! Forget your writing and philosophy career and stick with the radio.	2001-01-23

Brower does an excellent job of summarizing a lot of current and older but useful thinking on environmentalism. Each time I go back to my reading, I keep wanting to refer to earlier passages, so I look for an index. In fact that's why I'm writing this brief review. I hope that the publisher sees it and actually produces one for a future edition or printing. It would be very helpful, since I'm sure I'll want to come back to the book.<br />Over the last several months, I've hit upon the topic of saving the earth from another author, Daniel Quinn, the author of Ishmael. The goal is the same, but Quinn offers an alternative way of thinking that I find quite interesting. I'd like to ask both Brower and Quinn what they think of one anothers approaches, but, of course, that is now impossible in the case of Brower. If anyone knows whether they have ever met or read about one another, I'd be interested in knowing their reactions to the other's work. Since Quinn's approach is not an environmentalist's approach, I doubt that they have knowledge of one another. However, Quinn is pretty savy on all aspects of saving the earth.<br />I don't know if I specified it was OK to show my e-mail address, but here it is if someone wants to respond: mtn_view@sirius.com.	2000-11-28

It's filled with interesting observations about astronomy, science, education,  public life, experiences  as a black intellecutal, and his role as director of the Hayden  Planetarium. It's also filled with humor and many remarks and comments on  astronomy, the universe, God, movie mistakes on astronomical topics, and  even cremation vs burial. A very enjoyable read. I'm looking forward to  reading some of his other books.	2000-03-13

Carr, but I had the chance to browse through them at some length at a  bookstore. I would pretty much agree with Robert Jones Amazon review  remarks. In fact, I'd like to hear from him and have posted my e-mail  address with this review.<br />The books contain a wide variety of information  meteors, (even) telemetry, solar observations using VLF and other topics.  It didn't seem to be terribly deep in the area of radio astronomy. There  are plenty of circuit designs, and I may be a bit unfair here, but in the  area of radio astronomy (RA), it may not have been enough. I consider RA  the radio science part of things that deals with objects outside the earth,  sun, planets, stars, nova, galaxies, etc. <br />Both books are accompanied by  a CD-ROM but I couldn't find much of a description about the contents of  either. Both books have very thorough indexes, which I appreciate in any  technical book.  I'd agree with Mr. Jones comment about the book needed an  editor. The publisher is part of the Howard Sams 'empire'. I'd add that  there are few books for beginners on these subjects and that they all seem  to be lacking an editorial touch. That's too bad because it seems to have  allowed the authors to wander a bit on the subject. In the case of the two  books, it appears that it has also led to some slight difficulties in the  presentation. If you are really intereested  science and radio  applications, it would seem that these two books, at least volume 1, would  be useful way to get started. He has some good supporting authors (Mims,  etc.) and has a respectable collection of references.	2000-03-04

Indeed, the book is well written and  organized. However, I think the level of mathematics used is that of  advanced calculus. I believe this book is intended for a senior EE or EE  graduate student. However, it is not all mathematics and there is still  much to be learned about antennas from the book without having had exposure  to some of the mathematics used. If you are in doubt, you might consider an  alternative before purchasing this book, or at least purchase it with  the  thought of returning it within a 30 day inspection period.	2000-02-06

I'd say the average rating at this point, 3 1/2, is a bit high. This is an average book. I can see where it *might* be of benefit to some  users, but it has always seemed to me surprisingly short on details.   There're some good explanations of things but in my view they tend to be  overviews. In three years of use, I don't think it's solved more than two  or three problems, and they were not of any great consequence. The CD-ROM  included with the book has been of no help. The book strikes me as having  been written by a number of people without a real focus. IMHO it's more  like a dictionary or reference, and its focus is like them.<br />I think  slightly higher of Mansfield's book, Windows NT 4 Workstation. At least, it  has some more practical and easily useful info that's easier to read.  Norton has a book on this subject, but I have no idea of it's quality. If  you're into networking and the server side of things, try Mark Minasi's  Mastering Windows NT Server 4. It's applicable to Workstations too.<br />Since  Windows 2000 will be available in about 2 months, Feb. 2000, this book may  lose its relevance fast.	2000-01-02

It's very interesting and very funny. The story starts when the author reads a glowing review of his  doctoral thesis. There is, HOWEVER, a catch, and it leads the author on a  quest for the correct spelling of the mathematician Chebychev's name. I  haven't read any of the author's other books, but I'd say he does pretty  well, and would expect good and humorous things from him.	1999-10-27
