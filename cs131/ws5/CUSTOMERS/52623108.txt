However, most of the emphasis in this book is placed on presenting painstaking details of characters' personal lives, backgrounds and thought processes in terms of how they approach their science scholastically. While the clashes among scientists, Mormons and Creationists were interesting, I kept longing for some real armchair-gripping suspense and action, which didn't make its appearance until the final two chapters of the book. The romance between Em and Ray was strained (not to mention strange) and, in the end, predictable.  For me, this was a slow read; however, the story line does raise some provocative philosophical/religious questions and it was interesting to see them presented in a very creative way.	2001-11-20

Cynthia Ann never readjusted to white society and, in mourning for her Comanche husband and her children, eventually starved herself to death.  Yet, out of this tragic story, her son Quanah - half white, half Comanche - rose to become the most influential representative of the Comanche tribe and the last Comanche Chief.<br />In this book, author William T. Hagan presents the meticulously researched story of Quanah's life and the politics of both the white and native worlds which he straddled, serving as an eloquent bridge between two societies struggling for survival on the Oklahoma and Texas plains. An astute businessman, Quanah recognized the futility of staving off white settlement and turned his warrior energies toward negotiating for the best &quot;deals&quot; he could get for the American Indians.  Although he made many trips to Washington, DC and the White House to represent the needs of the Indians and often wore western Anglo dress, he refused to give up his braids, his &quot;much married condition&quot; (7 wives), and his dedication to the peyote cult.<br />This is a fascinating book which I highly recommend to any afficianado of the Old West and Native America.	2001-11-09

For example, prayers include: &quot;for the Protection of Pets&quot;; &quot;to End Racism&quot;; &quot;in Times of Stress and Confusion&quot;; &quot;Full Moon Chant for Strength&quot;; &quot;A Teen's Prayer for Guidance&quot;; &quot;for Deceased Pets&quot;, &quot;for Each Day of the Week&quot; and many others very diverse in their subject matter.<br />The masculine and feminine principles are addressed in a variety of ways, i.e. &quot;Lord and Lady&quot;, &quot;Father and Mother&quot;, &quot;Eternal God and Goddess&quot;,and the like.  The author encourages the substitution of whatever forms of address the reader wishes to use for invocations and rituals, so there is an expectation of flexibility in terms of adapting the book to one's own Wiccan practice.<br />While retaining Caitlin Matthews' &quot;Celtic Devotional&quot; as my primary daily and seasonal prayer book, I find &quot;The Wiccan Prayer Book&quot; to be a meaningful companion book which fits easily into my purse so I can read it whenever Spirit moves me to do so.	2001-07-07

I've &quot;passed it by&quot; for the last several years, but decided recently to take a closer look at it. With my sister being a special lover of the Halloween season, I thought it would be ideal to use for her readings - and I was right.  Because it is a deck that she closely resonates with, I've gotten my most accurate readings with her using this deck.<br />The theme, closely based on the standard Rider-Waite, is quite ingeniously done and is a very light-hearted deck to use, i.e. it doesn't reflect any &quot;dark&quot; images or interpretations.  Instead, author/illustrator Karin Lee draws on an array of Halloween imagery that reminds us of our childhood trick-or-treating, using Pumpkins, Ghosts, Bats and Imps to represent the standard Minor Arcana suits of Pentacles, Cups, Swords and Wands. Lots of creativity is shown in the Major Aracana as well; for example, The Emperor card shows a Boris Karlof-type Frankenstein, with a rendition of the Bride of Frankenstein representing The Empress!  This is also an excellent deck to use with anyone who has misconceptions of fears about having a Tarot reading, as it promotes a sense of childlike fun.	2001-07-01

This was not easy to accomplish, because of the two formidable belts of cross timber forest, which Washington Irving referred to in his writings as the &quot;cast iron forest.&quot;  These thick belts ran from a small corner of Kansas down through Indian Territory (now called Oklahoma), and continues to approximately where Waco, TX is located today.<br />Author Richard V. Francaviglia brings the reader on a journey through the cross timber regions, with a brilliant blend of natural history and Old West adventure-telling.  The book features many old maps, which in their own fascinating way, also tell the history of the cross timbers visually.  The author takes the reader on a journey from the opening of the West to the cross timbers - or what's left of it - in modern times.<br />One need not be scientifically inclined to read and enjoy this book, as Francaviglia explains all in a way which is easy to understand.  Anyone with an interest in Texas history and/or ecology will find this a fascinating read!	2001-06-15

Abducted by the Comanches, Cynthia was raised for the next 25 years as a tribal member and became &quot;fully&quot; Comanche, giving birth to Quanah Parker, the last Comanche Chief and one of the most influential intermediaries of his time, a representative of both the Native American and White cultures.  Abducted a second time as an adult by a well-meaning Texas Ranger, Cynthia Ann was forced to return to White society, but mourned deeply for her Comanche family, ultimately starving herself to death out of grief.<br />Much lore and legend has grown around the story of Cynthia Ann Parker over the years, and it has often been difficult to separate the myth from the reality of her dramatic story.  However, Margaret Schmidt Hacker has done just that.  Over a period of five years, Ms. Hacker painstakingly researched the archives in Texas, Oklahoma, California and Washington, D.C. and objectively weighed all the accounts of Cynthia Ann's life. The result of her efforts is what is considered the most authoritative book on the subject.  Although scholarly, it is at the same time, a gripping drama of the Texas prairies, and very readable by anyone with an interest in the Old West. Highly recommended reading.	2001-06-12

As a '60's flower child, I purchased my copy of this gem when it first came out in 1970.  It was my mainstay through all the years that I practiced zazen meditation (often now referred to as &quot;Mindfulness Meditation&quot;).  Over the years, my practice fell off until now - when I find my mind continually racing between work, home life, managing a couple of websites, keeping up with e-mail and music practice!  I found myself remembering the sustenance and simplicity this book offered and purchased a copy, my first edition having been lost somewhere many years ago.  I was delighted to see that the original publisher has kept it in the exact same format and paper quality as the first edition, so I felt the literal presence of an old friend in my hands.  Although written from a Zen Buddhist perspective, it is truly non-denominational, and its practice of stilling the mind complements any religious/spiritual tradition - or none at all, if that is your personal choice.  Especially for the modest price, this is the best.  You need search no further - it's all here.	2000-10-02

Having read several of the more scholarly treatises on Abbess Hildegard of Bingen, I'm finding it a breath of fresh air to experience her as a living being.  The book is beautifully written and is not afraid to present Hildegard as all too human, dealing with the concerns and fears that must have accompanied her extraordinary visionary gifts.  Although Hildegard would never have called herself a &quot;feminist&quot;, since she embraced the precepts and beliefs of Catholicism, including the superiority of an all-powerful male God, she held women in high regard and challenged many of the assumptions of that time about women the value of women in the eyes of God.

While Amy Zerner's gorgeous  tapestries work beautifully with the &quot;Oracle of the Goddess&quot; deck  and book, which I also own, I felt the collages of fabric images with the  &quot;paste book&quot; look too overbearing for me to effectively use.  The  cards are large, with a very frilly, lacy Victorian look to them, like old  Victorian valentines; I know that many people who own this book and card  set love it, so this is just my opinion. I would not discourage anyone from  purchasing this item, but just be prepared.  If you are a male, it is not  likely that you'll be comfortable with this deck.	2000-09-05

In reading the other reviews, there are  apparently quite a few other customers who experienced the same problem.
