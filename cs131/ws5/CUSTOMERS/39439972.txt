Her stepmother is hysterical, inconsolable and useless.  The father made a business venture before his death that turned out badly causing them to lose the home they live in. I've read a LOT of Ms Hill's books and while this is a very familiar theme with her this is one of her should reads! This is the story of Doris, her seventeen year old sister Rose, an older brother who has married unwisely, the very interesting younger siblings, the stepmother (Who is silly, selfish and weak) and the Macdonald family. I like the dimension the Macdonald family brings to the book.  Angus Macdonald is facing his own life challenges and temptations but he dearly loves his mother so he employs a companion for her while he is to be away overseas.	2005-09-30

One soldier is home convalesing while the other is deep in enemy territory, they both are strong believers.  It is a fairly interesting book, and a little unusual in it's theme but the secondary characters and romances were to me predictable and very typical Grace Hill. I personally liked the Big Blue Soldier better.	2005-09-15

This is the story of Celia Murray forced into the business world by the death of a relative. Although this a frequent theme of Ms Hill, one she was well acquainted with, I found this book appealing. Celia lived in a dismal boarding home with strangers, where she and the other inhabitants really were a victim of their circumstances.  The meals were dreadful and unappealing.  Even the landlady's inability to manage money and her own feelings of hopelessness were skillfully woven into the story. Celia receives a small inheritance, brings her Aunt and an old servant to live with her  and they begin a modest makeover of the boarding house that touches and brightens the lives of all who live there.  The romance is understated but satisfying.  I confess a love for books or movies that show one person making the difference for even one. so this review is biased.	2005-09-15

This is one of Ms Hill's earliest books, i believe 1903. This is the story of two women- Evelyn Rutherford and Allison Grey, one unsaved and one saved.  Evelyn is forced to stay with the Grey family because of a smallpox outbreak at her aunts. Allison struggles to \\"love\\" her and accept it as God's providence that she is there with her family, then she finds this spoiled socialite has met her much beloved brother and the conflict in herself intensifies.  Her brother has met Evelyn on two occassions and has a real burden for her soul, he also can't get her off his mind but he is a mature believer and a Doctor. It is a good book.	2005-09-15

I am an avid fan of Ms Heitzmann, she's amazing! This was in my opinion her most complex book yet. Rese and Lance were very different people but because Lance was so warm and caring, and because of his need to stay at the villa in book one he took the time to look beyond Rese's tough guy exterior (she did grow up raised by a schizophrenic Mom and then solely raised by a nondemonstrative Father in a construction world after all!!). I don't care for a tough almost masculine female lead character as a rule but Ms Heitzmann tells a compelling tale, similiar to The Rose Legacy, only in that it has an old tale woven through this contemporary book.  What Lance finds as he gets to know Rese is that she has totally learned to bottle evrything up and of course to never show weakness and vulnerability in the very harsh world she has known. I loathe books where the perfect guy loves the totally cold woman with no foundation for it, but this book develops characters so well, it is a very believable and satisfying book even if it my not be to your liking!  There were so many challlenges to live the faith also, I was wondering where she was going with the vendetta -the conclusion of that was Perfect! What can our God due if we surrender all to Him.This book is not for the fainthearted(content little Christians who do not want their faith challenged). When you read this book you really feel enveloped by Lance's Italian family, it's incedible!  There are so many complex characters in the book . And though Chaz is barely mentioned, he contributes a lot. I don't believe it is my favorite book of the author but I definitely recommend it and will have to read it again to absorb all I missed the firt time through!	2005-08-27

It has some similarites to A Voice in the Wilderness which is also very good.  Though this one really has less drama, fewer characters I think in a lot of ways I liked it better. It is the story of two men who have gone out West (running away from life's disappointments with bitter hearts). One of the men's half sister shows up on the very day her letter announces her intention, they are shocked but also pleased.  She makes a huge difference in their barren lives.  She also sees her brother as someone noble that he is not and his partner as the real problem. As usual in her best books she reveals Margaret's desire to be used of God , her sensitivity to the Holy Spirit and challenges us in the process.  It is simple but satisfying!	2005-08-20

I know the basic premise of this book was good, that God can take all things difficult and painful and work them together for good BUT the first two hundred pages of the book were of spoiled, obnoxious relatives, it was very tedious to read it over and over as Dale perfectly submitted to the trial. I guess it is definitely a matter of taste because I loved the Gold Shoe, while some disliked it for the obnoxious relative that came to stay, I found that book delightful and skillfully woven with the Mother's growth as she sought the Lord in it. This book is like a long drawn out dose of castor oil!!	2005-08-16

It was a skillfully woven tale with lots of interesting characters that added a lot of dimension to the book. The father dies suddenly, the bank fails and an unscrupulous lawyer threatens to take their home.  As a result of all those calamites the Mother decides they should move onto this other property they own but it is in a very bad part of town. I enjoyed meeting all the neighbors--the seven little orphan boys particularly.  I also liked Bat as Ms. Hill developed his character and showed him unscrupulous but then hungering for a life he has never seen before or known.	2005-08-16

I liked that there was a spiritual depth to the book that a reader could miss if just flying through.  Cat (the heroine) found her relationship to God shallow when she was tried. I too found \\"the trauma\\" not as earth shattering as expected (maybe in the flesh we want something a little more sordid?) but having just gone through one of those faith testing years myself this novel was completely believable.  She had God pigeon-holed and found out He wasn't \\"content\\" with the little area of her life she allotted Him. Ms John definitely gave her characters depth.  I loved how Dominick came to believe I Christ. This is a GOOD book, well worth reading, emotionally satisfying as well for the romantics out there.	2005-08-10

If you have ever been unappreciated ,you'll enjoy this book. It is almost an unconventional Cinderella story, but I believe it's appeal will probably be to older readers. Aunt Crete is an older woman who has served her sister and her daughter selflessly for many years, only to be treated as a servant of no value and no needs. Her sister's son from out west announces his upcoming visit, so fearing the man uncouth, they flee.  He's the picture of manners and refinement, and immediately discovers Aunt Crete as a caring, neglected dear relation, in short he values her.  This is a short book, but delightful!  Another unconvential Grace Hill story is the Obsession of Victorian Gracen, very good and very different also.	2005-05-24

This wasn't a bad book but I didn't particularly care for it either. I've read about fifty of Ms Hill's books. This is the story of a household of children that are suddenly and unexpectantly orphaned.  The oldest, a girl is almost of age and her brother is college age, then there are four (I think) younger siblings.  The big bad relatives want to marry the oldest girl off and sent the rest to the country with a mean old aunt or boarding school soooooo they run away.  This is a book of their adventures.  The romance is about two pages at the end of the book, which was sudden and a bit much to swallow for me.	2005-05-21

This is pretty much like a lot of Ms Hill's books, a girl orphaned and unprotected in the world, Amorelle goes to live with relatives who use and treat her like a servant, with a room on the third floor even!  But she stays as a witness to her Uncle who begins to care for her greatly.  This book differs from a lot of Ms Hill's other books in that in Amorelle's loneliness she accepts the care and physical attentions of a hansome gentleman, he is as usual absolutely controlling and unreasonable when she comes to her senses but the book is one of Ms Hill's later books and displays humor and is in my opinion a worthwhile read.  This is very different from the book Maris by Ms Hill, although the central theme is the same.	2005-05-17

Just when I am ready to quit reading Grace Hill books, there are a hundred of them after all, I stumble on another one with surprising depth and lots of turns. This is a book about two young men who get blamed by the whole town for a crime they didn't commit, but it is really about their families and their friends as well. One young man leaves town because he is blamed for a bank discrepancy, and an older friend follows him to bring him back. What befalls them makes it impossible for them to get back or get in touch with anyone so the town views their absence as guilt. There is more romance than usual in this book also, which I personally like. If  you like a book where everyone is settled tidily at the end of the book, this is not for you.  For instance what happened to Myra and Joyce's father? But this is an interesting book and a little atypical for Ms Hill.	2005-05-16

It's well written with lots of characters to make it interesting but fairly predictable.  Maris is a young woman who is engaged to a man who has wined and dined her and swept her off her feet with lots of flattery,a handsome face, a fancy car, the promise of a beautiful home, etc.  She's about to be married when her Mother collapses with a serious illness.  Her fiance is seriously peturbed by the inconvenience of her illness and is very unsympathetic. Because of this and a few other occurances Maris encounters she begins to reevaluate their relationship.  This would be a great book for teen girls, which is undoubtedly who Ms Hill had in mind when she wrote it.  There are some twists in the story to liven it up.	2005-05-13

The characters are very believable and well developed. Althea, the main character, will challenge you in your own walk as a believer. Simon, the male counterpart, is a Jewish man who is really in some ways is the family's \\"sacrificial lamb\\" to acquire their representative in the  English government. This really is a very profound book for a first time author, or any author!  My only complaint is that in giving Althea's traumatic past the author gives a more graphic description (I'm talking one line) than I think is appropriate for a Christian Novel.  It compares to Christy by Catherine Marshall.  My concern is not the married woman that read it but the unmarried Christian women.  But other than that this book is superb!	2005-05-11

If you aren't well read this may appeal to you, but it is very typical Grace Hill, not one of her better books. Kerry is a lonely young girl, sheltered, educated and beautiful but poor.  Her father has been writing a scientific masterpiece his entire marriage. His wife is spoiled,beautiful but useless in being a helpmate and a mother.  The Father dies entrusting his almost complete work to his daughter.  The Mother remarries immediately for money rather than love this time as she is very shallow.  Kerry is appalled and sees through the new husband and his lecherous glances. (The stepfathers dialogue is laughable, it is awful, Ms Hill obviously didn't know to many \\"bad\\" men)  She flees of course, so typically Grace Hill.  She meets two new men, one handsome, rich and definitely a gentleman and the other a Professor a very annoying, stalking scroundrel. She takes a cruise to America to publish her Father's work and to escape her new step father. The rest is totally predictalble.	2005-05-07

She does rival Martha Stewart but she also does displays her struggle to do the right thing (with her sister in law and brother and with Mrs Powers who was totally obnoxious, also with the school superintendent who wants to save her from being outdated and irrelevant in her world view.

The problem for the Mother is that she sees Tasha for the potential harm she could be to her son, but she genuinely likes her. Another young woman then appears on the homefront, one who MIGHT be perfect for her son but who in reality makes her(the Mother) absolutely crazy.

But to anyone who has ever been rejected, I personally found these books to be as traumatic as Braveheart. My personal favorite was the second one, not because it was any less traumatic but because of Leana's strength of character. She wasn't perfect but she blessed everyone around especially those who little deserved it. Rose blessed everyone with her beauty, charm and winsome ways, she was very well developed as a character who was petted and pampered and truly loved. She developed in charater as we watched her grow up.  The highest richest, most satisfying Romance is with our Creator/Redeemer, Ms Higgs incorporated that with skill!	2005-04-08

She's been accosted by the man her parents want her to marry, her life is totally fraught with uncertainties (she just married a total stranger) and she's giggling...I personally found it hard to believe and very annoying but in spite of that, the book is a worthwhile read!  I have dropped it to 4 stars after rereading because there should be a difference in a fine book and one that is an enjoyable read but a tad cheesy in some ways.  There is a LOT of inappropriate giggling and for that alone it should be a 4.  I liked the way the author developed the relationship but Elizabeth's discovery of this fact is a first silly (a little dance of joy in her room?) and from that to totally hiding her feelings- annoying.  Some things I really liked (like the overall creativity of the story and characters). I should add that I typically have found love inspired a total waste of time.	2005-02-21

First of all I wanted to like this book, and not just because I paid fifteen dollars for it.  I loved Daughter of Joy and Woman of Grace.  It is a novella with the typical story line-- a young widow with children at Christmas, they want a new Dad, a stranger lands on their doorstep (actually brought to it by her father-in-law)she lost her husband to strangers but takes him in anyway against her better judgment, nurses him back to health,and the rest is predictable.  That is not my problem with it.  Ian Sutherland is a dreamy Scotsman and believable but Anna is prickly and not likable due to a traumatic past, she definitely lusts after Ian (this is a Christian book right, I could have lived with out that whole lusting scene)  and then she tells him her horrendous past which she never shared with her very devoted first husband, I found that hard to swallow.
