The author digs deep into the psyche of his protagonist and speaks to us in a clear, warm, youthful voice.  While sometimes shockingly explicit in its sexual content the novel does not rely on the cliches typical of &quot;the coming of age&quot; novel.<br />At times poetic, the book focuses on Robin MacKenzie and his search for love and a &quot;place&quot; in the world.  When a horrible accident puts the family at odds with each other, Robin is thrust into a journey filled with self-doubt, guilt, and fear.  Never a dull moment, The World of Normal Boys is a page turner.  This is a near perfect novel that brings those agonizing years clearly into focus for those of us who forgot what it was like to be on the outside looking in.  No doubt, the author will win a Lambda award for this effort. In short, this book is a gem and will stay with you long after you've finished it.	2001-04-23

The complexity of Isabel Archer's character continues to provoke lively discussions in colleges and universities to this day.  James' style is dense and rich with detail.  This novel was written at a time when audiences weren't numbed by television and films and got their enjoyment from music, art and &quot;high literature.&quot;  James does not disappoint.  The book depicts the life of one brilliant young woman who insists on living life on her own terms in spite of her restrictive society.  This is a deep psychological probe and raises many questions regarding the role of women in the 19th century.  A marvellous classic!	2001-02-22
US	52180580	RSPRLYBBOHAUM	0452274117	612465378	The Weekend	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Rich and Complex	Peter Cameron has succeeded in creating a world filled with rich, human characters caught up in the tangled web of love and loss.  The story moves along quickly over the time span of one weekend spent in the country.  By far, Cameron's strength is his use of dialog.  He masterfully conveys what his characters are feeling in a clear and emotional way.  We come to learn so much about these people from what they say to each other and what they struggle to articulate and define for themselves.<br />Realistic and not at all overly sentimental, The Weekend will soon be a major motion picture.  I hope the film lives up to the book!	2001-01-19

The brutal, harsh environment is depicted accurately and passionately.  The reader gets a sense that Jensen has really done his research and has created a landscape that is both beautiful and dangerous.  The author's sense of pacing is excellent making this a powerful page turner.  Told in the first person, the novel introduces us to John Chapman, a man trying to escape his past and establish a claim in the 1797 town of Franklin.  This is not your typical gay novel at all.  The obstacles he manages to face are seemingly insurmountable!<br />I felt that some of the sexual content was a bit gratuitous and was taken aback at times by scenes of intense, horrific violence.  These are not typical cosmopolitan gay men sharing drinks at a local bar.  Jensen is part Stephen King, part Laura Ingalls Wilder, part Gordon Merrick.  A great first effort from Jensen!  I highly recommend this book.	2001-01-12

We come to understand his struggles with a particularly reclusive patient as well as the therapist's own &quot;first love.&quot;  Swanson has created memorable characters and a rich, detailed story.  While he jumps back and forth between the protagonist's past and present, Swanson delivers his narrative without confusion.  I would have prefered a straight forward narrative but Swanson's prose makes up for all the back and forth.  <br />Swanson's powers of observation and his meticulous attention to detail brings vividness and depth to the story and the characters.  There is no explicit sex in the story which I was hoping for since the tension is certainly there.  Well done!  I look forward to more of Swanson's work.	2001-01-02

This book is like having a kind and sensitive therapist at the writing desk with you.  It's clear, to the point and written in a relaxed, conversational style.  Keyes defines the complex fears and anxieties that keep writers from facing the challenge of the blank page and offers insight into moving past fear into joyful written expression!  I especially liked all the ancedotes he includes about authors like Hemingway, Faulkner, Proust and Fitzgerald.  Anyone who agonizes over what he/she writes will appreciate this book.  It is not, however, a &quot;how-to&quot; writing book in the traditional sense.  The focus of the book remains on techniques that enhance creativity and flow, not on developing story ideas, characterizations, plots, settings, voice, theme, etc.  There are plenty of other books on that.  What Keyes offers is an encouraging dialog to keep you committed and help you through your sleepless nights.  I rate this one right up there with &quot;Writing Down the Bones&quot; by Natalie Goldberg.	2000-12-27

William Taylor has managed to write a sensitive, powerful book that depicts the angst and confusion of teenage love in a completely believeable way.  The book moves along at a lightning pace and the characters are realistic, enjoyable and three dimensional.  New Zealand grammar takes a couple of pages to get used to but what he has managed to accomplish in little more than a 100 pages is truly remarkable.<br />I loved the symbolism of the blue lawn as well as the character of Gretel, a Holocaust survivor who could have had a book of her own.  Taylor's prose is tight, clean and powerful.  His economy of words makes for a fast read.  Maybe too fast.  I would have loved another 500 pages!<br />The book is not explicit and suitable for young readers as well as adults who remember what it was like to be young and in love!  I can't say enough good things about this book!	2000-12-22

Set in the Bronx during the 1960s, Boys on the Rock is a wonderful slice-of-life, coming of age story.  John Fox's conversational style makes  for a very engaging read.  He captures the rhythms of speech common among  teenagers beautifully.  The book is plotted nicely and does an excellent  job of depicting the angst and uncertainty of adolesence.  The author does  a wonderful job of creating a sense of the atmosphere and tension in the  Bronx during the 1960s with amazing accuracy.  This is a classic of gay  literature for good reason.  I highly recommend this book.	2000-08-30

Andrew Holleran's collection of short stories is nothing short of marvellous.  Written during a period that spans over twenty years, Holleran  offers his readers funny, original stories about gay life.

This is perhaps one of the best books on writing I have ever read.  Maisel  offers writers exercises to help them tune into their own unique voice  while offering encouragement all along the way.  Not just a book about  technique or &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; this book will address the  complicated aspects of living life as a writer and remaining sane at the  same time!<br />This book needs to be on the shelf of every writer regardless  of where they are in their career.

He follows the relationships  of several American expatriates travelling through France and Spain.   Hemingway's sharp, athletic prose is almost brutal.  The characters are  clearly defined and well-rounded.  While the plot is not overwhelmingly  engrossing its worth reading.  Hemingway's original style and refreshing  take on life made him one of the great writers of the 20th  century.<br />Especially good are his descriptions of the bullfights of  Pamplona and the young matador who runs off with Lady Ashley!	2000-08-03
US	52180580	R3HHWC8LCWO00A	0140286373	555286470	The Spell	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Excellent!	Hollinghurst has created a very moving work of fiction with &quot;The Spell.&quot;  It's the story of four gay men at various stages of life whose lives intersect.  Hollinghurst's deft style brings the characters to  life realistically and compassionately.  He handles issues like loss,  rejection, aging, parenting, jealousy, and sexuality with the precision of  a patient and gifted surgeon.  He cuts right through to the core of human  emotions.<br />Hollinghurst's command of the English language is admirable and  his prose is both soothing and sensual.  This book is a real treat.  I  expected another long description of campy, drug-filled nights out on the  town filled with sex and the hedonistic attitudes so common among gay men  but instead discovered a moving story filled with expressive, three  dimensional characters.  I highly recommend it.	2000-07-20

Goldberg expands upon the ideas she covered in &quot;Bones&quot; and takes it one step further.  My favorite passsages  from this book are those where Ms. Goldberg discuss what the personal  journey/process of writing has been for her.<br />Goldberg is both courageous  and inventive.  The book is filled with helpful &quot;Try This&quot;  exercises to help stimulate your own writing and reads more like a  conversation with a good friend in a coffeeshop than a manual on  &quot;how-to&quot; write the next bestseller. <br />Excellent!	2000-07-19

Here's another fast-paced, thrilling entry in the Robin Miller series.  Maiman's style gets crisper with each new entry.  Here, Maiman chose to really focus on Robin and K.T.'s relationship, of course there's no  shortage of action but clearly Maiman is letting her characters mature and  reflect more than in her earlier work.

Set in the world of classical music with all the grandeur and pomp that implies, this story fell flat.  A younger man falls for an older, famous man.  Not a very original concept to  begin with but it gets worse.  The mother falls for the older man, the  older man's agent/lover falls for the younger man, etc.  It's just a mess.   There are no truly likeable characters here and even the beautiful imagery  of Rome, San Francisco and New York does little to spruce it up.<br />OK --  here's the real reason I wasn't thrilled with it.  Not one good sex scene.   Nothing titilating, nothing disgusting or revolting, nothing scary or  dangerous.  It was so white bread middle of the road it was boring.	2000-06-08

To say that this is a morality story would be an injustice.  This story is more than that.  It is a mirror held up to humanity wherein we can see how material riches bring  out the best and the worst in our nature.  His use of language is  stunningly beautiful.
