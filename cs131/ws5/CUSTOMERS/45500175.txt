Perhaps it was the many adults that surrounded the main character.  In most young adult books the teenaged main character is surrounded by her peers, but in this book, it is mostly adults who help her to reveal her pain and to make a new life. Rather than be on the sidelines, the adults are front and center and we learn about their own sometimes unhappy lives.This is a good book for teenagers and their parents to share. A quick read with substance. <br />Try Martha Brooks' other books as well.	2005-09-30

Then this is the book for you. With a husband and children, life is complicated and there are no easy answers, not even in a book that is for the most part a humorous romance. Readers might find themselves wondering what they would do, along with the main character, as she tries to decide if she likes her exciting new life, or if she wants her old life back.The angst and confusion add to this fun story.	2005-09-28

The author weaves the historical facts seamlessly into the story, without breaking the flow. Too often in bad historical fiction, the facts are presented as an aside and the reader feels as if a Greek chorus is filling you in on what you need to know to understand the story. There's none of that here and you are transported to a difficult time in Florence, especially for women. <br />The danger, intrigue and a great romance make this an outstanding book.	2005-09-28

Not the tepid American remake, but the original British series with its slapstick situations and witty dialogue. The plot is a comedy of errors, with the reader aware of all the entanglements, while the main character continues to have obstacles put in the way of her happiness. There are lots of humorous situations and the read is made more enjoyable with the wonderful anticipation of what's going to happen next and who will she end up with?.	2005-09-28

This book reminds me of a screwball comedy with a woman (Lucy) who is warm and delightful, but always finding herself in compromising positions. Well, almost, because the author takes Lucy up to the brink many times, only to pull her back from the edge before she leaps. The reader is kept guessing and wondering, will she or won't she cross that line with her married man? Her mother-in-law is a character you love to hate, and by the end of the book, you realize all was not as it seemed. The ending will make you cheer.	2005-09-28

This book was a fun read and the settings give the reader a glimpse of a different way of life. I think a bit more editing would have helped the plot flow more smoothly, but the story of old love vs new love, family secrets revealed and the likable characters made it worth reading.	2005-09-28
