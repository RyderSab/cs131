I am at Amazon to buy this book as we have run into our renewal limit at the Library.  The rhyming cadence of this story is reminiscent of other Martin titles, and it makes the reading enjoyable for us as parents as well! <br /> <br />This has become a favorite, and the build up to the \\"And Grabs Him!\\" page is a nightly family ritual filled with giggles from Mom, Dad AND our daughter!  Love it!  We will be in our twilight years looking back fondly at this book!	2005-03-04

This is a very general book, and almost dismissive of the first time sufferer.  My circumstances do not make me the proper audience for this book, and it is not for the person with difficulty in conceiving, with an underlying health condition, a woman over 35, and a host of others.  The explanations are fairly elementary, and like another reviewer, find that many other publications contradict his theories.  If this is the \\"best book on m/c available\\", then I need to go to the Medical School library. <br /> <br />In my personal experience, I find that the author has only a cursory grasp of thyroid and auto-immune issues, and in fact confuses Grave's disease for Hashimoto's.  If one is to write a book which will encroach on specialties other than one's own, have the proper specialists at least review it!  The best part of the book is the section on the psychological aspect of pregnancy loss.  This is the only book I have seen which discussed the differences a man and woman may feel through a miscarriage. <br /> <br />Not the book for me.  The author makes it seem as though, suffering \\"only\\" one miscarriage, regardless of my circumstances, I do not deserve to \\"drain the national healthcare\\" in my quest for answers.  Keep looking.  <br /> <br />	2005-03-04

As another reviewer mentioned, additional information is haphazardly stuffed into the second part of the chapters for each week.  <br />What I found condescending were these little blurbs that the doctor apparently pulled from his/her office experience.  He/she would list questions and answer them as though he/she were saving these women from themselves.  The little picture of the doctor situated in these boxes almost has a look of smugness to it.  I just found these items to be absolutely irritating.	2002-08-03

Iovine gives no medical advice, or explanation of what is happening through a pregnancy.  She tells you that up front.  It is a wonderful departure from scary, technical information written in medicalese.  I enjoyed this book immensely as I needed to find something lighter, and more relevant to every day life on the subject.  To know that you share the same horror as other women to notice your first hemmhoroid, the discovery of how gassy one may become, and to know that we've all coped with public sickness is priceless!  To add some fun to your seriousness, I highly recommend this book.	2002-08-03

It had great potential.  I just couldn't find myself involved enough with the characters to be sympathetic to them.  Nora is a flirt with a few good one liners, but I just never got a sense of connection between her and the main character, Michael.  I just kept thinking that Michael was a fool, and that I wished that the first Lady, the President, and other characters gave me something to care about.  I needed a more compelling argument for Michael's connection to Nora to really care about his sense of purpose.  It's good for fast paced page turning, but it is forgettable.	2001-01-30

Not living in a large city, I think I'll have a hard time getting some of the ingredients.  Although they simplify recipes for the home cook, a lot of it is unrealistic.  I will use this for special occasions, and can translate some of the tips into other recipes, but don't think it will be a good every-day addition.  For example, to make fantastic burgers, they suggest salting ribboned chuck steak, then setting up your meat grinder.  I don't have one, and don't want one.  I'll also never make quail, squab, or liver and onions.  It's good reading for more advanced ideas, but I don't think it's really going to be a dog eared, ingredient splashed favorite.	2000-12-29

My mother is a singer, and I fought against Opera, Classical Music, etc. through my childhood and teen years.  I never took the time to understand it.  As an Audiobook addict, I picked this up and absolutely loved it.  The authors are quite funny and teach you to think of Opera as entertainment.  It goes through Opera's history, how it is perceived in other lands, do's and dont's of opera, and helps you understand how to get the most out of it.  It really makes you want to see one!  In fact, I ran to the library and checked out Don Giovanni!  This audio book gives you the tools to begin exploring Opera for your own benefit...and will be a big plus in case you are ever a Millionaire or Jeopardy contestant!	2000-11-09

I read this book because one of the characters is modeled after someone I know.  Although the part pertaining to that person spans a few pages, I am glad I read the story.  Obviously, it takes a stretch of the imagination to make Vermont that exciting, but it is credible and enjoyable.  I have read all of Ridley Pearson, Patricia Cornwell, John Sandford, and several others.  I will now begin the task of completing Mayor's series.  His research is thorough, and it is easy to visualize the story as you read along.	2000-10-30

It hleps you understand when you should see a health care practitioner, or when you might be able to alter a factor of your regimen to solve some of your own problems.  Even in the event that you must see a physician, the book helps you understand the type of information you should share with your provider to be a partner in your own treatment...not to mention how to be a good consumer of healthcare.  One aspect I found irritating was the authors several references to his days in Medical school.  With DPM after his name, I would think he went through the rigors of a school of Podiatry rather than Medical school.  It's just a semantic, but irritates me.	2000-09-22

A container of illegal  immigrants being smuggled into the US lands in the water and opens up a  hot-bed of chaos surrounding underground sweat shops.  It is fast paced,  well researched, and we get to spend time with some of our favorite  characters.  <br />There are several aspects of the book which are similar to  his others, such as tension at home and friction with another law  enforcement agency.  This time, however, it's the INS.  Nevertheless, I  still truly enjoy Ridley Pearson's books and suffer a bit of a slump after  I've devoured one.  This is no exception.	2000-08-07

I admire his ability to come up with original plots within a saturated subject (cops) area.  This book delivers our  favorite characters (Boldt, LaMoia, and Matthews)and further develops a few  more from books past.  A sick-out has affected the SPD union, and a  skeleton crew is left to pick up the slack...or try anyway.  Cops are  threatened and injured when they take over ongoing investigations for  &quot;afflicted&quot; individuals.  <br />Pearson cleverly weaves several  subplots into another amazing story, and brings them together at a  fast-paced conclusion.  I enjoyed the book immensely, however, I was a bit  disappointed in LaMoia the first half of the book.  Keep them coming,  please!	2000-08-07

I was reminded of one tip I was currently not doing to effectively manage my time.  I have been a bit more functional on a heavy day using this technique.  The rest of the book is  nothing new to someone who is busy and has survived thus far.

The characters are well developed and you love and hate them, until you are caught in the  final conundrum.  You accept them at that point as a product of  circumstance.  This was my first Richard North Patterson novel and I  enjoyed it immensely.	2000-07-25

Although the era has passed for this book to be cutting edge, it was a fantastic, exciting, and exotic read.  It is an original and blow-your-mind resolution.  Between the  tension, he never fails to insert some humor.  This is a cold war era spy  novel with &quot;spies within spies&quot;, double agenting, and the fear of  another ideology all the way through.  There is action aplenty, and you  will find your pulse racing right along with the main characters...Then  read the Lion's Game as Demille finds employment for some of his cold war  characters.	2000-07-25

Books	5	3	4	N	N	A Fascinating Listen for a Long Trip	I picked up this audiocasette due to curiosity.  The information packed tape was interesting, and even made me angry because this tragedy did not have to happen.  Like people say, most tragedies are a string of  unfortunate events coming together at the same time.  I don't think the  sinking of this liner is anything different.  It gives a glimpse into the  technological limitations of the day, the caste system of the gilded age,  and the prevailing seaman's attitude of the time.  After listening to this  (and reading The Perfect Storm), my interest was certainly piqued.  I  ordered some books on the Titanic and the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, and can't  wait until they get here.	2000-07-25

He breathes new life into the boring  old serial killer format, and you become engrossed with the lead characters.  The narrator's voice is  clear, varies from character to character, and he carries accents well.   Unlike some abridged autiotapes, I did not have trouble keeping the  story-line straight.  I am hooked on Parker now.	2000-07-25

The book is full of great photos paying equal homage to the &quot;field&quot; vs. &quot;English&quot; labs, and does not disciminate over color.  His photography skills capture the personalities of the breed,  and the depth of the relationships between dog and handler.  The captions  are perfect, and some will bring a tear to the eye of even the most stoic  of us all.  <br />The book is slanted toward field work, domestic life and  hunting activities, rather than conformance or obedience work.  My husband  loved this as a gift, and he is nearly impossible to buy for.  All in all,  though, it is a beautiful tribute to this remarkable breed.	2000-07-25

This is one of the more recent and thorough books on skin problems in dogs.  Incidentally, skin problems are the most common problem for canines.  The book is laid out like an encyclopedia by technical name of problem.   It shows pictures of severe cases of many problems, and lists the most  common problems by breed.  The useful appendices allow you to cross  reference your information to be sure you've uncovered all that you  can.<br />Although I would never try to diagnose my own pet, while getting to  the root of my Labrador's skin problem (which was a series of severe  inhalant allergies), it helped me check up on my vet, ask intelligent  questions, and find a fantastic specialist to finally relieve his symptoms.   I have broken in the binder on this book as I refer to it constantly, and  have many friends call to have me help them find information.	2000-07-13

I enjoyed this book very much.  You can identify with the small child wishing they were anywhere but where they were.  It was interesting, and almost read like fiction at times.  You see the viewpoints of a child  obsessed as well as an adult resolving and examining her life.  I enjoyed  the discussion questions at the end of the book and actually thought  through them.  It almost made me wish I were back in high school English  class.  Not earthmoving, but a good read and thought provoking.	2000-06-13

I enjoyed some of his (Nelson)Demille-esque spy-chasing, and giggled at the name of the band.  It conjures up images of a big haired and  sweat-banded singer.  Seriously, though, It is a good tale with several  different story lines running throughout which finally meet.  The  international scope is welcome after his more recent domestic series.  The  bottom line is that it is a good read, Still Pearson, and is a testament to  the talent he has.	2000-05-30

Sometimes it was a laugh of incredulity.  It's not the murderous rampage which I found funny (in fact, some of the details, especially when  animals were involved, sickened me), but the fact that everyone in  Bateman's life is so caught up with making money, having no body fat,  wearing the proper attire, eating the right course at the right restaurant,  etc., that they don't even notice that Patrick is a killer among them.   Even when he slips it into conversation!  The fact that the characters  fight over what &quot;GQ&quot; would say about a piece of clothng or the  crust on a pizza at the &quot;in&quot; restaurant (and MEAN it) is  hysterical.  I looked forward to the quips about the morning show with  which he is obsessed.  It's a classic spoof of the eighties!	2000-05-06

This collection on vignettes from nurses around the country is captivating.  Aside from the sadness, fear, frustration, and  joy, you will laugh a lot.  A theme that keeps coming up throughout the  tape focuses on cutbacks made in the medical profession.  Just when  you  are lost in a story, the &quot;reality slap&quot; of how the system has  been altered reaches out and gets you.  Although I appreciate this now, I  think only a nurse functioning within the constraints placed on them in  some situations can truly appreciate it.  Nurses are some of the real  heroes out there.	2000-05-06

It focuses on issues such as how your dog uses scent, how your handling of the lead affects the dog, why YOU need to be a skillful track layer, and how AKC  tracking is sometimes contrary to the way a dog would economically use its  nose to reach a goal.  The book also points out several errors handlers  make and points out errors of traditional tracking wisdom.  I can't wait to  make some of these observations in my own dog and make better use of what  he's telling me.	2000-04-25

The book focuses on getting past the standard ears back/teeth bared/tail curved reading of body posture and encourages you to look for earlier, more subtle cues so you can help your  dog head off an uncomfortable situation.  I wish there was a pictorial  section of some of the more subtle cues and more hands on information of  how to correct body posture so the dog feels less threatened.  One  fantastic line from the book is &quot;I'm surprised more dogs don't bite  people&quot;!  It was a good, easy read and is very thought provoking.	2000-04-25

I think I expected a lot more action in the story.  I would have liked this more had they included pictures of the landscape, themselves, some of the people they had met, and  a larger map.

It tastes like soap to me, and Ina shares my view!  I feel  validated by this book !  I've so far only made a few recipes, but love  them.

I've read all of Patricia Cornwell, and have just about OD'd on Ridley Pearson, and this was an Amazon suggestion.  While it was a decent read, I found two major problems by page 37.  First of all, what Medical Examiner  would be out in the middle of nowhere conducing a scene investigation in a  skirt and high heels?  Sexist, if you ask me.  Secondly, he paints the  &quot;small town medical examiner&quot; as some sort of villain and says HE  will embalm the victim.  Having both funeral directors and medical  examiners in my family, I know that no ME will embalm a body...and you do  not need an MD for embalming.  It was a decent read, but some of his  descriptions and action scenes get a little drawn out.  I found myself  skimming some parts.

I have become a fan of Pearson over the last several months, and I gave him a three-star for Hard Fall.  This is probably because I'm comparing this to some of his better books (Undercurrents, The Pied Piper) not  necessarily his peers.  This is my seventh Pearson book and, like Richard  North Patterson and others, he is seeming in a bit of a rut and reusing the  same schemes.  I'm on to the &quot;forumula&quot;.  There is always the  child angle, the cop &quot;officially&quot; off the case, the threats  against the cop/FBI agent, trouble brewing at home, yada yada yada. I still  love Pearson's books though.  Keep them coming.  Until new angles come  along, I will view these as favorite old friends.	2000-01-13

I give this work credit for not being more-of-the-same of its predecessor.

I disagree with the reader below that states that these men are portrayed as money spending alcoholics.  If you don't live the life, you can't make that judgment in my view.  It takes a certain type of person  to live that life, take that risk, and be separated from family like that.   I refuse to look at these people in the context of 9-to-5 terms. In my  twenties, I went out a lot, lived paycheck to paycheck, but just happened  to do it in a business suit.   Having spent five years scuba diving off of  Cape Ann, I have a whole new appreciation for the people of the area and  the world  in which they live. I personally don't relate well to the  3-dimensional discriptions of the bait and tackle, so I breezed over that.   The weather information, storm descriptions, etc. were horrifying.  The end  was a bit chilling.  I wish the author put a glossary of terms (may be with  diagrams) so that terms like &quot;beam-to&quot; were more understandable  to those of us not involved in sea-life.  I would also have loved to see  pictures of the storm, a typical &quot;sword boat&quot; and perhaps some of  the people involved.  All in all, a good read.	2000-01-12

It is fun to see all-out entertaining in this book.  They make sample invitations and themes, even signed with very southern names.  I realize this isn't indicative of the entire south, but it's fun to see plans for a &quot;Thursday lunch&quot; and a &quot;supper club&quot;, a few themes  which would be way out of character for my circle.  It is a wonderful  fantasy, though.  The recipes are easy and very good with nice photographs.   This is a book that is as much fun to read as it is functional.  The pears  en croute alone are a good enough reason to buy the book. It is set into  various themes and occasions which I find helpful, however the only one  they left out was a baby or bridal shower!  It's a great book.

One would think that many of the things she says about her family members would create some hard feelings.  I am  glad that she has matured a bit, but is still principled.  I am glad to  know more about her children and  her other sisters.  Many of the reviewers  swear that this isn't indicative of Saudi culture, but a reader make  decisions for themselves.  It gave me the impression that the royal family  gets away with atrocities that others would not...similar to a major  political family here in the US.  It also gives some insight into the  sociology of a culture, not just this one.  Extremes breed extremes.  It  was good reading, true or not.	2000-01-05

I listened to this on tape and can't wait to study how Buffalo looked at that time...not to mention to learn whether or not President Cleveland was  such a disgusting pig.  It is funny to hear the names of many people in the  context of life, not the memorialized museum, hospital, road, etc. that we  think of now in Buffalo.  As we face a controversy over a bike path through  a protected wildlife area in my area, it brings to the forefront that  people have had concerns over progress vs. protection for years. The story  itself was interesting and kept me occupied, however, the abridgement of  the tape made me rewind a few times to make sure I kept everything  straight.  I also had to remind myself that this story takes place long  before forensic detail was available.	1999-12-20

It angers me to believe that women are treated like this in a society ruled by men who fear education and liberation will  threaten their pleasure seeking and hypocritcal lifestyles.  I don't wish  to generalize about all Saudis, however the stories in this book make me  feel fortunate that I am American.  I am glad I am not living in an  oppressive culture and I am not in a desperately poor country where I would  have to work in servitude as an ex-patriot in a system such as this.  I  feel for the women of Saudi Arabia who do not  like their circumstance. I  now wonder what many of the foreign male students of middle eastern origin  really think of me when I walk down the street near a local  university  with a significant foreign population. I disagree however with one of the  other reviewers who felt this book bashed Islam.  The author was careful to  point out that Mohamad taught kindness and gentleness, however people in  power choose to interpret the Koran in a way that suits them.   I realize  that it must be difficult to translate a story, and write in another  language, but if you read this, you will get sick of the phrase  &quot;within the hour&quot;...just a part of the book I found irksome.	1999-12-20

I have added the remaining books of his that I have yet to read to my shopping cart (that's the idea, huh, Amazon?).  It involved staying up late, being scared,  holding my breath, and the like.  Although he reuses a few schemes in the  book, he is versatile enough to escape the tried and true, mano-a-mano  serial slaughterer.	1999-11-08

After reading the book, I listened to the abridged version of the audio tape.  I thought the book w as fine, but the audio tape was horrible.  That narrator has got to go...she has one accent..and it isn't a very good  southern one, and I was embarrassed for her by her portrayal of Marino.   Don't bother...stick with the book.	1999-10-02

His forensic work is credible and factual, and the pace is non-stop. This book adds depth to the characters, and I now understand the Lou/Elizabeth/Daphne dynamic.  The  characters are human, and you care for them.  Doctor Dixon also has more  depth in my mind after reading this book. Boldt's aching for children is  getting a little old, and Pearson's   pro-life message didn't go unnoticed.   Keep books like these coming!	1999-09-27

I think, as Patricia Cornwell is so superb a yarn-spinner, that we are holding her to a higher level than other authors.  It would be hard to top  herself, but the books are still fantastic.  This was better than the  Hornet's Nest and more imaginable than Point of Origin.  I'm glad I  disregarded the reviews...but I had to as I pre-ordered it!	1999-09-18

This book-on-tape held my attention, and I listen to so many that this can be hard to do sometimes.  I finished this feeling sorry that it was over, hoping that there was still some hope for the victims, and feeling that the  judge should be ashamed of himself.  It is another example of the big  company being able to afford injustice as the little guy can't pay for  it...I'd also love to know about the politics behind-the-scenes.  I want a  follow up!!!!!!!!!!!!	1999-08-14

It made me want to smack (no pun intended) some of the characters for being so stubborn and not having any drive toward  self-preservation.  Teens should read this as long as they don't see it as  a disguised message from adults.  The last few chapters presented a lengthy  resolution that was tiring to read following all of the action of the  remainder of the book.	1999-08-08

I listened to this on Audio and found myself volunteering to run errands just to stay in the car longer.  I didn't think I'd like this, but was enthralled.  Being from a small, blue collar town in Western New York, I  related to much of the culture surrounding the author's life.  You cheered  for him all the way through!  It is uplifting, and should be a high school  literature requirement.	1999-07-10

After having read some of his others, I'm really getting sick of the maternity and paternity conflicts.  His writing style makes me stop and  reread sentences now and then, breaking up the total submersion I crave  while reading.	1999-07-09

I am much more interested in the dynamics and pasts of the Ya-Ya's than in Siddalee's story.  I find her lack of ability to love Conor fully and completely kind  of boring.  The conflict with the mother isn't that  gripping, either.  Don't expect an emotional rush, and you won't be  disappointed.  It's a decent beach book.	1999-07-08

It is a good book and gives the reader hope that behavior problems can be cured.  Author puts a lot of weight into chemical assistance, but I reminded myself that he is writing about extreme cases.  It was a good and  easy read, but you will start analyzing EVERYTHING your dog does.	1999-07-08

It is a warm and fuzzy read about the nature of humans...if you can get past the plight of Brummet.  That scene was extremely disturbing  and I found it overkill if the author was trying to shed light on blind  trust in the hands of an evil spirit.  It was an okay book, but Oprah has  picked better.	1999-07-08

The concept sounds boring, but it makes you realize that there are situations where the small things in life really do matter, and  everyplace has its rules.  The character is street wise and very likeable.  I read this during the Northeast heatwave in the 90 degree range with no  air conditioning and fantasized about the sub-zero cold!	1999-07-08

The story telling is engrossing, but  not all that deep.  But, then again, on a lazy summer afternoon, who wants deep?  I was slightly disturbed by  their preadolescent trysts, but they go by quickly and you move on.  I'd  recommend it for the beach bag.	1999-07-08

Who on earth let's dogs run the busy streets of Eastern Mass? Who thinks it is funny to let their dogs run, show up on someone's porch who will look at their tags and call her to  give them a ride home?  She does nothing scientific, but apomorhpizes quite  a bit.  I feel sorry for those dogs in many ways.	1999-07-08

I have been a professor in China and was always intrigued by the government regulations as well as family dynamics.

He's almost two now and I'm always complimented on his behavior, and this is one of the books (and authors) who stands out in my mind.  The book  is readable and his case studies are helpful, if not hilarious sometimes  (see: the dog who became agressive towards husband after baby was born).  I  didn't have a lot of confidence in my training at first, but I realize that  he's not a person nor should I expect him to be.  This book reinforced  that.  A good read.	1999-06-17
