This novel is actually a collection of 3 stories in which Nameless, his partner Tamara Corbin. and operative Jake Runyan all have separate cases. Nameless is summoned to the death bed of Russ Dancer, a former pulp writer who wishes Nameless to deliver a package to his mother-in-law, Cybil Wade after Dancer passes away. Jake Runyan investigates several cases of gay-bashing in the Castro district. One of the victims is lover of Jakes's son, Joshua. While on a routine stakeout, Tamara notices a man struggle with something that Tamara feels is a child. Tamara decides to snoop around the house, and is taken captive by a madman, Robert Lemoyne. He had kidnapped a little girl Lauren whom Lemoyne believed was his daughter. He takes them to a remote parcel of land in Nevada County with plans to kill them. This was not my favorite Nameless novel. The Tamara storyline, while exciting at the end, was really slow for me. Nameless (I still call him this even though we know his name is Bill) and the Russ Dancer storyline are for long time readers of this series, and new readers would need to go back to \\"Hoodwink\\" to understand all aspects of this storyline. Most of the actual detection was done by Jake Runyan with his working to find the gay-bashers in the Castro district. All the novels by Bill Pronzini are well written. I almost always give his novels 5 stars but this one lacked something. All in all, however, this is a very good book.	2005-08-21

This series began in 1956 with \\"Cop Hater\\". I have read almost all of these novels, and I have not read a bad one yet. \\"Hark!\\" marks the return of the Deaf Man. This man has managed to stay one step ahead of the boys of the 87th for a long time. He send messages to Steve Carella which initially are anagrams and later are quotes from Shakespeare. Will the cops of the 87th Precinct finally catch the Deaf Man, or will he manage to get away again? There are several subplots in this one. Cotton Hawes is shot, Kling and his girlfriend have problems, Carella's mother and sister get married, and Fat Ollie Weeks from the 88th finds the man who had stolen his novel. \\"Hark!\\" is perhaps the most clever of the Deaf Man novels. Someone spent a lot of time with the clues. \\"Hark!\\" is an excellent addition to this long-running and entertaining series. It is highly recommended.	2005-06-12

I always enjoy going into the old brownstone with Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. From reading the blurbs on the books, I gathered that Rex Stout had lived a very interesting life. John McAleer does a wonderful job with Stout's biography. He begins with his ancestry, and gives an account of his family, his first and second marriages, and the births of his daughters. He also follows Stout's early career as a writer, and tells us about Stout's EBS, a thrift banking system he invented in the late 1910's. Stout began to write the Nero Wolfe mysteries in 1934, and wrote 72 Nero Wolfe stories until his death in 1975. The thing I found fascinating was that Mr. McAleer gives us the time when each novel was written, with how many days Stout wrote and days he didn't write. This book is extensive, but I was captivated reading about the life of one of my favorite authors, Rex Stout. This biography is highly recommended.	2005-04-16

Craig because one of my favorite mystery writers, William G. Tapply, had written a Brady Coyne/J. W. Jackson novel with Craig, and I wanted to get to know J. W. before I read their joint effort, \\"First Light\\". J. W., his wife Zee and their 2 children, Joshua and Diana live on Martha's Vineyard.  The book opens as 2 thugs come to J. W. and Zee's house looking for Tom Rimini. When Zee tellsl them she knows of no Tom Rimini, the thugs attack her, and she shoots them, killing one and wounding the other. When J. W. returns from a clamming trip, he learns that the thugs were looking for Tom Rimini. J. W. knows that Rimini is the husband of J. W.'s ex-wife, Carla. It seems that Rimini owes gambling debts to Sonny Whelan, a Boston mob boss. When Rimini does come to J. W.'s house, J. W. agrees to hide him out at a neighbor's house more to help Carla than Rimini, whom he dislikes. There was little mystery and the plot was a bit thin for my taste. I liked the characters, but certain things about this novel annoyed me. The children who are small act like they are 10 years older than they really are, and are more polite than most children. This novel was average, and certainly not up to par with the Brady Coyne novels by William G. Tapply. At least when I read \\"First Light\\", I will know about J. W. and his family.	2005-02-25

Alex Cross is on his way to resign from the Washington, DC police force when his friend, John Sampson asks him to help clear Sampson's friend Ellis Cooper of the murders of 3 women in North Carolina. The women were painted with blue paint. Before Sampson and Alex can find the real killer, Ellis Cooper is executed. Other murders occur in which the bodies are painted red, white, or blue and the person accused is innocent. These murders occur in places all over the US. Alex and John realize they are dealing with highly professional killers who had all served in Vietnam. Patterson writes page turners and \\"Four Blind Mice\\" is no different. The violence is graphic, and the suspense relentless. I thought that this novel was much better than the three Cross novels before it, but not nearly as good as the earlier ones like \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and \\"Jack and Jill\\". I gave it four stars because of the page-turning suspense.	2005-01-19

One of Sharon's newest operatives, Julia Rafael, is arrested and charged with grand theft. The police say she used a credit card belonging to Alex Aguilar, a man who has great political aspirations. Aguilar then goes to the Department of Consumer Affairs and lodges a complain against McCone's agency. Aguilar had been a previous client of the firm. The DCA licenses her agency. The BSIS - Bureau of Investigative Services - would perform an audit and could take Sharon's license away. An attempt is made on Julia's life and someone shoots at Mick, Sharon's nephew and operative. Sharon wonders who hates her enough to want to ruin her.  She realizes that someone wants to do great harm to her. This novel has the usual cast of characters that are in the McCone novels. I think Marcia Muller still has the best female investigator in mystery fiction. This novel is full of suspense and is highly recommended.	2005-01-08

When Will goes to Stalker's Creek to recover his Henry rifle, he meets with the Widow Packard, and she offers him the job as town marshal. Bax considers Matt a traitor and orders him out of town. I really enjoyed this novel. It is very suspensful and I could not put it down. There are some interesting plot twists as well. \\"Stalker's Creek\\" is highly recommended.	2004-11-02

When he gets there, the painting is missing and later Bernie is framed for Onderdonk's murder. He is later framed for the murder of a small time artist. He must prove his innocence and does it in Nero Wolfe style by gathering all the suspects together to give the solutions to all the crimes. This was my 7th Bernie Rhodenbarr novel, and my least favorite to date. The plot was complex and some of the aspects were hard to believe. Don't start the series with this one. This one is for true fans of Bernie Rhodenbarr.	2004-10-13

This novel co-stars one of Woods' other series characters, Holly Barker, chief of police in Orchid Beach, Florida. Holly comes to New York with her Doberman, Daisy, to arrest Trini Rodriguez who is wanted for several murders in Florida. The problem for Holly is that Rodriguez is in the FBI's Witness Protection Program; the FBI is making it very difficult for her to nab Rodriguez. This novel has some characters from past Barrington novels. Lance Cabot from \\"The Short Forever\\" hires Stone to represent a very shady character who is doing work for the CIA. Ed Eagle from \\"Santa Fe Rules\\" makes a brief appearance. Dino Bacchetti, Stone's former NYPD partner, plays a big role in helping Holly to find Rodriguez.

Michael Moore has been allowed to write books and make documentaries which twist the truth and only present one side of any story. He calls himself a liberal but is perhaps the most narrow-minded person I've ever encountered. His statements have largely gone unchecked, and many people believe everything he says as the whole truth without researching the facts. This book is not an attack of Moore such as you would find from the far right, but is a book based on facts. It begins with his resume showing that he worked only one day for GM, and quit. It shows that he was fired from a leftist magazine in San Francisco, and sued it for $2 million, receiving $58,000 as an out of court settlement. It goes on to show the half-truths and outright lies presented in Bowling for Columbine. This book was written before Fahrenheit 9/11 came out, so very little is said about that. The book ends with 38 pages of sources the authors used to research the works of Michael Moore. It points out that Moore is an extremely rich liberal. He owns a $1.9 million home in New York City, and a $1.2 million home in Michigan. My only problem with this book is in the title. Michael Moore is a lot of things, but stupid isn't one of them. Stupid people don't charge $30,000 a speech to denounce the wealthy. After reading one of his books, and seeing one of his documentaries, I really enjoyed reading a book that actually agreed with my positions on this man. People who say that this book is an attack from the far right haven't read it at all. It's the most fair and balanced book out there.	2004-07-27

Spenser also discovers that someone was also following Ellen, and he finds out later that another detective was following Marlene Rowley. Before Spenser can investigate further, Trent Rowley is murdered. Then, another Kinergy employee is found murdered. Marlene hires Spenser to find Trent's killer. Everything points to Darrin O'Mara, a talk show radio host who advocates wife swapping and claims that courtly love can only be found by having affairs with other people. As Spenser digs deeper, he uncovers shady accounting procedures that show Kinergy is not as strong financially as the public is led to believe. The story was a little too much like the Enron case. The plot was rather complex, and the book did not move as fast for me as most Spenser novels do. This one was average for Parker, who is one of the best crime novelists working today.	2004-07-24

The book begins in 1977, two years since Stout's last novel &quot;A Family Affair&quot; was published. Nero Wolfe has not taken a case since then and Archie wonders if he will ever work again. Maria Radovich asks Wolfe's help in finding who is sending her uncle Milan Stevens, the conductor of the New York Symphony, threatening notes. Wolfe agrees to take the case because he knows Milan Stevens as Milos Stefanovic, the man who saved Wolfe's life in Montenegro many years ago. Before Wolfe makes much progress on the case, Milan Stevens is found murdered in his apartment. Gerald Milner, Maria's lover, is charged with murder because he was seen leaving Stevens' apartment the night of the murder. Wolfe believes he is innocent and solves the case. I read that Goldsborough wrote this for his mother who wanted &quot;one more Nero Wolfe&quot; story. I think he does a fantastic job of creating the atmosphere of the brownstone. All the Stout regulars are there such as Inspector Cramer, Fritz, Fred Durkin, and Saul Panzer. &quot;Murder in E Minor&quot; is a very good novel.	2004-06-12

Holly Barker is forced into early retirement from the Army after a nasty sexual harassment case. Chet Marley, chief of police in Orchid Beach, offers Holly a job as his deputy chief of police. On her first day on the job, Holly learns that Marley had been shot the night before and was in a coma. She also finds out that Marley's best friend, Hank Doherty, had been killed the same night.

As she investigates, she is led to Palmetto Gardens, a very exclusive and rich piece of property in Orchid Beach. It is gated with extremely tight security. With the help of the FBI, her father Hamilton, and her lover Jackson Oxenhandler, Holly gets the answers to her questions. I enjoyed this book.

Riggs on a remainder table in a book store. I had never heard of Mr. Riggs until then, and I found out that 13 of these novels were written between 1984 and 1998. I think the prime reason I hadn't heard of him is the fact that all his novels were published by minor publishing companies. Since &quot;The Lost Scout&quot; is the last of the Ryland novels, I decided to start at the beginning of the series with &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;. Garth Ryland is a fortyish newspaper editor for the Oakalla (Wisconsin) Reporter. Si Buckles, Oakalla's practical joker, is dead. Garth goes to the funeral, but later finds a note at his house that says &quot;Si Buckles lives.&quot; Phil Chesterson, a friend of Si's kills himself for reasons no one knows. Then Dr. Fran Baldwin commits suicide. Several people, including the lovely Diana, Fran's wife and Garth's dear friend, see Si Buckles walking around. Is Si really dead? Could it be that he was buried alive as a joke? Has a murder occurred? This is not a typical mystery novel. In fact it is not only a &quot;who-done-it?&quot; but a &quot;what has been done to whom?&quot; as well. I really enjoyed reading this novel. It is set in small town America, and is quite a bit of fun. I look forward to reading the rest of these novels!	2004-04-17

Daryl Bruner, a 33 year old with the mind of a 10 year old, had been shot and killed by Rafe Paul, one of Norman Billingsley's cowboys. Billingsley thinks that he and his men are above the law. Ben, who is now married to Kay Hobbs (from \\"Once a Marshal\\"), decides to accept the council's offer and becomes sheriff. He hires his friend Leon McMannigle to be his deputy. Ben sets out to clean up the town while others want to see him meet the same end as the last sheriff who was murdered. Quite a bit has been written about the sex in Brandvold's Westerns. I think the descriptions are brief and tastefully done. It is mild compared with much of today's fiction. All the sex is between husband and wife with Ben and Kay Stillman, and Jody and Crystal Harmon. Peter Brandvold writes suspensful Westerns that are among the best being written today. \\"Once More with a .44\\" is highly recommended.	2004-02-26

He has spent 28 years serving the people of Georgia. I have not always seen eye to eye with him, but I have been pleasantly surprised with his service in the US Senate. He was appointed, then elected to fill the remainder of Paul Coverdell's term in the Senate after Coverdell died. \\"A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat\\" has a special message to the Democratic party in America. Zell Miller has been a Democrat all his life, and he writes that he is a Democrat in the mold of FDR, Harry Truman, LBJ, Richard Russell, Herman Talmadge, and Jimmy Carter. His message is rather simple. The national Democratic party has forgotten about the South. He points out that in 1972, 1984, 1988, and 2000 that the Democratic candidate for president carried no state in what he calls the Old Confederacy. In 1968, the party carried only one state and only Georgia went for Jimmy Carter in 1980. In all those years the Republican was elected president. In 1976, Jimmy Carter carried 10 Southern states and won. Bill Clinton carried four states in 1992 and 1996 and he won. The reason that the Democrats are doing so badly in the South is that they've become too liberal. Dean, Kerry, Ted Kennedy, and the like never come to the South to campaign for a Senate or House candidate because they are too liberal. He says that unless the party moves more toward the center, they will continue to lose the White House. The 11 states in the \\"Old Confederacy\\" now have 153 electoral votes. That is a huge lead the Democrats are giving the Republicans each year. Zell's book is well written and conveys his views on what is wrong with his party. And to show that he practices what he preaches, Zell has endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004, and will even campaign for him. \\"A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat\\" is highly recommended.	2004-01-17

This is an excellent novel by William Tapply. Even after 19 Coyne novels, his plots are fresh and the suspense is riveting. &quot;A Fine Line&quot; is highly recommended.	2004-01-07

In all there are 14 short stories in this book. Of special interest is the short story &quot;It's a Lousy World&quot; which is Nameless' first case and was written in 1968. There is also a Nameless/Sharon McCone story which Pronzini co-wrote with his wife, Marcia Muller. Bill Pronzini is a giant in mystery fiction and this book shows he is a master of the short story as well. &quot;Scenarios&quot; should be a part of any &quot;Nameless Detective&quot; collection.	2004-01-07

Neely Crenshaw returns to his home town of Messina because his high school football coach, the legendary Eddie Rake, is on his death bed. While there he meets up with many people who played for Eddie Rake. Rake coached at Messina from 1958-1992 and won over 400 games and many state championships, but he was very tough on his players especially on Neely Crenshaw who was an All-American high school quarterback who played on Rake's last championship team in 1987. This novel is about football obviously, but it is also about remembering and forgiving. If you are from a small town in the South as I am, you'll understand that on Friday nights in the fall football is the only game in town. &quot;Bleachers&quot; is a very good novel, and every football fan should read it.	2003-11-23

When Nagasawa's friend Jody Houston leaves San Francisco, and Sharon's reporter friend J. D.

Hamish travels to the small village of Drim which is in his territory to check out a very handsome and rich Englishman, Peter Hynd, who has moved there. The middle-aged women of Drim are all going to the hairdresser and taking aerobics classes in order to impress Mr. Hynd. He is even sleeping with some of the women, most of whom are married. Suddenly he disappears from Drim, and sells his house.

To get away from Lochdubh and Priscilla, he vacations in Drim to try to find out exactly what happened to Peter Hynd.

It gives details of many species that are lost to us forever. The illustrations are beautiful. Each species that is covered has a matching picture, its range, and reasons why it became extinct. The human species is mostly to blame for the loss of many of these creatures with destruction of habitat, over hunting, and introduction of disease and predators. Some of the species like the Dodo bird, the Great Auk, the Passenger Pigeon, and the Carolina Parakeet are well known whereas others are not known. It's very sad in a way. We have been able to save the California Condor and the Whooping Crane, but have probably lost the Dusky Seaside Sparrow, the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker, and Bachman's Warbler in recent years. This book is excellent, but really only covers the tip of the iceberg when it comes to species we've lost forever.	2003-04-03

I had thought that Pronzini's last novel, &quot;Bleeders&quot;, might have been his last &quot;Nameless Detective&quot; novel. Bill Pronzini is my favorite mystery writer working today, and I rejoiced when I found out that this wonderful series is continuing. Some changes have occcured in Nameless' agency. He has made his assistant, Tamara Corbin, his partner, and they have hired former Seattle cop Jake Runyon to do much of the leg work for the agency. Most of the novel is told by Nameless in the first person as always, but several chapters in which Tamara or Jake Runyon are  featured are told in the third person. Pronzini makes this style work wonderfully. Steve Taradash hires the agency to find out the identity of a homeless man who was murdered outside his business. This man is known on the street as Spook, and he &quot;talks&quot; to people named Dot, Luke, and Mr. Snow. Jake Runyon does most of the leg work in Mono County, and finds out some very interesting facts. The reader learns about the private lives on both Tamara and Jake Runyon.

The dating service is owned by two women, Maria Worth and Peta Gore. Peta is a terrible glutton, eating everything in sight, and making people so mad that they think of ways to get rid of her. When she is found dead with an apple stuck in her mouth, it is up to Hamish to find the murderer. As usual, he upstages Inspector Blair from Strathbane. I am reading these novels in order, and I think that this is the best one to date. It is highly recommended.	2002-06-12

I look forward to getting his Spenser novels each Spring. Mary Smith is charged with the murder of her rich husband, Nathan Smith who was murdered in his bed. It appears that the only other person in the house was Mary. Mary claims that she was watching TV at the time. Parker does a great job with her character; Mary isn't very intelligent to say the least. Spenser begins to investigate and finds that someone doesn't want him on the case at all. He is followed, then someone tries to kill him. Then, other people involved in the case are found dead. Spenser is stumped until the very end. Spenser is back in Boston for this one after being in Georgia and Arizona for the last 2 books. I think this is an excellent addition to this long-running PI series.	2002-06-12

I found this novel to be the most complex of the Barrington books to date. Stone is hired by a client of Woodman &amp; Weld, the law firm for whom Stone does certain miscellaneous jobs. The client's name is John Bartholomew who wants Stone to go to London to break up the relationship of his neice, Erica Burroughs, and her boyfriend, Lance Cabot who Bartholomew says is a cocaine smuggler. He asks Stone to bring Erica back to New York with him, and make sure Lance Cabot is sent to prison. When Stone gets to London, he learns that Erica Burroughs is not Bartholomew's neice. Lance Cabot is not a cocaine smuggler. He also learns that Bartholomew isn't whom he says he is, but is in fact a CIA operative working in London. No Stone Barrington novel would be complete without Stone's bedding a beautiful woman. This time he sleeps with former flame, Sarah Buckminster, who has moved back to England. He also meets with his true love, Arrington Calder, but once again their wires get crossed and she returns to the States before anything can happen. I found &quot;The Short Forever&quot; fast-paced and entertaining.	2002-06-02

Molly Antonio, a tenant in Sharon's building is found dead by her husband, Gus. She had been strangled. With things slow at the All Soul's Legal Cooperative where Sharon works, she is able to work on the case. She finds quite a few suspects along the way.

David Summers, a professor at Douglas College in Toronto, is murdered in Montreal during an academic conference. When the Montreal police ask for help, Salter is called in on the case. He finds that Summers had attended the conference with many of his colleagues, one of whom disliked Summers very much. Salter must wade through a lot of suspects before he identifies the killer. This is a very good debut novel for this excellent police procedural series from Canada.	2002-04-20

Glenna Stanleigh, a friend of McCone's, is filming a documentary on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It appears that someone is trying to sabotage the project and Glenna fears that someone is trying to kill her. She asks McCone to come to Hawaii and investigate. She and her lover, Hy Ripinsky, go to Hawaii. Glenna's project focuses on the Wellbright family, a wealthy family with quite a few dark secrets. Sharon almost becomes involved with helicopter pilot Russ Tanner, and her relationship with Hy is put to the test. This is a different kind of McCone novel. I did miss the San Francisco crew, but all in all I thought this was an excellent novel.	2002-03-20

I really like the character, as well as Roberts' writing style. Milan has two cases in this novel. He is working for Armand Treush, owner of TroyToy, who is suspicious that his accountant might be a corporate spy. His other case comes to him by circumstance. He notices an old Native American sitting all day on a bench outside his apartment in the frigid February cold. When he hears that the old man has been murdered, he goes to the police and identifies the man as the one he had seen. He then gets a visit from Eddie Ettawageshik, who is the grandson of the old man, Joseph Ettawageshik. Eddie tells Milan that his grandfather was in Cleveland looking for his great-grandson, Andrew Takalo, a baby who had been kidnapped from his home in Cross Village, Michigan. Milan agrees to help Eddie locate his nephew. This book is an excellent addition to the series and is highly recommended.	2002-03-04

When Hamish Macbeth is told that Mr. Trent has been murdered at his home, he hesitates thinking it is just another practical joke. But Andrew Trent has been murdered. Hamish Macbeth investigates finding several people in his family that wanted him dead. Was he killed for hate, or was he killed for money? This novel is good, but some of the local Scottish flavor that is in the other books is absent in this one, but if you are reading through the series, as I am, it is worth your time.	2002-02-02

Every time I hear that he has a new Nameless Detective novel coming out, I get excited in anticipation of reading it. &quot;Bleeders&quot; is the 27th novel in the series. Nameless helps his client Carolyn Dain recover $75,000 that her husband, Jay Cohalan, has obtained from scamming her. When he goes to return the money, he is met by a bald man who takes the money from him and tries to kill him. Luckily for Nameless, the gun jams and he is spared. He later finds his client dead on her bed from a gunshot wound. He begins his quest in pursuit of the bald man. &quot;Bleeders&quot; has a strong plot, and Pronzini is a master at placing the reader at the scene of the action. Nameless and Kerry, his wife, now have an adopted daughter, Emily (from &quot;Crazybone&quot;). That storyline is heart-warming and adds a dimension to the series that had not been there before. I noticed that the novel was dedicated to Bill Pronzini, and that there were references made to Nameless' possible retirement. I really hope that Nameless has at least a few more cases left in him. If not, thank you, Bill Pronzini for providing me with many hours of enjoyable reading!	2002-01-11

Priscilla Eads, the heiress to millions of dollars, asks Nero Wolfe if she can stay in his house for a week. Shortly after Wolfe turns her down, Priscilla and her maid are found strangled to death. Archie asks Wolfe to investigate the murders. The plot is strong, although dark, and the characters are strong and believable, but the main enjoyment I get out of reading any of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe novels is another trip into the old brownstone house in New York on West Thirty-fifth Street with Archie Goodwin, Nero Wolfe, Fritz, fine dining, and orchids. It's always a pleasure to read a Nero Wolfe mystery.	2001-12-23

The novel centers around the kidnapping of Regan's father, Luke Reilly, and his driver just days before Christmas. Regan and Alvirah team up to help solve the crime. The kidnappers follow a plot used by Regan's mother, Nora, who is a mystery writer. This is an enjoyable read, and is recommended for 3-4 hours of holiday fun.	2001-12-23

Susan and Byrne Hollander are brutally murdered in a burglary on their home. Days later, the 2 killers are found in a room in Brooklyn dead in what the police believe is a murder-suicide. They close the case. Matthew Scudder believes that a third person is involved in the murders and tells the Hollander's daughter, Kristin, his theory. She hires him to find the murderer. Then Kristin's first cousin, Lia Parkman, is murdered. Seven other poeple are murdered before Scudder figures out who did it. The murderer is perhaps the most diabolical creation of Lawrence Block. I also enjoyed learning more about Scudder's sons, as they play a role in one of the novel's subplots. This is an excellent addition to an excellent series.	2001-12-18

Someone placed a bomb under the truck and it blew up with him one night. Dave learns that Meyers had been doing nightwork to make extra money. Who killed Paul Meyers? Was it Silencio Ruiz, a gang leader who was sent to jail on Paul's testimony, and who vowed to kill him when he got out of prison? Was it Bruce Kilgore, a teacher, with whom Paul's wife Angela was having an affair? Does it have anything to do with Paul's nightwork? The plot and the characters are strong.

When the driver of the car, John Brown, is found murdered, the police think Holland is the prime suspect.  To clear his name, he begins to search for the real killer.  Every avenue he looks into leads to C. C. Monroe, a candidate for the governor of Minnesota. The plot is rather complex, but I really liked the novel and the character of Holland Taylor who has some personal demons that he struggles to deal with. I especially enjoyed the parts with Ogilvy, his pet rabbit, because we own a male lop-eared rabbit. This is an excellent debut novel, and I look forward to reading the next 2 Holland Taylor novels.	2001-10-03

Steve Carella and Meyer Meyer from the 87th Precinct and Fat Ollie Weeks from the 88th are called to the Grover Park Zoo to investigate the death of a woman who has been eaten by lions. They find out that she is Cassandra Ridley, a former Gulf War pilot. They also learn that she had recently made a drug run to Mexico. They also find out that she was paid a tip with &quot;super-bills&quot;, bogus $100 bills. The plot to this one is rather complex with drugs, bogus money, murder, and a bombing at Clarendon Hall.  More attention is given to the criminal element than is usual in McBain's novels. The characters are all well-drawn, especially a drug dealer named &quot;Wiggy the Lid&quot;, a man you would not wish to meet.  This is another excellent addition to a series that began in 1956. I have 45 of them, and I have not read a bad one yet.	2001-09-08

Sean Dillon returns in &quot;The President's Daughter&quot;.  The President of the United States, Jake Cazalet, fathered a child during a brief affair while he was in Vietnam.  Only he and the child's mother knew her true paternity, or so they thought.  Almost thirty years later, the president's daughter, Marie de Brissac, is kidnapped by Israeli terrorists who hope to get Cazalet to support an effort by the US government to bomb Arab countries like Syria and Iraq.  Cazalet opposes the initiative, and calls on Sean Dillon, ex-IRA enforcer now working for the British to try to find Marie and rescue her.  In the meantime, this group kidnaps Dillon's colleague, Chief Inspector Hannah Bernstein.  After finding out where the women are held, Dillon and American Blake Johnson stage a daring rescue.  The suspense is taut, and I found it impossible to put down this excellent novel by the master of the thriller, Jack Higgins.	2001-04-03

I didn't like a single character in this book, and the main character is no more than a twisted sexual deviant.  I would give this book zero stars if that were allowed.  I would not recommend this novel to anyone unless you enjoy reading about the psychological breakdown of a very unlikeable person.	2001-03-25

They team up to investigate the murder of Elaine Picard, a former friend of McCone, head of security at the Casa del Ray hotel in San Diego where a private investigator's convention is being held.  McCone and Nameless (whom McCone calls &quot;Wolf&quot;) alternate chapters.  This novel sizzles with action and it is one of my favorites of both Pronzini and Muller.  I'm hoping that one day the husband and wife team of Pronzini and Muller will write another joint venture featuring Sharon McCone and the Nameless Detective.  An excellent novel that is highly recommended.	2001-03-17

All the praise that Lehane receives is warranted.  &quot;A Drink Before the War&quot;  features the PI team of Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro who work in Boston.  Two senators ask them to find Jenna Angeline, a cleaning woman, who they believe stole some sensitive documents from one seantor's office.  They find her, but things don't end there.  Gang warfare breaks out, and Kenzie and Gennaro are in grave danger themselves.  All the main characters in this book are well-drawn, and the depiction of Boston is right on target.  I can hardly wait to read all of the Kenzie-Gennaro books by this very talented author.  This one is highly recommended.	2001-01-29

Walter Mosley is one of the finest writers in American fiction today.  This collection is highly recommended!	2001-01-09

This story is not meant to be up to par with her longer novels, and the readers who have complained that it wasn't long enough fail to realize that Clark was commissioned to write a Christmas story only.  Alvirah Meehan solves two mysteries; one concerning a missing baby left in front of a church 7 years earlier, and the other concerning a phony will.  I enjoyed the story, especially during this time of the year.	2000-12-25

For me, the Stone Barrington novels have been hit or miss.  If the word &quot;dead&quot; has been in the title, the novels have been very good (&quot;New York Dead&quot; and &quot;Dead in the Water&quot;).  &quot;L.A. Dead&quot; is one of the best of the Stone Barrington books.  Stone goes to Italy to marry Dolce Bianchi, but before the religious ceremony takes place, Stone learns that his actor friend, Vance Calder has been murdered, and that the prime suspect is his wife, Arrington.  Arrington is also one of Stone's former lovers, the only woman that Stone truly loves.  He goes to California to help Arrington fight the murder charge, with the help of big-time lawyer, Marc Blumberg.  Stuart Woods is one of the top suspense writers today, and &quot;L.A.

Nameless must found out who murdered Paige, and investigates.  As he investigates, the list of suspects grows.  This novel is not one of Pronzini's best-known books, but it is well worth reading, especially if you're planning to read all the Nameless Detective mysteries.	2000-12-07

In fact this novel is the first Pearson novel I've read, and I was well pleased. The novel actually consists of 2 stories that are not related, except that they have parallel themes. Ray Tatum joins the Hogarth VA sheriff's department and discovers a skeleton on the Appalachian Trail. He must solve the murder with the help of Kit Carson, a black woman with the park service. His story is told in third person. The other story is about Ray's cousin, Paul, an actuary, who travels from Roanoke to New York City to identify the reamins of an illegitimate son that he fathered back in the 1970's. His story is told in first person with Paul as the narrator. Each is story is captivating, and the characters are all well-drawn. I especially enjoyed the local characters in Hogarth County. Pearson has a gift for rich characters and strong plots. He is a writer that I intend to read again. \\"Blue Ridge\\" is an excellent novel.	2000-11-20

The Best Kept Secret is a term that refers to the city of Cleveland.  Reggie Parker, a friend of Milan's who is also a principal of the high school that Milan's oldest son Milan, Jr. attended, asks Milan to look into allegations of rape by one of his former students, Jason Crowell, a freshman at Sherman College.  The group calling themselves Women's Warriors have posted fliers about Jason being a rapist.  The administration at the college believes he is guilty of rape including Dorothy Strassky, the counselor for sexual harassment at Sherman.  Strassky calls Jacovich to set up a meeting with him to give him information that she has learned.  Before their meeting, Strassky is murdered.  Jason Crowell becomes the prime suspect in her murder.  Then, a large quantity of heroin is found in the house that Jason lived in, and he is charged with possession with intent to distribute.  It becomes apparent to Jacovich that Jason is being framed.  Only he and Reggie Parker believe that Jason is innocent.  Even Jason's father believes his son is guilty.  There are many secrets here:  Who was raped?  Who are the Women's Warriors?  Why has Jason not told Jacovich that he is gay?  Who is framing Jason?  It is up to Jacovich to answer all these questions.  I really like the character of Milan Jacovich.  The Best Kept Secret is an excellent novel!	2000-10-29

When Kaye is found murdered, Mick is the likely suspect.  Brady's investigation turns up things in Kaye's life that are contrary to what most people believe about her.  Tapply does a super job in drawing the character of Mick Fallon, who has a quick temper and a gambling problem.  The plot is strong, as usual.  This, the 16th Brady Coyne novel, is one of the best in the series.	2000-10-25

Hiram Gottschalk, owner of Parrots Unlimited, a parrot store, believes that his life is in danger, and Archy McNally is called in to make his discreet inquiries.  When Gottschalk is murdered, Archy continues his investigation.  The list of suspects is long: Peter Gottschalk, Hiram's son, who is a manic-depressive;  Gottschalk's twin daughters, Judith and Julia; Hiram's housekeeper and lover, Yvonne Chrisling, and her stepson Ricardo, who manages Parrots Unlmited.  Binky Watrous plays a big role as he goes undercover at Parrots Unlimited, and Archy gets a canine friend, Hobo.  This is an excellent and fun read!	2000-10-07

Martinetti hires Nameless to be the third party.  When the next call comes Nameless takes the money and drives to an isolated spot where he is supposed to make the drop.  As he leaves, he hears a terrible cry, goes back and finds a man, Paul Lockridge, murdered.  Someone had also taken the ransom money.  Nameless' mission is twofold; he must find Lockridge's murderer and find Gary Martinetti before it is too late.  Pronzini is a master of suspense, and even though this is the first novel in the series (written in 1971), the plot is strong.  No one can put the reader at the scenes with the detective like Bill Pronzini.  I believe he is the best writer of mystery fiction working today.	2000-09-21

A small-time antique store owner is murdered with  a dagger from one of her display cases.  Edwin of the Iron Shoes is a  little-boy mannequin with iron shoes who &quot;witnesses&quot; the murder,  but of course can't speak.  This is a very good novel, which I would give 4  stars in a usual review, but the impact this novel has had on American  mystery fiction earns it a 5th star.

Pronzini puts the reader  right there with him, hoping that he will be able to free himself from the  shackles that bind him.  He is chained for 90 days in this cabin with scant  provisions to keep him alive.  No one in mystery fiction can place the  reader at the scene like Pronzini.  &quot;Nameless&quot; is a character  that the reader really cares about.  If you haven't met  &quot;Nameless&quot;, this novel will make you a fan for life.  After  reading this one, I went back and read all his novels to date, and now I  have read them all, and anxiously await each new &quot;Nameless&quot;  detective mystery.  If I ever had to choose only one novelist to read, it  would be Bill Pronzini.  He's the very best!	2000-09-07

Neither me nor my wife knew anything about rabbits as pets, so  we looked for a book that would give us all the essentials of raising a  bunny.  &quot;The House Rabbit Handbook&quot; is the most comprehensive and  informative book we've found, and it has become our source of information.   When Benjamin does something that we don't understand, we consult this  book, and get the answers we need. We love our bunny, and this book has  helped us to be better bunny owners.	2000-06-22

What I got were 2 characters that I liked a lot, Tamara and Jamal, but very little actual  detection from a supposed private eye.  Try Marcia Muller or Sue Grafton if  you want good mystery and detection from a female writer. I will probably  not read another of Wesley's books.  I love mysteries, and mysteries  without plot are no good.	2000-06-16

Glint McClain returns to Arizona after fighting in the Union army.  Young gunfighter, Hal Peters, shoots McClain and leaves him for dead.  Father  Miguel, a priest, finds McClain and nurses him back to health.  To repay  the debt, McClain agrees to help Miguel free the Indians of his parish from  being enslaved by Bart Lathrop to work in the gold mine.  There is mystery  here, as well.  Why do the Indians refer to Father Miguel as Father Diablo?   Very entertaining and a quick read.	2000-06-14

Bernie takes a valuable 1913-V nickel from the safe.  The  Colcannons come home early, and when Mrs. Colcannon is murdered, guess who  is blamed. . .? Of course, Bernie.  When a friend of Bernie's (also the  fence with the 1913-V nickel) is also murdered, Bernie must become sleuth  to clear his name, and find out who killed these 2 people. A strong  addition to a very funny and entertaining series.	2000-06-14

Parker, and I feel this is one of his best efforts.  Even though Susan appears only briefly and Hawk is in France, a strong plot and believable characters make this an  excellent addition to an excellent series.  Someone is shooting horses at  the Three Fillies Stables in Lamarr, Georgia.  Walter Clive and his  daughter Penny hire Spenser to find out who is shooting the horses.  They  are concerned about their prized 2-year-old, Hugger Mugger who has a chance  to become a Triple Crown Horse.  Spenser encounters some strange characters  who aren't what they appear on the surface.  When Walter Clive is murdered,  Spenser is fired by Clive's daughter, Penny.  Later a new client hires  Spenser to find out who killed Walter Clive.  There are many twists, and  the reader doesn't know the whole story until the last page.  A real  winner!	2000-06-13

I will now have to add Camille Minichino to the list of &quot;must read&quot; novels with female sleuths.  I am a  chemist so I was interested because Minichino uses the periodic table to  name her novels.  Gloria Lamerino is a retired physicist who has returned  to her hometown Revere, Massachusetts from California.  The scientific  insight she brings in the novel kept it going for me, and the puzzle and  resolution were very impressive.  The other characters, Rose, Frank, Peter,  and Matt are very well drawn and I will look forward to them in her next  mystery.  In the last chapter, Gloria says that she's not looking for a  &quot;helium murder&quot;, but since I already have a copy, I know there is  one, and I am really looking forward to reading it, as well as the other  periodic table mysteries.	2000-05-23

My great-grandfather fought under that flag, yet he never owned a slave in  his life.  Our friends in the North often paint a picture that is quite  different from the truth, about why the War Between the States was fought.  This book was very refreshing.  With all the negatives in the news today, I  wanted the REAL truth, and this book provided it to me.  Mr. Hinkle makes  it clear that opponents of the Confederate battle flag are simply ignorant  of the truth, and probably make these statements without knowing anything  about the flag other than what left-wing opponents of the flag tell them in  speeches.  Hinkle obviously did quite a bit of research on this book,  supporting his arguments with facts, and not distortions.  After having  read it, I am much more in favor of keeping the flag flying in South  Carolina, Gerogia, and Mississippi.  It's part of our history, and anyone  that doesn't like it can always move to another state.	2000-05-16

Henry Slater will do almost everything he can to win the love of Sheila, a beautiful 17-year old girl.  After their affair begins, Slater's wife finds  out about the affair and \\"befriends\\" Sheila, and this is the  beginning of the end which is one of the best to come along in the thriller  genre in years.  The ending reminded me of true Alfred Hitchcock.  I quite  simply could not put this book down.  The only thing that puzzles me is why  this excellent author has not written more books.	2000-04-21

One reviewer obviously had something else in mind and probably didn't read the  entire book.  PI Thomas Black is following a rich man who is suspected of  cheating on his wife. As he stakes out the site of the supposed tryst, he  discovers that the rich man and his teenage lover are dead.  Black must  find out if it's murder or suicide.  Earl Emerson is one of the best  mystery writers working today. He paints a perfect picture of Seattle, and  his 2 main characters, Thomas Black and Kathy Birchfield, are 2 of the most  likeable characters in the mystery genre.	2000-03-26

I have now read all 50 of these novels, and not a single one is bad.  &quot;The Last Dance&quot; is no exception.  An old man, Andrew Hale is murdered,  found hanging in his apartment, having been drugged with Rohypnol.  Another  murder oa a young hooker is linked to this one because of the use of the  same drug.  The stoolie, Danny Gimp, is shot to death by 2 gunmen, and an  old woman is murdered.  It's always good to see Carella, Brown, Kling, and  Meyer tackle all these cases and come up with the murderer.  The 87th  Precinct novels are the product of the best there is in the genre of police  procedurals, Ed McBain. I just hope this isn't the last dance for the guys  from the 87th Precinct.	2000-03-03

It has some very good information on book collecting, and the story line is entertaining, even disturbing in many ways.

The newest Matthew Scudder novel, &quot;Everybody Dies&quot; is up there among the best of the series.  Everyone directly and indirectly connected to Mick Ballou are meeting untimely ends.  There seems to be no suspect  until very late in the novel.  Not only is Matt Scudder a top detective,  even Mick Ballou shows he has some sense of detection.  One likable  characted that has been a fixture in the Scudder series is killed so the  reader is drawn into the investigation.  This book is probably not the best  Scudder novel in which to start the series.  There are so many characters  here that are in other novels, but for long-time fans of the series this  has to rank up there with the best of them.	1999-12-02

For a private eye novel, there is no detection or mystery in this one. It's as if Grafton had to turn in a book  and had writer's block when she wrote this one.  A mystery novel without a  plot is no good.  Don't start with this one or you'll likely write off the  entire series, which is much, much better.	1999-11-17
