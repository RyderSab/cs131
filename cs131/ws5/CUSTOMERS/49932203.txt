Dr. Carla lists tens of Death Bed Visions which are indeed convincing and beautiful.  They make you realize that death is not that horrible and frightening at all.  The dying person sees deceased relatives, angels, and loved ones and actually wants to go to them.  They see the wonderful light that awaits for them on the other side and they see that [over there] there is nothing to be afraid of. After you read this book you will understand how unfair it is that society does not accept the DBVs and the death subject in general.  How our own religion rejects them, and wonder why, since they preach that death is not the end! Let alone the scientists (and stay away from most of them) who always find a...scientific answer for every question.  But as beautifully stated in the book already, if those visions are only by-products of the dying brain, how come the dying person sees only deceased ones, and never loved ones who are still alive?<br />I only wish I had this book when my beloved grandmother died and was so much frightened of death.  I would be able to explain her a few things I learned from this wonderful book, and provide her some comfort.<br />It is amazing.  It proved that we don't die alone at all, but a beloved deceased person or persons are there, waiting to help us make it to the other side and we are happy to reunite with them!	2000-11-29

Books	5	2	3	N	N	Earthquake prepared	This is an extremely helpful and important book for all those (like me) who live on a fault zone. The book begins by explaining how earthquakes are measured.  In the second part it shows how to secure your home, the materials you will need, like special screws for every item, bolts, latches, window film and so forth.  It also explains what you need to know about the  walls and the structure of the house. The author shows how to secure every single furniture in the house, from bookcases and their contents to crystal, ceramics, pictures and hanging artwork, to cabinet doors; how to attach computers, televisions, microwaves etc. Further on, it shows you how to prevent structural damage to your home and gives the cost as well.  How to prepare the emergency supplies and gives family safety plans (special instructions for children). How should you be prepared if you are living in a mobile home or apartment, preparedness for the disabled, everything, in every detail is listed in this practical book, and it also gives information about earthquake insurance. The second part of the book shows you what you should do during an earthquake, if you are indoors, outdoors, in a high-rise building etc.  What you should do when the shaking stops, from wearing heavy-duty shoes and long-sleeved clothes, to checking the house for damages. Whoever lives on a fault zone MUST buy this book now! and follow the instructions (which are easy to do) because unlike tornadoes and floods, you never know when an earthquake might strike nor the magnitude and the damage it will cause. I got this book after an earthquake we had measuring 7.4R killing over 30,000 people, and I am glad I did.  Now I feel more secure;  it is better to be prepared than do nothing, thinking whatever will be will be.	2000-09-28

Tens of funny (but truly meaningful) illustrations show you how your dog translates your behavior.  That's how I saw them, humorous but true. The book covers all phases of the development of the dog, from the day you will bring it at home, to the day you will have the perfect dog. One phrase I made banner from this book, what I was always supporting: &quot;I won't tell you that dogs are 'denning' animals, so crate training your dog is 'natural'.  That's not the truth. The only denning dog or wolf is a pregnant [one,] and when she and the pups leave their dens, they are plainly joyful to be out of it!&quot; People, please keep this in mind when you read in other books about crates for your puppy.<br />The book begins with firstly understanding your dog and their behavior, and how do they think, their natural reactions and how they learn.  Aggressive behavior, how do dogs sense their world (vision, smell, hearing, taste, touch, pain and so forth) How they communicate, their social development from life in the litter to the day they join a human family. In chapter six, it deals with puppy stuff, includes a puppy behavior test, from making your selection to the arrival at home, house training and socializing. Puppy training includes the basic: name recognition, commands like come, sit, stay.<br />The second part of the book analyzes what causes a dog to misbehave with first the human element (I liked this one. We confuse our little friends and then wonder why do they misbehave!!) How health and nutrition affect the dog; here a troubleshooting is included: physical problem - associated behavior problems. What follows this chapter is analyzing and treating the cause of the problem, and techniques to avoid like electrical shock devices, cages (dogs are not birds!)<br />In part three the author shows how to correct behavior problems like aggression toward owners, how to introduce babies and new pets to the established dog, barking and how to correct it even when you are not at home. Other behavior problems and their solutions include car sickness, car chasing, chewing, coprophagia, digging, escaping, fearfulness, fighting with other dogs, jumping on people, old age problems, over protectiveness and much much more. When I finished the book I couldn't think of any dog problem which was not included.  In fact I even read about things I never encountered before. With humane solutions and love, the author managed to write a perfect book which guarantees ever lasting solutions. It is perhaps the most wonderful book I read about dog behavior and how to solve the problems. A big thanks to Mr. Campbell	2000-08-18

Over 300 pages cover perhaps all common health problems, which are listed  alphabetically thus making it easy to find something, from birthing to  asthma, fears, fever, car sickness, cataracts, as well as behavior problems  such as chewing, car chasing, jealousy, house-training and much much  more.<br />The only disadvantage in my opinion, is that everything is briefly  mentioned, taking only a couple of pages for each subject.  The authors  could have expanded, making this book the only one a pet owner would ever  need.<br />I do recommend it though to every house with a dog or a cat because  it covers almost every illness and trouble you will come across.  An  experienced owner will find it interesting for the house library, but if  you are a beginner you may want to use this book as an addition,  &quot;supplement&quot;.  For beginners I strongly recommend &quot;What your  dog is trying to tell you&quot;.	2000-08-18

The author writes about the changes in medicine, our risky environment, the damages  from free radicals and even how stress affects our system.  Stress depletes  the body of nutrients, Vitamin C, B-complex, zinc and many others. He  explains everything about all vitamins and their purpose, as well as other  nutrients, the quantities we should take and how; all information about  fat-soluble nutrients, water-soluble nutrients, mineral supplements like  calcium, chromium, iron and so forth and their role. Dietary fats and  essential fatty acids, amino acids and herbs all are listed in this  wonderful beautifully written book. He explains when to take those  supplements, their combintations, how to store them and how long to keep  them.<br />Later on, he shows you how to set up your personal dietary  supplement program, adjusted to your needs and way of living.  It has a  treatment program, if you suffer from a particular illness, which  suppplements to use more.<br />It is a perfect book, simply written, not  boring, stuffed with medical terms and once you 've finished it, you won't  have any question regarding vitamins.  Everything is explained here.  I  believe every house should get a copy of this book.	2000-08-04

I got this book and before  giving it to him I read it.   It explains what allergy is, what causes it  and of course how to deal with it.  If you suffer from allergies, i believe  this is the book for you to cure them naturally. My brother (who is also  against any form of medication) is already doing MUCH MUCH better after  following the instructions in this book; improve his immune system, make  the environment around him better and understand what allergy is. Simple  steps you can take will lead to better living without much effort really.   The book is simply written, easy to understand, which I find to be very  important.  Some books are heavy and boring because there are authors who  think that they talk to other doctors and not to simple people who did not  study medicine (Sorry for that). Allergy problem?  I don't think you will  find a better book on the subject than this.	2000-08-03

I  was certain that I would find this book very interesting, and I wasn't  wrong.  This book is truly wonderful. He explains how many hours should we  sleep and what happens to us if we don't.

More than the half explains everything about dog language, how to understand what your dog is trying to tell you, how to understand aggression, playfulness, fear etc, and how to reply to those  signs once you 've understood them.  The last chapters of the book deal  with training (sit, stay, down), general information about the health of  your dog, how to groom them, how you can improve an old dog's life and make  those last years as comfortable as possible.   You can see in almost every  line Mr Dibra's love for dogs. It is truly wonderful!

I wish I had this book when I first moved to my  own house. It would save me time and also I wouldn't be so much stressed  everytime I needed to clean (that's excausting myself twice a week).<br />The  book begins with instructions as to how to organize your cleaning schedule,  what should your priority be, and what should be the last thing to do.  And  clean it like a pro, fast &amp; right! Also, how to get rid of your clutter  once and for all. It gives you advise as to what kind of detergents you  should use,which cleaners are hazardous, which ones you should avoid and  why. What I liked here, is How to hunt microbes (!)<br />In part two, it has  an A-Z reference with everything you can find in a house, and how to clean  it, so when you have a problem with a particular item, you don't just  scroll up and down to find it, the A-Z makes it so easy.<br />Part three,  again it's an A-Z rundown of everything you will need to know about.

I was trying to understand a small health problem that I had, and this book showed me what  it is: wheat intolerance!  When I stopped eating whatever contained wheat  my problem was solved. You can really improve your health condition and  your immune system  by learning what is blood type friendly and what you  should avoid.  As mentioned in the book, many people suffer from  intolerance to a particular food but they don't know it because it could be  something they eat daily, like in my case wheat, bread.  As a result you  always have a problem and you can't find what causes it.  It has a full  range of recipes which you can follow, combinations of foods, in order to  prepare your meals easily, it shows you how to arrange your kitchen and  your shopping blood type friendly.

I got a Jack Russels terrier three months ago and when I brought her home it was like bringing Tarzan home from the jungle. This little creature was totally uncivilized, knew nothing, turned our lives in a living hell. The  first thing she did was to bite me when I attempted to clean her ears  (thank God she had the baby teeth when she did that!). She was barking  &amp; biting us, no one would dare to touch her! My little  &quot;Tarzan&quot; finally responded to her name after a whole month. I was  so surprised with her behavior, comparing her to my poodle who brought all  her good manners with her upon birth and learned everything almost  instantly. I was really in a bad situation with her since I had to find a  way to civilize my Tarzan and make her part of the family. I got a few  books on training, and used my own methods I used for my poodle but none of  them would work. Tarzan would still bite us, bark any time of the day and  unfortunately night too, take things from the coffee table, drink our  coffee from the cup when left alone, and take GOOD care of all the plants  in the house! <br />That's when this book came to the rescue. I must say I was  very surprised with the techniques the author uses, but since I was  desperate and had nothing to lose I put those methods to work.  Well, after  only a week Pinky learned more than what I tried to teach her in two months  time.<br />The author is down to earth when it comes to dog training, making  it clear that you have to understand that it's a dog you are trying to  train and not human. She shows you the dog's point of view in order to  understand their behavior better. Why they do the things they do, their way  of thinking, and how you can can solve those problems. How would I know  that by just spraying plain, natural water on her face would stop her from  biting!  But it did. That simple.  Or when you want your dog to come to  you, you must not run after her as she takes that for a game, but simply  sit downand pat your legs.<br />We all love our dogs, there's no doubt. If we  didn't, we wouldn't have got them in the first place.  But that doesn't  stop them from barking or biting.  Just showing love and affection to the  dog won't solve any behavior problem. If you are in the same situation I  was, get this book, and you will see the benefits from the very first  lesson. Thank you Mrs. Wilson.	2000-07-12

I don't know what does Mrs Marlo do in her training class; in this book she did nothing. She kept mentioning problems like aggression, housebreaking, etc but the author forgot the...solutions (!) for many of  the above. That was the most frustrating part of the book:  reading the  problems and looking for the solutions which were no where. I didn't  understand what she was trying to say from the first page to the last.  She  talked about crates, about taking the water away from the puppy three hours  prior bed time so that she won't soil her bed (try to do that when the  thermometer hits 40C and then we may as well talk about what's cruel and  what's not).  I think the author was just very proud of what she read and  learned that decided to write them all in a book.  New Art? Yes! certainly,  everything I read in this book was new for me. Which I wouldn't attempt to  perform on my little angels.	2000-07-03

It is really wonderful, and I have already started taking a few of the supplements the author suggests. I say &quot;a few&quot; because I found that the author could  have done a much better job expressing/analyzing his ideas (that's why the  four stars). For example, I am under 25, and there are a few things which  left me in question as to whether I should start using them or not.  If you  are not sure of something, like me, you should see the book with your  doctor and then proceed.

Although I tried to follow some advises from this book, I saw that they prefer to starve than eat anything else.I thought they would die since they didn't eat anything for 2-3 days and gave up! The author insists that it's a matter of time that your dog will get used to the new diet, but I see that it is not.  I think it has to do with the personality of each and every dog, and that's the reason I will never get a book like this. They don't change their nutricion no matter what I do, so I prefer buying books which deal with their psychological world and ways to communicate with them, instead of books which actually waste my time reading them.	2000-03-28

The quiz was fun too. It really helps you choose your four-foot friend. Although I think so many examples of people and their own dogs, and their own way of life isn't so necessary.  They could be shorter and fewer. At a point they become boring and you just  skip those paragraphs.	2000-03-22
