Derek Beres has both hands and feet on it. Beres dives deep into the world music world and makes a compelling case for his thesis that the music we will be listening to in the future (and many of us are already listening--and dancing--to) will belong to no single national or culture but instead will be a true global fusion of influences, styles, attitudes and, of course, sounds. Beres explains the relationship of the traditional to the progressive, puts the music into its proper spiritual and cultural perspective and, most of all, brings it to life with vivid descriptions and poignant insights. No dry hype-filled treatise on the latest pop trends, Global Beat Fusion is a living, breathing guide to a place we haven't yet been but will be visiting very soon.	2005-08-09

Not to mention a feisty beauty school dropout as a heroine! I just adored this book--both for the writing--which is pitch perfect--for the souther-fried comfort of the story, and for the main character, Elizabeth Polk, who was so alive on the page that I half expected to see her walking on the street. <br /> <br />A spectacular debut from a spectacular talent.	2005-04-03

This is a novel that is so very honest about the messiness of life, the resiliency of people, the strength of friendship (and that includes male/female bonding, too) and the magic and mystery of the forms redemption takes.

Books these days stay on the shelf for two or three months at best, and sometimes the best books aren't even reviewed, so a lot of wonderful choices fall by the wayside.

Bad Girl Creek is peopled with four distinct and wonderful women, all grappling with the things all of us deal with--aging, love, heartbreak, illness, the healing balm of friendship, the giddy joy of amorous love.

From the very first image of Gary feeding his newborn in a diner, I was caught.

This is a story about family and the sudden way happiness can turn right into nightmare, but it's also about finding your community, and about how love can rescue you or at least offer sustenance.
