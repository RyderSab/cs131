As much as I enjoyed the Bride of Willow Creek (5 stars) and the Wives of Bowie Stone (4 stars) that's how much I did NOT enjoy this one.  The story is preposterous, the events are unlikely, the characters (except for Lily) are unsympathetic and even she begins to grate after a while.  First she feels one way, then does a U-turn with respect to her feelings for Quinn.  Quinn's secretiveness becomes absurd as the book progresses. - shades of Jane Eyre - And Paul is a total jerk.

I couldn't put &quot;Fever&quot; down, so intense and vivid it is.      However, it just was not quite as good as &quot;Darkling&quot;, so I gave it just 4 stars.  Ms. Sutcliffe is one heck of a writer.  As I read, I felt the heat and humidity of the deep south.  She is gifted in being able to represent the cadence and colloquillisms of the slaves.  But the trials and tribulations just kept piling up.  The incidence of the yellow fever was almost too much; kind of an &quot;over the top&quot; addition to an already boiling pot.

I don't remember reading anything by this author before, but I will certainly remedy that situation.  I read at least 5 books per week.  Before \\"Darkling\\" I had read 3 books that were on the NY Times paperback bestsellers list.  Compared to this, they were as dry as dust - and I'm talking about VERY well-known authors of romantic fiction.  The 3 were really not worth my time to give a review on.  Darkling has everything.  A heroine with a plucky, endearing persona, a hero, flawed & suffering, but still real enough, engaging enough, to die for.  Uncle Henry, Bernie, Ruth, Mitsy, Charlotte, even Jack are wonderfully wrought characterizations.  (...) Thanks for a great adventure, Ms. Sutcliffe.	2001-11-11

The heroine in &quot;The China Bride&quot;, Troth Montgomery is one of the most marvelous leading ladies I have read in a long time. The first part of the book moved along beautifully and, if rated separately, would have gotten 4 stars. The history and culture of China was fascinating. However, the second part of the story sagged badly. Kyle's complete loss of spirit, and consequent behavior, just didn't quite add up. It did not make sense that he would not reach out to Troth. I think if Kyle had been more fully developed as a character in the first place, this might have helped. Also, the time frame of his imprisonment seemed so brief - yet we were told that he spent months under inhuman conditions, but somehow I didn't suffer with him.  A reader needs to have empathy with a character in order to care about him or her and here it was missing.  As it stands, the second part would only receive 2 stars. Average: 3 stars.	2001-08-31

The plot was well done, the writing quite good and the characters real.  It takes real talent for a writer to blend the hearts of a 20th century woman and a 16th century man.  The differences in social culture were convincing, although I wondered if Lydia, the hero's mother, might have done a little time travelling herself - so modern were her sensibilities.  Adam was a unredeemed villain, an evil being without a soul.  He made an interesting contrast to the gorgeous Hawk who, after all, just wanted to medieval castle husband.

The problems between Sarann and Rodger were telegraphed without any subtlety on the writer's part.

The dichotomy between the words &quot;Beloved&quot; and &quot;Enemy&quot; is developed perfectly by Jane Feather in this enthralling book.  What a love story; what a pair of lovers!  I am writing this years later because:  (1) It was one of my favorite books at the time I read it, and (2) it seems to be getting an unfavorable rating from several reviewers, so I thought I would try to bring more balance to the negative reviews.

This tale unfolded subtly, yet breathtakingly.  I was absolutely enchanted.  All of the characters, Guy de Gervais especially, and the delightful Magdalen, have such depth that I was emotionally bound to them and experienced both the joy and sadness that was in this wonderfully told tale.  I have read nearly all of Jane Feather's books.  Some are 5 Star, others are 3 Stars.  This one, although written nearly 12 years ago is one of the best.  I highly recommend it.	2001-06-30

This book was an emotional journey for me.  Tristan and Amiranth are beautifully developed characters with whom we live for a time and whose story remains haunting and moving, well after the last page is read.  I have read as many books by this author as possible.  Shana Abe truly occupies a special place in the upper echelons of romance writers.  Thank you, Shana.	2001-06-15

So, to be brief.  &quot;Secret Song&quot; was better than the dreadful &quot;Fire Song&quot; starring Graelam the Cad.  &quot;Earth Song&quot; and &quot;Warrior's Song&quot; were very enjoyable (and the reason I purchased Fire and Secret).  I noticed that on the back cover, the author states that she wrote these books some time ago and that she didn't do any rewriting, just enjoyed the new cover design.  I think that Ms. Coulter might take some time to review these reissues.	2001-06-13

I purchased this one based on the expectations that it would be at least as good.  Alas, what a disappointment.  I found Graelam to be an ignorant lout.  Never have I met such a cruel, unfeeling brute who raped and humiliated the dear Kassia on the pretext that women are naught but animals to be used by their masters.  I stuck with the book, mostly because Ms. Coulter does write well and because I liked Kassia and hoped she would find a real man to fall in love with.  Graelam's sudden insight to his idiocy came too late in the book to make it worth the time spent - he will never be redeemed in my eyes.	2001-06-12

This was a forced, superficial, pathetic attempt at writing.  I only finished it - in speed-reading mode - because I wanted to see if the writing improved, even a little bit.  It did not.  The story was corny, the characters one-dimensional.  Usually when I find a book laborious to read, I either don't finish it, or I thumb through it to see the end.  I don't write a review like this one.  In fact, I have only written one other negative review out of dozens I have posted. However, I felt strongly that I should warn any unsuspecting potential readers.	2001-06-08

This one was a major disappointment.  I almost did not finish it.  It was  awkwardly written.  But then I realized that Ms. Howard was still in early stages of novel writing.  This book was written in 1985 and boy, what a difference 12 years has made.  I say 12 because I refer to &quot;Son of the Morning&quot; which was written by Ms. Howard in 1997 and was one of best books I have ever read.  So don't judge Linda Howard by this book.  You have lots of treats ahead if you stick with the later-written books.	2001-04-03

It is the best mystery I have read this year and compares well with some of the best I have EVER read.  The central mystery is profound, frightening and emotionally wrenching.  The author has brought great depth and humanity to the characters of Rachel, McKissick, Billy, Claire and all of the rest.  This is one of the few instances in which I wish the author would feature the main characters in another book.  More, more, more from Alice Blanchard - one of the best writers around.

After many years I searched for and found another copy of it.  Now I lend it out to only my most trusted reading friends.  I found this to be one of the most fascinating books I  have ever read.  The opening chapter - in the chapel - is so astounding, so  riveting, that I was fairly gasping when the scene ended.  This book takes  the reader on a journey where s/he must suspend all the rules of reality.   I loved it.  I will read it again.  I think John Farris is one of the BEST  writers of this genre, along with Peter Straub and Stephen King!	2000-07-05

This book barely deserves mentioning when compared with Woodiwiss's other books.  Raelynn is such a twit, I was happy to see  Jeff's plan to dump her.  The entire story seemed forced and superficial.   Liked Jeff, but then, had the advantage of knowing him through his  brother's story.<br />The most irritating thing about this was the contrived  story outside of the book that this one was supposed to be based upon.  A  totally ridiculous &quot;literary&quot; device.  Shame on you, Kathleen  Woodiwiss.  Better to write nothing more at all than to manufacture a story  with no heart.	2000-06-04

Several years have gone and then this month I read the &quot;Flame and the Flower&quot;.  Better and better.  Then the &quot;Elusive  Flame&quot; - 4 and 1/2 stars, followed by the &quot;Wolf and the  Dove&quot; Great book.  Ms Woodiwiss writes in great depth and breadth -  beautifully developing her characters.  Also, the books have a satisfying  length packed with fascinating writing, rather than a flimsy premise  stretched to a thinly contrived, and eventually boring, missive.  I just  finished &quot;Shanna&quot;.  Loved it.  It gets at least 5 stars.  Now, am  starting &quot;A Season Beyond a Kiss&quot;.  Wish there was more to choose  from, but when a writer starts putting out quantity, the quality is either  very uneven (Betina Krauhn, Elizabeth Lowell), or is missing altogether.   Keep writing Dear Kathleen and give us more Wulfgars and Aislynns.	2000-05-21

The writing is so fine that I'm surprised that it was not on someone's best-seller list.  Switching between past and present is sometimes awkward and annoying to a  reader, but Ms. Eagle gives equal emotional truth to both.  I have read all  of her books I can get my hands on and can only hope for more, more, more.   It is, however, a testament to her talent that she is not churning out book  after book based upon the same characters some writers develop in the first  book of a &quot;series&quot; and in later books just put them in different  situations.  Ms. Eagle creates original, memorable characters in each  story.	2000-01-16

This book is so superbly written, it belongs in a class/category that is far beyond the &quot;plot by the numbers&quot; books I am often stuck with.

The stunning writing and story in The Chalice and  the Blade make it worth while to read a few mediocre books. This book is a  gem among many.

I was unable to pick up any other book for some time after reading the first three.  I felt a distinct sense of loss until I could get to the next adventure with Jamie and Claire.  The characters are fully realized and you love them or hate them and suffer with them, accordingly.  Of course, my &quot;crush&quot; on Jamie will not abate, but Claire offers stiff competition.  I have not yet read &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; because I cannot bear to reach the end of this wonderful saga.  D. Gabaldon's writing is exceptional, as is her knowledge of history.  These are the best books I have ever read!  I never found any of the three too long; each became too brief as I came closer to the last page.  I agree that these novels far transcend the romance genre and only wish that they had been marketed better than they were.	1998-05-10
