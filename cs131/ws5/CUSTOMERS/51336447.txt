When I read the lastest escapades of Tully Mars, first introduced in the Tales From Margaritaville story \\"Take Another Road,\\" it quickly swept me in, continuing where he left off. While it helps to have that background, it is quite possible to pick up this book without any other previous knowledge of the characters. For fans of Jimmy Buffett's music and books, A Salty Piece of Land fits in well in any parrothead's library. <br /> <br />That said, in some ways, a non-fan with no previous background might have a problem putting 2 and 2 together with some of the character references. In a previous review, the reader said the book meanders... and it's meant to, I think... just as life sometimes meanders. However, Buffett ties up all loose ends by the end of the book, and all ends well in Tully Mars' world. If you already haven't, you might want to read Tales from Margaritaville first. <br /> <br />On a personal note, I was a touch disappointed to find that the book was about Tully Mars, and not Frank Bama and Trevor Kane from Where Is Joe Merchant, also written by Buffett. Still, I liked it, and I'm confident many people will also enjoy it.	2005-04-13

After Sept. 11, 2001, many Americans asked the question, &quot;Why?&quot; Unfortunately, due to America's pop culture, the reason often gets masked behind the sound bites, corporations, and what looks good on television. It is increasingly difficult to get a viewpoint on world events in the USA from a perspective other than American journalism sources. That's where this book excels.<br />The authors explain in an easy-to-understand manner exactly why those outside the USA dislike America, in ways many people are unfamiliar with. The USA might be the only remaining super-power, but to continuously ignore how others look at us as a country will prove to be disastrous. I highly recommend this book as one way to get that &quot;outside perspective,&quot; and to shed some light on a subject that more often than not gets drowned out in political rhetoric and made-to-fit sound bites.	2003-03-09

However, it reads kind of dry- I'm not sure if it's because after awhile all the Chinese names all seem to run together, or what... The book reads like a very academic endeavor, which is fine- I've read a number of criminology books that take that approach. While very informative, &quot;The Dragon Syndicates&quot; isn't a gripping page turner by any stretch of the imagination.	2002-12-27

Margaritaville is Jimmy Buffett's biggest hit, and if your knowledge of him ends there, that's okay. This book of short stories, some fiction, some autobiographical, is excellent tropical escapism at its finest. Love, triumph, coming-of-age, you can almost pick the archetype, and in one way or another, he addresses it with a magnificent cast of characters, from the bizarre friends in our own neighborhoods, to good-natured scoundrels we'd love to emulate if we could, to the girl next door we wish we could reconnect with.<br />Buffett's descriptive style is reminiscent of Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon books, and it works so well, you can almost see exactly where the characters are walking to in their towns, smell the aromas, hear the townspeople in the street, etc. Rumor has it that a studio optioned the book... I can't wait to see the movie!	2002-12-27

Whenever I heard of a new Glenn Morris book, I eagerly checked it out, bought it, and usually devoured it in a day or two. Some of the items within his books delve into the metaphysical, paranormal, and sometimes just plain weird. His martial arts insights are equally interesting and as an on-and-off student of Southern Shaolin kung fu, I can understand and appreciate the references to ninpo and Bujinkan ninjutsu.<br />One of the benefits of his previous books (&quot;Path Notes&quot; and &quot;Shadow Strategies&quot;) was his ability to explain a process in which he obtained results- for example, his experience with Tien Tao chi kung in &quot;Path Notes.&quot; This time around, he does explain a handful of things, but barely enough to whet the appetite for the true &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; of what he's trying to convey. I think by this point, Morris assumes many of the previous readers and fans know more or less where to go for the answers. If not, they know at least in which direction to look. That is the reason for the 4-star instead of 5 star rating.<br />I don't think that Mr. Morris is dabbling in BS when he explains the esoteric end of martial arts, or his more mystical results while meditating. For those who experience dynamic meditation, and know what that opens up within them, his experiences are interesting, obtainable, and absolutely worth experiencing. I'm almost disappointed in finishing this book as soon as I did.<br />On a side note, he has quite a reference and &quot;suggested reading&quot; list in the back of the book that is well worth checking out.	2002-06-09

His insights are useful in exploring the inner workings of the mind, the body, and the spirit, as well as expanding your knowledge of your OWN martial art, whether it be aikido, kung fu, karate, ninjutsu, or whatever.<br />And, to make matters even better, check out his reading list / bibliography for an even more intense mind screw! :)	2002-06-09

I first read &quot;Path Notes&quot; quite a few years ago, and I never tire of re-reading it. Morris' insights on chi kung, meditation, ninjutsu, and indeed, martial arts in general are fun, refreshing, and his reading lists and suggestions give more than a few things to make you go hmmmmmmmmm...<br />Many books I have glanced through, read, and put down are filled with the usual esoteric mumbo jumbo that give vague descriptions of what happens if you do &quot;X.&quot; In some instances, particularly in beginners-level meditation, Morris' descriptions might even fit in that category... but that's because that was the stage he was in- that was his perspective on the subject. He details also his reactions to his experiences- on a physical, mental, and spiritual level- and gives inklings on what to expect, but also makes clear through his writings these are HIS experiences. Your mileage may vary.<br />His attitude towards martial arts- ninjutsu, et al- is one of a hobbyist. Someone who shows up, plays around, keeps coming back, and has fun... and also learns a ton in the process. This book- as well as his other two books- has a wealth of information, and points the way to a library full of more information... IF you know how to look and read between the lines. Morris is one hell of a &quot;coyote teacher!&quot;	2002-06-09

Much of the information would be applicable back in the late 1980s, and even early 1990s, but after the recent events of September 11 and increased scrutiny of people who would use the information would be setting themselves up for trouble.<br />In addition, there are a number of companies mentioned in the book, and no address, phone numbers, or contact information are provided. It might be the author's intent that whoever really wants to know the needed information would know how to get it, but the casual interest person would be left in the dark.<br />There are more current books out there, don't waste your money on this one.

As a just-starting-out naturalist, I read most of Brown's books with interest, but the deeper I go into the naturalist's world, the more powerful messages I get between the lines. <br />The book offers many insights on modern man- most of all, the notion that if one simply lets the world drift by, with all sorts of damage, trouble, etc. being done (mind you, yourself doing none of the actual damage), the message is clear- Why didn't you do something?<br />Probably the most powerful message in the book is, &quot;There are no small things.&quot; To quote Bruce Lee, if you throw a rock into a pond, you get ripples- soon the ripples cross the whole pond. Every action we do has implications, good and bad. Make your impressions positive and beneficial.<br />For those lucky enough to attend Tom Brown's school, reading any of his books after taking a class- no matter how many times you read them previously- it's like reading an entirely new book. There are countless messages and powerful teachings in The Quest, and I give it my highest recommendation.	2001-10-14

While The Way Of The Scout is not a blow-by-blow how-to book like Awakening Spirits was, it gives insights on the world that is the scout's. The skills are within access of anyone who wants to learn them, but more importantly, the mentality of the scout is the true changer of people.<br />The scout always put those other than him/herself first. This also extends to the environment, the surroundings. Will taking something from the land in the end benefit it? How can I help those who are depending on me? The scout was a supreme naturalist, healer, tracker, hunter, and protector. How many non-scouts can say that?<br />Anyone reading this can become a scout. It's also a level I hope to attain one day, and am planning on attending the Scout class offered by Tom Brown's school in the near future.	2001-07-23

This book, while taking place in the Next Generation timeline, stays true to the original storyline, expands on it fabulously, and takes the reader deeper into the Genesis Device mythos. From the previous reviewers and the &quot;dust-jacket&quot; intro posted on Amazon, you have an idea of the plot- someone has, to quote David Marcus in ST2, perverted the Genesis device &quot;into a dreadful weapon.&quot; Of course, Picard and crew get drawn into the story, and yadda yadda yadda.<br />Certainly there are a few minor errors (the whole Defiant-class bridge-on-deck-two-instead-of-deck-one BS) but I'll leave that for the Trekkie nitpickers. While quite possibly the author COULD have packed all this stuff (Parts 1 and 2) into one book, thus not ticking me off waiting for the sequel, it is well-written, thought out plotline, and one keeping me eager for the next chapter.	2001-01-25

I picked up the first book on a lark while food shopping. A month later, I'm devouring the 5th and 6th books.<br />Between the previous reviews and the information about the book provided on Amazon, you have enough to go on as to the plot, etc. First off, I am a Christian, but never delved into the realm of Christian fiction before this (Check out my bio for my picks). However, I would characterize this series as not only excellent, but as an interesting fight between good and evil, and how absolute power corrupts absolutely. Okay, I'm off my soapbox now.<br />The best parallel I could make with this series is Stephen King's &quot;The Stand.&quot; Much of the same imagery is there, with enough plot twists and surprises to keep readers returning for more and more.  The classic fight between the Tribulation Force (also the title of the 2nd book) and Nicolae Carpathia will quickly remind King fans of Mother Abigail and Randall Flagg's teams duking it out in &quot;The Stand.&quot; The series has not disappointed me once, and it's refreshing to read a series that doesn't resort to profanity or a gratuitous use of sexual situations or innuendo, and still manages to drive home the point of the story.<br />My only regret is that I am finishing these books at the rate of one a week, and I will soon be at the end of the line, until the next book is published. Great job!	2001-01-25

After watching them both a few hundred times and thinking I grasped the concepts pretty well, I picked up Frank Herbert's classic &quot;Dune,&quot; and was blown away.<br />While &quot;Dune&quot; laid the foundation for the entire series, including the mythos, the history, and background of the two major houses in the book, &quot;House Atreides&quot; fills in many blanks about how Emperor Shaddam IV came into power, the history of Vladimir Harkonnen (some of his extracurricular activities were merely hinted at in the movie), and also some deeper history into the dealings between Leto Atreides and other houses.<br />Leto is a young man, his father being the model for the duke he would become by the end of the book. His father is intent on making his experiences varied, in order to enrich his rapport with the people he will eventually rule. In this, he develops compassion, empathy, and determination- once he sets his mind on a task he does not let go. He also is not afraid to stand by those he supports.<br />Supporting characters are spotlighted here and there, such as Rabban, Duncan Idaho, and Pardot Kynes, father of Liet Kynes, and grandfather of Chani. Also, the developing relationship and acceptance of Pardot Kynes into the Fremen is important, and gives an even deeper look into their society.<br />All in all, an excellent prequel, and I doubt I would have picked it up if someone within the Herbert family had not written or cowritten the story. I'm waiting eagerly for the next installment.	2000-10-02

I can say that for a fact, as I have had many of the same  experiences myself.

For anyone exposed to, and travelling on what could be  considered a shaman-like path, this book offers insights not only in a man  who would become a healer, but insights that can apply to almost anyone. I  am not a shaman, nor do I claim to be, but Bear Heart's book brought a  number of things to the forefront of my life, and cleared my mind as to the  path I should take. <br />Will this be the case for everyone? I doubt it.  Otherwise, it is a quick and very entertaining read.

Sure, after reading a little about his &quot;formative years,&quot; one could make the arguement  that his screwed up home life led him to where he ended up, but one thing  remained constant- he was a self-made man. He knew who he was, where he  wanted to go, and if he screwed up, he sucked it up and took his lumps,  because all he had to blame was himself. But Barger doesn't wallow in this-  he glories in it! He and a few other Angels were jailed on a BS charge (and  they all knew it), but instead of getting pissed about it, they went with  the flow of the system, made themselves to be model prisoners (the chapter  where the prisoners in jail were rioting, except the Angels, who were  calmly in their cells), and were eventually aquitted. <br />Whatever you think  of the Hell's Angels, Sonny Barger is in his own way, a Zen master.  Nobody's perfect- God knows Sonny ain't. However, his subtle message of  holding himself-  and ONLY himself- personally responsible for his life's  successes and failures is refreshing, especially in recent times where  everything from cartoons, video games, rock music, and a bad home life is  blamed for all the ills of society. Sonny, through his life's trials and  tribulations, is still standing. He stands because of an indominable will,  and a desire to prove all the naysayers wrong. &lt;grin&gt; Hell, even  cancer couldn't beat him!<br />My best to Sonny- If I'm ever in Arizona, I'd  like to buy him a few beers!	2000-08-17

Because of this, I  noticed subtle things, written on a level that would pique a reader's  interest in the wilderness, but would confirm other things to anyone who  has learned under Brown or one of his students.<br />If there is one thing the  book emphasizes, it is that nature need not be mysterious, dangerous, or  foreboding. Once a person works in harmony with nature, all the fear  vanishes, and the only mystery is discovering new and exciting things that  one had previously missed. Many resources exist outside of Brown's school,  many of which can be found here on Amazon, and while self-education can be  long and arduous, you will find no better education than learning about  nature.	2000-08-17

The Dragonlance Chronicles are quite possibly the best S&amp;S novel series ever produced, and I don't say that lightly considering the others in the genre (with a nod to Tolkien and Moorecock). The characterizations,  descriptions, and emotions conveyed by Weis and Hickman are nothing short  of phenomenal, and despite the series dropping off a bit in the 3rd book  (Dragons of Spring Dawning), the characters are what pull it off.

I'm a medical professional (RN) and by no means a  granola-eater or tree hugger, but after reading this book, I stopped taking  my world for granted and started giving thanks for little things, like the  food I eat, the plants that give me oxygen and food, the sun that gives  life to all, etc. Pay specific attention to the prophecies toward the end  of the book. If they aren't a wake-up call, I don't know what  is!<br />Excellent book, highly recommended, as are any of Tom Brown's books.  He's an even more powerful speaker than an author, so if you have an  opportunity to see him, do it!	1999-07-28

Many crucial items are left out, such as organizational structure, the &quot;who-does-what&quot; positions, and maybe even some  first hand accounts, as has been done and done well by La Cosa Nostra  researchers. Very general overview with little hardcore information.	1999-07-12

It's been out for at least 10 years or so, but for a newly minted parrothead (or someone who's trying to figure out why he's so popular), it's a great starting point to get a feel of the person and the  philosophies of Jimmy Buffett. It's a great story, and goes off on odd  tangents, but the read is worth it, and in the end, you just about wish to  move to the Carribbean or Key West and try to live life as uniquely as  Jimmy or his characters. It's escapism at its finest, has a happy ending,  and it's a wonderful book, even if you're knowledge of Jimmy Buffett ends  with the song \\"Margaritaville.\\"	1999-03-14
