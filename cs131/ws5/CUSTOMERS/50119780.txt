Max Brand was one of those writers who was WAY too prolific for his own good-- He wrote SO MUCH that the quality of his work suffered greatly and often.   A rule often applied by his biggest fans (I've met a few) is that his older work (from 1917 to about the mid 1920s) is usually the best.  I have found this to generally hold true, as the thirties output, in particular, tends to be meandering and pointless at times.  (Brand turned in the later years toward long series of novels such as the Silvertip series, and he really began to stretch these stories unmercifully.)<br />The stories collected in this volume are a marvelous exception.  These stories, long known among Brand fans as the &quot;Chip stories&quot; were published in the pulps in the early thirties and are a rare glimpse of the western writer Frederick Faust COULD have been, if he had taken more care about it.  These 3 stories HAVE all been published in paperback before (in spite of the claims of the front cover) but never in ONE volune.  They are delightful first-person narratives about Chip, a 15 year old gunhand and his relationships to an outlaw, Dug Waters, a rancher, Newbold, and the narrator, Joe.  They are that rarest of pulp joys-- Pure, unpretentious B-western adventures-- and they are very humorously written and well- crafted.  If Brand had kept up this kind of groove, he'd have become a REAL legend among western writers and fans. <br />A must for all B-western fans and Brand afficionados.	2001-01-13

I think that this is the best volume in Marshall and Manuel's &quot;providential history&quot; series.  The material on the prayer revival of 1857-59 is easily worth the price of this book for any American  believer.<br />A word about this series as a whole:<br />While I slightly prefer  the treatment of the same subject in William P. Grady's WHAT HATH GOD  WROUGHT to the ongoing history presented in this series, I will say that M  &amp; M's treatment of Lincoln and the spiritual causes of the civil war  were, to me, far superior.  I would still, however, recommend that you read  both this series AND Grady's wilder, more hardcore fundamentalist approach.   Between the two you will have much to consider.<br />All in all, a great  read.  AL	2000-07-13

Not long ago, I recieved an e-mail from Dr. White announcing (drum roll, please) his new &quot;last-word&quot; treatment of a controversial topic: THE POTTER&quot;S FREEDOM, White's defense of reformed theolgogy against  lowbrow, lowlife hyper-fundys.<br />Basically it's a typical White  performance.  The guy who began his book THE KING JAMES ONLY CONTROVERSY   by neatly categorizing all King James defenders on a kind of  smartest-to-dumbest scale; the guy who demanded that Thomas Holland  withdraw his criticism of the same book from circulation; the guy who (for  me) has come to define &quot;mock-tolerance&quot; and &quot;condescending  compassion toward those who disagree&quot; has, indeed, done it  again.<br />It's not that bad, but I still recommend that you read both sides.   Read this book, but still read Vance's OTHER SIDE OF CALVINISM as well.   As with White's King James book, the real agenda here is to ensure that you  do not read certain books.<br />I have been accused of lying about this, but I  really have come to use White's King James book to defend the KJV (or  perhaps more accurately to defend the DEFENCE of the KJV!)  After a couple  more readings of THE POTTER'S FREEDOM, I expect to find it equally useful  in dealing with the debate-worshipping theological bullies who claim to  defend God's sovreign will!	2000-06-22

I will say something at the outset that White's &quot;fans&quot; will no  doubt believe to be a falsehood: I have found this book useful in defending  the KJV!<br />This book, although well-crafted, readable, perfectly proofread,  and HIGHLY touted by the mainstream evangelical press, has actually done  little to stem the tide of a growing movement among Christians toward the  KJV-- and there's a REASON! <br />The reason lies in White's peculiar attitude  toward his subject.  It is a perplexing mixture of outright condescension  and feigned compassion.  This is in painful evidence from the very outset!  In the Introduction, for example, White states plainly his mission to  exhume the truth without bitterness... and then SUDDENLY launches into a  neat categorization of KJV-ers on a sort of &quot;smartest-to-dumbest&quot;  scale!!<br />Indeed, this dichotomy-- between playing the &quot;good wise,  patient professor&quot; on one hand and trashing those who DARE to think  differently on the other-- crops up so often in White it almost becomes a  caricature.  It is a beautiful example of what I can only think to call  &quot;MOCK TOLERANCE.&quot;  It would even be amusing if White were not so  totally unaware of it! <br />KJV-ers, do NOT fear this book!

This book, by textual scholar Waite, is my favorite defense of the KJV.  Waite's outline of four areas in which the KJV is demonstrably superior to modern renderings of scripture is the clearest and most concise  presentation I have found.  It is also useful as an antidote to some  mean-spirited pro-KJV writings that have become ammo for the &quot;other  side.&quot;  Waite is not guilty of bombast or arrogance, and I praise God  for it.<br />I once passed this book to a derisve individual who was baiting  me almost incessantly after reading White's KING JAMES ONLY CONTROVERSY.  I  asked him to read Waite since I had already read White's popular and  mock-charitable &quot;establishment&quot; treatment.  Out of a sense of  fairness, he reluctantly agreed.  Well, I would be a liar if I said he  drastically changed his views, but he is now unwilling to argue about the  subject and seems to use only a KJV!<br />I strongly recommend this book.	2000-05-08

So much of what is available on the Anabaptist movement during the Reformation is hopelessly biased from the Reformed P.O.V..  This book, however, is not only partial to its subjects, but is immensely readable and  altogether inspiring.  These men (and women, too) were so bold in their  imitation of New Testament Christianity they were slaughtered by Catholics  and statist Protestants alike.<br />All of these portraits are useful and  informative. The story of Michael and Margaritha Sattler DEFINES Christian  courage.  (If you EVER get the chance, see an independent English film  about them called THE RADICALS-- one of the finest Christian films ever  produced.)  The section devoted to Balthasar Hubmaier is worth WHATEVER you  pay for this book.  Hubmaier was called by William Cathcart &quot;the  greatest man of Reformation times.&quot; I am inclined to agree.<br />Highly  recommended.	2000-04-24

As a dispensational Baptist who, admittedly, has seen great abuse of the dispensational framework by self-appointed Bible scholars, I would like to recommend Dr. Blue's well-balanced treatment of the issues involved in Bible interpretation as it relates to the average Bible-believer.<br />Blue  makes a great case that dispensationalism, as it wholly relies of the Word  to interpret the Word, REMAINS the most trustworthy method of holisticly  viewing the inspired scriptures.  <br />It is getting more and more difficult  to proclaim a right division of the Word of truth in these perilous times.

As a brief addendum to my review below, I would like to comment on the best story in this volume: THE GIFT OF COCHISE.  This story was made into the screenplay for the  John Wayne film HONDO by James E. Grant.  It is now  widely believed that L'Amour's book HONDO is actually an adaptation of this  screenplay and not an original novel. (See discussion in Robert Weinberg's  LOUIS L'AMOUR COMPANION.)<br />For the record, I prefer L'Amour's original to  HONDO, both book and movie.  Louis' original story is more accurate  historically and works better on nearly every level.  One significant  change in Grant's treatment involves the character of Ed Lowe, the female  protagonist's murdered husband.  In the original, the Ches (Hondo) Lane  character is motivated entirely by a sense of duty toward Ed, and the  events of the story revolve entirely around this motivation.  I believe  Grant deliberately made this change in order to deconstuct Lane's typical  L'Amour-hero integrity and create a moral ambiguity in the love story. (He  seems to have been fond of moral ambiguities in all his John Wayne  scripts.)<br />Read the story and see what you think.  It is one of L'amour's  best moments as a writer.	2000-04-20

Aside from the fact that his (Woodrow's)  newer book spends little or no time actually repudiating Hislop, I must  also remark that his original BABYLON book, while quite useful in many  ways, actually strayed from Hislop quite often.  In fact, the bibliography  shows that Woodrow's discernment was... er, FUZZY... even in the 60s, as  there are Jehovah's Witness books cited and even illustrations borrowed  from Watchtower publications (at least in my very old edition.)<br />The truth  is that Woodrow did a decent service back-in-the-day by providing many  readers (myself included) with a workable INTRODUCTION to Hislop, a true  scholar and biblicist you should never be ashamed to admire.

Space is actually  wasted, though, on Augustus Toplapy, when Ryle could have given us a  picture of, say, the great John Newton, instead.  <br />Still, this one is a  must for those interested in the old gospel, great preahers, or church  history. Bravo!	2000-04-03

L'Amour's best story collection was 1975's WAR PARTY, but this 1980 follow-up has some great moments as well.<br />Most of all I want to comment on the story &quot;Bluff Creek Station,&quot; a powerful re-write of an earlier pulp story called &quot;The Blood of Ryan.&quot;  I believe this  story is one of L'Amour's finest moments, right up there with FLINT,  REILLY'S LUCK, THE DAYBREAKERS, and the story &quot;The Gift of  Cochise&quot; (collected in WAR PARTY.)  It is the story of a stagecoach  stationmaster's last moments of life. Unforgettable.  It is alone worth  whatever you pay for this book-- my favorite western short story next to  O.Henry's &quot;Pimienta Pancakes.&quot;<br />All in all, a great anthology.   Buy it.	2000-04-03

Of course, eventually, all of L'amour's great old pulp fiction will see book form and, as a huge Louis fan, I'm glad of it.  But if you want to read L'Amour's BEST short fiction, this collection, the first, supervised by the author himself back in '75, is your finest bet! <br />L'Amour was a  better writer in his pulp days than he will ever be given credit for.  In  fact, as a late purveyor of the pulp western's twilight era, I prefer him  to Elmore Leonard, H.A. DeRosso, et al.  These men were just self-conscious  crime writers (with some hipper-than-thou neo-naturalist brightness and  talent) who condescended, for a time, to sell westerns.  L'Amour, on the  other hand, was a believer! -- and BOY, could he knock off a tale! <br />Also  worth noting is the story &quot;The Gift of Cochise,&quot; expanded by  James Edward Grant into the screenplay for John Wayne's movie HONDO.  (L'Amour is now believed to have actually novelized this photoplay-- See  Weinberg's LOUIS L'AMOUR COMPANION.)  I believe the original story is far  better than HONDO-- book or movie!   L'Amour's original is more logical and  realistic, and the love story works better with the dead husband as a good  guy toward whom Ches (later Hondo) Lane feels a driving responsiblity. This  was one of L'Amour's greatest perfomances.<br />Also, check out the other  'slicks' Louis wrote for COLLIER'S and the SATURDAY EVENING POST-- pure,  smart story-telling!  (Especially the forgotten 1960 Sackett story  &quot;Booty For A Badman.&quot;)  The ladies will love his excursions into  &quot;Ranch Romance&quot; territory-- &quot;One For The Pot&quot; and the  title story.  There's not a single dud here and the collection would be  perfect if it included &quot;Bluff Creek Station&quot; (later collected in  THE STRONG SHALL LIVE), my personal choice as L'Amour's greatest short  story.<br />So buy it when you can, especially if you have never read Louis  L'Amour!  This anthology is a perfect introduction to an Americanlegend.<br />Al	2000-04-03

I know the old &quot;Home Run Preacher&quot; is now considered hopelessly &quot;evangelically incorrect&quot; nowadays, but I wouldn't trade this old book for a trunkload of Swindolls or Kay Arthurs!   You want real gospel preaching?  DIG IN! <br />Sunday doesn't 'give talks' or 'devotionally  exposit.'  He chasers sinners, saved and unsaved, like a rabid pit bull!    And you know something?  He still manages to convey the great love of  Almighty God and the beauty of Jesus in a way that makes today's TV and  radio charlatains look weak, pale and just plain cowardly.<br />Carl Sandburg  was all wrong about Sunday. So was J. Gresham Machen.  Billy KNEW the real  Jesus!  THAT'S why he couldn't shut up about Him!	2000-04-03

FANTASTIC!	At last, a publisher has given us the REAL Spurgeon's priceless, too-hot-to-handle &quot;Rome remarks.&quot;  As an avid reader of the old Baptist battler I can assure you that these are only the tip of the  iceberg, but they are quite well-selected in any case.<br />I have always been  greatly amused at the &quot;editing&quot; of Spurgeon's work with regard to  Romanism-- among other things-- by the &quot;Powerhouse&quot; Evangelical  Publishing Establishment in the U.S. (Check out the censored and rewritten  &quot;Morning and Evening&quot; devotionals, for example.)  These  publishers' genial efforts not to offend Romanists and Ecumenicals would  doubtless raise the considerable ire of old Charlie himself-- which they  themselves must SURELY realize!   Hypocrisy can be quite interesting in  it's more &quot;devout and holy&quot; manifestations! <br />Here, though, is  the unexpurgated wit of a gospel preacher who was so bold and outspoken  that the Media STILL has to silence him!

You say this book won't serve as ammo against the fleshly logic and &quot;evangelical correctness&quot; of doctrinaire Calvinism?  HA!   I have shown these arguements to two articulate and over-educated &quot;defenders  of sovreign Grace&quot; and their responses have demonstrated otherwise, to  say the least!   One will no longer speak to me (odd, since he used to love  baiting me at every chance) and the other literally-- LITERALLY-- shook  with rage by end of our first discussion (and he teaches at a Baptist Bible  college! )<br />The truth is this: Vance has tapped into something so simple  it plum amazes me!   Calvinism IS logical, DOES make sense to man's finite  mind, and answers virtually ALL comers with tidy precision.  And THIS is  exactly why a New Testament Christian should AVOID it like the plague!   It  feeds the mind and stifles the soul.  I agree with Vance that Calvinism has  hurt the Church's mission-- he is simply TOO correct about this.  In my  experience, every bird that ever &quot;refuted&quot; my contention that  Calvinists invariably lose their zeal for winning souls to Christ was also  a NOTORIOUS slacker in personal evangelistic work. (&quot;By their  fruits...&quot;)  Vance shows no mercy, and he is simply  correct.<br />Especially good is Vance's section on &quot;Calvinism and the  Baptists,&quot;  which, to me at least, was LONG-awaited.<br />I praise God  for you, Vance, and pray your book finds many hands!  Amen!	2000-02-18
