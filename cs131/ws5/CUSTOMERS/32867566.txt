But it does help you go through them [financial statements] and learn what they mean, and how cash flows through a company.  If you can understand what they are trying to tell you; you are WAY ahead of your average investor, even the smart ones.<br /><br />Most importantly, they teach you about \\"economic moats\\".  These are the strengths of the company that keep competition at bay for a long period of time, allowing the company to continue to grow for years (and thus, the stock price and dividends as well).  It also goes through the businesses represented in the stock market, sector by sector, to tell you how to analyze a particular stock from each sector and its good and bad characteristics.<br /><br />A little tough, and certain parts require some math, but even if you don't \\"get it\\" all 100%, you're still way ahead of your average investor, as I said.  You definitely come out of this book with more knowledge about companies and mistakes made by average investors than you knew before you turned the first page.<br /><br />My only wish is that some of its more acute parts didn't go over my head quite so high...and that is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.  Otherwise, a FANTASTIC book.  Definitely pick it up and don't be afraid of not understanding all of it: you'll at least absorb something out of it that will get you ahead.	2005-08-29

Joe Leaphorn doesn't believe in coincidences, and neither does the author.  And nothing simply coincides in his books, all the subplots come together neatly.<br /><br />An anthropologist disappears, two men are found murdered, a backhoe is missing and Joe Leaphorn, who's wife has recently died and is retiring from the force, wants one last big case before he quits.  He cooperates with junior officer Jim Chee who just wants to find out who stole that damned backhoe and murdered those two men in the truck.<br /><br />The book is really full of surprises and has a totally surprise ending.  Not the one that I was really hoping for or betting on, but it was a shocker.  A little hard to follow all the plots coming together however, which was why I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5.	2005-08-19

What is spoken about in several chapters could be summed up in one chapter.  It seems to repeat the same facts over and over again just to make the book longer.<br /><br />Though I must digress and give the author some credit for making his point that Iraq is an anachronism--something that does not belong in this time period and could have been settled a different way.  But I still have to point out that this book was dry and not as enlightening as it could have been.  Read a book with more scope, one perhaps about the Peace of Paris and how the Middle East ties in with it.  I'm sure there are more than enough.	2005-08-18

I must say that it was a really fascinating read, if not the most well laid out detective novel.  Things do look random from one perspective, as Leaphorn said he used to think, just like the paint on the rocks looked random until seen from the right perspective (another Navajo principle of metaphysics).  This book is loaded with Navajo metaphysics and cultural insights.  I think the story of Ashie Pinto's alcoholism is quite sad, actually, and I don't entirely understand the concept of the coyote in Navajo culture, but this is still a great read.  I wouldn't at all pass it up.	2005-08-03

Meanwhile, several Navajo have died from Bubonic Plague (something they still die from, seriously).  Is there a connection? Yes.  In this one, Leaphorn is now a private citizen and Chee is acting Lieutenant.  Their roles almost seem reversed but they're still the same old characters.  I don't think they had to have Janet Pete in this one again, I think he should just dump the b****.	2005-08-02

This book really makes me sad that the Cold War is over and the Soviet-American struggle and intrigue is a thing of the past.<br /><br />CIA operatives struggle to get a Russian spy for America out of the Soviet Union before he is executed.  Sounds simple but it's not and it takes great effort on the part of all involved.  The husband-wife CIA team are great at what they do and make exceptional characters that you really want to cheer for like it's a football game or something.

So, in 1997, things are a bit different than they really are: no revolution based on the lofty ideas of Jefferson means no French Revolution, no Russian Revolution, no Mexican Revolution, etc, etc...the world is ruled by empires still playing \\"The Great Game\\" and the North American Union is a happy (almost) dominion of His Majesty, instead of an independent United States of America.  Technologically, this world is far behind--apparently, the author thinks that America's democratic spirit is responsible for its pioneering, capitalistic nature--radios still use vacuum tubes and zeppelins cross the continent in lieu of 747s.  Instead of the FBI, we have the Royal American Mounted Police.<br /><br />The most famous painting in the empire, that which commemorates the reconciliation pact between Washington and King George III, is stolen to finance a fascist rebellion in the NAU.  And that's where the excitement ends.  The rest of the book is just a trip across North America to visit or interview this or that character, and finally, they find out where the painting is and rescue it before it can be destroyed.  Woo hoo.<br /><br />It was a cute book, but not well written.  Harry Turtledove would have done better writing this on his own than with a Hollywood actor to help him---who certainly left his political mark on the book.  For instance, there is no murder in America since guns are outlawed in the British Empire....yeah right, Mr. Dreyfuss, why don't you keep your political opinions to yourself and not bore us with them? And I doubt technology would be that far behind.  Though he's right that, if there were no American Revolution, there would have been no \\"trigger\\" for countless others.<br /><br />Canadians would find this book pleasantly cute, since the world would be soooo much better, to them, had there been no American Revolution, and all of North America was just like Canada.  Uh huh, right.<br />Canadians would find this book pleasantly cute, since the world would be soooo much better, to them, had there been no American Revolution, and all of North America was just like Canada.

Cussler usually weaves together a couple of themes in his books, in this case, the secret plot of the Neo-Nazi Wolff family to \\"purify\\" the world and the coming doomsday prediction of the ancient Amenes civilization.<br /><br />The premise of the ancient Amenes civilization, much older than the Sumerians and completely lost to the world in a massive disaster, was fascinating and spellbinding.  And the Wolff family were worthy opponants for Pitt, if a little unrealistic to have a whole family of clones of Adolph Hitler (enhanced, of course).  One always discovers something absolutely fascinating in Pitt novels, and archaeology was always one of my favorite topics.<br /><br />All in all, it was another great Pitt novel, one in which Pitt wins against all odds and has a beautiful woman in the process, not unlike James Bond.  But it's more of a combination of Indiana Jones and James Bond, and still manages not to be too corny or stereotyped in the process.  Pitt is still relatively unique, so he's not intended to be an exact clone of either Bond or Jones, which is a good thing.	2005-07-30

I think I enjoyed reading Night Probe better, now that was a good one.  But this one had too many \\"weird\\" things coming together.  Like, Jules Verne, the Vikings, the Cerberus plot to blow up Lower Manhattan, etc, etc....he should have stuck to two intermixed themes as he usually does (like ancient Atlantis plus the Neo Nazis in Atlantis Found).  Also, the idea of a matter teleporter and Jules Verne's original submarine is a little silly.  The characters were weak, Dirk Pitt didn't really come out as Dirk Pitt in this one and too much time was spent on the peripheral characters.  It was a fairly decent read, I just think that Clive Cussler could have done sooo much better when he wrote this one.	2005-07-27

Millington's work is probably the best I have come across that explains Mah Jongg as it was played before Babcock and a whole slew of American players f*cked it up.  It goes into great detail in the rules for play.  While there is no extensive section on strategy--only a brief one--it does have a fascinating section on the history of the game, and a brief description of several variations.  Read the directions in detail.  It may look a little overwhelming but once you've read it you'll be an expert in Mah Jongg forever and have a thorough knowledge of all the rules of the game.	2005-07-27

One, Saudi Arabia as it is, is circling the drain.  Revolution is imminent.  And two, they are NOT our friends, however much oil they may give us.<br /><br />Robert Baer traces back the sordid history of U.S.-Saudi relations, and is very critical of the U.S. Government's ignorance in these matters.  If Baer is correct, we are in for a disaster of epic proportions.  I find it interesting that the CIA even allowed him to publish this book, let alone simply censor it.

There are no ray guns or aliens in it, no spectacular space battles or things more associated with Star Wars or Star Trek, where science fiction is concerned.  All the action in this book is a showdown between a human, astronaut David Bowman, and the life-like computer, HAL.  It almost seems as if, throughout the whole book, the most human character ends up being HAL himself, witnessed by his last words as Bowman tries frantically to disconnect him.  So the other characters were a bit static in a way, like Heywood Floyd for instance, but I can live with that.<br /><br />His premise of the development of mankind is fascinating to say the least--that we were \\"enhanced\\" by an alien species and owe our early survival to them.  This is truly a unique and groundbreaking work of science fiction, much better than anything anyone else could have written.  But I take off one star for the lack of \\"humanness\\" in some of the characters.<br /><br />2001 may not have arrived exactly as Clarke planned, but maybe 2050 will be as he described in this book?

You get Heywood Floyd's personal struggles and emotions, not just one single part with him in as in 2001.  The ideas in 2010 are eerily real: joint US/Russian space missions at odds with the Chinese (who have sworn than, by 2010, they will land on the Moon I kid you not).  We explore a little more of Hal and the Monolith and some questions are answered that were not answered in 2001.<br /><br />Overall this was a more than worthy sequel to 2001.

The Hitchhiker series (Restaurant is the second) is the best British humour (not humor) has to offer.  His approach to science fiction merged with comedy is sheer genius and beats up Star Trek and 2001 like a pimp beats up his 'hos.<br /><br />We continue the story where we left off, and Arthur, Ford, Zaphod and Trillian (oh yeah, and Marvin the android with chronic depression) as they meander their way to eat at the most fabulous restaurant, (same as title).  So the Earth was just a supercomputer designed to find the Ultimate Question to the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe and Everything?

This is not true.  Orwell may have written this at the beginning of the Cold War when we knew just how nasty life was in Russia, and looked to the USSR and Communism as its model.  However, this could just as easily apply today.<br /><br />There are underlying themes in this book that apply to today's democracy-dominated world, unthreatened by the monolith of 1940's communism or fascism, just as they did in 1949, when this book was written.<br /><br />First, in the book they mention that people have the tendency to justify handing over power to a smaller, more efficient caste of people during an emergency.  That's when it all starts to unravel.  Give the government an inch and they will take a mile.<br /><br />When the press is not heterogenous and the government can influence it, you begin to have official lies.  This happens in many countries that have \\"official state media\\" (think, the Middle East).  Second, he mentions that when atrocities were committed by Oceania, they were considered noble but, committed by the enemy, were atrocities to be avenged.  Be careful when you fight your enemy that you do not become just like him.  It is when there is little difference between your tactics and that of whom you fight that you lose yourself and your identity as a human being.<br /><br />I could go on and on of countless examples, but these are just a few.  You don't think a democracy could unravel? Think again.  Read 1984.	2005-07-23

The Medici made their biggest mistake after taking over Florence when they fired Niccolo Machivelli, the equivalent of a modern Prime Minister or Chief of Staff.  He really knew his politics, and had a realistic plan for a Prince to seize power and become Prince of a United Italy.  That was Machiavelli's dream, an end to the internicene warfare of the medieval Italian States, and the beginning of an era of a new Roman Empire.<br /><br />This book is essentially what amounts to a very long job application by Machiavelli, hoping that the Medici princes would rehire him and he could return to doing what he loved to do and did best, politics.<br /><br />The book is often criticized as the work of the Devil because of Machiavelli's insistence that the prince will have to be ruthless, not always keep his word, and manipulate people.  He insists that a successful prince must be FEARED by his population---though not to the point where he is hated.  He said, execute a man and he won't be able to hurt you again, but never simply confiscate his property or take his women away from him.  The book is still relevant today.	2005-07-23

A glossary in the back of Roman and Latin terms does not make the work cumbersome but instead fascinating and easier to read.<br /><br />Marius and Sulla, once political allies and underdogs of the system, are now having a falling-out.  Marius, now a privitus (private citizen) goes on tour of the empire on a fact-finding  mission, while Sulla prepares for his run to the consulship himself.  Meanwhile, civil war breaks out as the Italian city-states revolt against their Roman masters.  Sulla and Marius end up on the same side in this one, but once it's over their paths begin to diverge...<br /><br />The end of this one, though I won't spoil it, is rather sad.  Rather than having the admiration for Gaius Marius I had after reading The First Man in Rome, I began to experience dismay with his character in The Grass Crown.  He has become suspicious, deceitful, jealous and lets his emotions rule his brain.  Needless to say, it ends in disaster for Marius.<br /><br />Sad ending, but great novel to read just the same.

There is a glossary in the back of Roman terms to clear things up that you don't know (unless you're a history major) but that doesn't mean the book is difficult reading.  Quite the contrary: McCullough has taken a difficult subject and made it a pleasure to read.<br /><br />A wealthy man, but lowborn, \\"an Italian hayseed with no Greek\\", Gaius Marius could buy and sell half the Senate and it wouldn't matter; he's still \\"shut out\\" of the upper-echelon of Roman politics without a proper patrician ancestry or political links to one of the noble families (not to mention the fact that several of those families are openly hostile to him).  Lucius Cornelius Sulla, on the other hand, is impoverished and base but possesses one of those noble patrician ancestries, is in the opposite situation; due to lack of funds and military experience is he locked out of the political system completely.<br /><br />Lucky circumstances and the person of Gaius Julius Caesar (the famous Caesar's grandfather) change both mens' futures completely.  Sulla is thrust into the Senate and finally allowed his rightful place in history that his patrician ancestry should have assured, but his poverty disallowed.  Marius's alliance with the Julii assures him a second chance at the main prize: the consulship of Rome, highest office in the land.<br /><br />Truly a wonderful story, wonderfully narrated, and brought to life via real characters and expert dialogue.  I'm not kidding when I say it's the best historical fiction work I have ever read.	2005-07-13
US	32867566	RMVWGFXMDGFUA	014200202X	694137922	Casino Royale (James Bond Novels)	Books	4	1	3	N	Y	Casino Royale: a good read	A great beginning for the Bond series (which totals about 13 books from just Ian Fleming).  He's a little different than movie James Bond and a little more realistic to boot.  Plenty of action, though, I think Bond's escape from Le Chiffre was just a bit too easy.  Also, I think the romance with Vesper was a bit too drawn out and he spent too much of the book talking about Bond's \\"recovery\\" with Vesper.  Other than those two complaints, this is an excellent book, surely it can be called a classic.	2005-07-12

My only beef with it is that it usually does not have the short vowels printed there along with the consonants which are of immense help to the beginner.  But at least it does have the transliteration of the word to help make up for that fact.  It's also not too cumbersome to carry around with you.	2005-07-12
US	32867566	RKE2SZR7DENDI	0679772693	620118114	A Short History of Byzantium	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Fascinating Read for Fascinating Times	Even more interesting than Rome itself, the Byzantine Empire spanned more than a thousand years after the \\"fall\\" of the west, and Lord Norwich manages to successfully jam 1000+ years of history into one reasonably sized volume.  I am not sure he had to go through every single emperor to tell the story of Byzantium, but the details on each were amazing, he speaks of the emperors as if he knew the men personally (the mark of a good historian).  The details are sometimes even hilarious (the Byzantines did have something of a fascinating with gouging out eyes and castrating people).  And the reign of the infamous Justinian and his wife Theodora are dealt with in just enough detail to fascinate the reader.  I would have to say this book was well worth the price I paid for it.	2005-07-12
