All three have similar subject matter: the bleak future.  Both Brave New World and 1984 depict technology run rampant and used to further de-humanize the populous.  1984 is a bleak book, but in parts very powerful.  I would say, however, that at times Orwell lost my interest.  He is in love with narrative, which is fine, but occasionally it drones on.  I would say that Brave New World is a better book to read about how the future CAN go wrong, mainly because it is much more entertaining.  But 1984 has a ton of integrity, especially in the ending.	2003-04-16

There seems to be a theme in most of the stories in Everything That Rises Must Converge, and that is sudden violence... usually at the end.  I'm not giving anything away, because the read is the important part.  O'Connor creates very authentic southern characters, that are funny, disgusting, bigoted, warm and all around human.  There seems to be a slight O'Henry in O'Connor in that she likes to surprise you... some may say suddenly end things, quite dramatically.  But it is with this ease that her writing is that much more disturbing.  On the surface, the south she portrays is gentle and simple.  Yet with sudden ferocity, she turns it on its head.  To read O'Connor is really enthralling.  The intensity and description in which she writes makes each story in this collection seem like a novel.  I read Wise Blood a few years ago and liked it, but I will have to read it again as well as her other works after the great fulfillment this collection gave me.	2003-04-10

The Professor and the Mad Man focuses on two such men, both are considered brilliant yet one was insane.  His story is the most interesting and the most tragic.  However, although a perverse way to look at things, if he did not commit the murder he committed the dictionary would not have been as rich as it is, for he had quite a bit of time to work on it, considering that he was institutionalized for most of his adult life.  My only problem with the book is when it would interrupt the story of Minor and Murray and discuss in very brief spurts other people involved in the dictionary, when clearly this books strong suit is the relationship of Murray- the head of the project and Minor- the most prolific contributor.  When the book focuses on Minors tragic life, it is a great read.  When it diverts it can be a bit of a chore.  But all in all for a subject matter most would consider droll, this work flushes the humanity out of it.	2003-04-03
US	51878010	RPR4X2TN9QOLE	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	A deserved classic	I never read Lord of the Flies in high school, so, I finally got around to it, near to my 30th birthday.  It is a novel of great depth and symbolism.  The characters all represent a portion of leadership: Jack- the warmonger; Ralph- the diplomat; and Piggy- the brain behind the diplomat.  Some may say that this book is just a cynical view of human nature.  But I believe it is just realistic.  After all most of the boys that Jack scares into becoming a part of his tribe are young and therefore ignorant.  This shows how most despots keep control, by denying their population with any real higher education (except for the privileged few) and intimidating them to stay in line.  The outcome of the novel is tragic, yet a lesson in survival and civility: when might makes right, there is no progress and only fear.	2003-03-29

The overwhelming and most effective feeling Bakis conveys is one of sadness.  Sadness because a mad genius has bred a race of dogs with prosthetic limbs, mechanized voice boxes and a higher intelligence (for dogs) and the dogs are fiercely unhappy, for, they are more or less machines in an otherwise organic body, a body that is rapidly deteriorating and they know it.  One of the places the story fails to hold me is within the dialogue.  It isn't bad, but it isn't good either.  And the further I read the less interesting the story is.  The climax I just sort of skim.  The sense of action is too minimal to keep me interested.  Plus, Bakis isn't very successful in the complete personification of the dogs .  After awhile I just can't take the story to heart.   A good effort, but not a real memorable one.	2003-03-25

Not that it's a bad book.  It isn't.  Some of the sordid activity of the Hell's Angels is quite an interesting read... but at other points in the book I found myself skimming, i.e. the descriptions of the cycles, etc.  However, one thing I really admire about the book is it's sheer objectivity.  Thompson neither loves nor hates the Angels.  He obviously shows contempt for some of their loutish and criminal/psychopathic behavior, but also distinguishes them as misfits looking for a home.  If you're looking for an expose on biker gangs that would reflect their modern dimensions, obviously this book wouldn't be for you, but as a history lesson in outlaws it has strong merits.	2003-03-20

At the end there are no sunsets or glorious lifting of burdens that leave the protagonists free from worry for all time.  However, it isn't an exercise in sorrow either.  It is a portrait of a life and of two men trying to make one together.  Yet, the one with the brains can only do so much, as the childlike giant is a danger to everyone around him, without meaning to be.  This is one of Steinbeck's classics and for good reason.  It is short yet it says everything it needs to say, which I think is one of the marks of a great writer: stop writing when the story is finished.  This novel is deservedly a classic.	2003-03-15
US	51878010	R1UJRL0UTGQQ6A	1573225517	138260184	High Fidelity	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Real Romance	High Fidelity is a glimpse into the way REAL relationships work. Throughout, the narrator, Rob, contradicticts the reality of love with the fantasy that he always thought love was.  There are the mundane details of the break-up and the move out, plus the &quot;lets still be friends&quot; attempts that never work.  Occasionally Rob seems like a bit of a dolt, and this observation makes one not always totally sympathetic towards him.  His life seems to be drifting along and he doesn't seem to care either way.  But this is the character and at least he is honest.  I wouldn't call High Fidelity a &quot;page turner&quot;.  But it certainly is an easy read and a good one at that.	2003-03-13

While I don't necessarily agree with some of the more doom and gloom projections of the future, Huxley is quite adept at explaining mind control by the powerful wanting to remain in power.  Plus he has a keen awareness of the threat of our stability by the rising problem of over population.  Also, remember this book was written in 1958 so some of his projections have already come true.  Brave New World Revisited is quite an intellectual book, yet very readable.	2003-03-07

It actually moves along quite well. At times Hemmingway's sparse and arid prose is maybe a little too one dimensional to sink your teeth into, but he gets his point across. We understand quite well the degree of Santiago's persistence, and bad fortune, yet he still persists. There is zero pretension in this novel and that makes the simplicity of the fisherman's life that much more authentic. If you're a Hemmingway fan you'll like it. If not, you won't... 'cause it treads the same stylistic grounds.	2003-03-05

If you are already a Nirvana fan you probably have read similar things Kurt Cobain has said that is in this volume.

It feels forced, as though Steinbeck was straining to write about normal people when possibly he couldn't relate to them anymore.  The characters are O.K.  But nothing like the characters in the other books I have read by him thus far: Grapes, Eden, Cannery and the Pearl.  Basically I was disappointed.  However, I will still seek out more Steinbeck to read since most of the other works I have mentioned were so monumental.  Every writer is allowed a dud here and there, especially one who has such an amazing track record.	2003-02-14

The build up takes too long and the human relationships don't seem real at all.  When the novel is scary it works.  But that's for such a brief period of time that I felt drained reading all of the filler.  I must confess I'm not a Stephen King fan, but I'm not anti either.  So, if you are a fan you'll probably dig it.	2003-02-08

But as the author says, it's supposed to be.  The life of a bi-polar or manic depressive person IS self indulgent and rambling.  However, I would say reading the almost mundane details of her life (mundane in the extreme) can sometimes be aggravating to the reader.  However, her insites with her own disease and the disease of other's are quite profound.  She does not think medication is a cure all but also knows it is necessary.  Quite an eye openeing book for the uninitiated.	2003-01-26

Welsh writes the characters with a combination of empathy and objectivism, that shows us their major faults as well as what's going on deep inside(except maybe Begbie, who doesn't have much going on inside).  Welsh choosing to write how those living in the edinburgh slums talk gives the novel an added authenticity that makes the novel that much more palpable.  I'd recommend this to anyone interested in true art.	2002-12-27

Norton tries to make a connection with the Salem hysteria and wars with the Indian's in Maine.  I didn't really think she connected it very well, and only confuses the reader by going back and forth with the time period and not really explaining the connection(unless she thinks it is obvious, which it isn't).  And as another reviewer has written the style is choppy and dry... you have to really be boring to make this story boring and she succeeds.  Look for another book on the subject if you are interested.  I will be trying to sell my HB at my local used book store.	2002-12-07

Red has to be one of the biggest [villians] in literary history.  There was no problem, specifically with Death of Sweet Mister.  I would just say that it lacked drama when drama was most called for, and the in general [feel] of it all lacked the southern gothic feel perhaps woodrell was going for.

Then I bought it and read it and have no idea why it's so popular. The plot is an interesting one.  The beginning is very strong and emotional.  Yet beyond the beginning and the promising plot is really just bad writing.  The dialogue alone is laughable and made me(when I wasn't laughing) cringeing at some of the VERY sappy sentiments.  Yes this is an emotional subject matter, but that doesn't excuse lines such as \\"she seasoned her toast with her tears\\" GOD!  Who wrote this, a 16 year old?  This novel reads as though Sebold took a creative writing course and took everything that the hack that taught it told her to write, seriously. If you're interested in how a family copes with the murder of a daughter in a realistic way, I wouldn't say this is the book.  But I'm sure it will be a movie!  Hopefully the screen writer will be better than Sebold!	2002-10-03

Yes, they are still happening even today.  However, Riis's writing style is quite sensantionalist, it had me rolling my eyes every paragraph or so.  And he is quite prejudice against a whole multitude of races and religions.  Again, yes I know this was written in 1890, but the sheer volume of his judgement against other cultures, etc. really took me out of the core stories of the conditions of the people detailed in the book.<br />A fair amount of the book had me interested, it's just the way the stories were told made me not be able to disgest their content very well.	2002-09-27

But for a novel it gets tiring quick.  It doesn't seem to have much of a point other than to offer up two different fantasies of an inmate: one very violent and disturbing, then other benevolent.  Whatever, they both get old.  Some of the writing is the most disturbing I've ever read, which is fine, if it has a point.  I don't believe it does.  I have read two other Selby books, Last Exit and Requiem.. both are far superior to Room, Requiem is a masterpiece!  So if you haven't read any selby go to one of those two first.	2002-08-30

Solomon really dives into this subject with a vengance and gives you all you would ever hope to know regarding depressions history to treatments to modern perception,etc.  The last chapter &quot;Hope&quot; is especially steller, and there is no chapter that is a let down.  Occasionally I found the pace plodding, but I never thought his writing was in fact &quot;depressing&quot; it was enlightening, and an excellent job throughout.	2002-08-24

Since I'm more of a fan of gritty fiction and this novel's subject, although not completely mainstream,is usually too mainstream for me.  However Russo makes you want to read about these people, it flows very well and although the book is thick it doesn't get boring.  My only criticism is the ending, it seemed to get a little melodramtic and after that seemed to try to tidy itself up a bit too quickly.  However, all in all a damn good read.	2002-08-07

Fight Club was good, but not as good as everyone says.  Survivor was really good(in the beginning) and then got very gimicky.  And thsi one? Well all of the above except it is sporadically good and sporadically juvenile, and gimicky.

Occasionally this novel cracks with energy, the tension among the characters is quite potent, and then at other times it bores you near sleep.  The rambling monolgues can be great(like when Pilar is detailing Pablo's once fervent commitment to the cause) and then at other times the words seem to be an annoying roadblock that you have to wade through to get to the meaty parts.  All in all I respect this novel and do think it is a good work, but I can't give it more than 3 stars, because of the chores it sometimes put me through.	2002-06-22

While I am basically living the life Ms. Ehrenreich describes in Nickel and Dimed I still found the descriptions of life in the periphery of society as being quite depressing.  Maybe it is because I only have to support myself and not a family that I didn't quite realize the scope of the \\"invisible\\".  Ms. Ehrenreich described very well how our supposed \\"priveleged\\" society is priveleged for the very few, and it doesn't have to be that way.  It's not like the Walton family will starve if they up the starting wage up a buck or promote with vigor or treat their employees as adults and not mis-behaving toddlers.  Those that promote capitalism should realize they are doing a diservice to their creed by treating so called \\"non-skilled workers\\" as they do.  Eventually not being able to feed your family will start to jade those who want a real life, and don't just want to struggle to merely survive.  We wonder why the destitue in the middle east turn to terrorism, well we can look right at home and see that any idea that is empowering is better than being [dumped] on, it will happen here rest assured if things are not evened out a bit.  This is well illustrated in Nickle and Dimed.<BR>     I guess my only contention with the book is chastising those for having a \\"maid service\\" etc.  I mean these are things people use.  For instance if I had a little bit more money there is no question I would get a maid, for I am a slob.  I think the main issue is paying them what they are worth, not giving them peanuts and expecting these workers that do the dirty work to like it.<BR>     If our country is so concerned with ending terrorism, how bout the terrorism of a minisule pay check and the terror of not knowing if your kid can get adequate care if somethingf horrible happens.<BR>     What promises will fringe groups give in the future to those who need promises?  And who will do whatever they have to do to try and make a better future?  Isn't this the question are business leaders should be asking?  We aren't only un-ravelling in the middle east, but eventually the cloud of depression over our ghettos will turn to riots that make the L.A. riots look like a brush fire.<BR>     We can stop that anger from turning violent if we wish to forego short term gluttony.	2002-06-08

Tender is the Night is certainly a professional effort, however it is dull, it is a bit dense, and the timelines occasionally are confusing, making the first two obeservations even more glaring.  It is a sad story, but one in which I found a chore to read for the most part.  It seems to cerebral to conjur up the passion of a taboo love affair and the malaise of a dying one.  We can't compare all of a writer's work to his greatest triumph (gatsby in this case) but since I read Tender is the Night because I liked Gatsby so much, the comparison is inevitable.<br />Maybe I'm too young to truly understand this story or better yet feel it, but I have a feeling when I'm older I won't want to attempt another pass.	2002-05-31

However, round about the middle of the book, I began to read the words but not take any of them in(i.e. BORING).  Suskind uses virtually no dialogue.  He is TELLING you everything making you less like a fly on the wall and more like a bored(read: VERY bored) student just wanting to take a nap.<br />His main character while in the beginning is intrigueing becomes a nauseating little creep that I could care less about.  The murders ARE mandane and to make up for his lack of any real energy, Suskind(like Cormac McCarthy) gives you detail upon detail hoping you're SHOCKED- but really all you're doing is yawning.<br />The end is the best part!  Because it's so laughably ridiculous(unintentionally of course).  I won't ruin it for anyone, but the way in which the main character gets out of his due punishment must have been pulled out of some feebile dream the night before Suskind wrote it.  No one who has read three decent books would buy it, thus making the whole experience of reading this book maddening.<br />So to sum up, guy can write but end result is convoluted, pretentious and dull.	2002-05-21

The flashback scenes were actually my favorite, in which we get a glimpse of this man, Joe, before he was a slab of meat with a brain.  His descriptions of being a faceless, armless, legless, earless, lipless, noseless, etc. man are quite gory and disturbing, which is good.  But he gets a bit redundant here and there, making the impact not as powerful as it could be.  When he goes off on tangents about Christ I think I get the symbolism, but it doesn't quite jive with me.  I believe Trumbo was trying to make a statement, and that is fine, but I think (especially at the end)his statement gets in the way of the story, which in turn gets in the way of the impact.  As a reader you feel you were manipulated just to get to the part where he is raling against war, in a context that doesn't seem to gel with the story.  Plus the style of writing is pretty sloppy, and what's with the no comas?  Kind of got on my nerves.<br />Overall, glad I read it, certianly wasn't a waste of time, but as far as being the \\"fiercest anti-war novel ever written\\" I'd hope not, because in it's shining moments it seems to be about survival most of all, and not necessarily about the evil's of war, at least it wasn't for me.	2002-04-13

It really shows the dominace his mother had over him and how conflicted he was about who he was, which in the end was probably why he killed himself.  Many writers get rejected, they all don't kill themselves... so it was Nevils and Hardy's job to shed light on the many factors that led to his suicide, which I believe they did very well.<br />However it's not all dark and gloomy, reading about how insane his mother was quite funny at times, although I wouldn't want to spend an evening at one of her recitals or listen to her ramble on the phone(I have my own mother for that)	2002-04-03

It is never awful or great but just o.k.  I found most of the stories just ended, like maybe it was an idea for a novel that she discarded.	2002-02-18

The melting down and all around descriptions are the virus running amok are very interesting.  However, the effort to tug at our heart strings is sloppy and manipulative and loses the focus of the book for the most part.<br />Some of the writing seems a bit forced and therefore doesn't flow very well, but some is dead on...<br />oh well just my opinion	2002-01-24

I found this a chore to read for the most part.  The anti-hero is so pathetic that you just want to end the misery as soon as possible, and the stuff with the prostitute is too melodramtic.  Obviously this was a pre-curser to his genius work Crime and Punishment.  After reading NOTES,I believe it has gotten far too much praise than it deserves.	2001-12-30

It makes you realize the responsibility of all your actions.  How your pain doesn't justify you trying to pass it onto someone else.  It is about evolution and truly will stick with you.	2001-12-09

It's intense, gruesome, disturbing, but yet beautiful in the way he uses language and keeps you interested in the story.  It's a great view of a southern hell: full of fundamentalists and inbred hillbilly's.  My only critiscm is that it does tend to ramble a bit at the end, but with such great prose it didn't bother me too much.	2001-12-02

And they will stay with me, but the book could have been 100pgs shorter and had more of an impact.<br />Dean is an amazing character.  Although my favorite would be old bull lee, based on the strange and wonderful mr. burroughs.<br />Yeah decent book, should read it, but don't believe ALL the hype	2001-08-22
US	51878010	R365MG0ZNNEUWW	0385498721	179075750	Survivor: A Novel	Books	3	1	1	N	Y	Beginning GREAT- the rest mixed	The beginning of Survivor really sets a very dark, sad and original tone, with the Tender Branson ultra loser, ultra isolated character.  The suicide hotline in which he tells people to just kill themselves is sadistically funny.  Fertility is a great character all the way through the book.<br />But once Tender Branson becomes a superstar(made by agents and the like) for being the last creedish cult member living(presumably) the book gets a little too flashy, a little too quick and superficial.  It's still a very good book from a very good writer.  But with the promise of the first half of the book it is sort of a let down to resort to (as other reviewers have mentioned on here) gimmicks.<br />Chuck P. does write with vigor and is an easy and mostly exiciting read.  I just thought this book could have gone FAR deeper and instead it seemed to have sped up, and lose me with lack of much emotion, that I felt the first half had.	2001-07-21

Because there aren't any.  Conservation unfortunately is against the rising tide of our population, given that Meacham tries to detail the options, some of which aren't so romantic but they are options none the less.<br />If you have your heart set on rhetoric don't buy this book.  If you are more open an objective view of the reality of conservation, buy this book.	2001-07-12

Over all I did enjoy my experience and felt I learned alot.	2001-06-06
US	51878010	R3BHBRPFL1GB7W	0140043519	683385169	Junky	Books	5	1	3	N	N	A page turner	It is far more straight ahead than Naked Lunch, but with a clarity that has amaizng energy.  I have not read everything by Burroughs but what i have read leads me to believe he made his greatest mark in my mind with Junky.  Possibly completey autobiographical and therefore less artistic than Naked Lunch, etc.  But it's wit, grime, and linear thought transcends.	2001-05-26

But I just attempted to re-read it, and really it doesn't hold up.  I found myself bored with the lack of the depth.  I guess I just grew out of this one.	2001-05-26

But this book is hard to top.  For literature in my opinion this book is the bible.  Dostoyevsky is not only a brilliant technical writer but a great storyteller as well, especially in this novel.  You can read it over and over again, and the characters are just as vibrant the story is just as facinating.  Well that's all I really have to say, if you haven't read the book READ it.	2001-05-26
US	51878010	R3UOLLWFIRDFUG	0802132952	783763378	Naked Lunch	Books	3	2	3	N	N	maybe I have to read it again	You know Burroughs to me, is very hit or miss.  Junky was a hit.  Some of interzone was a hit....  But Naked Lunch to me, while I guess many consider it a great work of art, seems to me to be a rambling self indulgent diatribe.  Again maybe I have to read it again, but I don't quite have the desire to do so.  There are some good moments it the book.  But since it's basically a junkie talking while on junk I didn't think I could relate.  Burroughs was a fantasic writer with such a sharp mind, and occasionally I just think he is being lazy with it, masking bull for ART.	2001-05-21

Written in a style that could grab anybody's attention.  This book blew me away completely.  It isn't leftist rantings.  It's told from the perspective of the conquered not the conquering, which is a far different perspective.  If you love history and are not set to believe that everything in that eighth grade tarnished history book is gosepl.  Pick this book up, it is remarkable.	2001-05-21

And I probably won't start to after reading this book.  Not that it's a bad book, becasue it isn't.  Will Self is obviously a very capable gifted writer.  I found some of the satire very funny and to the point.  However I found the point belabored quite a bit.  He seemed to be in love with his cleverness, and I'm sure he is quite clever, but it got a little redundant for me.  So very good book, the style of which turned me off more times than not.	2001-05-20
