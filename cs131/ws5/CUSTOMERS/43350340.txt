As the sun sets on a deserted Florida beach, a desperate man prepares to take his next victim. The young girl seems just the right age to survive the journey through the black water. And if she doesn't...she'll end up like all the others... <br /> <br />HAVE A TERROR... It's been a beautiful day for psychic Mira Morales and her daughter, Annie. So why does she feel a growing unease about the smiling man walking calmly toward them on the deserted beach...a chilling warning that he is not to be trusted, but feared above all else... <br /> <br />ALL THEIR OWN... For years, children have been disappearing without a trace in the Florida Keys. And no one, not even the FBI, has suspected that it could be the work of a single twisted psychopath. Now, with her daughter gone-abducted by a killer consumed by a desire to change his past and his future-one mother will do whatever it takes to find her child, even if it means following her through the darkest passages of the unknown, to a place where each choice has terrifying consequences no one can possibly foresee...\\" <br /> <br />As psychic Mira Morales and her daughter pack up their gear to return home after a day at a remote beach, a man with his arm in a cast approaches. Mira has an uneasy feeling about this stranger but when the realization strikes it's too late. <br /> <br />Ms MacGregor introduces us to Mira in her book The Hanged Man. Mira is a psychic whose husband was killed during a convenience store robbery. In this first installment of the Mira Morales suspense series, we find Mira and her daughter Annie spending a day at the beach. When they are approached by a man who tells her his boat broke down, Mira realizes too late that this man isn't what he seems. Knocking out Mira, and kidnapping here daughter, the man just seems to evaporate. When Mira awakes, she uses the strong psychic attraction from Annie to follow them. What Mira finds out is something truly frightening and that she must watch her every step. Now, it's up to her boyfriend FBI agent Sheppard to use his non-psychic investigation skills to locate both Mira and Annie. <br /> <br />Though far fetched and bordering on the edge of Sci-Fi a little too much, this is still a good book that will grab you from the start. The characters are good solid characters, and the plot is a good one. Ms. MacGregor does a wonderful job with a plot in which you don't have much to figure out. You know who kidnapped Annie and why early on so you would think that would spoil the story. On the contrary, you find yourself on the edge of your seat wanting to see what happens next. <br /> <br />I found this book to be a wonderful read that was hard to put down. If it weren't for my busy schedule, I probably would have read this book in one sitting. If you like suspense or thrillers, then I highly recommend that you add this book to your reading list. You will enjoy it. <br /> <br />Though this particular book has not been nominated for any literary awards, Ms. MacGregor has the following literary accolades to her name.  <br /> <br />NOMINATED:  <br /> <br />1987  Shamus Award   Dark Fields Paperback <br /> <br />WON: <br /> <br />2003  Edgar Allan Poe Award Out of Sight Paperback <br /> <br />This is the second novel by Ms. MacGregor that I have enjoyed. The first was The Hanged Man and I plan on reading more by this author. As I said before, if you enjoy suspense and thrillers, then don't leave T. J. MacGregor off of your list. <br />	2004-11-01

FROM THE CASE: \\"On his 49th birthday, Alex McKnight's old friend Jackie goads him into playing poker with a bunch of men he hardly knows. In the middle of the game, masked robbers invade the premises, hold the players at gunpoint, and proceed to rob the homeowner. Alex is roused to action and so is his former detective partner, Leon Prudell. Working first against one another and later together, they discover that the crime is far more complex than a simple robbery. There is murder and greed and revenge involved-and a wild chase on the waters of Lake Superior-before Alex is forced to realize that there is no retreat from life. And that maybe this is a good thing...\\" <br /> <br />When ex-cop, ex-private eye Alex McKnight is almost physically drug out of his cabin by his old friend Jackie for night of poker with five other men, what could go wrong other then maybe drinking to much and waking up with a hang over the next morning. How about a home invasion and robbery, and if that isn't bad enough, three of the six men playing get arrested for planning the crime. Especially, when the three are good friends who you know would never do something like this. This springs Alex into action. <br /> <br />Though this isn't one of the best books I have ever listened to, it wasn't that bad either. I found the characters to be entertaining and likeable. Mr. Sullivan who narrates this book does an excellent job at bringing them to life based on the descriptions provided by Mr. Hamilton. In particular, Mr. Sullivan does a good job with making all of the voices different. He does a great job with the Canadian characters, ay. Mr. Sullivan has recorded over eighty audio books and has several television appearances to his name. <br /> <br />Though I found this book to be fun with a great plot and enjoyable characters it did have its flaws. In my humble opinion I felt that Mr. Hamilton could have made this book a bit more exciting. Mr. Hamilton spent a bit too much time with descriptionsof the characters as well as the Northern Peninsula of Michigan. This book also didn't keep me riveted to it like many other audio books have. I'm not saying that Mr. Hamilton is a bad author; I just felt he used a bit to much description for my taste. <br /> <br />This fourth book in the Alex McKnight series is a good book that puts Alex into action to prove that his friends wouldn't or should I say couldn't ever be involved with a home invasion and robbery. It also makes Alex realize how little he knows about his friends and there families. <br /> <br />This is a pretty good book that in my opinion is worth the read or listen. Though it could have been better, if you like this genre, then I would recommend this book to you. <br /> <br />Mr. Hamilton's literary recognition includes the following award nominations and wins. <br /> <br /> NOMINATED:  <br /> <br />1999  Anthony First Novel A Cold Day in Paradise <br />2003  Anthony Novel  North of Nowhere <br />2003  Shamus Novel  North of Nowhere <br />2004  Anthony Novel  Blood Is the Sky <br />2004  Shamus Novel  Blood Is the Sky <br /> <br />WON: <br /> <br />1999 Edgar Alan Poe First Novel A Cold Day In Paradise <br />1999 Shamus  First Novel A Cold Day In Paradise <br /> <br />I have never read or listened to any other titles written by Mr. Hamilton but I do plan on it. This book was enjoyable though not riveting I liked the plot and the characters and hope that all of his novels are this good. Based on his literary award nominations and wins, I don't think I will be disappointed. <br /> <br />Being a person who enjoys reading I have read many books and enjoyed the works of many authors, I can't really think of anyone to compare Mr. Hamilton with. Perhaps you could say his style is somewhat like that of Lawrence Block or James Lee Burke. <br /> <br />No matter what authors you prefer in this genre, give Steve Hamilton and North of Nowhere a try. I don't think you will be disappointed. <br />	2004-10-25
US	43350340	R39FRCRBZPIEOJ	073930738X	730478278	The Sinner	Books	4	1	1	N	N	India + Nuns + Murder = Thrilling Suspense	FROM THE CASE: \\"The cloistered grounds of the convent have traditionally represented a place of faith and peace. Now, that peace is shattered as two nuns are found, one dead, one mortally wounded. The killings appear to be without motive, without an obvious suspect, and are further complicated by the murder and mutilation of a third woman. Together, medical examiner Maura Isles and intense, moody homicide detective Jane Rizzoli, both introduced in earlier Tess Gerritsen novels, uncover an ancient horror that connects these terrible slaughters. As long-buried secrets come to light, Isles finds herself drawn inexorably towards the heart of an investigation that strikes closer to home - and towards a dawning revelation about the killer's identity too shattering to consider.\\" <br /> <br />What do India, Nuns and murders have to do with each other? That is the very question that homicide detective Jane Rizzoli and medical examiner Maura Isles have to answer in this wonderful novel by Ms. Gerritsen. Set in Boston in winter, this novel starts off with Dr. Isles being called to a murder scene. Nothing out of the ordinary for a medical examiner you say. A true statement except that this murder scene is inside the chapel of a convent and the victim is a young nun. From here it gets even stranger when Dr. Isles is called to yet another murder scene and finds a victim who has been mutilated. Is this murder related to that of the young nun? You have to read or listen to this book to find out.  <br /> <br />In this novel, Ms. Gerritsen takes us down three separate paths only to rejoin them for a wonderful climax. This isn't what I typically think of as a medical thriller. I guess because when I think about medical thrillers I think of novels where healthy patients are dying from some unknown medical cause, not one where a medical examiner is the main character. <br /> <br />This was a wonderful audio book. Though it didn't keep me glued to it one hundred percent of the time, I found myself in parts hoping to get stuck in traffic or looking forward to the end of the day so I could get back in my car to continue. <br /> <br />The narrator for this audio book combined with the writing style of Ms. Gerritsen did a superb job at bringing the cityscape of Boston in the winter to life. One who has never been to Boston, I found myself making wonderful visualizations. I could picture the convent as if I were standing in front of it and the twinkling lights of Christmas on the snow. Another thing I liked about this book was the characters. I found myself picturing Maura looking like Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra.  <br /> <br />Being one of the Detective Rizzoli novels it seemed to me that she took a back seat to Dr. Isles who ended up being the main character in this book.  <br /> <br />All in all, this was a good book though not great. I really enjoyed the way the reader is drawn down several paths which make it very hard to figure out who the murderer is and why. I really enjoyed the writing style of Ms. Gerritsen and the narration. <br /> <br />Unfortunately Ms. Gerritsen has never been nominated for any literary awards for her work. This is a shame, as this is the third novel by her that I have enjoyed and any one of them is worthy of a nomination. In addition to The Sinner, I have enjoyed Bloodstream and Life Support by Ms. Gerritsen and would recommend any of these. It dosen't matter if you enjoy medical thrillers, mystery, or just plain good suspense, then you don't want to leave this or the other two Tess Gerritsen novels I mentioned off of your list. <br /> <br />Take it from one who likes medical thrillers; if you like authors such as Robin Cook, Michael Palmer, Peter Clement or Iris Johansen, then you will not be disappointed by the works of Ms. Gerritsen. <br /> <br />For you folks in the literary awards areas, I think it is time that you give Ms. Gerritsen serious consideration for her work.	2004-10-18

Stephanie needs cash - fast - but times are tough, and soon she's forced to turn to the last resort of the truly desperate: family... <br /> <br />Stephanie lands a gig at her sleazy cousin Vinnie's bail bonding company. She's got no experience. But that doesn't matter. Neither does the fact that the bail jumper in question is local vice copy Joe Morelli. From the time he first looked up her dress to the time he first got into her pants, to the time Steph hit him with her father's Buick, M-o-r-e-l-l-i has spelled t-r-o-u-b-l-e. And now the hot guy is in hot water-wanted for murder... <br /> <br />Abject poverty is a great motivator for learning new skills, but being trained in the school of hard knocks by people like psycho prize fighter Benito Ramirez isn't. Still, if Stephanie can nab Morelli in a week, she'll make a cool ten grand. All she has to do is become an expert bounty hunter overnight - and keep herself from getting killed before she gets her man...\\" <br /> <br />This is the first book in the Stephanie Plum series. When Stephanie Plum loses her job, she makes every attempt to survive. She has hocked most of her appliances and furniture, and you think, what else can go wrong when her car is repossessed. What's a girl to do then? Well she does what any self respecting person, male or female, would do, turns to her cousin Vinnie for a job at his bail bond company. <br /> <br />I found this to be an enjoyable book with a good plot and though you quickly develop some suspects, Ms. Evanovich doesn't give you enough information to definitely connect them to what's going on. <br /> <br />This book was narrated by C. J. Critt, who has narrated other books written by Ms. Evanovich as well as authors such as Patricia Cornwell and R. L. Stein. Ms.Critt does a pretty good job with the narration; however, I thought that her attempts at doing male voices could have been better. It seemed to me that they all sounded pretty much the same. The only male characters that definitely sounded different to me were Morelli and Ramirez. I'm not saying that Ms. Critt did a bad job. On the contrary, she did a good job and brought many of the characters to life. She did an excellent job with the character Stephanie. Ms. Critt makes Stephanie Plum seem so real that when she reads one of her parts, you just know that she is saying it the way Stephanie would. <br /> <br />There are many things about this book that I liked. Ms. Evanovich doesn't waste words on detailed descriptions of people and places. She gets straight to the point, and only gets detailed when necessary. However, though this is a good novel, it's not great, and at best is average. If you like the detective genre or mystery genre will like this book. <br /> <br />I rated this book average (three stars). The reason for this rating is simple. Being one who commutes in a high traffic area and gets tired of radio stations with lame DJs and radio stations with to many commercials, I like to listen to audio books. When rating an audio book I base it on how much I was kept riveted to it. This book, though good and decently paced, didn't have me hoping to get stuck in traffic or not wanting to get out of my car at the office or upon arriving home. <br /> <br />This book does have foul language and some minimal sexual content. Though not used on every page, when the foul language is used, it is used in spurts. If you are offended by this type of content, then this isn't a book for you. <br /> <br />This book was nominated for the following awards in the category of First Novel; Agatha Award, Edgar Allan Poe Award and a Shamus Award. <br /> <br />Below is a complete list of the awards Ms. Evanovich as been nominated for or won. <br /> <br />AWARDS: <br /> <br />NOMINATED:  <br /> <br />1995 Agatha Award    One for the Money <br />1995 Edgar Allan Poe Award  One for the Money <br />1995 Shamus Award    One for the Money <br />2000 Anthony Award    High Five <br /> <br />WON: <br /> <br />Ms. Evanovich has not one any awards for her writing. <br /> <br />This is the second book by Ms. Evanovich that I am familiar with. The other book was, To the Nines which is another in the Stephanie Plum series. I think Ms. Evanovich is a good author and I am planning on listening to or reading other titles written by her. If you like the mystery genre or detective genre, then I recommend that you put One for the Money on your list of must reads. <br /> <br />If you like authors such as Nancy Bartholomew, Sarah Strohmeyer or Anthony Bruno then you will like Evanovich. <br /> <br />Give One for the Money a try, and happy reading. <br />	2004-10-07
US	43350340	R2YLJI1MXI3WBY	1590073509	116175105	Catering to Nobody	Books	3	8	8	N	N	Catering To Who Dun It Fans	FROM THE BACK/CASE: \\"Catering a wake is not Goldy's idea of fun. Yet the Colorado caterer throws herself into preparing a savory feast including Poached Salmon and Strawberry Shortcake Buffet designed to soothe forty mourners. And her culinary efforts seem to be exactly what the doctor ordered...until her ex-father-in-law gynecologist Fritz Korman is struck down and Goldy is accused of adding poison to the menu. Now, with the Department of Health impounding her leftovers, her ex-husband proclaiming her guilt, and her business about to be shut down, Goldy knows she can't wait for the police to serve up the answers. She'll soon uncover more than one family skeleton and a veritable stew of unpalatable secrets-the kind that could make Goldy the main course in an unsavory killer's next murder!\\" <br /> <br />When I first got this book I couldn't believe it. With a main character named Goldy Bear who owns and operates Goldylocks Catering where \\"Everything is just right\\", I was wondering what on earth I had gotten in to. <br /> <br />This book was a little slow at the start. At the beginning you learn that Goldy has been hired to cater the wake of a teacher who committed suicide. From this point until Goldy's ex-father-in-law drinks rat poison laced coffee seems to take forever to develop. Once you reach this part, the book seems to gradually pick up the pace, though it never reaches a breakneck speed. Never in the book does there seem to be any sense of urgency or a sense of \\"Oh my god, what's she going to do now?\\" or \\"How is she going to get out of this?\\" <br /> <br />Once this book begins to pick up the pace, it becomes a very enjoyable story. You will find yourself liking the characters of Goldy and her 11 year old son Arch. In addition, there is an almost light hearted air to this book which never distracts from the plot. In fact, it only enhances the character of Goldy. Ms. Davidson's inclusion of actual recipes in the story helps to accentuate the character of Goldyas a caterer and in a strange way make her seem more real. <br /> <br />For mystery buffs or those who like a good \\"Who Done It\\" this is a good book. Ms. Davidson did an excellent job at creating a plot that will keep the reader guessing all the time. Many times I thought this character or that character did it only to be wrong. <br /> <br />This audiobook was narrated by Barbara Rosenblat who is an experienced narrator with many titles to her name. She does an excellent job at bringing the characters to life. Though she isn't boring in her narration, I think Ms. Rosenblat could have done a better job in giving the characters a sense of fear or urgency when required. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a good book with an excellent plot. Unique in style and content it has wonderful well written characters. The narrator does a good job at bringing them to life but lacks that extra something that will keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br />The first in the Goldy Bear Mystery series, Ms. Davidson was nominated for both the Anthony and Agatha Awards in 1991 for this book in the category of First Novel. <br /> <br />NOMINATED:  <br />Agatha (1991) <br />Anthony (1991) <br /> <br />WON: <br />Anthony (1993)  <br /> <br />I have never read anything by Diane Mott Davidson prior to this book. Though I only gave this book three stars, it was a good book that I enjoyed. With the unique characters and the way I was kept guessing throughout, I will definitely be trying other titles in the Goldy Bear Series. <br /> <br />Being an avid reader, I read all kinds of books. However, most of the mystery books I read are not really written in the same style as this one. To me, the only author I can really compare Ms. Davidson to is Lawrence Block and his Bernie Rhodenbarr mysteries.  <br />	2004-09-28
US	43350340	R1EP9NCORY4RKW	1586211919	472682750	Last Man Standing	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Go the Abridged Route	FROM THE BACK/CASE: \\"It took ten seconds for Web London to lose everything: his friends, his team, his reputation. Point man of the FBI's super-elite Hostage Rescue Team, Web roared into an alley toward a drug dealer's lair, only to meet a high-tech, custom-designed ambush that killed everyone around him.<br /><br />Now coping with the blame-filled words of anguished widows and the suspicions of colleagues, Web tries to put his life back together with the help of his psychiatrist, Dr. Claire Daniels. To do so, he must discover why he was the one man who lived through the ambush-and find the only other person who came out of that alley alive...a ten-year-old boy who has disappeared.<br /><br />Web's search leads him from inner-city Washington, D.C., to the rolling hills of Virginia horse country-while people connected to him are violently silenced. Acting on his instincts, Web believes he knows where the killer will strike next. Only this time, he may not survive the attack.\\"<br /><br />This book starts out like a house on fire and has the potential to keep the listener glued to it. Unfortunately, after the initial opening when Web London freezes and watches as his fellow members of Charlie Team of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) get gunned down this book fizzles. This fizzle is brought on by Mr. Baldacci's need to describe every person, place and thing to the smallest detail. What tends to keep you hanging on are the action scenes that tend to promise re-ignition.<br /><br />Though this book does slow down, there are only a couple of spots where it drags. Mr. Culp who narrates the book does an excellent job at trying to keep things moving. Fortunately, it seems that when you get to these spots, something exciting or gripping happens immediately following them.<br /><br />There are several things about this book that I really liked. First, Mr. Baldacci does a good job with the characters. That is to say, he did an excellent job at picking the right type of character for the right part. Mr. Culp helped this by giving the characters the right type of attitude and voice for their role in the story. In addition, Mr. Baldacci takes what are basically several stories to start and does an excellent job at bringing them together as the novel progresses.<br /><br />Another thing the Mr. Baldacci did well was to confuse the reader or listener in this case as to what was going on and who exactly was behind it. At times I found myself thinking that it was an inside job. Other times I thought it was the Frees behind it. When things are finally revealed I was flabbergasted to say the least. Some people don't like it when they can't figure out what is going on or who is doing it. I enjoy it when an author confuses me and keeps me guessing. So many times you figure out who, what, where, when and why with little or no difficulty.<br /><br />My dislikes for this book are simple, too much description. I'm not one that needs the most intricate detail described to me. Quickly set the scene with as little description as possible and get on with it. Mr. Baldacci, you could have saved a few trees if you would have used less description.<br /><br />To summarize, this is a good novel that is slowed down by to many descriptive scenes; however, it is saved by the plot, the characters and the narrator.<br /><br />If you like thrillers then you will like this novel. Just keep in mind that David Balcacci tends to be very descriptive. Though I haven't read or listened to the abridged version of this novel, I would think that is the better route to go and would probably recommend it. I have a gut feeling that I probably would have rated this novel higher then three stars if I had listened to the abridged version.<br /><br />Mr. Baldacci is a good author and this is the second novel by him that I have tried. The first was Absolute Power which I didn't like and rated two stars and titled my review for it \\"Absolute Junk\\".<br /><br />  Mr. Baldacci has never been nominated for any of the main stream literary awards. Based on Absolute Power and this novel, I can understand why. In no way am I trying to imply that Mr. Baldacci is a bad author. On the contrary, Mr. Baldacci is a good author but hasn't written anything that is ready to be nominated for an award.<br /><br />If you like authors such as James Grippando, Stephen Cannell, John Grisham, Michael Conelly or Kyle Mills, then I recommend you try reading or listening to this novel.een nominated for any of the main stream literary awards. Based on Absolute Power and this novel, I can understand why. In no way am I trying to imply that Mr. Baldacci is a bad author.

US	43350340	R2CG7PW0XWURHX	1570426457	515249324	Angels Flight	Books	4	13	17	N	N	Slow Start, Good Finish	FROM THE BACK/CASE: \\"An activist attorney is killed in a cute little L.A. Trolley called Angels Flight, far from Harry Bosch's Hollywood turf. But the case is so explosive - and the dead man's enemies inside the L.A.P.D. are so numerous - that it all falls to Harry to solve it. Now the streets are superheating. Harry's year-old Vegas marriage is unraveling. And the hunt for a killer is leading Harry to another high-profile L.A. murder case, one where every cop had a motive. The question is, did any have the guts?\\" <br /> <br />It's post Rodney King and every thing that the L.A.P.D. does is constantly being scrutinized. Now, a Civil Rights attorney who is preparing to sue the L.A.P.D. and several of its officers is murdered. This leads to Detective Harry Bosch and his team being called out in the middle of the night. It doesn't take them long after they arrive on the scene to determine that they are being put in charge of a political keg of TNT that could blow up right in their faces if they aren't careful. During the investigation Harry discovers that the attorney had enough evidence to win the case. Did a cop kill the attorney? Did a civilian commit the murder? These are the questions that Harry, his team and you need to find. <br /> <br />Mr. Connelly wrote this in such a manner that picking the killer early was easy; however, he left enough doubt to keep you guessing. With the plot twists, he does a great job at making you wonder if your choice is correct. <br /> <br />This is the first book my Michael Connelly that I have had the pleasure to experience. Being one who commutes in a high traffic area and gets very tired of morning DJ's, I chose the abridged audio version of this book. This version was narrated by Burt Reynolds who did a good job with most of the male characters. Unfortunately, when he would do the voices of the female characters I would get this vision of him in drag which distracted some from the book but not enough to make you lose interest. Another thing I didn't like is the back of the case stated that Harry's Vegas marriage is unraveling but his wife is never mentioned in the book nor is she ever at home regardless of the time of day or night. I understand that this is just one of the Harry Bosch novels, but if this isn't part of this particular story line, it shouldn't have been included in the description of the book. <br /> <br />One of the things I liked about this novel is the way that Mr. Connelly painted the character of Harry and Mr. Reynolds brought him to life. He was painted as a hard core detective who really detested the L.A.P.D. bureaucratic stuff (if you know what I mean). <br /> <br />When I was determining if I wanted to give this book a try, I noticed that it has been listed as everything from mystery to suspense to thriller. Personally if you are a fan of the hard core detective genre, then you're going to like Angels Flight. <br /> <br />Published in 1999 this book has never been nominated for any awards. Though I liked this book and rated it four stars, I agree that it isn't award nomination material. <br /> <br />Though Angels Flight has never been nominated for an award, I am including a list of some of Mr. Connelly's accomplishments for your information. <br /> <br />AWARDS:  <br /> <br />NOMINATED: <br /> <br />(3) Anthony Award   1993, 1994, 1996  <br />(2) Edgar Allan Poe Award  1999, 2003 <br /> <br />WON: <br /> <br />(3) Anthony Award   1997, 1999, 2003 <br />(1) Edgar Allan Poe Award  1993 <br /> <br />Angels Flight is an above average novel that takes place in L.A. with everything the cops do being scrutinized. This leads to some very delicate situations when Harry is assigned to investigate the death of a black Civil Rights attorney. Like I stated earlier, if you like Mystery/Suspense or Hard Core Detective novels, then read or listen to Angels Flight. It is a smooth flowing novel with some twists and turns to keep you guessing if your assumptions are right. <br /> <br />Being the first novel by Michael Connelly that I have experienced I can't recommend any specific titles that I have read. I can recommend his award winning titles which include, The Black Echo, Bloodwork, City of Bones and The Poet. <br /> <br />If you enjoy the works of authors such as James Lee Burke and Lawrence Block, then you will enjoy the works of Michael Connelly, or at least, Angels Flight. <br />	2004-08-30

With his final breath, he feels two small hands in his - and then nothing. He awakens in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a lush Garden of Eden but a place where your earthly life is explained to you by five people who were in it. These people may have been loved ones or distant strangers. Yet each of them changed your path forever.\\" <br /> <br />Wow! This is a powerful, wonderful book.  I guess that pretty much sums it up.  When I got the audio version of this book I didn't know what to expect. I had never heard of the title much less Mitch Albom. In addition, this definitely isn't something I normally enjoy. Again, WOW! <br /> <br />Have you ever wondered what happens when you die? Most religions teach that you go to a better place. Christianity teaches you that you go to heaven where you meet God and spend eternity. But, what if heaven is what you make it? What if there are different parts of heaven?  What if there are five people that are waiting for you from your past? What if each one had a lesson for you? This book doesn't try to answer these questions, but it does make you think about them. <br /> <br />This book isn't a serious look at life after death or meant to inspire a change in you life. It is a fictional novel that though unreal, can spark some real thought. Mainly it is just what it is meant to be, entertaining. <br /> <br />The five people that Eddie meets when he gets to heaven completely surprised me. Some I was able to guess and others took me by surprise.  I don't want to give them away so I won't tell you exactly who they were, but some are the ones to be expected and others aren't. <br /> <br />Erik Singer's narration combined with some light music and soft sound effects in the background (which in no way distract the listener); get you engrossed in this novel from the start. <br /> <br />This is Mr. Albom's first work of fiction. Previously he wrote a true story about one of his college professors titled \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" which was nominated for an Abby Award. <br /> <br />If I had to find something about this book that I didn't like I would be hard pressed to do so.  I guess it would be the use of the line, \\"Today is Eddies birthday.\\" Again, this is just if I had to pick something that I didn't really like about this novel. <br /> <br />This book has something for everyone. I can't place it in a specific genre because it can fit in so many. It is everything from adventure, to romance. <br /> <br />Other titles by Mr. Albom are, <br /> <br />TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE: AN OLD MAN, A YOUNG MAN, AND LIFE'S GREATEST LESSON (This book was nominated for an Abby award in 1999). The winner that year was the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. <br /> <br />In my own effort to give you as much information about this book and author that I can, I have taken the liberty to include a list of awards which Mr. Albom has either been nominated for or won. <br /> <br />Nominated: <br />Abby (1999) <br /> <br />Won: <br />None <br /> <br />In my opinion, The Five People You Meet In Heaven deserves to be nominated for numerous literary awards, and I hope it is. <br /> <br />No matter if you listen to the audio version or read this novel, The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a must have in your collection.  To quote Patrick O'Kelley, this is a \\"simple book that will find good company on a shelf next to It's A Wonderful Life.\\" <br /> <br />The end of this audio book contains an interview with Mr. Albom in which he says that he has many other ideas for fiction in his head. My response to this is for you to get them down on paper Mr. Albom.  If they are as good as this one, you have nothing to worry about.	2004-08-19

Having taken refuge in a motel, he wakes again only to find his hands covered in blood. As far as he knows, he's no killer. But whose blood is this and how did it get there? Over the next few days Frank develops a fear of sleep, because each time he wakes he discovers strange objects in his hands and pockets - far more frightening than blood.\\" <br /> <br />Enter our heroes, Bobby and Julie Dakota. Frank hires them to keep an eye on him and figure out where he is going, what he is doing and why. <br /> <br />In typical Koontz fashion, this book starts off fast and gets your heart pumping.  You can imagine yourself with Frank running for your life and with Bobby in the back of his Dodge van conducting surveillance. Unfortunately, after this portion of the book climaxes, Koontz slams on the breaks and brings you almost to a halt. It's like going from 80 to 5 MPH in a few seconds. <br /> <br />Though it slows down, the book doesn't come to a complete stop. I didn't find this book to be a real page-turner, like many of Mr. Koontz novels, until about the last 100 pages or so, and then I couldn't put it down. It also wasn't until this point that I realized that I had read this book before. I'm not saying that the reader will feel bogged down, it just slows down and is less exciting for awhile. <br /> <br />I really liked the character of Tommy. Tommy suffered from Downs Syndrome though Mr. Koontz showed him in a light that made me wonder if people with Downs Syndrome really suffer and are they really smarter then we think and only have a hard time formulating their thoughts into words to communicate with us verbally. <br /> <br />Mr. Koontz writing style is one that I enjoy. He has a way of setting scenes and painting the characters without going into extreme detail like authors such as Stephen King. <br /> <br />This book, unlike some of his others, doesn't revolve around someexperiment that went wrong or anything like that. You will be shocked (maybe a strong word) when you find out what is going on. <br />  <br />If you like good writing, a good plot, Great characters make this book a must read especially if you are a big Koontz fan. For first time Koontz readers I would recommend one of his novels such as Face of Fear, Icebound or Sole Survivor. <br /> <br />I always have a hard time comparing authors to other authors and this is no exception. To me, the most logical comparison would be to Stephen King. If you like King, you will definitely like Koontz. <br /> <br />Some of the other titles I have read by this author are listed below.  <br /> <br />Dark Rivers of the Heart (Prometheus Award) <br />Face of Fear <br />Fear Nothing (Bram Stoker Award) <br />From the Corner of His Eye <br />House of Thunder, The <br />Icebound <br />Intensity <br />Key to Midnight, The <br />Lightning <br />Midnight (Bram Stoker Award)  <br />Sole Survivor <br />Ticktock <br /> <br />Note: The items in parenthesis are awards, which that book, was nominated for. <br /> <br />In all, Mr. Koontz has been nominated for the following awards. <br /> <br />Hugo <br />World Fantasy Award <br />Bram Stoker Award (3) <br />Prometheus Award <br />	2004-08-13

It took off like a horse out of the starting gate at the Kentucky Derby and never let up. <br /> <br />Vincente Callabrese is a part time enforcer/collector for the mob and part time movie producer student. When Vincente is asked to produce one of his classmates screen plays this is a start of a new career for Vincente. <br /> <br />First a name change, from Vincente Callabrese to Michael Vincent. Then it's off to Hollywood where he rapidly becomes one of the hottest producers in the movie business. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Michael has a hard time shaking his past. When he tries to buy the movie rights to a novel and is refused, he asks his old friend Tommy Povenzano for help. Tommy assures Michael the he will help. This is the start of all of Michael's problems. <br /> <br />In typical Woods fashion this novel is a mover. Though this novel isn't full of excitement, it will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what happens next. It doesn't take long between incidents. <br /> <br />The bottom line here is that this is a book not to be missed. <br /> <br />Choke  <br />Dead In the Water <br />Orchid Beach <br /> <br />These are all other options by Mr. Stuart and I would recommend any of them. <br /> <br />Though this book has not won any awards Mr. Woods won the Edgar Alan Poe award in 1982 and was nominated again in 1992. Once you have read or listened to this book you will understand why. <br />	2004-07-28

Mr. Cussler is an excellent author who I truly enjoy reading.  Mr. Cussler as always does a great job at painting the scenes, and in particular Dirk Pitt.  I had the pleasure of reading this book on flight from Washington, D.C. to San Diego.  It was extremely hard to put down and I couldn't wait to check into my hotel so I could finish it.  Being one who has been obsessed with ships and the sea since I was a child, Mr. Cusslers books are always extremely enjoyable to me. <br /> <br />I have read the following other books by Mr. Cussler. <br /> <br />Atlantis Found <br />Raise the Titanic <br />The Sea Hunters (Non-Fiction) <br /> <br />I would highly recommend any of these books. <br /> <br />Mr. Cussler was the recipient of the Edgar Alan Poe award in 1974 for The Mediterranean Caper. <br /> <br />Though I can't think of any authors in this genre to compare him to, I can compare Mr. Cussler to other winners of the award mentioned above such as Stuart Woods. <br /> <br />If you like adventure, then don't leave this book off of your reading list. <br />	2004-07-24

The unforgettable characters, nonstop action, high-stakes suspense, and sheer entertainment of To the Nines define Janet Evanovich as unique among today's writers.\\"<br />This was the first novel by Janet Evanovich that I have tried.  I chose the Unabridged Audio Cassette version narrated by C. J. Critt.  Ms. Critt did an excellent job with the various voices throughout the novel. I certainly don't know how she remembers the voices for each character.<br />From the beginning when Stephanie is trying to bring in a little fat bail jumper who has completely greased himself up with Vaseline, this book gets you laughing and giggling.  Not to mention the antics of Lula, the overweight ex-hooker who also works for Vinnie and sometimes partners with Stephanie.  The voices Ms. Critt uses to portray the characters only add to their personalities.<br />Unfortunately, the plot in this novel is drawn out to much and it is the spurts of comedy that keep the unabridged version of this novel going between events.  Perhaps if this were the abridged version I would feel differently.<br />Ms. Evanovich did a great job of fooling me with the plot (even with it taking a while to develop) of this novel.  With Samual Singh working for a company that makes parts for slot machines, I was expecting something completely different.<br />Don't let my negativity stop you from getting this book as it wasn't bad.  I just couldn't find it in me to rate it more then average.  Will I read or listen to other books by Ms. Evanovich? Yes.  I never just read or listen to one book by an author.  After all, everyone needs a second chance, and besides, my wife is currently reading One for the Money which I believe is the first Stephanie Plum novel by Ms. Evanovich and she tells me that it is excellent.<br />Ms. Evanovich has won the Silver Dagger award and truly she can be compared with other winners of this award such as Patricia Daniels Cornwell, Eric Ambler and James Lee Burke.  I don't know if they have ever won the Silver Dagger, but I would also like to compare Ms. Evanovich to Tess Gerritson and Margaret Truman.	2004-07-02

If that's not tough enough, you are harassed by one of your superiors who has his head so far up (well you know what I mean). After deciding to file charges against your superior you lose. Well as anyone who has been in the military can tell you, so much for the career. Luckily in this book Holly Barker caught what she thought was a break when she lands a job as the Deputy Chief of Police in Orchid Beach, Florida working under an old army buddy of her fathers. Well all is going well until the night before she is to start work when the Chief is found dead next to his cruiser. Holly steps into the job of chief and onto lots of toes and all heck begins to break loose.<br />This is my third Stuart Woods novel. Though not as good a Dead in the Water but better then Choke, I found this to be a book that was enjoyable to listen to. Ms. Monk did an outstanding job with the narration and used good voice inflections various little nuances to vary the characters enabling you to easily differentiate between characters.<br /> Mr. Woods does a great job at bringing characters to life and setting scenes without long drawn out description. This book doesn't leave much time between action filled chapters. Between bad guys and subordinate officer who are not happy with the fact that Holly is there new boss anything and everything happens including a love affair with the towns District Attorney.<br />Mr. Woods, is an excellent author with whom I became acquainted with his novel Dead In The Water and was hooked. If you like a good mystery with lots of action, then Stuart Woods is an author not to be omitted from your list.<br />Just get a Stuart Woods novel and \\"Good Reading\\".	2002-07-23

Though the stories were good I could have cared less about some of the miscellaneous stuff. The various stories will have you on the edge of your seat. Perhaps the abridged version would have been better. I listened to this book on tape and at times they just went on and on for what seemed like hours about nothing.<br />If I were the authors of this book, I would put out another book containing only the stories of the actual missions of the various submarines and the crews experience.<br />Though I liked the stories, I did not care for this book and would not recommend it to others unless they are absolutely fascinated with Naval History.<br />Folks, don't waste your time or your money on this one.	2002-07-23

The first scream came from the snowbound railwayman who felt the fangs ripping at his throat. The next month there was a scream of ecstatic agony from the woman attacked in her snug bedroom\\".<br />It's obvious from the title of the book that none other then a good old-fashioned werewolf is killing the folks of Tarker Mills, Maine. What's not obvious is the way in which Stephen King brings this story to life. Not being one of Mr. King's longer books this one is none the less just as good. Though written in a style that I thought was more for preteen or teenage readers, it was a good book.<br />This book will keep you riveted from beginning to end as well as having you jump at every sound you hear. If you have a pet, make sure you wrap up in a blanket or long pants because if it brushes up against you, you just might find yourself screaming.<br />Another aspect of this book that you will enjoy is Kings method of describing the people, places and THINGS that go bump during a full moon without a lot of unimportant facts or description.<br />If you're a King fan, make sure to pick up a copy of this book today.<br />Being one who has read many King novels, I have to rate this as one of my favorites. Also, don't forget to see the movie, it's not bad either.	2002-07-23

Both of them suspected that something was wrong - terribly wrong - in the great medical research center where they worked.\\" What is causing so many patients to die on the operating table? Why is it only females? Read this book to find out. However; don't be disappointed, as this is not one of the better works by Robin Cook.<br />Being an avid fan of Robin Cook, this book was definitely not his best work. Though enjoyable, I didn't find it as gripping as some of his other works and can only give this an average rating. Normally once I start a Cook novel I have a hard time putting it down but I didn't have that problem with this one. Not boring, but not as gripping and fast paced as some of his other works. In his usual manner, Mr. Cook is successful in describing the characters and setting the scenes with minimal words and doesn't drag it out as many authors do.<br />I found this book to be plausible yet was able to see through the plot from the very beginning. However, like most of his novels, this book will have you thinking hard about some of the goings on in the medical world today. When I hear or see something on the news regarding a medical breakthrough, I immediately begin thinking about the many Cook novels I have read.<br />For all of you Cook fans, like his many other novels, keep the dictionary handy for looking up those various medical terms. If you are new to Mr. Cook, I recommend starting with one of his other novels; but the same holds true for you as well about the dictionary. If I had to list one thing about the works of Robin Cook that drive me crazy, it would be that he has a tendency to forget that many of us are only lay people who are not familiar with much of the medical jargon he uses. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy his novels greatly.  <br />My favorite novels and I have read many by Mr. Cook and the ones I would recommend for new comers to his works are:<br />Outbreak<BR>Blind Sight<BR>Contagion<BR>Harmful Intent<br />The one I don't recommend for those new to Mr. Cook is:<br />Godplayer	2002-07-23

Can Detective Robicheaux solve a forty year old murder? What would cause someone to drag up something so long ago and forgotten by most? You have to read or listen to this novel to find out. With many twists and turns this novel weaves a tale of action and suspense.<br />This was my first experience with the works of Mr. Burke and I was extremely pleased with it. The characters were absolutely wonderful and the narrator Will Patton did a marvelous job at creating different distinguishing voices for each of them. Many times when listening to a book on tape, you have to listen very close to distinguish between the characters. This wasn't the case here. Mr. Burke did a great job in bringing the settings and characters to life, and with the help of Mr. Patton creating mental pictures of the people and places in the book was extremely easy.<br />The twists and turns I wrote of earlier will also keep you changing your mind about who did what, when and where that you will finally give up and just wait for the end.<br />Again, this was my first experience with any of the works of Mr. Burke and it isn't going to be my last.<br />If you like detective novels or a good book on tape, don't skip this because you'll be sorry you did.	2002-07-23

A language teacher who gets arrested in France and is arrested for a crime he hasn't committed.<br />This was a good book with many twists and turns. You find yourself laughing at some of the situations that Vadassy finds himself in and feeling sorry for him at the same time.<br />Though this is an older book,it sort of reminds you of an old movie or radio program.<br />If you are looking for something light hearted then I highly recommend this book.	2002-07-22

From the first page it engrosses you to a point that you just want to keep reading until you reach the end.<br />Mr. Koontz does his usual terrific job in describing scenes and characters with minimal of words. In addition to this, he cuts off a chapter at just the right moment to keep you in suspense. He also does a wonderful job of taking what essentially is three different stories involving Tessa, Chrissie and Sam at the beginning of the book and bringing them into one story later in the book.<br />Folks, I can't say enough about this book. I have read many Dean Koontz novels and I would now have to say that this has become my favorite. I recently read his book \\"From the Corner of His Eye\\" and didn't give it a real good review. This is definitely a must read. If you are a Dean Koontz fan, don't leave this off of your list and if your new to Mr. Koontz, then don't hesitate to read this book, You Won't Be Sorry.	2002-07-19

It's a little mystery, adventure and romance. Like the title says, this is not a typical Robin Cook medical thriller. I found the book to be extremely enjoyable. It was easy reading and fascinating. Erica Baron travels to Egypt to escape/get away from a romance that she isn't sure she wants and to fulfil her dream as an Egyptologist what could go wrong. During a visit to an antique shop Erica meets Abdul Hamdi the proprietor who shows her an authentic life size statue of Seti I. But what she didn't bargain for was seeing Hamdi murdered before her very eyes. This starts a trail of intrigue, romance, and danger as Erica decides to help do something about the black market trading of Egyptian antiquities.  <br />As usual, Mr. Cook's characters are colorful and seem so true to life. He brings the story alive and sets the various scenes without wasting words on descriptions. The characters are few and you don't really know who is friend or foe.<br />Again, don't be fooled. If you're a fan of Mr. Cook and are looking for his usual medical thriller this isn't one. Don't leave it off of your reading list though. For you die hard Cook fans, this is one of his earlier works and may be hard to find. I this book and read it in one day at the beach.<br />Mr. Cook, this book shows that you definitely have the ability to venture into other areas of writing rather than just medical thrillers. I will be placing this book on my shelf alongside your other novels. You are a great author in my opinion and greatly enjoy your works.<br />I gave this book 4 stars because I felt it could have been a little more exciting and was just a little slow starting. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys mystery, romance and intrigue.<br />Other books I have read by this author include Fever, Brain, Outbreak to many others to list here.<br />Again don't leave this book off of your reading list.	2002-07-16

That is exactly what Junior Cain does and as far as everyone is concerned, (everyone except Detective Tom Vanadium) he is innocent. Pursued by Tom and the sense that someone named Bartholomew is his nemesis and must be destroyed the story begins.<br />   In usual Koontz fashion his characters are colorful and he doesn't waste a lot of time in scene description. He describes the scene in a short concise manner unlike many other authors. You quickly come to like most of the characters but will spend much of your time wondering what they have to do with the plot.<br />   Normally, Mr. Koontz's books grab you from the first page and continue to build throughout with very few low points. About 100 pages into it, this book became the exception. This book is 622 pages long and many of them it seems were put in just to drag it out. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Dean Koontz fan and have read many of his books. However, this one just didn't do it for me. I started this book on a plane from Washington, DC. to San Diego, CA. back in March and just completed it the other day. Normally, I would complete one Koontz novel in a trip like this. This book just doesn't grab you and get you to a point that you can't put it down until near the very near the end.<br />   If you are contemplating a Koontz book, take it from someone who has read many, \\"Don't start with this one\\". Don't pass up Mr. Koontz though, he has plenty of good ones out there. The list below is done in order of my favorite books by Mr. Koontz.<br />   If I didn't like Mr. Koontz work, I would only be giving this book 1 star instead of 2 and I won't be placing this one on the same shelf as the ones below.<br />  Other Dean Koontz books I have read:<BR>Face of Fear<BR>Lightning<BR>Sole Survivor<BR>The Bad Place<BR>The Door to December<BR>Fear Nothing<BR>Icebound<BR>Intensity<BR>The Key to Midnight<BR>Hideaway<BR>The House of Thunder<br />Dark Rivers of the Heart<BR>Dragon Tears<BR>Tick Tock<BR>Mr. Murder<BR>and I am getting ready to start Midnight sometime in the next week.	2002-07-10

He read this book like it was a race. In addition, the sound quality was really bad. You could hear every breath the Mr. Heald took. This book really held great potential. It was a good plot and Mr. Tanenbaum is probably a very good author. I chose the audio book for this title and do to circumstances beyond his control Mr. Tanenbaum didn't come off in a good light with me.<br />This was the first book I have had by Mr. Tanenbaum and it probably wasn't as bad as my rating indicates. I based that on the narrator and quality of the recording. I would probably give the actual book 3 stars, it was average but not above average.<br />If you like hard core detective stories, I would recommend this book. However; I must warn you, the language in it is rather colorful at times. If you are easily offended by vulgar language, then this isn't a book for you.	2001-08-23

What are they hiding?<br />In typical Stuart Woods fashion, this book is gripping from the start. With boats blowing up and fast action, it was a good audio book. This is the first book in a month that kept me riveted to my car to a point I didn't want to get out when I arrived at work or at home.<br />Mr. Sanders (Narrator) did a fantastic job. He was able to use his voice to give characters different accents, and personalities. In addition, he is one of the few narrators I have heard in audio books who could actually do a fairly decent female voice. I truly believe this added to the book.<br />Fast paced with lots of twists and turns, this is a gripping novel. This is only the second book I have ever had by Mr. Woods. The other was Dead In The Water. Though being relatively new to Mr. Woods works, I found this book to be exciting, fast paced and hard to pull away from just as I did with Dead In The Water.<br />If you like mysteries or suspense drama, then this is a book for you. For other new comers to Mr. Woods works, don't hesitate to read or listen to this book.	2001-08-21

Lets face it folks, if you like hearing about other peoples trash (and most do, Bill and Monica were a prime example) then this is a book for you.<br />Emmet Folsby founder, owner and CEO of Folsby publishing and Barbara have been having an affair for awhile. OK, so other men have had an affair, but not with their daughter. A bisexual son who marries in an attempt to get ahead in his fathers company and better his chance for inheriting the entire thing when his fathers time comes. Barbara sees right through this scheme and decides she must come up with one of her own. What these two wont do in an effort to get ahead. Both are obsessed with money and power and of course sex.<br />I chose this as an audio book and was not disappointed. Granted, it wasnt what I thought it was going to be, not my usual genre; however, one doesnt become more literate by confining oneself to a particular genre or author.<br />What I liked about this book, was the style of Mr. Sanders. He made the characters seem extremely colorful and with the help of Mr. Gaines (narrator) they were presented in a manner that really made you understand them.<br />I chose the abridged version of this audio book. Now, I wish I had selected the unabridged. It was obvious that many parts were omitted which were relevant to the story line. You could easily pick out where areas had been left out and you could tell that they were rather large areas.<br />In addition to the missing segments, there were no real breaks indicating the end of chapters or subchapters. Everything ran together and it was easy to get confused as to what was going on.<br />This was the first book by Mr. Sanders that I have ever had the opportunity to experience. I found it to be somewhat simplistic but gripping and at times even humorous. It was fun to see what the other would do next or what would happen to them. The book had a rather surprising ending but I wont give that away here.<br />As I said, this was my first Lawrence Sanders book and being one who doesnt normally read this genre, it would be unfair of me to attempt a comparison to other authors in this arena.<br />If you havent read anything by Lawrence Sanders dont hesitate to try. However, go with the unabridged version. Personally, I think this book had the potential for a higher rating had I listened to the unabridged version.	2001-08-16

I had heard great things about Ms. Rice and seen many of her books on the New York Times Best Seller List. Ms. Rice must certainly have paid the Times to list her book here.<br />Not being one who typically reads/listens to this type of book, I decided to give it a try based on the recommendation of my son. Now that I have finished this book, my son tells me that I didn't like it because I haven't read any of the other books to be familiar with the characters. Perhaps it is because I haven't read any of the other books by Anne Rice, but I found this book to be extremely slow. I didn't think the first tape would ever end.<br />Here you have Pandora (an old vampire) and David (a young vampire) sitting in a café, drinking coffee (first off, vampires only drink blood). Obviously not related to Count Dracula. I guess even vampires must change with the times. Anyway, David requests Pandora to write her life story, both mortal and undead. Why, who's going to read it? Is David going to be the first vampire to get on the Times Best Seller List? Please, lets get real here. Vampires are goolish and evil, with the exception of Barnabas Collins of Dark Shadows Fame (Old soap for you younger folks) that only want to run around and drink blood.<br />Not wanting to be completely negative, I did find some parts of the book rather enjoyable, for instance, her escape from Rome to Antioch, and some of the things she did there. I thought the part about Pandora becoming a vampire was pretty good; however, Ms. Rice could have ended the book here because all of the dribble that went on after that was of little importance to the story. I did like the character Pandora and her glib, egotistical attitude. She definitely wasn't going take any guff from anyone. Other then that, this book was definitely not for me.<br />The reader of this audio book (Kate Reading), at times could really grate on your nerves. In particular, in the first chapter she made the character Pandora drone on and on. It got rather boring. I can say for a fact, had this been a printed version vice audio, I would never have gotten past Chapter 1.<br />I have never read any other books by Ms. Rice and my son tells me that is why I didn't like this one. He says I didn't know the background and the characters.  The only other books and authors I can compare Ms. Rice to are Dracula by Brauhm Stoker and Frankenstein by Marry Shelley. The later two would definitely be placed on a shelf above Ms. Rice. Being one who believes that it takes three strikes to be out, I will try at least two more Anne Rice books. I don't know when, but I will.<br />Folks, take my advice, stay away from this book, at least for a starter. I can't swear that any other books by Ms. Rice are any better, but my son assures me they are.	2001-08-14
US	43350340	R31Y6KP4QRAPPT	0425174204	872231482	Fever	Books	4	8	8	N	N	What Would You Do?	A cancer researcher who's daughter is diagnosed with leukemia is suddenly told by the institute that employs him that he should drop his own research to work on project that he doesn't believe in. Benzene found in the river being dumped by a recycling company. All these things add up to another terrific Robin Cook novel.<br />This was a wonderful book. In typical Robin Cook fashion, it doesn't take very many pages before you are hooked. I guess the real thing about this one it the fact that it is all too real. Big business doing anything they can to protect themselves, a research institute that is willing to do almost anything to keep the money flowing in and a child with leukemia, all very real in this time.<br />One of the things I liked best about this book, was the way in which Mr. Cook describes people, places and things without going overboard. He keeps it straight to the point without all the miniscule detail that you see from some authors. In addition, Mr. Cook kept the medical terms to a bare minimum (unusual for him), and the ones he used, he managed to follow-up with a layman's explanation.<br />I guarantee this book will scare the heck out of you. No it's not a scary horror novel, but it will get you to thinking about what is going on in this day and age. Could there really be a cure for cancer that big business is keeping under raps to keep the money flowing in? This book really got me to thinking about things like, millions of dollars flowing into different charities for years and nothing to show for it.<br />Other books I have read by Mr. Cook include Blindsight, Brain, Chromosome Six, Contagion, Godplayer, Harmful Intent, Outbreak and Vector all of which are good and only one that I didn't really like (Brain).<br />If you like medical thrillers, and Dr. Cook, don't pass this one up. You won't be disappointed. If you have never read one of Mr. Cook's books, don't hesitate to start with this one.	2001-08-10

I., Vick, as her friends call her, has a mystery to unravel. The first thing she unravels is that nobody appears to be who he or she says they are.<br />I truly enjoyed this book. V.I. Warshawski was a wonderful character. Ms. Paretsky did a wonderful job at making her colorful and humorous. Indeed, Ms. Paretsky made all of the characters good. This book, though a little on the older side was the first in the V. I. Warshawski series. Not possessing the extreme descriptions that so many authors in this genre feel needs to be included, Ms. Paretsky described people, places and things providing enough information without overkill.<br />Ms. Peters (reader) also did a wonderful job at bringing characters to life. Though the male characters weren't overpowering, (tough for a female to do a male characters voice), the female characters were all outstanding, including that of Jill the 14-year girl. <br />This was my first experience with Ms. Paretsky and found it enjoyable. Being one who listens to many audio books while commuting to/from work. I found this book enjoyable and certainly plan on trying others by Ms. Paretsky.	2001-08-07

These are the things most people think about when they see or hear about a St. Bernard. We either can't or don't want to think about one of these beautiful large dogs having Rabies. But it is a fact of life. In this book Mr. King strays from the supernatural into something that could and has happened in real life and that is what makes this book so scary.<br />I took this book off my shelf last weekend to read while relaxing at the pool on a hot summers day. Well I couldn't put it down. I was amazed that this book kept me riveted to it a second time. The first time I read it, I began reading it early in the evening and read until I was finished. Ok, this time I started it earlier and was able to put it down long enough to eat my dinner but that was it.<br />Folks if you want an excellent fast paced read. Then Cujo is the book. You won't want to put it down until you have finished the last page.<br />Caution: If you own a dog you may find yourself reading with one eye while trying to keep the other on your own dog, I DID.<br />I have read many books by Mr. King, but after a second read I think this has surpassed the Shining as my favorite.	2001-08-03

I enjoy books both reading and audio, buth this is one that I really don't think I would have finished had I been reading it.<br />My advice to anyone who wants to listen to this audio book, get the abridged version. Mr. Clancy, please, you are a great author but your books are becoming way too long.<br />In addition to this book, I have either read or listened to serveral of Mr. Clancy's other works. My favorites are &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; and &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;. My least favorite was &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, again a little long.<br />The only author I can think of in this genre to compare with Mr. Clancy is Clive Cussler. Both men write excellent action packed books and have great lead characters, Mr. Clancy had Jack Ryan and Mr. Cussler has Dirk Pitt.

In addition, this audo book utilizes some minor sound effects that gave me the sensation of listening to an old time radio program. These sound effects added greatly to the book. Some of them were things like the sound of sonar pinging, making the voices sound like they were coming over an intercom system and the computer voice of Jerry just to name a few.<br />Mr. Asner did a wonderful job with the voices.

Since I have only read two of his books, or should I say read one and listened to this one, it would be unfair of me to attemp any comparison of Mr. Archer to any other author.<br />I'm sorry Mr. Archer, but I can only give this book 3 stars. Not because I didn't like it, but it didn't get me so wound up I couldn't quit listening to it. To me 3 stars is average.<br />I say it again, Mr. Archer, you truly are a master storyteller.	2001-07-10
US	43350340	R1OU6PBR7AFH7I	0451191013	575466033	The Regulators	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Small Town Ohio vs. Power Rangers	Power Rangers gone mad is all I could think about while listening to this audio book. Maybe a cross between the Twilight Zone and some Saturday morning cartoon mutants. Richard Bachman, or should I say Stephen King was really letting his imagination go crazy on this one.<br />Small town Ohio, a hot summers day, and a malicious red van; suddenly, gun barrels come out of the windows of the van and people begin getting blown away where they stand. That's the start of it. Page after page of people being wasted. This is probably the bloodiest book Bachman/King has ever done.<br />Where did these mutants come from? Who's controlling them? Most importantly, who can stop them? To find out the answers to these questions your going to have to read the book.<br />Why did I give this book only 3 stars? Simple, just as I stated in the first paragraph. It was almost like Bachman/King was sitting in front of the TV watching Power Rangers or something with his kids and thought, &quot;Gee, if I made these guys evil, what a book I would have&quot;. It by far wasn't the worst book I've read by this author, but it wasn't the best either. Good plot, but to me it seemed obvious that it was a twist on something gotten from TV.<br />OK, OK, so TV has something to do with the plot of the book, after all this is fiction. But for a writer as great as King, he could have done better.<br />I have read many books by Mr. King and I have also read some of his Bachman books and I can't say that any of them are bad. In fact, if you read some of my other reviews for this author, you will see that Thinner is probably the only book I have rated as below average.<br />If you like Bachman/King, you will like this book; however, don't be surprised when you find the plot simplistic and predictable.	2001-07-10

I found this book to be intriguing and engrossing with a plot that explores what I feel is becoming a serious problem in this day and age, the subject of child sexual abuse and child pornography.<br />I found the character of Micky Knight to be delightful. Not what I was expecting from a hardcore detective. I was expecting her to be a hard drinking, heavy smoking, foul-mouthed type of PI. Definitley a surprise to find that she wasn't like this at all. Hardcore PI when necessary, yet, compassionate and intelligent. One thing in particular that I liked abou this book was the ability of Ms. Redmann to make the character of Micky Knight to be hardcore without the constant use of vulgar language. The few hardcore detective novels I have read in the past tend to use vulgar language to a point that almost every sentence contains some sort of explitive.<br />Ms. Redmann does an outstanding job of keeping the reader fooled throughout the book. Many times I thought that I had it all figured out only to be surprised a few pages or chapters later. Ms. Redmanns ability to describe things is also a plus. Having traveled to New Orleans on numerous occasions, I found her descriptions of the French Quarter and the West bandk areas to be very vivid and accurate.<br />Being the first book that I have read by Ms. Redmann, and not being one who reads a lot of hardcore detective stories, it would be very unfair of me to attempt to compare her to other authors. If you are looking for a detective novel that is different, but will keep you on your toes and guessing throughout, then this page turner is for you. Please don't judge it based on the grounds that the lead character is a Lesbian. I almost did and am now glad that I didn't. I plan on reading other books by Ms. Redmann.	2001-07-09
US	43350340	R2UML9YM64GRGE	0425147517	206722278	The Key to Midnight	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Dean Koontz At His Best	Mr. Koontz originally wrote this book under the pseudonym of Leigh Nichols (I didn't even know he had one). As Mr. Koontz explains at the end of the book, he spent quite a lot of time editing this book prior to re-releasing it under his name.<br />This book was definitely Koontz at his best. Though not your typical Dean Koontz plot, he did a wonderful job crossing in the the Spy Novel Genre. I read this book in one day on the beach. I found it to be wonderfully written, and I really liked the characters. I was certainly surprised to find out who was and wan not one of the bad guys. Boy did it fool me. Some of the characters I expected to be corrupt wern't and some that I expected not to be were.<br />The plot unfolds in Japan, and ends in Switzerland. Mr. Koontz does a great job of describing these locations without getting lengthy and boring yet making them colorful.<br />If you like Dean Koontz, don't leave this book off of your must read list.<br />I have read many of Mr. Koontz's novels and I rank this as one of his best.	2001-07-09
US	43350340	RRGCNGMMPT7FT	0671046845	401600096	BLOODSTREAM: A Novel of Medical Suspense	Books	3	1	1	N	N	OK Medical Thriller	Small town, Tranquility, Maine is rocked by what is happening to their teenagers. School fights, disrespect and murder are only a few of the things. Dr. Claire Elliot who moved to Tranquility is determined to find out what is causing the problem and discovers the hidden secrets of this quiet resort town. Now what can she do to help?<br />If you like medical thrillers and want an average book to read or listen to, then this is a book for you.<br />I found this book to be average as can be seen by my 3 star rating. It will grab you from the start but fails to hold on completely. It didn't have me so riveted that when I had to stop that I waited until I heard more. I was able to pop the tape and get out of the car.<br />The positive things about this book are that there are several twists and turns in the plot. Just as you think you've figured out what's going on and who the good guys and bad guys are you get surprised.<br />Jan Maxwell (narrator) did a good job with the reading; however, the images of the characters and the town weren't extemely vivid.<br />Don't let this review keep you from getting this title. If you like medical thrillers and have read other books by Ms. Gerritsen then read this book, it isn't a bad read by any sense of the imagination. However, if you haven't read anything else by Ms. Gerritsen, then allow me to recommend her book Life Support for your first.<br />Ms. Gerritse is a good author. I have only read/listened to two fo her books. However, I enjoy Robin Cook who also writes medical thrillers and have read many of his works. Though not quite as good as Mr. Cook, I would rank Ms. Gerritsen right along side of him.<br />Again, if you like medical thrillers then don't take this book off of your reading list.	2001-06-29
