It's like the authors were sitting down beside you telling you what to do.  Unlike most auto body repair books, they don't assume that you have an endless supply of cash to buy every tool known (a very important consideration for most of us).  I took it out from the library (along with many others) but this is the only one I'll be adding to my personnal library.	2004-09-29

Yes, he mentions some products by name or manufacturer but only because he thinks they are the best for the purpose being discussed.  He has restorered many cars and it is helpful to get his opinion of certain products.  Much better than some books that tell you to do your research or, worse even, that all products are about the same so it doesn't matter which you buy. <br /> <br />If you are restoring a car or even paying someone else to do it for you then get this book.  You'll learn how to do it or the right questions to ask the person you hire.	2004-09-29

Anyone with children would have to laugh all the way through.  The cliches are both hysterical and pathetic at the same time.  It really is a book with no discernable plot; rather, it is just a collection of vignettes.  I honestly believe if Disney had not made a movie of it, it would still be a rather obscure book in the USA (of course, the same can be said for the Pooh books and Mary Poppins).  I am not saying it is not an enjoyable story. It is.  But it should only be looked at as a cute, if some what violent, children's book.  It has no message and no greater meaning as some seem people to think.	2003-12-22

It is as easy to use as John Muir's book when is comes to rebuilding a VW engine.  It does not take hundreds of hours to do nor does it take thousand of dollars.  Rebuild kits with cylinders, pistons, etc are relatively cheap and, if these parts are servicable, a gasket kit and rings will be well under a hundred dollars.  I rebuilt my engine for about three hundred dollars and it runs like a charm.  It took one week to do part time; about twenty hours.  Little in the way of specialized equipment is needed.  Machining, if needed, is usually minimal and not costly.  I only have the usual range of socket wrenches and stuff and no specialized equipment.  Muir's book even tells you how to make inexpensive substitutes that work excedingly well.  Wilson's book cuts to the chase and tells yo what you need to know.  If you have an average level of mechanical ability you can do this.	2003-10-08

Rowling is back in top form and book 5 shows it.  In this book Harry Potter is reaching his teen years and becoming quite defiant in his dealings with the Dursleys.  The story is darker, scarier, more intricate and more intense than any of the others.  It is a bit long and, perhaps, could have been shorter.  As other reviewers have said, there are small bits of the story that don't seem to go any where in particular.  Still, there are two other books to be written and those parts, if Rowling it true to form, will play roles, may be even significant roles, in those books.<br />The saga continues.  This is shaping up to be one of the fineist fantisy series ever; and book 5 will, I am sure, be one of the best books of the series.	2003-07-01

Needless to say, Mr. Golding has a very negative view of people.  Perhaps his view is colored by the fact that he lived through the development and dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (atomic bombs are brought up in the book as having hit the airport from where the boy's plane departed) and the rise of Nazism in Germany.  Mr. Golding uses a group of plane wreaked boys to tell his tale of what he thinks is the natural denigration of society.  Still, I can't find his view at all consistent with the world around us.  If savagery was natural for people we would not have developed into a civilized society.  In fact, with few exceptions, all peoples form structured societies that impart rules for the welfare of the group; not the other way around as Mr. Golding would have us believe.  Except for few notable exceptions (like Nazi Germany) savagery is not natural for people.  Even there, civilized peoples prevailed.  Additionally, I believe this book has racist overtones in that Mr. Golding chooses to use the jungle motif to display his version of savagery.  Why couldn't he use another back drop?<br />Technically good writing gets the book three stars.	2003-06-25

The O'Hara's make it clear that the foreskin is the most erogenous, sensual and sensitive part of the male sex anatomy. They also make it clear that the foreskin also increases sexual pleasure in the female partner during sex. Circumcision started in this country as means to stop male sexual pleasure through masturbation. It continues as a means to control male sexual pleasure by reducing a man's sexual pleasure in all aspects of sex. It is now known that circumcision has no medical benefit. No medical organization in the world recommends routine circumcision.<br />This book lends much support to the concept that the male's foreskin is the functional homolog of the female's clitoris. Any circumcised man that thinks he is not missing out on better sex should think of what sex would be like for a woman without a clitoris. Sex for a man without a foreskin is like sex for a woman without a clitoris. The O'Hara's should be commended on broaching a subject that few would choose to take on. Their book should be required reading in every sex education and child birth class in this country.

Common sense may tell you a lot of what Dr. Shapiro presents here (like, eat more fruit and vegitables and grain products such as breads). but he has taken the leg work out of determining what foods to eat.  As he tells us, there are no bad foods.

In Texas, where this story takes place, many prisons are privately run and Camp Green Lake is no different.

This book makes it clear that routine circumcision has NO medical benefit. Because it has no medical benefit, NO medical organization in the world recommends it. For example, circumcision does not prevent urinary track infection (urinary track infections are lower in Europe where circumcision is virtually unheard of) and many studies have shown circumcision to increase the rate of HIV infection and the rate of transmitting HIV/AIDS to the female partner (UNAIDS calls using circumcision to prevent AIDS playing Russian Roulette).<br />Circumcision was started as a \\"cure\\" for masturbation. Since then it has been a procedure in search of a disease. To little attention is paid to the life long harm done to the child. For example, circumcision is now believed to be a contributing factor in male sexual dysfunction since the procedure removes highly sensitive sexual tissue and the unprotected glans becomes desensitized through a hardening of the skin in a process called keritinization.  Also, the foreskin protects the infant from infections since it keeps feces away from the urethra.  In addition, the foreskin has major immunological functions including secreting a chemical called lysozyme (an ingredient in mother's milk) that has been show to kill HIV, the virus that causes aids.  This fact alone may explain why the AIDS rate in the USA is three to twelve times higher than any western European country.<br />Routine infant circumcision not only is medically unnecessary, it is harmful.  It is only a matter of time before the procedure will be outlawed.  Until that happens this book will give parents the information they need to protect their sons from this destructive practice.	2002-02-07

Jonas lives in a society where everything is controlled by rules.  The rules were decided long ago to eliminate any individuality, any fear, any worry or anxiety.  But, as he learns when he is made the Receiver of Memories, a lot has also been lost.  There is no color, no music, no love and no pain.  However, what starts off as a great story with great potential quickly looses its thrust.  It's almost as though the author didn't know how to end the story and grabbed the first thing that came to mind.  The ending leaves the reader with many questions.  That in and of it self is not bad as long as they are thought provoking questions.  But these are not.  Rather, the reader is left asking where the rest of the story is.  This book leaves the reader flat.  There is no closure.

Milla learns compassion while Tal learns to call upon inner strengths that he never knew he had. Both Tal and Milla learn that all people are people regardless of where they were born and they learn that the only way to judge a person is as an individual rather than what group they are from. Garth Nix has written a great series that breaks the mold in several ways. Perhaps the most profound way is that he tears down traditional gender roles by having a compassionate male hero and an aggressive female hero. Today, boys have to learn that they are not weak just because they are not aggressive. Boys also have to learn that girls can be just as physically aggressive as boys. Girls have to learn that boys can be strong in many ways, not just physically and that girls can also be strong.<br />Hats off to Mr. Nix for a very well done story.

He has been able to put into writing what I, and many other men, have known but have not had an outlet to express.  That men are victims of overwhelming gender discrimination.  And, in this book, he clearly documents how it's hurting both our children and our society.  To paraphrase Harry Trumen, you can't keep one group of people in the gutter with out staying there yourself.  Gender discrimination against men has kept, and will continue to keep, all of us in the gutter until we recognize it and stop it.  Now is the time to stop it.  Let's remove the road blocks to fathers getting custody of their children, to men staying home to raise the kids, to making sure we have more male teachers at the elementry school level, to our recognition that men are equally the victims of domestic violence, etc.  My hat is off to Dr. Farrell for another excellent job well done.	2001-08-17

Both Tal and Milla have been changed by their experiences, but mostly from the experience of being with someone that was so much different from the other.  As such, Milla, even thought she had been made the Ice Carl's war chief for the attack on the castle, has become more humane, almost compassionate; and Tal, on his own with only his spirit shadow for any real help, must make decisions that will decide the fate, and even the very survival, of his people.  Both are performing deeds that will live in legends, but only if they can survive and save their worlds from the Sushin and the free shadows of Aenir.  However, a trap is laid for Tal, a trap that he is drawn to by his compassion for his family, a trap that succeeds.<br />The next book is out in November.  I know Tal can wait, but can I?	2001-08-07

Tal is forced to work with the rebel underfolk called Crow to try to find his lost father and save both the Castle and the Dark World from Susin and the evil plot he's hatching.  Milla returns to the ice and must then lead an assualt on the Castle.  Both Tal and Milla grow inside, but their worlds are coming down around them.

In this part Tal and Milla journey through the dream world of Aenir to find the Codex, a book that Tal needs to help rescue his father and save his family.  As with the previous two books, the author develops the relationship between Tal and Milla, two people that thought they had nothing in common.  Here, they realize that, in fact, they are more alike than they are different.  The experiences that they have had together have made them both realize that they can never go back to their former way of life, Tal as a Choosen of the castle and Milla as an Ice Carl girl in the dark frozen world outside the castle.  Nix's character development is superb.  However, the descriptive narrative is limited, I think, in part due to the age group the book is targeted to (9-12).  I think he under estimates his audience in this regard.  In spite of that, the book is well written and my 10 year old son can not wait for the fourth book to be published.  If fact, neither can I.	2001-02-22

However, once I got past my initial impressions and settled into the book, I was quite impressed.  Carr is a versitile writer; make no mistake about that.  I think that some of the negative reviews are from people who can't adapt their expectations of an author.  That's to bad because Carr's latest is as good as his previous work.  I couldn't put down this book and stayed up late (much latter than I should have) reading it.  Not many books make me do that.  If you like Carr, I think you'll like this one also.	2000-11-19

It's interesting, after looking through this book, to see just how far some artists have deviated from Tolkiens ideas (not that that's necessarily bad).

In the last book, The Fall, Tal is hurled away form the castle to be found by Icecarls, a nomadic people that follow animal migrations for survival.  Milla, an Icecarl girl, is ordered to help Tal get back to the castle and, in return, get a new sunstone for her clan's iceship.  In this book Tal and Milla get back to the castle only to find that Tal's family is on the wrong side of a political power play.  Tal's father disappeared in the first book and now his younger brother appears to have been kidnapped.  With his mother ill and his sister forced to live with a couple of very nasty relatives, Tal turns to his eccentric Great-Uncle Ebbitt for help.  After many narrow escapes, Tal and Milla enter the spirit word of the Chosen, of which Tal's family are members, in order to find a book that may help them solve the mystery of Tal's father's disappearance.<br />In the first book Nix tears down traditional gender roles.  He continues to do that in this book while at the same time rounding out the major characters personalities.  We begin to see more sides of both Tal and, especially, Milla.  In this book Nix also starts to address the cultural arrogance that both Tal and Milla have learned from their societies.  I think Nix has a great way of addressing some of the major social concerns of today's society in an a manner that's easily digestible for the intended age group for this book.  He does so with an intriguing and well written story.  I think that the book (and series) will appeal to both boys and girls since the both heros play an equal role in the story and both are dependent on the other equally for survival.  If fact, at the end of this book both Tal and Milla realize just that.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It's enlightening and it's a terrific fantasy.	2000-09-29

About 20 Years ago a book was published entitled \\"No Money Down.\\"  It told how to get rich investing in real estate.  Sequels were written  and seminars were held.  But, did the book change the financial standing of  people that read the book?  For the vast majority the answer was a  resounding no.  Did people get in to financial trouble following the advice  in the book?  I bet some did.  Mr. Kiyoski's book is another in the long  line of get rich books that tell you some of the basic overlying principles  of acquiring financial freedom.  In my opinion, however, better investment  guides abound.  Do a search here at Amazon to uncover quite a few.  Any  book by Peter Lynch or the Motley Fool books are good examples.  It's not  that Mr. Kiyoski's book is a bad book.  It's that I think there are much  better investment books to be had.  It also seems that Mr.Kiyoski tells people who attend his seminars to go to Amazon.com and vote against reviews that aren't favorable to his book.	2000-08-08

I took the book out of the library (as a previous reviewer suggested).  There are many how-to-get-rich books in print.

It isn't a  comprehensive investment guide.  It's a couple of good ideas immersed in a  great deal of motivation.  Motivation is great, but hard facts are what's  needed to keep you going after the motivation wears off.  This book is  scant on them.  If you need something to get you going, then great, this is  the book for you.

Too many authors have jumped on the `Let's blame the males' bandwagon with little research to back up their claims.  Now that bandwagon is targeting our sons in schools. Ms. Sommers takes a fresh look at sexism in schools.   She finds that boys are also the victims of sexism.  This comes as no  surprise to the millions of boys in school that are constantly facing  harsher discipline than girls do for the same transgressions.  It also  comes as no surprise to boys since, in many classes, boys start several  pegs lower than girls because, as I have heard many teachers state, `Girls  are just smarter, that's all'.  People bury their heads in the sand about  sexism towards boys in our schools.  But they are hurting half of our  school population and, ultimately, our entire society.  It seems sad that  the so-called reformers of education have to pick their fights with our  children.  School should be a place where everyone gets the same  opportunities, not a place where feminists can take out their repressed  hatred of males on our sons.	2000-07-10

The book is not beholden to the stereotypes of male strength and violence and  female compassion, as one typically finds.  Rather, both genders portray a  complete range of personalities; from the compassionate male hero to the  violent girl (Milla) that wants to kill Tal but resists out of loyalty to  her clan and because she gave her word to her clan's (female) leader.  The  story line itself is interesting and shows no inconsistencies that leave  the reader wondering if the book was ever edited.  This the first book in a  total of six in the series.  My only complaint is that this book is not a  complete story in and of itself as are the Harry Potter books or Ursula Le  Guin's Earthsea series.  It leaves the reader hanging at the end with no  idea of when part two will be written.  But that is a minor complaint and  inspite of that I highly recommend it.  In todays world it's important that  boys have compassionate male heros and understand that females can be just  as violent as males.  Likewise, girls have to understand that boys aren't  weak just because they aren't physical and that girls can be strong both  physically and mentally.  Of course, the book also has it's share of  underhanded people (both male and female) along with the snobs, the cheats,  the genius teetering on the edge of insanity and plenty of fantasy  creatures to round it out.  In short, as far as the characters go, the book  is an accurate portrayal of life.  And the story is a wonderful fantasy.	2000-06-12

No amount of research  presented in the book would hold back the negative comments and criticisms.  It that regard, it's unfortunate that people praise this book.  It shows  that bigotry is still alive and well in the world, if you target the right  group: men.  Mr. Montagu's book is a case of supporting a preconceived idea  (the superiority of women) with selected research and biased  interpretations.  I know a great deal of people.  I find that women are not  any more or any less compassionate, loving, intelligent, unselfish or  anything else, then men.  It's unfortunate that a distinguished researcher  like Dr. Montagu published such an unscientific book.  It's even more  unfortunate that people will use this book, even subtly, to drive a wedge  between male and female relations.

Dr. Bigelow is able to succinctly reveal why circumcision is a hoax perpetuated on the American people.  He also tells why the foreskin is an important, functional part of male anatomy.  What sets this book apart,  however, are the personal comments throughout it that really show how men  in this country have been victimized by the medical profession and society.   It's time to save our sons from the same abuse that the majority of  American Men have endured.  Our sons deserve to grow up intact just as much  as our daughters do.  There is no medical reason for circumcision.  America  is the only industrialized nation that still routinely circumcises, yet  just about every aliment attributed to having a foreskin is lower or no  higher in all of the industrialized countries that don't circumcise.  For  example, America has one of the highest HIV rates in the industrialized  world.  Circumcision has done nothing to stem the tide of HIV infection in  this country.  In fact, some studies show that circumcised men are at  greater risk of contracting HIV.  And, since the circumcised penis becomes  keratinized and rough, it's probable that they are at greater risk for  infecting others.<br />Dr. Bigelow's book is wonderful both in its factual  documentation of circumcision and in its personalization of the horror of  circumcision.  It's a must read for every man that has been circumcised, to  realize what he's lost, and for every man that has not been circumcised, to  realize how lucky he is.  It is also a must read for women.  It will help  them to understand the hurt that most men in this country have suffered at  the hands of the medical establishment and society.  It will also help them  to realize how lucky they are if they are fortunate enough to have an  uncircumcised lover.  Just a thought; the crime rate in this country  increased almost lock-step with the circumcision rate.  Now the  circumcision rate is going down and so is the crime rate.  I wonder if it's  justa coincidence, or if crime is some how related to the violence most  males experience just after birth.	2000-06-05

I started this book with high expectations and perhaps that's part of the reason that I didn't find it as enjoyable or profound as I had hoped.  Bradbury paints the future of Earth and humankind as bleak.  For example,  every human in it seems to have a Redneck persona.  The few that don't are  examples of genius gone mad.  The Martians aren't presented as being any  more sophisticated.  The only real difference between them and Earth people  is that they have telepathic powers.  I realize that I'm reading this book  50+ years after the first publication, and perhaps Bradbury really had this  pessimistic outlook on mankind, but it's hard to believe, as Bradbury wants  us to do, that a people could achieve travel to Mars if everyone in that  world acted like they're out of a poorly scripted Western.  For example,  one would assume that the first ships to Mars would have only the brightest  and best trained astronauts on board, but those ships are manned by  astronauts that act like a bunch of squabbling kids at camp with guns  added.  In short, lots of major points in this book just don't make  sense.<br />The book is extremely sexist.  Nearly every single male (Earthling  or Martian) is either stupid, gullible, easy to anger or ready to kill.   With only one exception (the old man in The Martian) the only ones that  show any compassion are crazed lunatics (also doing killing).  All of the  Women are presented as docile, subservient and nonviolent (lets get real).   Even<br />assuming that Bradbury was writing the book as a warning as to what  the world may become and how we may ultimately destroy ourselves, a more  realistic range of personalities would have made the book more believable  and, therefore, more effective.<br />With that said, there are several stories  in the book that are very well done in their own right.  They were released  as short stories before inclusion into the book showing that they can stand  on their own.  Usher II is definitely the highlight of the book.  Another  is, There Will Come Soft Rains.<br />I gave the book three stars because, in  spite of my objections, I think the book is readable and does have an  important message.	2000-05-28

In this regard, this book helps to fill in information that's hard to come by otherwise.  However, it drops the reader there.

At 200+ pages you would think that the author could tell you everything you wanted to know about circumcision, but I found myself wishing he had written more.  Because of Mr. Gollaher's writing I found myself fascinated by a subject that does not easily lend itself to fascination.  By keeping  to the facts, Mr. Gollaher is able to write a scathing rebuke of  circumcision as America's cultural ritual, a ritual not unlike those  practiced by 'primative' peoples.  Mr. Gollaher strips away any medical  justification for circumcision leaving it, as some claim, a form of  legalized criminal assult on newborn babies.  After reading his book, one  cannot continue to belittle male circumcision as a poor cousin to female  circumcision.  In fact, I hope that Mr. Gollaher's book will be one of the  driving forces that make non-medically justified male circumcision illegal  in this country, just as female circumcision is illegal.  Every prospective  parent and every doctor should read this book.  If education is the key to  ending circumcision, then this book is a gigantic step in the right  direction.	2000-05-02

Would  the authors also propose that men also hide money from their wives?  Would  the authors argue that there are other areas in a relationship where one  spouse should lie to the other?  Relationships can be hard enough to build  without an instruction book on how to take them apart.  The authors should  be ashamed of themselves.	2000-02-11
