I once told a friend that the reason I keep reading Ms. Slaughter's books was that I wanted to see how ridiculous each one was.  In that respect, this was a disappointment.  It was actually the best-written book in the \\"Grant County\\" series, and that's not saying much.    This book has its share of problems.  First, the situation regarding Jeffrey's health issue.  This hung over the story only to be resolved half way through the book with a simple two-word sentence.  After that, it was referred to once and only briefly.  I'm not exactly clear as to why this was even in the book (oh, yeah, Jeffrey once cheated on Sara - \\"Faithless\\" - very clever.)    Next, it is obvious to me the Slaughter really dislikes her own characters.  There is nothing remotely likeable about any of them, and she seems to have a truly distasteful, offensive hatred toward all of her female characters.  If you're a female character in a Karin Slaughter book, rest assured she will find a horrible, disgusting way to brutalize you.    Then there is the character of Lena.  To say that this character is a downer is putting it mildly.  She is without a doubt the most depressing, gloomy, pathetic character I have ever read in any book.  I have no interest in her as a character anymore.  She needs to go.    Lastly, what was with the Heart references?  Did the Wilson sisters pay Slaughter for a mention in the book?  True to form, Slaughter even found a way to insult Ann Wilson.    Wow, can't wait for the next one...	2005-10-10

I noticed this book at a major retailer and having never heard of the author, decided to get it out of the library. I found it to be quite enjoyable to read, reminding me slightly of Ann B. Ross's \\"Miss Julia\\" series of books.  I did not find it as funny as those books (although it's possible I was not supposed to) but it was a wonderful portrayal of fine southern ladies and friendship, and the lengths people will go to to protect someone they love.  A four star recommendation for this one.	2005-10-03

Usually I end up being pleasently surprised.  This was not one of those times.  I'm a little confused by all the great reviews this book has received.  If you believe the message of this book (find a man to have great sex with and in doing so you will find true love and happiness) than this is the book for you.  Romance readers will love this one, I guess.	2005-09-21

Well written and suspenseful.  It kept me guessing all the way through it.  We even see a little bit more of the personal side of Jane Rizzoli, something that I think may have been lacking in the last two books.  I did think that this was a pretty quick read, but still highly recommend it.	2005-09-19

I found the story interesting, compelling and plausible, up until Royall meets the \\"Woman in Black\\" in the cemetery.  I felt the author made fools out of her readers with this scene.  It's as if she could not find a way to reconnect Dirk and what happened to him to his family, and chose to come up with what I believe is a completely unrealistic way (in what was otherwise a very realistic story) in which to do it. As I was reading this portion of the book, my only response to it was \\"WHAT?!?\\"  Or, maybe she decided she had to throw some sex back into the book since there hadn't been any in a while.  I'm not sure, but it completely soured me on the rest of the book.      I felt the book's ending a bit unsatisfactory - far to many questions left unanswered.  This was my second book by this author and might just be my last.	2005-09-16

This is a seriously flawed book loaded with stupid and/or clichd characters.  Susan is truly one of the stupidest characters I've read in a long time.  I have a hard time liking a character who would not punish her daughter for getting drunk, sleep with her soon-to-be ex (after finding him in bed with another women) and smoke pot with a guy she hardly knows (who eventually manipulates her into bed while managing to get her into the Victoria's Secret corset and thong he just \\"happened\\" to buy for her!?!)  I read one review that found this scene funny.  To me, it was sad and pathetic. <br /> <br />I found some chapters that did not flow right at all.  One moment, characters are in one place and then all of a sudden in another place with absolutely no explanation as to how.  This book definitely needed a better editor. <br /> <br />And, isn't it convenient that Susan decides she wants to write for the newspaper and, lo and behold, don't they just happen to want to hire her.  I could go on and on, but do not want to waste time, unlike this book, which is a complete waste of time. <br />	2005-08-26

There is really not much else I can add to the other reviews of this book, except to say that I really enjoyed it.  It was not what I expected at all (for some reason I thought I was about three women.) <br /> <br />One thing I did want to mention was the telling of the story in three parts.  I enjoyed the first two parts quite a bit.  That's not to say I did not like the third part.  In fact I liked it a great deal.  I do not, however, feel that it was necessary.  I think the book could have ended with the second part and I would have been quite satisfied with it's completion.  It seemed to me that the third part could of (perhaps should of) been a book on it's own.  Regardless, It was still a wonderful book that I highly recommend.	2005-08-08

I genuinely liked the characters and thought the story, while some of it a bit far-fetched, was wonderful...up until what happened to Thor was revealed.  At that point I really thought the book took a bizarre twist.  It was as if another book had been written and a portion of that book was inserted into this one.  Once I got past that, the book became enjoyable again.  I have given it a 4 star recommendation a bit reluctantly.  It's more like a 3 1/2 star book for me.	2005-08-02

This was one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. <br /> <br />Arthur Henning is a character that I think will stay with me for a long time.  His loneliness is overwhelming.  I believe his love for Aggie represents to him all that he once had before the war and her child represents all that he lost since. <br /> <br />I thought the way Brown kept going back to the Dr. Ornstein character was quite compelling.  That was what seemed to be the single most life altering moment for Arthur.   The loss of his wife and daughter, Toby leaving, his unrequited love for Aggie - these were almost inevitable for Arthur based on what happened to Dr. Ornstein.  Brown's ability to go from the present to the past all in the same paragraph was excellent and did not detract from the story in any way.  Her portrayal of the Duvall's and Mrs. MacCauley were excellent, although I would have liked to know more about what made the Duvall's the way they were.  Still, this is a wonderful book that I highly recommend.  I look forward to reading Ms. Browns other books. <br /> <br />	2005-07-19

I came across the \\"Miss Julia\\" series of books a few months ago and have recently read all of them. I have just completed \\"Miss Julia's School of Beauty\\" and while I enjoyed it, it was not as good as the previous books.  The ending of this book seemed to wrap things up a little to quickly and neatly.  In fact, considering how the story ended, I was left wondering why this hadn't taken place pages earlier. <br /> <br />Having said that, this was still an entertaining book to read and a good addition to the series.  I would recommend this series to all those who have gotten a little tired of Janet Evanovich's \\"Stephanie Plum\\" series of books.  A four star recommendation for this one. <br />	2005-07-14

Blunt has created interesting, realistic characters in Cardinal and Delorme.  His descriptions are wonderfully written without being overwhelming in detail.    The story flowed very well.  This is not a \\"who done it\\" type of mystery. The story revolves more around who the characters are, why they do what they do, and how the mystery is solved.

The main reason being that for what this book is, it's okay. Not good, not bad, just okay. <br /> <br />There is always going to be a core fan base for this series of books, regardless of whether the books are good or not.  Personally, I found this to be more of the same ole, same ole. I think I laughed once while reading this (which is less than I laughed while reading the last book, and I gave that a one star rating.)  I'm sure most readers probably love the \\"sexual tension\\" in this one, but for me, I found it annoying, bordering on boring.  The characters are the same, the story is the same, the laughs are the same, but if that's what Evanovich thinks appeals to the fans, and it appears as though she does, more power to her. <br />	2005-06-30

I found the characters to be very real and believable.

He did not bog it down with a lot of unnecessary description. Instead he told you just enough to put you in the moment. <br /> <br />I felt a connection to Patty. Her struggles were very real to me.  I could sympathize with her situation.  She even annoyed me at times as well.  I found her love for Tommy and her loyalty to her relationship with him touching and admirable.  She is determined to make it through this because she genuinely loves this man.  I like the fact that Tommy's prison life was not a central part of the story.  If it had been, it would have totally detracted from what is essentially Patty's story. <br /> <br />O'Nan could have easily written this book another way (i.e. Patty meets and falls in love with another man, Casey becomes a troubled teen, etc.)  I think a lot of lesser authors would have done just that.  Thankfully, instead of going the \\"romance\\" route, he has written a wonderful story of love, determination and perseverance.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-24

This was one of those books.  I immediately liked the character of Geneva.  She is a Diva (which she admits), but also a warm, lovable person with a heart of gold. <br /> <br />The story itself could have been written like any other \\"chick-lit\\" book, but the uniqueness of Geneva and her successful Broadway career interspersed with the \\"Great Mysterious\\" really separated this book from those others.  I enjoyed reading about Geneva taking care of Rich and connecting with him and the people in his life.  The other characters were very well written, and yes, a little clichd (philandering boyfriend/fianc Trevor and too-good-to-be-true James, for example.) <br /> <br />If I have any criticism of the book, it was with Rich's dialog.  Some of it did not seem like it would come from a 13 year old, let alone one with Downs Syndrome.  But this is only a minor flaw in a truly enjoyable book.  A four star recommendation for this one. <br /> <br />	2005-06-17
US	50914631	RKNNEO26VEYHR	0446533041	975506815	Good Grief	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Excellent book	This \\"Chick-Lit\\" book is anything but.  It is an excellent story about living with grief and attempting to get on with life. <br /> <br />This is a story told with humor and honesty. I was wary at first, thinking this was going to be just another book about a woman who eventually finds happiness again only because the perfect man enters her life.  While Sophie Stanton does meet and begin a relationship with a new man, that isn't the central focus of the story. In fact there is so much more going on by the time the story ends that many aspects of her life, including this new relationship, are left unresolved. <br /> <br />I agree with the reviewer who mentioned the campiness of some of the scenes in the book, including the date with the married Grief Group member and the opening of the Bakery fiasco.  Those things were little to slapstick for what is otherwise a very well written book.  I also have a bit of a concern with the way that Marion's Alzheimer's was written into the book.  One day she's fine, and the next, she's in the advanced stages of the disease.  These are minor problems, however.  I look forward to the author's next book. <br />	2005-06-14

It is written in such a way that the reader is kept guessing as to what is actually happening.  Great characters in Bobby Dodge and Catherine Gagnon, Catherine being the more complex of the two.  It's hard to know what to feel about her. Sympathy? Dislike? In the end, maybe a bit of both.  It would nice to see Bobby continue on in another book.  I think there's more about him to be explored.  A very enjoyable mystery. <br /> <br />	2005-06-06

I had it on hold at the library for several weeks and was anticipating reading it.  I couldn't have been more disappointed. In fact, I gave up half way through the book.  I have never been more bored reading a book before. It was literally putting me to sleep.    As with McEwan's last book, ATONEMENT, I had trouble getting through the first 100 pages, but at least with that book, the story eventually became interesting and I came away from it quite satisfied.  SATURDAY on the other hand is nothing more than a pompously written book that plodded along with intellectual drivel.  Based on the positive reviews this book has been getting, I can see I'm in the minority, but life's to short to waste time on over-intellectualized babble.	2005-06-02

No intricate plot twists or suspenseful intrigue, just a slice of life story of the Novak family and the small Pennsylvania mining town that defines them.  Both the characters and the town are described superbly.  The author's ability to make these characters come to life is amazing.  I was able to get a great sense of each family member' fears, hopes and desires.  I truly enjoyed the author's writing style as I did in her previous novel, MRS.

Her attention to detail and her experience as an assistant state attorney have helped her craft and amazingly intricate and suspenseful second novel.  As with the previous reviewer, I agree that it is essential to read RETRIBUTION before tackling this one. <br /> <br />LAST WITNESS is one of those books that require you to pay attention. So much is going on that it is impossible to skip over passages without loosing the flow of the story.  Hoffman has created excellent characters in C.J. Townsend and Dominick Falconetti.  She has written intelligent, likable, 3-dimensional characters that make you believe they really exist.  The book is not bogged down with their romantic relationship.  Instead it lies below the surface, never drawing the reader away from the main focus of the story.  It has a suburb ending that sets the stage for the next book.  I highly recommend this excellent novel. <br />	2005-05-17

I have enjoyed reading them and found this, in terms of the mystery, to be one of the best so far.  Crombie writes well thought out, intricate stories, and this when left me guessing until the end.  My 4 star rating is due to the fact that Kincaid really seems to be more of a side character here.

The author has written this book in such a way that I could feel the pain and desperation of Thomas and his sister as they try to remain as some sort of semblance as a family.

This one is definitely a miss.  He has essentially written pretty much the same story he's written before, modifying it just enough to make it seem different from previous books.  And, I confess, it's always bothered me a bit that because he's a male, his books are labeled  \\"Fiction\\" instead of \\"Romance\\".      I had a problem with the character of Jeremy from the beginning.  I didn't dislike him, but couldn't quite figure out what Lexie's initial attraction to him was. Was it his good looks?  I guess so.  Sparks wrote him as being both a traditional guy wanting a family and a nightclubbing womanizer.  It seemed too much of a contradiction for me.  I liked Lexie much more (although I found the name Lexie a bit annoying.) However, I couldn't reconcile her wanting to remain in this small North Carolina town with wondering why she couldn't find an intellectually stimulating man there.     There was also far too much interpersonal dialog going on. Pages of both Jeremy and Lexie reflecting on their past relationships, current situations, their attraction too each other and on and on.  It made for a very boring read at times.  And the cottage by the water was just another clich I've already read in numerous other books.    I would have like to have read more about the side characters. Lots of lost opportunities there. The solving of the mystery was very anti-climatic.  By the time it was revealed, I honestly didn't care.  As for the ending, no big surprise there, either.  I suppose if you are a fan of this author, you will enjoy this book quite a bit, but I could not recommend this one to someone not already familiar with the authors' previous books.	2005-05-04

I was taken with it after the first 40 pages.  I felt a connection with each of the wives.  In the beginning, you wonder why these women fell for this man. But as you read it starts to make sense. These are three damaged women who needed the kind of attention this man was willing to provide to them...at first.  I liked the way the author wove the story of Charlie into the book as well.

This one was no exception.  It was nice to read a book were the main characters were not in their mid thirties, but older with some life experience.  Julie, Lucy and Maria were very interesting, realistic, well written characters.  Even though I had pretty much figured out what happened half way through the book, it was interesting seeing how the story unfolded.  If I have one complaint with the book, it was with the way the character of Shannon was written.  Teenage girls written as selfish, brainless idiots in books have always been one of my major pet peeves.  I wish she could have been written as a little bit more sympathetic.

The main problem I have with it is that there are pages and pages of absolutely nothing happening.  This book could have been shortened by about 80 pages.  Mary Crow is an interesting character, but really doesn't do anything until the last 40 pages of the book.  Her relationship with Jonathan is nothing more than an afterthought. The most interesting characters in the story are the two little girls who figure out what's going on before anyone else does, and they began to annoy me after awhile.

However, \\"Sympathy Between Humans\\" is merely okay.  It has some problems that I couldn't get past.  Sarah Pribek is a police detective who seems to have no current sense of right and wrong.  She's totally willing to protect her friend and former partner Genevieve, yet completely writes off her husband Shiloh.  Her superior asks her to look into rumors of an individual practicing medicine without a license.  When she locates this person, instead of arresting him, she goes to him for treatment (since she has a fear of going to the doctor which was never really explained) and immediately begins a sexual relationship with him.  Her involvement with the Hennessy family was far-fetched.  The part when Sarah opens up a bottle of wine and gives some to the 17 year old Marlinchen in hopes that it will loosen her up so that she will feel freer to talk had me laughing out loud in disbelief.  I do believe Sarah Pribek is an interesting character and that Compton has the ability to write a suspenseful and intriguing series of books.  I hope she pulls it together with the next one.	2005-03-02
US	50914631	R2JVG3UGPH0SJ	0743454545	573739483	Vanishing Acts (Wsp Readers Club)	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Picoult fans should enjoy this, but...	It is with a bit of reluctance that I give this book a 4 star review.  It's a bit of a let down after the wonderful \\"My Sister's Keeper\\".  While I found it interesting and it did keep me guessing, in the end I was left a little confused and felt as if something had been left out.  Picoult is a wonderful writer and obviously does meticulous research, but it just didn't quite cut it this time out.  One of the problems I had with this book was the whole Delia/Eric/Fitz relationship.  It just didn't ring true and I found it very reminiscent of the Nina/Caleb/Patrick relationship in Picoult's \\"Perfect Match\\".  Just who does Delia love? Eric? Fitz? Both of them?  I'm not even sure the character of Fitz was necessary to this story.  Also, it seems as if there should have been more to Delia's Search and Rescue aspect of the book.  I did, however, find Picoult's truly gritty portrayal of Andrew's time in jail and the rituals and customs of the Hopi tribe incredibly well written and interesting. If you are a fan of Picoult's books, you will probably enjoy this book a great deal. If you have never read her books before, start with \\"Keeping Faith\\" or \\"My Sister's Keeper\\".	2005-03-01
US	50914631	R26OJNJZVL2K3A	0679771476	887180857	The Law of Similars	Books	4	4	4	N	N	4 star review	I enjoyed this book a great deal, even though I had some problems with the character of Leland, who seemed both admirable and reprehensible at the same time.  He reminded me a bit of Lester in \\"House of Sand and Fog.\\"  Both are men who seem completely willing to give up everything to protect a woman they've known for an extremely short period of time.  Why Leland, a prosecuting attorney would be willing to break the law, thus risking his career, reputation and most importantly, his daughter, to protect Carissa seemed a bit far-fetched to me.  Had they known each other longer, maybe I could understand it.  I did find the father/daughter relationship between Leland and Abby quite believable and the book did peak my interest in Homeopathy.  Also, the story ended they only way I would have wanted it too. A four star recommendation for this one.	2005-01-21

At least she was an honest and sympathetic character.  Maggie and Rose were total clichs and I intensely disliked both of them.  I have always understood that when I read a book, I must suspend disbelief at times, but this is ridiculous. Rose is one of the stupidest characters I've read in a book in a long time. Sister or not, if someone is living off of you rent free and stealing from you as well, throw them out!! Am I honestly supposed to believe that Maggie, a dyslexic who could not handle reading a teleprompter, is hanging out a Princeton, reading Great Expectations and Romeo and Juliet? Oh, and Maggie and Jim having sex - who didn't see that from a mile down the road? Also, I could understand Rose's changing of careers if the author had made a point of suggesting Rose was disgruntled with her job as a lawyer, but no such indication was ever given.  This book totally insults the intelligence of its readers. A waste of paper.	2004-12-15

I absolutely fell in love with the people of Lost River. They made me wish that people like that existed everywhere. Yes, everything is tied up very neatly in the end, but so what? I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. Five stars for this one!!	2004-11-16

I've often found that the books I like the most are those that don't necessarily have a \\"plot\\". They're simply great character studies, and that is certainly what this book is.  I found myself really rooting for Miles, even though, because of his situation, the odds were against him.  All of the other characters seemed genuinely real to me.  There are many towns like Empire Falls where you can find people just like the characters in this book.  This was my first Richard Russo book, but certainly not the last. Five stars for this one.	2004-10-27

Like so many books that I've read recently, I had a difficult time getting into this one. I found the first 100 pages or so to be quite unnecessarily drawn out. I struggled to get through many of the long descriptions and almost gave up until the incident in the library. That, for me, is when the story picked up and began to flow.  I enjoyed the rest of the book immensely. Robbie's experiences in France and Briony's experiences as a nurse were written in such a way that I could see myself there with them. The ending was beautifully written.  Four out of five stars from me, only because of the first 100 pages.	2004-10-20

It started out incredibly slow for me and I was getting a little frustrated with it.  The main reason I purchased this book was because it was described to me as a murder mystery. However, the murder doesn't take place until half way through this 800 plus page book. Also, had I known about the child molestation in the book, I probably would not have purchased it. Having said that, I'm glad I did continue with it. The story was fascinating and very well told.  Even the seemingly endless descriptions were beautifully written. If you're willing to be patient and let the story unfold, you will find this a very entertaining read.	2004-10-15

Perhaps I was looking for another \\"No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\", but this book does not have the charm that the \\"No. 1 Ladies\\" series has.  Part of the problem may be that I'm not that well read a person, because many of the references in this book went right over my head, and I found that I was forcing myself to just get through many of the chapters. The mystery in this book was not that interesting and it's conclusion uneventful.  Having said all that, I did like Isabel, Jamie, Cat and Grace and McCall Smith does a wonderful job describing Edinburgh.  Therefore, I can see the potential for a very interesting series of books in the future. Let's hope the next one is better. I will certainly give it a try.	2004-10-04

I've known the worry, fear and frustrations of having to deal with a sick parent and could relate to many of the feelings Jeanne was experiencing. A beautifully written book, full of humor and sadness. I would recommend this book to all, regardless of whether they have had to deal with a sick parent or not.	2004-09-29

I was not dissappointed. The book started out a little slow for me, but quickly picked up speed. In fact, it was almost impossible for me to put the book down while reading the last 100 pages. The story itself was interesting and somewhat unnerving. Mick Callahan is a great character. Extremely flawed but very likable. Hopefully, we will find out more about him in future books.	2004-09-21

The final scene on the boat involving David was a little far fetched, and I would have liked to have known more about the characters of Cardoza and Geary, but there was enough suspense in the book to keep me interested until the end. A nice, intriguing book to read.	2004-09-18

There were a lot of different twists and turns in it to keep me guessing throughout. I do agree with the previous reviewer about the spelling and grammatical errors. There were quite a few of them. I haven't seen that many errors in a book in a long time. For that reason it gets four out of five stars from me. However, it was still a very entertaining book to read.	2004-09-14

It just didn't touch me on an emotional level the way \\"Suzanne's Diary\\" did. What it did do was leave me with some questions, however. What exactly was the purpose of these letters anyway? And why were they written in letter form? Why not as a diary? Why write them and never mail them. And wasn't Brenden just a little to good to be true? I'm not much of a \\"romance\\" reader, but it seems that whenever I have read a romance, it almost always takes place at a lake or in a remote cabin near some body of water. Quite the clich and a bit boring. By the time I got to the end I felt nothing. A bit disappointing, since I normally like Patterson's books. But if you looking for a quick way to waste an afternoon, this might be for you.	2004-09-09

The first half of the book had me  slightly frustrated and wondering exactly where it was headed. It was the second half of the book that really caught my attention and grabbed a hold of me. In fact I read the last 150 pages in one sitting.  It's only for that reason that I give the book four stars instead of five. If you can be patient and let the book unfold, you'll find it a pretty satisfying read.	2004-09-07

I've always been fond of books that had characters that I could relate to and feel a connection with. All the characters in this book seemed very authentic to me.  I felt the pain of each one of them, especially Ethan. I could honestly see this happening to anybody, and indeed, have heard about these same types of situations happening in real life. I hope to read more from this very talented author.	2004-09-03

A completely implausible plot with dull characters. I had the murderer pegged the moment he entered the story. And what is with these female authors who portray teenage girls like they're complete morons. I can't tell you the number of books I've read with a teenage girl who is essentially good at heart, but doesn't she just have to fall for the \\"bad boy\\" her usually single/widowed parent doesn't like? And while we're at it let's have her have sex with him (yawn). Also, I cannot figure out the presence of Willa in this story. Other than being a somewhat boring love interest, she served absolutely no purpose. I think I should learn to avoid these TV \\"Book Club\\" books. More often than not they're complete disappointments.	2004-08-15

However for some reason it just didn't seem appealing to me. I would see it on display in bookstores and pass right by it. Then a friend told me how much she loved the book and insisted that I read it. So, I checked it out of the library (thankfully) instead of purchasing it. I genuinely do not understand why this book is the success that it is. The first chapter smacks you in the face and then the rest of the book simply falls apart. I found that most of the characters were either underdeveloped or unrealistic. In fact the only character that seemed realistic in any way to me was Buckley. The Mother was particularly bothersome to me. I simply cannot believe that any mother would tell her child she wanted to be more than a mother, leave the family for several years and than upon her return, have her husband completely accept her back into the family. Like many other reviewers of this book, I too was confused by the sex between Susie/Ruth and Ray. The thing that bothered me the most about this scene was the fact that this girl who had been raped would find it acceptable to &quot;use&quot; another woman's body to have sex. I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1, only because I did appreciate the premise of the book and how the author did get my attention in the beginning.	2004-08-04

Oddly enough very early on in the book I remember thinking \\"Why would Kinsey take this stupid job?\\"  Apparently it's because Sue Grafton is running out of ideas. Kinsey truly is a minor character here (as she herself admits to being).  She does very little actual investigating and at times, Reba seems to be the better investigator!  Also, the relationship with Cheney never comes across as being anything special here. Let's see, they go to dinner, and then have sex, they talk about Reba, and then have sex, they talk about the Fed's case against Beck, and then have sex.  There's not really a whole lot to this relationship otherwise.  One thing that truly bothers me is how Kinsey does not seem to have any common sense here. For example, at one point she's thinking about her relationship with Cheney and says how she wishes she had a girlfriend to talk to at that point. So what does she do? Instead of calling Vera, the friend she's had for years, who has also already made an appearance in this book, she calls Reba, the ex-con she's only known for two days. Let's not forget the seemingly endless descriptions and whole chapters that are nothing but filler (case in point, the chapter with Vera.)  I really thought H and N were bad and this one ranks right with them.	2004-07-18

It was a short, quick read that ended far too abruptly. I think I'm simply getting tired of this series. The Stephanie Plum character is loosing her charm for me. She does not seem to grow in any way and doesn't seem to want to. My main problem with this character is her indecisiveness. Joe or Ranger? Make a decision already! Actually, I think the decision is obvious. Does she really think there is a future with Ranger? I must admit, I am probably the only female that reads this series of books that is not that fond of the Ranger character as a romantic interest. Yes, he's \\"mysterious and sexy\\", that's all well and good, but what woman would want to seriously become involved with a man who seemingly has no interaction with his only child?  I will admit, I never get tired of Lula and Grandma Mazur. Those characters are always a lot of fun and they provided a few laughs. It's just not enough to keep me interested anymore.	2004-07-08

I really enjoyed A through G, but H is a real disappointment. I simply do not like Kinsey in this one. She comes across as a bit stupid here. I'm surprised at her willingness to break the law. For example, she hits the female cop since this will get her arrested and she'll be able to stay close to Bibianna. What?! Or how about when she's with Raymond looking for potential accidents and she VOLUNTEERS to drive at one point. Then when she causes her first accident she feels a &quot;thrill.&quot; Who is this person? What I really found ridiculous was the chapter with Dolan and Santos filling Kinsey in on what's going on and what they want her to do, and then low and behold, she inexplicably gets bailed out before she's supposed to. I hope the next books in this series that I read are a whole lot better.	2004-03-19
