Books	5	0	0	N	N	Can I Get Away with Slapping a Character	M Bridges debut novel, Are You Satisfied Yet, is a dramatic tale that will pull you in after reading the first chapter. The story is about Betty Jean Carlson and the mess she puts up  <br />with--meaning her man, Ezekiel Johnson. Ezekiel is fine and he knows it. He couldn't commit to one woman if his life depended on it. Although he claims to love Betty Jean, he continues to cheat on her. His latest conquest is Carla Jeffries. Carla knows she's the other woman, but doesn't care and finds herself in hot water.  It's obvious that Ezekiel has issues, but Betty Jean takes it upon herself to forgive him time after time. When is enough, enough?  <br /> <br />The author does a great job of showing not only Betty Jean's side of the story, but she delves into the other woman's (Carla) story. Are You Satisfied Yet is not lacking in drama. For a first time novel, M. Bridges did a great job.  <br /> <br />There are times you will want to slap Betty Jean, Ezekiel, and Carla for various reasons to say the least.  The author puts a teaser at the end of the novel so be warned that you'll be sending her emails to release the next novel in the series sooner than later. <br />	2005-09-18
