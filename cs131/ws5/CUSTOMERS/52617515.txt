If you're a Hillary fan, you'll read this book to attack it.  If you're a Hillary non-fan, you'll read this book for ammunition.  You'll both be dissapointed.  For you non-fans, there's not much there that hasn't been claimed elsewhere.  You fans should look on the bright side: she lies about her knowledge of Bill's wanderings; she is a ruthless infighter, a duplicitious and shrewd politican, is addicted to power and, to quote Nixon (yes Nixon), she provokes \\"fear.\\"  Why don't you just say, \\"Well, so?\\" Follow the example of George Bush's fans who, instead of blackballing Richard Clarkes' book (which actually, for the first 10 chapters, protrayed him in a rather positive life) said to fans and critics of him alike: \\"Go read it. That's him in there.\\" <br /> <br />It all depends on your definition of character and what you want in a US President.  The background of the book's author is more interesting than the substance.  I read it because it provokes so much defensiveness from Hillary supporters.  And at the end of the last page, I just can't understand why that's their response.  So she's hooked on power and so on.  You didn't know that?   <br /> <br />In 1991, I had a business acquaintance in Arkansas who, with a spouse, had dinner several times with the Gov. and Mrs. Clinton.  That person, when I asked about Jennifer Flowers, said, \\"Look, everyone in Arkansas knows that Bill and Hillary don't have a 'marriage,' they have an 'arrangement.'  Everyone in the state who knows anything knows that Bill messes around.  Over the dinner table, she steps all over him.  She's much the dominant personality.\\"  She's an alfa fe-male.  Her fans should welcome that image.  Why don't they, I wonder?  Fear?	2005-08-27

The reviewer below that gave it a one start rating for having a \\"neo con\\" bias obviously read it predisposed negatively. Iran's been attacking the US for decades.  It would be out of character if they weren't planning something more devastating than bombing Marine or Air Force housing. Just today the Europeans, on a fool's errand, finally broke off talks with Iran. Current events may render this book obsolete within a few months.  Read it fast.	2005-08-24

Just a man expert in war telling the truth in his own authentic language.  After the cloud(s) clear over the one or more US cities that experience the impact of a small, portable nuclear weapon in a few years, months, or hours, the few folks who happen on Hunt's book will say, \\"Wow, was he right, or what!\\"  [For a peek into the mindset that discounts Hunt (and will, on that day, be rendered snibblingly incoherent) see the April 22 1 Star review and then its other reviews for a context. Hi ho.] <br /> <br />For anyone who ever came operationally in contact with the CIA in a war zone, his assertion of their general incompetence, coupled with the Beltway disease is a gimme. Not likely to change. Cause not enough of us died on 9/11 to get the \\"it\\" of his title.  More to come, then maybe.	2005-06-19

You'll like Peter's thinking, or you won't - not much in between. I found many oracles therein. This reader joins the author of Imperial Hubris in heralding Peters as on-target with regard to the need to align the military with reality - now and in the future.  The book The Pentagon's New Map is also in line with his thoughts.  There's some rumbling going on in the US military establishment.  These guys are all part of it.	2005-01-04

So the thing to do is for the world to, in a sense, grow up and discard ancient myths, or risk blowing ourselves up. This, the clear, portion of Harris' book is provocative.  He writes, \\"Religious moderation is the product of secular knowledge and scriptural ignorance--and it has no bona fides in religious terms, to put it on a par with fundamentalism.\\" That's a great one sentence definition, by the way, for why mainline Protestant denominations in the US are dying.  Without saying it, he makes a case that the West is religiously disarmed in its fight against a worldview, Islam, that has terror at its core.  Harris would have us drop the naive, politically-correct thinking that separates Islamic terrorism from Islam.  Therein, I believe, he articules a compelling case that resides in the minds of many non-Muslim Americans.  <br /> <br />Once that argument is made--that Islam really is a biggggg threat to the world, and that we need to all discard our ancient mythologies--he launches into a discussion of a modern approach toward spirituality.  Here he lost me.  Like wading through a pond of peanut butter. Doesn't mean it can't be done.  It's just really hard.  <br />  <br />The \\"clear\\" part of the book was worth the price of admission.  I don't feel like I missed anything by not getting the muddled part.	2004-10-31

Kohn disects the bias techniques of the NYT's front page.  Read it and you'll find yourself more carefully analyzing the language on the front page of any newspaper you read.  Smarter readers make for a stronger democracy.  And while once-upon-a-time the credibility of the NYT's was unquestdioned, today the news function has become a direct arm of the editorial page.

Our alleged friends - and if not friends, then not enemies - were the arsenal for Iraq between the Gulf Wars, and today US and British troops are being killed in Iraq with weapons Hussein bought with skimmed UN Food for Oil dollars from Russia, France, Germany and China.  (These are the same \\"allies\\" that the current administration is being criticized for not successfully soliciting support from for the war! \\"Allies\\" owed money by Iraq for arms.) This is a detailed read that gives a very compelling case for looking at current events in the Middle East through different lenses that what you hear on the network news.

The first half of the book is a frightening analysis of what we all know is a terrible threat-nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists.  The second half of the book has two less formitable points: (1) the Bush administration has it all wrong thesis and (2) here's a big list of things that should be happening.  The writer occasionally tortures logic.  Example, he notes that a \\"substantial majority\\" of Pakistanis, Turks, Jordanians & Moroccans believe the US is \\"overreacting to the threat\\" of Iraq. (p.136) (Don't I remember the previous US Administration stressing that very threat?) Then he writes, \\"We invade and occupy an oil-rich Arab couintry that was doing nothing to threaten us.\\" (p. 136) I guess he was asleep throught the 90's.  The writer cites the NIE statement that Iraq would not be able to make nuclear weapons till 2007-2009 as proof of the absence of \\"imminent\\" in the threat category. So when did we start believing the NIE, only when it supports our theses?  On the geo-political clock, isn't '07-'09 somewhat imminent? I felt like I was reading the talking points of a political campaign rather than the thoughtful analysis of serious problem.  I'm getting enought of that from the TV, and more. The last quarter of the book is for the policy wonks--idea after idea after idea. I got lost in the forest among the trees -- some shrubs, some redwoods.  I give the first half of the book a 5, the last half a 1, hence the 3 rating.  I'm glad I read it- the first half.	2004-09-29

The net of it is: (1) Senior officials in the Bush administration hold differing opinions, (2) Bush listens to and can cope with differing opinions, and (3) Bush makes up his own mind an acts in what he believes is the best interests of the country. He actually comes out the star of the book.  So, where's the shocker?  Maybe it's in this:  How can Sen. Kennedy and former VP Gore read this book and still say Bush is a liar?  It looks more like the worse thing he did was believe wha the CIA was telling him. As did Kerry, et al.  This is an interesting read offering insights on how decisions are made on heavy matters.

It'll just raise your blood pressure and provoke the sort of invectives appearing in some of the other reviews.
