The plot is, of course, overdone and the situations are absurd, but that's what books like this are all about.  I recommend it as an excellent summer read	2005-07-16

It is intelligent and complex. The ending is appropraite. I'll grant you that it is a little far-fetched at times, but it is cleverly put together and a very satisfying read. It will appeal to intelliget readers, I think. Besides, you will learn a lot about medieval literature.	2005-07-09

If Mr. Trollope were to write this book today, it would be half as long.  I loved the insights into a long ago set of values, and there were many instances when his wry humour moved me to laughter, but this is a tedious read.  I confes I &quot;power read&quot; parts of it.  I'm glad I have read Trollope, but I doubt that I will read more of him.	2005-04-08

There is too much description, of course, but apart from that I can find no fault with it. The characters are well drawn, the plot in intricate and it unfolds as it should. Altogether a most satisfying read. I do have one question, however: The beginning is narrated by Sir Walter... and I do not see how he can be a Sir . Can anyone enlighten me?

US	48860668	RVEFMIJBM0HCJ	0679783326	363093333	Jane Eyre (Modern Library Classics)	Books	4	7	9	N	N	A 19th century masterpiece	Jane Eyre is one of the classics of 19th century English literature.  It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting.  The language is, at times, tedious, and the plot absurd - with impossible coincidences, but, to English reader of the mid 19th century, these were accepted and demanded.  The characters are well drawn and the atmosphere is vivid.  Miss Eyre is a strong character who proves that the good and honest will prevail in God's good time.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of literature.	2005-02-27

It lacks the folksy charm of the first.  The  plotting is weak, and the situations absurd.  I suppost if you want a simple, easy weekend read this would do.

Smith's rustic African philosophy worked well, for a while anyway, but I find that he did not translate well to the urbane setting of Edingurgh.

Characters are not particularly strong.  A poor woman's version of Margaret Atwood.  The concept: lab-created people and jessed people try to find happiness in a future world should be compelling, but the writing doesn't quite carry it off.  This has the look and feel of a pulp novel.  It's a little better than that, but it's not &quot;literature&quot;.	2004-12-22

The quality of the construction, the maps and the illustrations, make it a treat to read. The story, of a man who re-discovers some islands (the Auroras) between The Falkland Is and the South Georgia Is is secondary. The first part, about the ideas of going there, and the second, the voyage, are not really all that compelling, but the third and fourth, dealing with the attempt by Hippolyte to prove the truth of his story, and Marie's disbelief, are more like a real novel. If you get a chance to buy this, do so. And savour it!	2004-12-20

I think the talking tigers were a bit much.  And what's with Archie?) I will read Mr. McGill's second novel, and anticipate that reviews will say something like: &quot;The promise shown in The Mysteries has been refined in this spectacular second novel...&quot;  The story was, I found, not quite compelling enough to hold my interest completely. I don't want to sound pompous, because I can see that McGill is obviously a good writer, but I must say that he's not there yet.	2004-12-18

For my taste, however, it's slow and overly long.  The style is passe. There are some very amusing comments (like when the end of the war is celebrated so that the English no longer have to go to Scotland to observe strange races). To compare it to Harry Potter is absurd.  Potter is a kids' book; this is an adult book.  On the whole, I think I prefer HP.	2004-11-19
