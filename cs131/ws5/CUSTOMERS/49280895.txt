Ms McCullough has done a profound historical research in order to write her \\"Roman Saga\\" started with \\"The First Man in Rome\\" in 1990 and continues with \\"The Grass Crown\\" (1991). There are four installments more.    She delivers an accurate picture of the late Roman Republic, bringing to life historically characters with amazing detail.  The author follows and reveals step by step all the intricacies of that rich and complex era.    Does this mean that the book is boring? By no means, Ms McCullough is able to show daily life, dressing, feeding, religious rituals, political and social structures in a magnificent fresco and at the same time construct an engaging story that will trap the reader for hours.    The story starts in the year 99 BC, following the careers of Marius and Sulla as they step by step draw away from each other and start a bitter confrontation.   The backdrop is the \\"Social War\\" (uprising of the Italics against Rome), the invasion of Greece and Rome's Asian province by King Mithridates and the harsh clash of plebeian and patrician.    Ms McCullough gives also numerous anecdotes about different great Romans as Marcus Livius and his sister Livia Drusa; Marcus Aemilus Scaurus and his very young wife Dalmatica. Their stories crisscross the entire novel.  Almost inadvertently Gaius Julius Caesar is introduced in the story giving his first steps as a boy and a pre-teenager of outstanding intelligence and sensibility.    Last but not least the author has drawn beautiful busts of the main characters; detailed maps of different ancient scenarios where action takes place and a very complete glossary.     I recommend reading the first volume of the series, but even if you don't do it, you will no be at loss as the author gives some flashbacks in the first pages.  I strongly recommend this book to any serious history aficionado!  Reviewed by Max Yofre.	2005-10-12

Ms McCullough is a well known author since the publication of her very first novel: \\"The Thorn Birds\\" (1977). This kind of success is difficult to maintain in successive publications. Not for her!   With her \\"Roman Saga\\" started with the present volume in 1990 she achieved a new great editorial success.

By no means, the author is able to show daily life, dressing, feeding, religious rituals, political and social structures in a magnificent fresco and at the same time construct an engaging story that will trap the reader for hours.    The story starts in the year 110 BC, when Marius and Sulla are still obscure characters. Both of them have enormous undeveloped potentialities. Fortune touch them in the person of Gaius Julius Caesar (grandfather), a rather poor but noblest Senator.  Thru matrimonial alliance with the Julian Family they initiate their astounding career. They start by going to Numidia to fight Jugurtha as subordinate officers. After a while they are in charge of the whole affair and successfully accomplish Roman's goals.   The narration goes on up to year 100 BC showing the German menace and the prelude to the \\"social wars\\".  The whole story of Marius and Sulla, Caesar and Pompey will be delivered in the next volumes that I am eager to read.       What delights me more is how Ms McCullough describes with detail many interesting historically characters, bringing them to life with a sort of \\"Roman ruthless\\".

In a very compact book series with excellent presentation, first quality paper and nice reproductions gives the reader a succinct and complete view of the subject.    Mr. Derrick Wright starts with a synopsis of the events preceding war's break out and then he follows with opposing Commanders, Armies and Plans in roughly 20 pages.    Next a compact but detailed day-by-day chronicle ensues.  Here the author sagely intercalates personal recounts with cold description of the battle in progress.   The photographic material is outstanding; each photo shows the shocking reality of the battlefield. The color plates are realistic and painted with vivid tonalities.  There are two and three dimension maps, showing very clearly how the combat evolved.    Finally a brief section is dedicated to the four Medal of Honor winners.   The appendix showing the casualties suffered by both sides is appalling and the 97% of dead Japanese military will prove the rule and not the exception all along the Pacific Campaign.    The only weak point of the book is the almost inexistent description of the Makin landings.

I'm just a new fan of Jasper Fforde and Thursday Next series and look forward to read the next three installments. <br /> <br />\\"The Jane Eyre Affair\\" is apparently only a normal sci-fi book, staged in an alternate universe with time travel as an ordinary feature. <br />But as the reader starts getting involved with the story (and to achieve that should decide to \\"play by Fforde's rules\\" and suspend disbelief) will become apparent that there are many layers on the tale. <br />One is a \\"tongue in check\\" non-stop pun with names and literary references. Another is a serious detective story that keeps you jumping from one scene to the next trying to anticipate what will happen. Yet another is the alternate universe with its special rules that will be disclosed little by little: odd but coherent. <br /> <br />Fforde uses a mixed writing technique, switching from first person to third as the action requires it, giving the story a very personal, but enjoyable, style. <br />Some characters are depicted very two-dimensionally and stereotyped as in a \\"comic book\\" and others, as Thursday Next, fully fleshed and articulate. <br /> <br />A book that any literary buff will fully enjoy but also sci-fi and detective stories fans will. <br />Reviewed by Max Yofre. <br />	2004-12-12

After finishing reading it I was amazed by how deeply Mr. Clavell has grasped this exotic environment in his novel.<br /><br />Mr. Milton has thoroughly researched the contemporary European sources to build this book. He took into account the diary & letters from William Adams (the historical character on which Clavell's book was based), Richard Cock, the chief English Factor at Hirado (Japan), Captain John Saris and other Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese sources. As other reviewers have pointed out, Japanese sources are omitted. This in my opinion, is not a great setback, because the author is telling the story of the hundred year relationship between Europeans and Japanese from the Europeans stand point of view, and he doesn't claim otherwise.<br /><br />The amazement and shock, that such a different culture generated on these seamen and merchants is shown in their own words. In one hand the higher cultural level, reflected in the cleanness, sophistication and demeanor of the Japanese, seduce them. In the other hand the harsh justices applied: deaths for minor and major faults, without appellation or mercy, appall them.<br /><br />The spicy language used by William Adams and his fellow merchants is shown, with minor standardization in order to render it intelligibly for modern readers, recreating their environment and mindset. The book is very entertaining  and provides a colorful sight of that historical period and place.<br /><br />Enjoy this reading!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.	2004-09-22

I feel that that is why this book is such a compelling read.    Jeff dies suddenly of a heart attack at age of 43 after living an unsatisfactory life, but instead of going to Heaven or Hell or Nothingness he awakes at his college dormitory when he was 18 years old. First he is almost driven into madness (as it will occur to you or to me). Then little by little he is able to gain control of his new life and starts an amazing trip.  However when he reaches 43, he dies again. Is this the End? Of course not, it's a new start. He is launched, and the reader with him, into a seemingly endless quest.    Ken Grimwood, (unfortunately deceased) has constructed a novel that dwelt with fundamental questions as: Which is the sense of life? Are our actions inane? Is love attached to a person?  He broods on ethics, responsibility, altruism, selfishness, fatherhood and vocation amongst other significant issues.  So, is this a philosophical and boring book? No, not the least! It's a fast paced gripping and thought provoking novel! It earned his author the World Fantasy Award in 1986.    Just one more detail: take a careful look to one of the Replayed Lives that depicts what kind of world may arise from a ruthless America and remember it was written in 1986 way before the more dreadful recent events.

Bettik, Martin Silenus and The Shrike reappear here. The Catholic Church with her new resurrection \\"sacrament\\" is expanding everywhere. The \\"farcasters\\" are not working and space travel takes a toll in the form of time debt.    Simmons gives a new turn of the screw to his story: the new main character is an anti-hero. He is not very brave or smart; he is loyal and devoted to Aenea. Usually M. Endymion just goes ahead pressed by the events that pop up and strives to stay alive and protect Aenea. He is just an ordinary man subjected to extraordinary events. The Pax forces leaded by Father Captain de Soya launch an all-out persecution thru the universe and this is its chronicle.    Simmons uses a subtle humor and winks the reader to enter the game. At the same time, in another level of the story, more complex issues are touched as predestination versus free will; religion and faith; ethical and unethical choices.

From Kerouac and his circle the angst that pursues many intellectuals in the late Fifties.<br /><br />This book, as each of PKD’s novels, is unique, captivating and full of action, moral and ethical issues. Characters are not heroes, just human beings doing their best to survive in a hostile environment. They may be selfish and even despicable but within them there is always a spark of altruism trying to emerge.<br /><br /> PKD constructs a disheveled post apocalyptic world that imposes its fearful traits upon the reader.<br />On this background the story of Jones, a foreseer who evolves from a fortuneteller to a religious messianic leader, is seen from the eyes of Cussick, a security agent that tries to stop him. Cussick represents the new establishment: the Relativists. They are trying to create a new utopia, but as many other real utopist they are creating a world without freedom and creativity. The answer that PKD gives to this is nihilism.<br /><br />As usual with PKD writings, an unfathomable melancholic undercurrent traverses the whole story, forcing every character to wonder “why am I here?”<br /><br />This is a dark yet captivating novel from a great writer that is beginning to show his mettle.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.	2004-04-20

But in my opinion is more than that. Kay has researched the historical period he reflects in this \\"alternate universe\\", and gives an accurate and sensible picture of it: the value of honor, the religious beliefs (even if disguised with other names and nuisances), the mixed loyalties (to country, king, family and religion), poetry and medicine among others.  The story is loosely based on the medieval poem The Song of Mio Cid, around year 1000 in the Iberic peninsula, three cultures mixing and interacting; a main character from each of them: the courageous Captain Belmonte, the sage and stubborn doctoress Jehane and the cunning warrior-poet-politic Ammar, the three of them draw a complex and absorbing tapestry.   Kay is masterful depicting scenes that lead the reader to jump to conclusions that are, astonishingly, proved wrong a couple of pages later, this keep you reading on tiptoes, expecting new surprises... and they show up even if you are warned.  The descriptions of cities, rural places, king's courts, markets have a distinctive flavor, without being boring. The different characters are fully human and interesting, not two dimensional stereotypes as may be expected in Fantasy story. The inner thoughts of most of them are shown, giving insight as to why they do what they do.  A book to enjoy by different audiences.  Reviewed by Max Yofre.	2004-03-26

The Face of Battle is an early book from Mr. Keegan (1976) which shows all his virtues combined: he is a professor (at Sandhurst Military Academy), so the book is didactic; he is an investigator so his researches on how to describe a battle are shown; he is a talented literate writer, so his prose is engaging and fluent.  As with other books of the author this is a very commendable reading for different audiences: those interested in specific military topics, those interested in history (as myself), those who want to know how a battle looks like and more.    Mr. Keegan open his work with an introduction in which he wonders how battles has been described and perform a critical reading on some famous excerpts, pointing out why they fail to tell us what really happened in those critical moments of history. At the same time he draw a model on how a battle should be told.  He applies this model to three outstanding battles: Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme. He analyze and describe each piece of battle, taking pain to break them into small components and presenting them to the reader with a forceful languaje.    Agincourt is a fearful hand to hand and man to man conflict, Mr. Keegan reviews the weapons, the battlefield, the climate, the mood of the warriors, the leadership, the moral conflict of killing prisoners among other things. Even if this battle piece is described with scientific method you have the poignant feeling of being there.    Waterloo is different scenario, weaponry has evolved changing the kind and quality of armed encounters. Documentation on the battle overflows and menace to drown the historian. Artists imagination is aroused and lots of paintings full of color and inaccuracy find their way to galleries and museums. From all this massed data and imagery, however Mr. Keegan, produce another coherent and accurate description of the events on 18th June.     The Somme is XXth century and an industrialized mass war, the size of the battle field enlarges toan inhuman scale, increasing logistic and communication problems. General staff miscalculations translates into human useless suffering. Pre-battle, battle and post-battle issues are analyzed and shown in this section. Military lessons may be extracted from it by military professionals. A very realistic picture of the pains, disorientation, vision, behavior, of the front officers and soldiers, among many other \\"observables\\" may be grasped by the rest of the readers.    But as I said at the beging of the review, Mr. Keegan is not only an historian, he is an educator, so to complete his work, as an epilogue, he discuss the future of battle and the art of War.

I was able to find more than one book about Spartacus and his revolt, but on gladiator's everyday life, origins, evolution among other issues, I was unsuccessful. Worst of all, the recent movie \\"Gladiator\\", renew my interest. <br />Finally I found this book at Amazon's Store (where else?). <br />It is at the same time an oasis for my thirst and a let down in some aspects. <br />First the bright side: Mr. Baker has done a very interesting research and show his findings in a very amenable way. <br />All the main issues are addressed: origin of gladiatorial institution, organization, evolution and extinction. Weaponry, different kinds of fights, ceremonies, circus emplacement, glossary of terms. A vivid reconstruction of \\"A day at the Circus\\"  and some other interesting items about these ancient warriors. <br />The shadowy side: the edition and typography of the book is poor, it looks as it was given to press in a hurry (trying to catch with film success?). Some side stories are well known, other are not directly related with the main object of the book. Bibliography is scarce and no reproductions are shown. <br />Balancing pros & cons the book is fairly good read for anyone interested in this particular subject. <br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.	2004-02-11

Obviously Lt. Wells is not a writer, he is a Soldier. He has been a Soldier and he always will be one, no matter what he does to earn his life.    We are presented with the shocking story of Iwo Jima battle seen with the eyes (the soul I'll better say) of a front line combat Marine. Wells let us share his feelings from the time he is still a college student, how he decide to be a Marine in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, his life at Boots Camp, Paratroop training, Guadalcanal experience, more training at the States and finally through all the rugged strife of Iwo Jima.  This book is a very straightforward account of a teenager evolving into hardened young soldier ready to give his life for his Country. At the same time gives the reader an inkling of the historical period, its values, ideals and expectations. Also pictures the life style of the Marines Corp, its written and unwritten codes, language, ethics, training, etc.    Every word in this book sounds true and without ornament. A must read for any WWII buff.    Reviewed by Max Yofre.	2003-02-05

The Mask of Command is a very commendable reading for different audiences: those interested in specific military topics, those interested in history (as myself), those who research on leadership and more, much more, because John Keegan writes with a dynamic and fluent style and expose his ideas very engagingly.    Four historical figures are chosen as examples for this study, we may dissent with the choice. I'm sure every reader will have a different list, if forced to select four characters among the enormous list of suitable candidates.  Each Commander is presented in his historical background: political and social circumstances; his staff and soldiers, his ideals and goals, his methods and resources. Then compared and confronted with the other subjects. Here is where Mr. Keegan displays a very imaginative and didactical approach.     A deep insight  into the commandeering skills of these forceful characters, separated in time and space, but very close to each other in the quests they have to solve.

I was immediately captivated by her amazing imagination and quality of her prose and became instantly a fan of the author. This first impression was corroborated as I read more of her writings.  All her books showed a rich mixture of imagination, complex and interesting characters and conflictive situations to test their mettle.  In \\"Kindred\\" the story is presented in a sci-fi framework, in order to give an entry point to a world distant more than a hundred years from us, but the substance is about getting in touch with slavery. Unearthing the relationships between slaveowners and slaves, drawing a huge fresco of that society.  Dana, an Afro-American woman, is drawn time and again to the past with the specific mission of saving Rufus' life, the son of a slaveowner and his heir. Each time Dana is transported backward, the drama increases. Poignant and vivid scenes are shown, reaching deep into the reader's sensibility, but with an earnest and straightforward approach. You can't elude perceiving the \\"reality\\" of the world shown in this amazing book. After reading it, I keep wondering about what strange compulsion make a human being to despise another one based on racial, religious or even political or social differences, without perceiving that we are kindred to each other.

In \\"King and Emperor\\", the human dimension of each character grows and they are confronted with moral and ethical dilemmas.  Shef, Svandis, Cwicca, Thorvin, Bruno, Brand and the rest (even the crooked Erkenbert) has to choose between different actions in order to proceed. Still is a novel full of action, adventure and entertainment. In my personal point of view, some aspects of Svandis cuasi Freudian  dream explanations are out of context. I don't agree with other reviewers, in their appreciation of an abrupt and rash ending of the novel. The confrontation between Bruno and Shef is well paced and reach a \\"logical\\" ending.

A very well documented background, reveals Harrison's researches. This novel shows how myths are created, the chosen Hero, rising from an obscure corner and going step by step on the path Gods or Destiny had forged. At the same time, Shef is not a puppet in their hands, his humanity is present, he is free to choose and he does so, not without paying the price.   The entire early middle age world is reconstructed accurately; its reality is overwhelming. Harrison has profited from his long period at Denmark, the Norse legends blended into the narrative and the Viking characters, with their regional characteristics (a Dane is different from a Norwegian and from a Sweden) shows it. Also we may trace hints of Mark Twain's \\"Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's court\\", and that excellent movie that was \\"Alfred the Great\\" but recreated in a new and brilliant scheme. The inventions and rediscoveries are plausible, they make me think about a genius like Leonardo da Vinci, transported some centuries ahead of his time.   A book to enjoy and read more than once.
