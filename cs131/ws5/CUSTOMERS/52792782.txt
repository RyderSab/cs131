Tu Fu is sad and poinant, talking about the scenes of war. Li Po talks of drinking and intoxication in a way that seems that it is a way of life<br /><br />Young translates in a free verse form using simple words and goes for the feeling of the poem. The poems are not 100 % literal translations but they are jems.  I feel like I am having some of my chinese friends translating a poem for me and they say this is the best I can do you will have to read Chinese to fully understand the poem completely.  Young takes us as far as one can go in our language.  He took on a difficult task to bring these poems so simple in language and so complex in context and emotion to life, Young has done an excellent job with the tool of the English language	2005-06-06

(Yes the clinton's would have asked there favorite pollester back if he didn't hate them they did it  before when they needed him) because I think Bill and Hill made Dick Morris's stomach churn.   <br /> <br />Morris writes history that means that there are references to his facts he is not telling stories or making things up so that they will play well with poeple.  Morris states that things he says are opinions.  Some I think are correct some a little bit off or extreme, but he has a convincing arguement.   <br /> <br />Remember Bill never had sex with that woman, Morris at least admitted that he slept with someone else.  Why not forgive Morris if you can forgive Bill?     <br /> <br /> <br />I would like both books both Bills and Dicks to be read and then make a choice like I did.   <br /> <br />	2004-10-20

Morris has worked with the Clintons for years and has soom unique insites some are more credible then others.<br /><br />If you want to have an informed mind and an open mind read this book and Hillaries and decide for yourself.  Too many reviews on this page are left or right, but few are objective.<br /><br />Try to verify Ms. Clintons facts and Morris's facts and the one who can most often verifable will be closer to the truth.  I beleive that reading a book that you may not like may open your  eyes to things that you may want changed. A closed book out of stuborn partisnship is a sadness, both books should be read  and judged.<br /><br />This is America there is room for debate, in my life I have  been to places where the freedom to have  a different opinon does not exist.  I am happy that we can have our arguemnts in the US even if they are silly	2004-10-20

Unlke the liberals that I respect M Moore is a down shouter who gives misleading evidence, edits images and time scales to move his agenda.  He shots down his detractors claims of conspriacy.  When I saw Bowling for Colinbine I found a lot of statics which were deceptive things weren't normalized for good comparisons.  I can forgive sloppy by I can not accept deceptive this book shows that Micheal Moore will do anything to promote M.

I am a westerner who has traveled and worked (and married) in this region of China.  The books of Ha Jin make me believe that I am in Dalian or Harbin.  The characters have such an intresting nature but as I have found there isn't one China there is 1.5 billion China's.  Ha Jin characters have a chinese nature and a personal independence I like.   These tales are multifaceted and no repetitious.  The setting and the characters change from story to story, but all are in this beautiful complex world of northern China.  This region of China is still the least settled and the most political corruption and non western thinking happens here.  <br />The stories I liked most are:<BR> the Sabatour which is about a professor who is arrested for standing up to the police and who is utterly defeated, but is looking for an unlikely form of revenge. <br />The Woman from New York.  About a chinese woman who has gone to the west and comes back to reestablish connection with her family only to find she doesn't fit.  <br />Cowboy Chicken comes to China<BR>A story about Chinese workers in an American francies trying to make sense of a formulated system that suprisingly works but doesnt fit China.  This tale is mircaulous in how  the west and east often miss the essence of each other.<br />The Kindergarten <BR>A tale where a young class of students is cheated by there teacher to do work so that the down trodden teacher can survive.  It is a tale of maturity and vengeance and misunderstanding.  The story is from a young girls eye who understands something is wrong but not understanding the causes.<BR>Ha Jin's novels Waiting and In the Pond are good reads as well	2003-10-05

The idea is that after a certain amount of word of mouth comumication can cause a small trend to become a major fade or social trend.  The model is similar to the spread of viruses or disease.  This book is about an idea reaching a crital mass that cause a juggernaut of change. <br />The book states three rule how certain poeple are good at connecting poeple, some poeple are excellent educators and some poeple are great salespersons.  These poeple can cause a word of mouth fad or socal virus.  The book gives excellent case studies and examples of this type of person<br />The second part of the book is about making ideas stick.  How small changes in a avertising campaign or idea communication can cause a marked social idea. <br />The final idea is about context effecting socal action.  This part of the book describes the causes of the spread of teenage smoking and sucide.  A lot of the science is counter intuative and really will suprise most readers.  <br />This is an important book for thoses who want to understand the &quot;randomness&quot; of our marketing and social world.<br />As well the book is well researched and compelling with its examples and case studies.  It is an easy read I read it on a 10 hour plane ride and it seemed like minutes.  As well I wanted to read it again.	2003-09-12

I love this perspective of Hamlet.  It is truely a comical look at how even the insignifcant look for purpose when often there is none to be found.  There is a lot of great diaolog and I had to laugh when Rosencranzt almost stumbles on to his own version of to be or not to be.  But he can't quite get started.<br />They just can't figure out what is going on or what they are supposed to do.  The play is full of wit and philosophical banter which plays on Shakespeare and the theater in general.  Loved Hamlet and so this play really gets a rise out of me.  It may be worth reading Hamlet again if you haven't in a while just to get in the mood of the play.  It is basically the story of two guys wondering how they got in the middle of a story they don't understand.  <br />I think shakespeare would have loved to have written  this play.<br />If you are unfamilur with Hamlet read it, if you are read Hamlet again it is a joy, than read this.	2003-06-28

Kosinski <BR>The only the real life of Kosinski is as strange as his fiction. <BR>And his fiction is strange yet utterly plausible in the mind of the reader. <br /> I liked it, the main character is capable of quite morally good things as well as dark dangerous things.  Some is very true the two most unlikely stories in the book actually.  Kosinski writes about his main character missing the plane to LA and all his friends were killed in a mass murder, Kosinski was supposed to go to Roman Polanski's house but lost his luggage and was delayed a day just causing him to miss arriving the night of the Charles Mansion Helter Skelter murders.  The second story is about his main character marring a rich heiress for love only to see her die.  This actual happened to the Kosinski.  His mixture of pure fiction with the Autobiographical is mesmerizing.  Leventur his main character is a Russian émigré who has many international adventures.  He is a womanizer, a killer, a hero victim, avernger and villian.  The plot bounces around the world from the opressed world of the Soviet Union to the extra<BR>grandure and freedom of america.  I also loved Being There.	2003-06-28

This book is just hard hitting as they come.  William S. Burroughs does not paint a pretty romantic picture of drug use.  He shows the destructive nature through is own actions in this biography.  This book goes into all aspects of opiate addiction including loss of lobeedo, total lack of higene and self respect.<br />This book is about scoring and the despreate naked dirty need of a junkie.  This book mesmerized me as it horrifed with its narritive.  One of the most truthful autobiographical looks at drug use in its most desprate form.  From theft to fooling doctors into prescriptions Burrows commits many crimes, the worst of which is his own self distruction.<br />I like the book for not being a defense or a cautionary tail, just a graphic story which makes you see the results with your own eyes<br />this isn't a joy read it is quite enlightnening, it is easy to finish because even the pain of Burroughs experience draws you into the inexpicablity of the actions of a true addict.<br />This is well written direct and not beat poetry stream of consousness  like so much of Burrough work is.  <br />This is being a junky.	2003-06-15

As I read it I got very hooked.<br />The story is about a man traveling around the world looking for silk worm eggs.  At first the fates seem to drag the man from place to place year after year.  But when he finds a forbidden woman in Japan he takes charge of his fate.  <br />There are two letters which are translated to the man which change his life.  Each one changes his direction when it seems unchangable.  <br />The use of repitition of his journey is exciting because every trip the man has changed and the same journey does not lead to the same place or time ever again.<br />The best short read in years.

This addition has BAT and three other wonderful Capote stories The House of Flowers, A Cristmas Memory, and The Diamond Guitar.<br />I like these stories because each shows that there is prices to be paid in life and that there are some both negative and postive conquences to almost any relationship.<br />BAT is a story is so unique it is about a girl that everyone wants to save, but who really never needs it.  Holly Golightly is a woman with an unknown past and a less known future.  Everyone she meets seems to think she is a fake but for the fact that she is genuinly not trying to convince anyone she isn't.  It is the story of a woman who wants freedom and love, but in a masculine way is willing to part with love that has to high a price.  There is only one Holly Golightly in the relm of literature.<br />The House of Flowers is about a poor Hatian girl who goes from being a well paid prostitute in Porto Prince to a wife of a honest man.  The story shows that she has to indure hardships in Marriage as well as in her first profession.  It also shows that often we only have to look back a little bit to see value of the present.<br />The Diamond Guitar is a story of two men in prision who are best friends and the conflict they have when one man wants to escape.  It has to deal with friendship, loss , freedom and memory.  It is comic and tragdic.<br />The christmas memory is just too hard to explain, but it shows the life of a person who never  can grows up and her experinece with a young boy who has no choice but to grow up.	2003-06-07

It's premiss is that Easterners' are more contextual and less object oriented in their thought processes. Nisbet shows how the West tends to value conflict of ideas over harmony and the east focuses on harmony and relationship. <br />Nisbet uses history, geography and traditions to explain his findings which are backed up by many interesting studies. I like the emphisis that these studies outline tendencies which peolpe can be trained to change or adopt to there advanatages. <BR>Nissbet also is willing to critize both the east and west for certain errors that there thought patterns lead them to. <br />Nissbet also discusses how the source of how confontrations between the west and east occur due to differences. As well he discusses why the west and east have different view of human rights. <br />His most interesting arguement and most well founded is that Westernization is a commercial phenomenon and not necessarily a cultural one, Coke and Mc Donald's invasion of the world does not mean that eastern culture is disappearing or weakening only that the Big mac and Coke taste good to almost anyone. <br />I like Nissibet hope that western and eastern cultures will influnece each others way of thinking. And that understanding one anothers way of thinking is important. Through my travels around the world the attempt to understand others has lead to much more happiness than strife. <br />My new wife is Chinese and this book helped me to understand why some simple questions that I asked her are not so simple because we have a different starting point in the way we understand the world, this does not stop us from understanding the world together. I hope Nissbett is right for the world would be a better place.	2003-06-07

While the Zone system can be presented as hard core math, Grave uses Black and White images to define the Zones and help you think in grey scale. His book is extremely practical and is based on using the light meter in the camera. This means that you are not forced to buy extra equipment such as spot meter or hand held meters unless you want them for convience. The book really is good in making you think about the black and white print that will be produced. The proper exposure give you or your developer maximum latitiude in making prints. As well great effects can be made by adjusting your preceptions an adjusting the camera to capture what you precieve. The part on developing looks good also. There are film test and exposure test to determine if your camera is fuctioning normally or if needs work. If you are not getting good results then I suggest using these test to determine if your camera is functioing correctly the test seem unnecessary if you are getting good results. The Pictoral examples in this book are great. The text is about seeing a picture in your mind and then telling you how to create it on film for priinting. This book will greatly improve your black and white skills if you are a beginner without creating a great deal of confusion.  Some of the lessons translate well to color photos.  And there is a chapter onthe zone system for color.	2001-09-18

The book discusses all formats of cameras and various lenses and filters in good detail.  Very good explainations of exposure depth of field focus and all other general topics are discussed.  This is a great reference for anyone who wants to know the workings of a camera. The book also convers what each format of camera can do.  It outlines techniques for achieving effects based on focal length, apeture and film speed.  There is also a section of filters and what you can do for you.  The book has a heavy bias towards black and white but most techniques are transferable to color.  There is not alot about exposure control that is in the next book the The Negative.  This book will help with camera care maintaince and help you decide what kind of equipmnet you will need as you advance as a photographer.  The descriptions are never brand names but types of cameras and lenes.  This book is very fundimental and therefore timeless.	2001-09-18

A mother who is loyal to her party who along with her whole family is tormented and tortured under Mao.  And finally  a daughter who is raised in the cult and the disilluion of Mao.  <br />This book is also a great introduction to modern chinese history.  The reasons for the rise and fall of all the political regemes in china are outlined.  As well the faith and loss of faith in communism in china is well out lined.  This history is factual and personal at  the same time.  Her is a look at three generation of Chinese who struggled with warlords,the Kumingtong and the cultural revolutions.  Women and men of character who were tormented for their belief by there own political party.  <br />I loved this books and believe that Chung Jung has created a master work that is for all time.

A great deal of time is spent on detailing the life of BEAST RABEN and his parents and there interaction with the Baron Vadimer Harkonenn.  As well the intriges for the House Corrino as it tries to crush the oposoition to the EMPIRE. <br />This book shows the sword training of Duncan Idaho. The childhood of Leit Kynes and Gurney Halleck.   I read this book over the weekend and could not put it down.  It is different than Frank Herbert who weaved themes into the work.  This is pure story, but it is in the DUNE universe with some of the most characters that you loved in the other work. As well it hints at the birth of Feyd Rahd Raben and Paul Atreides.<br />It jumps between a lot of story lines and one should read House Atreides if this is you first DUNE book.	2000-11-29

This book does not embelish, but tells the story of Crazy Horse through those who effected his life.  the story shows Crazy Horse as a loner who love his privacy but was often forced to give it up for the action needed at the time.  The book was well referrecned and often will state when a story may be from a questionalbe sorce.  It is an easy read and covers history that is often ingnored.  Crazy Horse is more a history of the Americas than a biography, but that does reduce its worth.	2000-11-14

His example shows the ubsurdity of judging a man by the color of his skin.  His life was a struggle and this book goes into great personal trials of the man.  The book is more about  Jackie's family and professional life after baseball than baseball.  Yet  this does not distract the reader this adds to the story of a honest,  passionate and intellegent man.  His autobiography with personal honesty  goes into Robison's strengths and weaknesses. <br />The story of Robinson and  Branch Ricky is well detailed.  It may be the greatest story that ever  happend in baseball.  If you want to read a book that tells a great  baseball story than read this.  If you want to read a story of a man whose  courage has been rarly equaled than read this book.

Patton and his third army.  There  are very detailed accounts of the generals biographies. As well the  campaignes through  Sparta, Georgia and Germany are good quick over views  of the campaigns. <br />There are three main thesises of this book. The first  is that a democracy can quick assemble and train an army because they are  motivated by principle.  They are fighting of their nation s values and  this congeals the army into an effective fighting machine.  As well once  the army has completed its task it is quickly disassembled for it has  served its purpose.<br />The second thesis is that democrartic generals are  willing to use fast swift tactics against the means to war rather than  risking their troops or destroying enemy troops.  Also move with a quick  large force and the enemy will be unwilling to face you. Land need not be  occupied just made unproductive by making a wake of destruction.  <br />The  third thesis is that these great democratic armies have needed leaders who  are able to take calculated risks  to acheive great victories.  The leader  must understand motion, terain, disipline, justice and supply.  He must  also be at the head of his army, he must be at the center of the fray  inorder to instill his troops repect for him inorder to follow.  I believe  the author did a good job in proving his point.  <br />If you like this book  read Sherman's Memiors and the art of war by Sun-tu	2000-07-12

This book is good for those with  or without a strong science background This book is the second best book of  all time on the general description of the ideas of Darwin the first is the  ORIGIN OF SPECIES. This book is more readable than the ORIGIN and includes  the exciting evidence of DNA and Genitics that happend after darwin. <br />It  also confronts most the attacks on Darwin from both scientists and  creationist.

US	52792782	RG9CYRMNQHH4R	0226307654	849253156	002: The Complete Greek Tragedies, Volume 2: Sophocles	Books	5	3	8	N	N	Greens translation is outstanding	I wrote the review of Aescylus below, which is a mistake.  I was reviewing  another part of the complete greek plays by L and G. <br />Greens translation  and editing of Sophocles is as good as Lattimores Aesychlus(which is the  best in the world of classical literature).  It is often mistaken that  these three plays are of the same  trilogy. Actually they are parts of  three unique trilogies.  So don't be disturbed if you find some minor  contradiction in the story lines each triology was ment to be played only  once and never seen agains so the author often would be willing to use the  same characters to convey different messages.<br />Antigone is a play about a  sense of higher justice than the law.  Doing what is right because it is  right even if it means death.  It is a great look into the greek view of  justice. Still today this may be on my top ten play list of all time.  I  believe that this is the first of a trilogy on the King Creon and his down  fall.<br />Oedipus Tyrannos (Oedipus the tyrant) is about hubris or man trying  to rival the gods.  Oedipus is also about self discovery and finding out  things about yourself that lies just below the surface.  It is also about  stubborn pride and how it bind you and turns you against those tring to  help you.  As well it is about the tragedy that accompanies self discovery.   Don't try to read to much Freud into this. Again one of the best playes  ever written. <br />Oedipus at Colonus is about redemption of Oeidpus and the  freedom that he achieves in admitting himself as human.  This is a great  play also.<br />This entire series is a jewel from the classics department of  U of Chicago.	2000-07-08

A love story that is realistic because of  the lover's imperfection. Love is not a stagent idea in this book. One sees  both the pragmatism of rejected love and devotion to the idea of love. The  characters are unpredictable and complex. The main love triange in the  story is suported by the richness of supporting characters. The supporting  characters take on short main story line roles. This book is about all the  aspects and degree of love. Devotion,regection, love, lust, fidelity and  infidelity are all mixed. The characters struggle with their relationship,  which are fluid and unpredictable as life is. The only love story that is  as realistic and challenges the reader as much is the Elornor Gehrigs My  Luke and I. This is some of the best fiction that exist!<br />Florinto is in  love with Fermina, and is rejected by her after their initial infatutation.  Florintio will not give up he is waiting for Fermina husband to die to  recindle the romance.  Florintino is a man with need who while being  faithful in spirit has affair after affair with other women as he waits.  Fermina has to deal with a series of marital strife and bliss as Floritino  waits out her marriage.  Marquez gets to examine a great deal of love  relationships in this book.  It is excitingand changing as love and life.  This is my first Marquez book but it will not be my last.  The text is rich  in details and may drag a little at times but preserver it is worththe  read.	2000-07-08

I have read a dozen of translations of Aeschylus and this has no rival. As well the whole series edited by Green and Lattimore are the best  compelation of all the Greek tragedy to date. Lattimore understand the  darkness and the fatilism of greek tragedy. The verse translation is  flowing and rythmic as the greek is. The translation is loose and not  exacting like Lattimores Iliad but he captures the theme better than a too  literal translation would allow.<br />This is the story of house of Atreus.  <br />Agammenon: Agammenon has just returned from war.  His wife Clyesmenstra,  plots to kill him to avenge his daughters infanticide by Agammemon.  As  well it is also revenge by the gods for Agammenons willingness to make this  scarifice and leading so many greeks and Trojans to their death in a  meaningless war although the gods did not instruct C. to do this.  As well  A. brings back Cassandara his slave concubine who is cursed to see the  future but never to be believed by Apollo.  She forsees here own death and  those of Agammenon and his troops. <br />Libatiion Bearers:<br />In this plays  the Apollo sends Orestes to avenge his fathers death which the gods did not  sanction.  He does so and is attacked by the furies for matericide.<br />The  Furies:<br />Athena passes judgement on Orestes because even though matercide  is a crime it was sanctioned by a god to avenge a king.   AS well the  furies must be satisfied in there blood lust even if Oresties is found  innocent.<br />The setting for the play is in the most primative of times  which allows Aeschylus  to create characters who do not follow the mores of  his day more believeable.  This play may have been the model for Hamlet.   <br />Even after reading 100s of plays since the orestia this is still the  most gripping drama that I have read.  These plays and Hamelet are my  favorites	2000-07-08

As time passes I see myself disagree with the philosophy of Ayn Rand more and more, yet her work has challenged me to think and question my own philosphy of life.  I am not a hard core objectivist and I am actually a  little amazed at how far hard-core objectivist go especial in their  challenge of modern physics and quantum mechanics.  But this book is a  great book is worth  examination  and questioning.  <br />The Fountainheads  characters are really amazing and interesting.  <br />Howard Roark the  protagonist is a talented college drop out who struggles to become an  architect. He refuses to design anything other than to his own design and  will not be influenced by the whims of cleints or fads in design.  His  buildings are prefect in the book and Roark will pay out of his own pocket  to fix his mistake in design.  And he would rather see a building of his  design destroyed than corrupted.  Roark is driven by solving problems of  design not by fame or fortune.<br />He is contrasted by Peter Keating who  unlike Roark  always caves in to be popular opinon by catering to the whims  of clients and critics. While Roark is almost uneffected by people, Keating  is totally dependent on others for his ideas, dreams and sense of self.   <br />Dominique Frankon is Roarks lover who wants to see him destroyed and  tries to destroy him herself.  For she is tortured by the fact that everone  gives in and compromises themselves.  She tries to destroy Roark because  see believes that he can not hold out forever against the world and she  would rather see him destroyed than live a subservient life.  <br />Gail Wylan  is Roarks best friend.  Wylan is a newspaper owner who is a tyrant over his  empire.  He tries at first to control Roark and fails which is what starts  there friendship. Wyland is forced to choose between public opinion and  Roark in a court case.  Wylan must choose bewteen power or intergity.   <br />Toohey is the devil in the form of a critic.  He praises thosewho will  give into society and attacks those who will show independence and  integrety in their work.  He wants to destroy indiviualism and replace it  with a dull mediocracy.  He wants to control mens minds by making them  dependent on his evaluation of the world.  He is facinated by Roark while  Roark has little fasinatition with him.  Toohey knows that he must at all  cost destroy Roark.<br />As I have said Rand will make you think.  But  challenge her ideas in your own mind.  THE PASSION OF AYN RAND by Barbera  Branden is an excellent biography for those who love or hate Ayn Rands  views.	2000-07-07

You will need to understand Diff EQ  for this book.<br />The first chapter took me a week to read and work out the  math but then I red the rest in 4 weeks.  It is a hard start because Hill  develops your background before starting with applications of the theory.   I really began to grasp the subject after reading this book. Ohter books  will not lay the mathout as well as Hill does.  It is a hard read because  Hill is so thorough, but the rewasd is well worth the struggle.

This book is probably the most fasinating biography I have read.  Sherman was an talented outsider whose abilty won the civil war.  The book begins with Shermans early military career and civilain life before the civil war.   Sherman crisscrosses the content to support his family and becomes a Dean  of students, a surveyor, a banker, a rail road man and a partener in a law  firm.  All these skills and travels blend together to make a master  stragist and leader. <br />Sherman was a man always moving to survive. His  plan of attack was to move quickly to destroy property and save lives of  his men as well as those of the enemy.  He stood for loyality and a chain  of command, yet was willing to congole the president and U S Grant into  allowing him to march through Goergia and the Carolinas while living off  the land. <br />This is an analytical story of stragidty and passionate story  of a man who was unwilling to slaughter men and instead destroyed the means  to war.  <br />All war is hell.

His translations always have a sense of motion to them.  The character are vital and passionate in this transtlation.  The story is of Aeneas and his quest to find a home for the  survivor of Troy.  The story is of mythic travels and temptation of Aeneas  as he travels to Italy (Odyessey like.)  Then the conquest of Italy(like  the Illiad).  This poem is a mixture of the Illiad and Odessey, a story of  a warrior/traveler.  Fitzgerld caputres this duelity in his translations.  If you don't believe that a translator can make a difference then read this  version and compare to others.	2000-06-18

When you read Fiztgerald's Illiad you imagine the velocity of Achilles the runner and feel the heat of his rage,  you understand the  craftyness of Crooked minded Odyesses and the hubris of Aggamemmon.<br />I  have read a most verse translation of the Illiad and this one best captures  the emoions and motion of this poem.  Fitzgeralds translation is not as  exact to the Greek in word for word sense as Richmond Lattimore's, but it  is exacting in how it presents its characters in this story and struggles  they face.<br />The Illiad is famous for its repeated phrasing, and epitaph  for the characters, Fitzgerald chose the best way to translate the repetion  in the poem to fit the characters persona so that they became effective in  conveying the soul of the characters.<br />This Illiad is great for the first  time reader as well as those who have read the Illiad before.  This is a  fresh easy to read version modern in its language but capturing anchient  themes of Homer.<br />This is one of those ten books that I would be stranded  on a desert Island with.  This story has passed the test of time and  Fitzgeralds translation is as timeless, a true classic.<br />I also suggest  his translation of the Aenied and Odyessy	2000-06-18

But after reading Dune I devoured everything Frank Herbert wrote.  <br />This book is about life on the desert plant Arakkis.  While you read this book you will think about every  drop of water you drink and every bead of sweat you prespire.  The plot  never is straight forward or predictable. Frank Herbert is willing to spend  time on the characters that he is willing to destroy early in the book.   This is intresting because you don't have a clue who is going to survive  the intruge of this book because any character no matter how well developed  may be destroyed or corrupted.  Sounds like life doesn't it.  <br />I do not  believe a world like Dune will ever happen but if you are looking to read a  book just for the pleasure of reading than this is a great book.  While the  sciecne of the book is out there the political and emotional strain on the  characters make Herbert's world seem very real.	2000-06-16

It documents the policy, actions and atrocities that were commmited by the Spainish, english and other settlers of the Americas.  <br />The book shows how the natives after starting with  friendly relations and cooperation with early settlers were in turn   demonized, murdered and enslaved.  Documentation from the letters of the  founding fathers of the US and documents from spanish missions tell of  plauges and systematic depopulation thru forced labor.  <br />As well  scienticific evidence about deteration of diet and health of native  americans.  Like the Jewish holocaust this well document course of event is  attached as incredible, yet the documentation and record used are hard to  refute.  The policies of Thomans Jefferson and Goerge Washington alone are  worth reading about.<br />The book also attachs the continuing demonization of  native americans and the lies that the native american population was  better off being intergrated into Europian culture and that its culture had  no merit or accomplishment.  <br />Histroy often goes to the victors, but  geneations later the hiden truth comes out.  Anyone wanting to understand  the history of america and its founding should read  this book.	2000-06-16

I am not a huge Sci- fi fan but I am  very loyal to the work of Frank Herbert.  Who creates plots with in plots  with in plots.

But I am guessing that you  didn't read three books without liking them.  This is Herberts Pinnicle  DUNE, DUNE MESSIAH, and CHILDREN OF DUNE were the preface to this book.

It is not an attack nor praise of Ayn Rand <br />  Anyone who has read Rand has been effected in some way. I used to be quite a disciple of Rand, but as life went on I saw and learned more and  saw some flaws with Rand.  Rands biggest flaw  was the hubris of not  believing that she could be anything but rational.  Like all humans our  emotions effect our choices.  Rand was a great for arguing justification  for her actions, to protect herself from being labeled emotional.  Rand's  chief flaw was she did not try to balance her emotions in her  rationaliztion of the world. This is all to true in Rand's case.  <br />I have  learned some good things from Rand, but this book brings an objective view  of Rand( no pun intended).  All thinkers great or otherwise have flaws and  those who wish to think for themselves must look at how the philospher  practiced what she preached.<br />Rand was, for all her hatered of  manipulation, a professional manipulator of her readers, followers and  lovers. She was a propent of reason always yet she indulged in unrealistic  hero worship of her husband and had the most irrational love affair with  her hier-apparent. An affair that drastically hurt spread of her philosphy   at the pinicle of her success.   She was at the center of a philosophy that  shaped the economic views of Alan Greenspan, and created the zelots like  Leonard Pekoff. <br />I do not think that every thing that Rand wrote was  wrong but this book helped me to question Rand and to see flaws that the  hard-core objectivist community would rather not see the light of day.	2000-06-15

River Out Eden and the Blind Watch Maker. The Blind Watch maker is more complex and more detailed.  But River out of Eden lays out Darwinian theory  beatifully and in an understandable form. Darwin is hard to read and this  book flows well for the lay person (Such as Chemical engineers like my  self)  <br /> He confronts the attacks agianst Darwin by creationist and  biologist alike.  He is a great defender of Darwin.  If you are a scientist  outside biology this is a great book, a great book for young students  confused by Darwin, and for Creationist who want to understand their Chief  opponents (Darwin and Dawkins). <br />Some of the Dawkins ideas such as the  idea of the selfish Gene and his ideas on Gene &quot;cooperation&quot; are  described in this book. If you want a taste of Dawkins read this book. If  you like itand want more detailed imformation and theory read the blind  watchmaker.<br />I rate this book as one of the most important books  that  I  have ever read.	2000-06-15

Again as in fight club there is long lists of free assoctaion like text.  But these listing of things fit the  character better.  The main character Tender Branson is built from the  ground up where in fight club the character just appear.  Tender is part of  a defunct cult whose remaining members are killing themselve and some times  being murdered.  There supporting characters are better than in fight club  they are more every day than realistic than those of fight club.  (IE these  people would avoid getting beaten up but they tend to be a little less  afraid of killing themselves)  Fertility Holis adds mistery and excitement  with her Cassandra complex. She is always in the background springout  adding a new dimension to the story.  <br />Again as FC it is a first person  narritive with a character in  a strange position that is very destructive  in nature.  Again like FC the  book looks into the interesting phemomena of  the creation of a Messiah figure and shows the danger of being and  following these strange men. There is some violence in this book but unlike  fight club the violence comes off as very unenpowering.

This book is good for those with or without a strong science background<br />This book is the second best book  of all time on the general description of the ideas of Darwin the first is  the ORIGIN OF SPECIES.  This book is more readable than the ORIGIN and  includes the exciting evidence of DNA and Genitics that happend after  darwin.  <br />It also confronts most the attacks on Darwin from both  scientists and creationist. I am a scientist and I believe in the theory of  evolution this book is the clearest explaination of the theory in a form  written for general consumption.  I challenge anyone who flatly refutes the  theory of evolution to read this book.  For you will have to face Dawkins  (and lets not forget Mr. Darwin and Mendell). I believe this book will have  a strong effect on you wether you agree with it or not.	2000-06-15

If you like the movie read the book.  Reading the book gave me a different feeling than the movie the movie is very convincing in its attacks of materialism and 9-5  life.  As you read the book you start to see that alot of the material is  rehashed nihilism mixed with a little masochism.  The book pushes alot of  pop culture buttons that Ihave heard before  such as material positions and  owning property lead to numbness and weakness, men are weakened because of  lack of male role models and because they are raised by women, vilolence  brings a hire sense of male potency and awareness, you can know your self  only through self destuciton and hitting rock bottom.  BUT the book is  Entertaining, even if it is only to count how many pulp culture mantras it  chants.<br />The characters are complex and do embrace there self destructive  nature.  This book is about hitting bottom and it is done in a believalbe  fasion until about the end where things get a little to out of hand to be  believable.  I started reading Survivor.  Which is better so far both books  main characters become twisted messias of sort self destruction is a big  theme in both books.	2000-06-12

If you ever end -up talking baseball for hours with your friends then pick this book up.  Because it is like talking about baseball with Ted Williams.  You get to hear how an ecenteric kid grows up to be the best hitter ever,  but still be an ecentric man.  I never read a book by someone who loved his  work as much as Williams, even with the disapiontments of his life.  The  book is realistic in its prespective.  Williams is matter of fact (endless  cool facts and pitching hitting deuls) about the negatives in his carrer.   He shows his obessive side and professional drive all at once.  BONUS GREAT  PICTURES OF WILLIAMS AND OTHER GREAT PLAYERS!  I also suggest my  favorite baseball book of all time My Luke and I by Elanor Gerhig (OUT OF  PRINT BUT DEFINATLY worth the hunt)	2000-06-12

I am  a chemical engineer in the oil industry and this book intrests me for obvious reason, but... This book is about the impact oil and mankind has had on each other.  Oil has shaped the world economy and power  structure in business and goverment since it was first drilled for in Penn.  This book is more about the intrigue than technology.  The goals of this  book is to show how man hads become to depend on oil without knowing it.   How oil has shaped history, warfare and peace.  I have had several friends  who are not engineers  say that they have loved this book.  No hard science  background is needed.  Yergin is weaves a story of people and their  fasination and fixation to control the worlds supply of oil.  THE PRIZE is  the perfect title.	2000-06-12

The tale of the mans history alone is worth reading even if he wasn't a figure that has effected american culture.  Malcolm X was not a  stagnant figure he was changing as he learned.  He progressed from a  huslter to disiciple to a leader and in these transitions he learned to  challenge his beliefs and the beliefs of others.  Malcolm X was a man who  at the time of his death began to challenge the hatered of others and his  own hatered.<br />The second fasinating thing about this book is that the  book is told in a real time manner.  So that you actaul see the transitions  in ideas of X. Huxley did a great job as  ghost writer.<br />The third thing  that is great is seeing the interal workings of the nation of islam. I am  an atheist yet this was very fasinating to me.  I disagree with alot of the  nations views on race, but understanding racism starts with understanding  the philosophy of the racist and the ignorance that that philosophy  premotes.  The theroy of the disemiation of races given by the nation is  one of the most inconcieveable things I have ever read.	2000-06-12

A love story that is realistic because of the lover's imperfection. Love is not a stagent idea in this book.  One sees both the pragmatism of rejected love and devotion to the idea of love.   The characters are unpredictable and complex.  The main love triange in  the story is suported by the richness of supporting characters.  The  supporting characters take on short main story line roles. This book is  about all the aspects and degree of love.  Devotion,regection, love, lust,  fidelity and infidelity are all mixed.  The characters struggle with their  relationship, which are fluid and unpredictable as life is.  The only love  story that is as realistic and challenges the reader as much is the Elornor  Gehrigs  My Luke and I.  This is some of the best fiction that exist!	2000-05-09

I have owned this book for 11 years it is simplily the best that I have ever read.  Millay words are elegant and precise. Her themes and her passion for them makes her timeless.  Your libary is incomplete without  EDNA ST. VINCENT MILLAY.  I have studied poets from around the word, yet  none have matched her poems.  I am lucky to have discovered her work so  early in life.	1999-03-21

Readable and complete, for first organic classes	I have read several texts in chemistry and engineering, and organic is not my favorite subject, but this is in my top three texts of all time.  I recomend it esspecialy for those without P chem.  This is a great first  organic book and its contents are applicable for useages with more advanced  classes.  Any chemist or biologist could use a copy and  the study problem  guide is an assest worth the 40 dollors if this is a text for your class.	1998-11-13

It is a great reference book with a philosphy that diabetes is  to be controled by you and not you by it. It covers all types of diabetes,  treatment, insulin, diet, exercise, complication, pregnecy, and how to deal  with your new cronic disease so that one can live a full life. <br />I  recomend this book for all diabetics because of the source, the ease of  understanding, and the professionalism of its approach as well as it has  tons of useful information.

It is a balanced diet based on  the amount of protien consumed by the musles each day and the ratio of fats  and carbohydrates.  Sear's endoreses 1 protien unit 7 grams or 73 calories  or 57% of cal to 9 grams of carbs or 42 cals or 32.5% to 1.5 grams of fat  or 13.5 cal or 10.5 %.  Ketosis only commonly occurs in type I diabetics  like myself this is cause because my body does not produce insulin any  longer and fats are burned to survive at such a high rate that the bodies  ketone level rises.  Non-diabetics need not worry about there diet causing  KETOSIS. Diabetics must consult there doctors and find the right insulin  regiment to match there carbohydrate intake!!! The cause of Ketosis is that  the diabetic did not take enough insulin!! This will not happen if the  diabetic monitors his sugars and will only most likely happen if the  diabetic is ill (this diet or any other may not change this) or if a  diabetic stops his insulin injections, which is likened to suicide.  This  is a diet based on maintaining a chemical balance based on how much protien  is destoyed by the musle ware and tare, by fuel needs ie carbs and fat  needed to regulate your biochemistry!!!  This balanced diet will help  diabetics establish a steady supply of sugar so insulin control may be  better.  I have seen 3 poeple on this diet lose wait then stablize on a fix  wait that only changed if they excercised more and increased musle mass!!!   This diet will help the type 1 dieabetic face his greatest enemy  hypoglycema.  The diet has a low sugar in take ie 32 % vs the 60+% diet  that I was put on.  If I am not very careful with a high carbo diet my  sugar can be all over the place.  The lower sugar ie carb diewt (carbs are  converted to glucose ie sugar) The more carbs of different types ie various  amount of sugar can lead to more insulin reactions a controled medium sugar  diet with steady intake ie eat atleast every five hours and eat foods that  are slow absorbing will lead to less insulin hypoglycemea.  <br />This is  chemistry that has won the NOBLE PRIZE!! Sear's is right about the  importance of insulin. Anyone intersted in reading more facts about insulin  should read  Diabetes be David Nathan MD or the AMERICAN DIABETES  ASSOCATION Complete Home Guide to Diabetes.
