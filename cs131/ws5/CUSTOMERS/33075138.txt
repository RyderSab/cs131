When I was done reading it I practically called everyone I know I told them to GET IT! <br /> <br />It is one of the most hilarious things I have EVER read. Augusten's crazy mom, her crazy therapist, his crazy family, and his own crazy behavior are just unbelievably outragous and bizarre that it gives new meaning to \\"you can't make this stuff up.\\" <br /> <br />Bizarre is definately the best word for this. On one hand you are left feeling like WOW someone has a life wierder than my own how could they of survived that? And yet at the same time you really get to thinking about the strangeness in your own life and you WILL chuckle at a couple of the crazy stories when you find yourself identifying. <br /> <br />Augusten definately takes stories that could be depressing and tragic and makes them profoundly funny. There really is no neatly wrapped \\"moral to the story\\" even though you really feel there should be. <br /> <br />He is definately a gifted writer and shares the most appropriate details that enhance the stories so much. <br /> <br />I honestly don't know it is just such an amazing book by such an amazing author, a REALLY amazing story that you cannot believe is true but at the same time it HAS to be! Read it!	2005-03-10

Brock definately achieves all he sets out to! This books definately uncovers and documents the systematic attack on the media by the extremely well organized, well funded, and zealous right wing. If you are baffled by how well the conservative movement is doing in America (especially in the last election) then this book is definately for you because Brock answers ALL your questions. The book basically destroys the idea that there is a \\"liberal media bias\\" and proves that that notion is actually a myth created by Republican billionaires and think tanks in order to destroy objectivity and real balance and replace it with vicious conservative bias. If you want to read exactly how the Right hijacked the media and now uses it as a distributor of its propaganda read this book.	2005-03-10

It is definately the most realistic approach to the subject and I applaud the author's goals - finding the evidence of what could be the original inspiration for the stories of the Amazons. The book does not, like others, write off Amazons as a fantasy from the beginning and use them only to espouse various feminist ideas. It also doesn't have a stubborn faith that the Amazons existed EXACTLY as told in myth and stretch little amounts of evidence to the breaking point trying to \\"prove\\" their existence. And even though it does eventually HAVE to leave the subject of the mythical Greek Amazons and dig further and further back in time in many different cultures it is far from an \\"encyclopedia\\" of EVERY single woman in HISTORY that has ever been assertive. <br /> <br />Because it was so realistic, though, it does come off very dry and researchy. <br /> <br />I really don't know what to say about this book. It wasn't one of my favorites on the subject although it probably is the most useful and informative. If you have a big interest in the subject of Amazons and ancient history and archaeology then you'll appreciate this (maybe not like, but appreciate). But if you are looking for something that really invokes the fantasy and passion and obsession with the Amazons and what they have come to stand for then you definately have to look elsewhere.	2005-02-14

The conviction and passion of Julia Hill definately come across full force. She's a very wise person and her observations about life are thoroughly thought-provoking. I must say I didn't know much if at anything at all about the whole Luna tree-sit before reading this. So I cannot comment about how well it documents the episode. I did assume from the relatively short length of the book and the fact that she does generally just share her own personal, inward stories from her time in Luna that it wasn't a great chronicle of the entire activity around the tree-sit. However as an inspirational book to fire up the activist in you (or just to help you do what you know is right) it's perfect!	2005-02-08

Ellen's mom tells pretty much the whole story here! But it's far from an E! True Hollywood Story type EXPOSE. Its a warm, human, family story that makes you laugh and cry! Betty tells not only Ellen's life story but her own and her son's and her sisters' and basically the entire family is touched on here. And it really is a beautifully written very real story. Betty is most definately a gifted writer. If you're an Ellen fan this book is definately for you. But you really don't have to be to enjoy the wonderful collection of personal stories that Betty shares. They could be stories from anyone's family, not just a celebrity's. I think that was the best thing about this book: where other celebrity biographies are usually sensationalistic and extraordinary this book humanizes Ellen and her family and her story.	2005-02-08

I came about reading this book in an unusual fashion and it surpassed all my expectations!<br />I was originally going to read the book because a neighbor had said it was quite racey. I'm much more of a Jackie Collins fan than a Christian historical fiction fan! So when I started reading the book and found out it was Christian-themed I was alittle put off.<br />Then my mom read it and spoke SO highly of it that I decided to give it another shot.<br />And it really is a great book! Well worth every minute and every word! Obviously I wasn't reading it for it's religious relevance like most of Francine Rivers' fans. But I still found it to be extraordinary! Sort of like a Christian Mists of Avalon. Definately up there with the best historical fiction and fantasy books ever written!<br />Its brutally real and adult and I know why my neighbor would advertise it as racey. The atmosphere Francine brings to life in ancient Ephesus actually seems almost modern its so cosmopolitan. The characters are all realistically flawed and deep. The struggles are attention-grabbing and keep you reading.<br />Toward the end of the book its almost like a great mystery novel and you literally can't put it down until you find out what happens! VERY well written, well thought-out book!<br />Of course it is a religious-themed book and can get preachy at times. And the miracles and spiritual happenings in it are clearly fantasy packaged as truth. But for the open-minded reader it's barely noticeable.<br />My only REAL bone to pick is with the happily-ever-after ending that would of gone better in a Disney movie. For such a realistic, adult novel a fairytale ending wasn't what I was expecting but its what I got. For that reason alone I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars but since I can't 4 will have to do!	2004-06-15

Jackie takes all the stereotypes of Hollywood celebrities and throws them together into a glamor-packed soup of gossip and subplots! Like a 500-page tabloid! The characters are all true-to-form spoiled, self-obsessed divas. The goings on are appropriately scandalous. The many talents and many husbands, the wild rich kids, the gay followers, it's all here!<br />The perfect Hollywood novel it may not have much substance but since that's what's expected of its subjects it's just perfect!	2004-04-19

I agree with the reviewers who claim alot was glossed over. But I think that it was still a beautiful story about a truly beautiful (inside and out) woman who has lived an above-average life. I also really feel, despite questions about accuracy, that she gives an Arab perspective on the Middle East that you don't often hear in America. But above all else it really is a King and I, Grace Kelly type story taking place in a totally foreign, exotic, and unstable region. I personally was inspired by Queen Noor's choices and work with the people and the wonderful things she and her husband achieved.	2004-03-22

I must expect I started reading it expecting trashy behind-the-scenes adult industry stories. TOTALLY not what this book is. Traci tells her whole story with shocking candor and honesty and detail.<br />What emerges is a rather typical story of an abused teenage girl from midwestern ghettos moving to California and falling into nude modeling and porn films. But far from trashy pornographic stories Traci deals with things truthfully and to the point. In fact her career in the adult industry takes up a TINY FRACTION of the book. Most of the story is how she got there and how she got out and where she is now. Which all makes for better stories than anything her drugged-out, overhyped days in porn could produce.<br />She really is a remarkable woman not just in spite of her traumatic childhood but because of it. You can tell the personal work that she's gone through to become who she is today - very ambitious, persevering, and wise-beyond-her-years.<br />My only problem with the book is that, naturally, Traci takes a very rigid stance against the adult industry and refuses to believe it can be anything but the pool of drugs and abuse she got into. Which of course is what happens when a teenager, barely 16, gets into an ADULT business. But aside from Traci's expected scorn for porn the book and she were VERY impressive.	2004-03-22

This book I felt was more of a tribute to Richard Dawkins himself than his other books that speak so movingly on Darwinism and evolution and natural selection. This one contains more moving and intelligent discussions on those topics but the seven sections that make it up are much more eclectic.<br />The first section is definately a wonderful starting line! The first article, the namesake of the book, is some of the most inspirational and beautiful words on the topic of an educated, rational, scientific view of life I have ever read. It brought me close to tears and I think is an important thing for anybody that shares Richard's zest for an inquisitive, skeptical view of life to read.<br />The second section is mostly Richard's continued admiration of Charles Darwin and his work. The first two articles are titled \\"Light Will Be Thrown\\" and \\"Darwin Triumphant\\" and I think the titles speak for themselves. My only bone to pick is that in this section Richard devotes under a page and a half to subject of homosexuality and genetics. As a gay man I have always been interested in Richard's thoughts on the subject and the short, curt, dare I say brush off of the topic I felt was cheating the readers of his signature wit and incredible logic and crystal clear communication of ideas.<br />Section three was a collection of some of Richard's passionate, bold words on the subject of religion. In a culture (especially in America) where religion is untouchable and immune from scrutiny I applaud Richard's bravery in taking on the subject with his incredible talents of logic. The last essay in the section, \\"Time To Stand Up\\", is infused with post-911 urgency and are truly inspiring words from an atheist's point of view.<br />Section 4 is a collection of eulogies and such for late friends of Richard's. A beautiful assortment of words that make the reader feel as if they knew the honored personally.<br />Section 5 documents the debates and agreements between Richard and Stephen Jay Gould. A wonderful chapter that showcases some stellar educated skirmishes between two great minds.<br />Section 6 is perhaps the most personal section. With the connecting theme of Africa Richard shares personal stories from his involvement with the continent through being born there and his acquaintances with important people doing important work there.<br />The last section is just a \\"prayer\\" for his daughter Juliet. An inspiring argument for reason and science as opposed to the trickery of tradition, authority, and revelation, I feel like the letter could of been written to Richard's readers as well as an admonishon to continue searching for the cold hard truth of fact and evidence.<br />Altogether a wonderful book by a wonderful man!	2004-02-09

From growing up in International Falls, Minnesota to being the queen of the largest Christian television network to being the scorn of millions in and out of the Christian community. And all the steps inbetween. She candidly shares every detail (including some of her sex life!) of her rise and fall from power and her struggle to pick up the pieces of her life. Every struggle, every behind-the-scenes moment, every misconception and every mistake NOT widely known about!<br />Tammy definately had a life worth reading about. She sheds revealing backstage light on some of the biggest names in Christianity today - Paul and Jan Crouch, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, etc. etc. etc. All with a genuine spirit of forgiveness.<br />Tammy is definately a beautiful soul and a beautiful person who deserves to be heard. In the book she says, \\"I believe that truth is truth. What happened happened and is now history. I just want history to be told correctly for my children's sake and for the sake of my grandchildren and generations to come.\\" I think that we all should hear the truth from this woman whose ENTIRE life was devoted to openly sharing with people.<br />Whether you agree with her religion or not (for the record I don't but I still enjoyed every word and think she's fabulous) her general love for everybody, including those that hurt and betrayed her in a colossal manner, shines!<br />Don't judge a book by it's cover or a televangelist by her makeup!!!	2004-02-05

If there's anything wrong with this book it's that he scaled it too much and climbed way too far for the average reader.<br />The first half of the book is fabulous! Some of the best writing on the subject of Darwinism and evolution ever! Very accessible and easy to understand. Especially chapters 4 and 5 give you the confidence that the next time somebody challenges evolution you have the answers to make a solid point for it. Classic Dawkins, he explains the evolution of the eye and the wing in terms anybody can understand. Using computer programs and the example of spider webs he makes solid, visual cases for natural selection. Definately applaudable.<br />It's the second half of the book that I had a hard time with. I feel like he delved too deep (or too high in this case) and tried to explain things that didn't need explaining and gave too many disjointed examples of what he was trying to say. In fact he threw out the whole central theme of the book - Mount Improbable - and tried to explore the idea of this multi-dimensional mathematic cube. And I'm sorry it made little sense. He should of stuck with the central theme of the book.<br />And where he expertly explained the eye and the wing because they are a favorite bone to pick with creationists, he went off on shells and &quot;kaleidoscopic embryos&quot; for no aparent purpose.<br />Chapter 9 was basically a super-condensed version of The Selfish Gene which I suppose he included because not everybody has read that great book. But it still seemed superfluous to the main point of the book.<br />He returns to his point at the end of the book thankfully but by then you feel like it should of ended a long time ago and you get the point enough to work out his final examples.<br />But better safe than sorry, right? It's enough that he tackled such an important issue as the improbability of evolution, using his unparalled excellence at explaining the &quot;peaks&quot; of &quot;Mount Improbable&quot; in language that everyone can understand.	2004-02-01

Chapters 3-5 particularly go into scientific areas one feels that Dawkins himself doesn't wholely understand and therefore you feel as if you're trusting him that he's getting the explanation right.<br />However he does his best and his best is better than most! Also he should be forgiven for delving deep into a variety of subjects considering his applaudable goal of showing without-a-doubt the poetic and aesthetic brilliance that can and SHOULD be found in science of all kinds.<br />While I feel that the book was sadly lacking in his wonderful writing on the topics of religion and theology (most of the time he touches on these topics only to make the point that statistics and mathematics are more reliable) it still accomplishes his point of showcasing the wonders of sciences often assumed to be dull and lifeless.<br />A wonderful read for anybody looking for the pizazze in science  and fact that is generally believed only to be found in fairy tales and illusions.	2004-01-25

FABULOUS book that could only of been written by Tammy!<br />Its not particularly deep as the title would suggest but it does touch points that I think anybody would understand and identify with. Its basically a collection of thoughts and feelings and stories. But they are unmistakably from Tammy Faye and her wit and sense of humor and general zest permeate everything! One of the truly well-written, personal books by a \\"celebrity\\" where one feels they really made a connection with the author.<br />As somebody whose interests in Tammy come from her role as a gay icon, not a televangelist, the book can get preachy at times and if you're not into reading the Bible you'd better avoid whole sections of the book as the Bible and Christian ideas are oft-quoted and Tammy is clearly rooted in her faith. But I really feel that her faith is as much a part of her as her false eyelashes! In fact she is one of those Christians that really have that inner light they are all striving for and even if you don't agree with the particulars of her religion she has an undeniably beautiful spirit.<br />OF COURSE most of the book IS about false eyelashes...and clothes and wigs and purses and shoes and shopping!<br />Its just a hilariously fun ride through the mind of a hilariously fun person who has seen and survived alot!	2004-01-25

While the average reader can definately understand pretty much everything, Dawkins' logic and reasoning abilities are breathtaking and you're almost shocked you can go along for the ride!<br />Everything is thoroughly reachable and Dawkins has a fabulous knack at explaining things! I DEFINATELY think they should teach this book in Highschool Biology! I didn't understand ANYTHING about evolution and natural selection from text books but this book was an AMAZING tool at understanding those concepts!<br />He gives so many examples and simple but profoundly real explanations that toward the end of the book you really feel like a genius and like you know it all!<br />I definately, definately recommend this book for the reader with no prior scientific interest or experience and definately to ANYBODY with an interest in natural selection and evolution.	2004-01-20

The rest of the stories in the book similarly are a mix of the completely mundane and usual and the mythical and extraordinary. Like the Greek myths updated for our time. On one hand the stories are about single mothers, college students, divorcees, troubled teens, hookers, orphans, nannies, office workers, best friends, and hapless husbands. But on the other they are stories of Eos, Artemis, Selene, mermaids, Nereids, Ra, Hades, and Helios. Kate Atkinson magically weaves these themes together in such a way that you are never bored and can never pinpoint the separation of fantasy from reality.	2003-12-28

A fabulous collection of her very personal memoirs and stories and advice, it's almost like having a conversation with the archetypical grandmother. But far from old-fashioned and foppish, Miss Doris is downright hilarious at times and speaks with the energy and zeal of somebody less than half her age (in fact, she puts most young people to shame when it comes to fully embracing and enjoying life). Her stories, taking place everywhere from New York theatre to Los Angeles tv to her bedroom, are all colorful and more entertaining than fiction ever could be. You can't make this stuff up! She opens herself up admirably, sharing her personal struggles and her darkest times as well as her triumphs and good days. Throughout, the conversational style of her and Danelle Morton's writing makes you feel more like you are spending time with a friend than reading a book. If you want advice from somebody who has been there before, or colorful tales from the world of entertainment, or a touching autobiography, or an endless source of laughter, or just some fabulous recipes (which the book is peppered with) then this book is for you!	2003-12-28

This is your guide to being a capital BIG Glamazon with a hunger for men, food, and fashion. As far as fat acceptance goes there are books that have done a better job. Mo'Nique deals pretty narrowly with people exactly like her. I know BIG girls that could care less about whether designer fashions come in plus sizes. And while Mo'Nique stresses FAT peoples' love of buffets and eating I know plenty of the EXTRA LARGE that get stuffed after two bites and plenty of evil skinny ones that could inhale a Hometown Buffet. And while I myself do worship the ground Lane Bryant walks on and took frequent snack breaks while reading the book I found Mo'Nique's relationship advice for BIG girls anti-feministic at best and degrading at worst.<br />But technicalities over her positions on the struggles of the large-and-in-charge don't overshadow the fact that this is a fabulous conversation with Mo'Nique who delivers her opinions and insights with her signature (and definately larger than life) attitude and comedy.	2003-11-18

Especially for a book of its size! The story never gets stale or dull, the characters never lose your interest. In fact, in some ways, the story grips your interest tighter and tighter as it progresses and doesn't even let go on the last page!<br />Some of the best writing I've come across in a long time as well. It was over 400 pages and I just couldn't put it down! Be prepared to read it 100 pages at a time (if you're lucky and don't read it all the way through)!<br />While certainly a decadent story, it isn't in any way empty fluff. Despite their obvious and sometimes heinous character flaws you definately are captivated and endeared to the main characters and even some side characters! Yet at the same time it manages to not be wholly depressing - just unapologetically real! And the lighthearded, humorous moments that occur naturally act further to attach you to the story and the book.<br />The book didn't foster any emotional reactions, as tales of tradgedy and such usually do. But I think it was meant that way. Because the characters AREN'T necessarily tragic! Just struggling. And their struggles definately create a hunger to get to their conclusions - no matter what they may be, happy endings or further tradgedies.<br />The only negative thing about this book is its reflection of real life.

Ok, so, I picked up this book because it was mentioned in the movie To Wong Foo and I thought, &quot;Well this better be fabulous!&quot;<br />Boi was fabulous an understatement! Why can't I give this book 6 stars?!?!<br />This is one of the few books where I can agree with all of the fluffy praise quotes peppering the cover LOL<br />A simply gorgeous work, Diana Vreeland is a fabulous, fabulous woman! Such taste! Such elegance! Such style! This is a MUST READ for everyone that wants an example of a true lady!<br />D.V. isn't just about clothes and decorating. While admittingly not a feminist, Mrs. Vreeland is obviously an independent, determined, disciplined woman who is, if not a role model, an inspiration to all!<br />God, I can't even put into words the qualities of this book that are just overwhelmingly fabulous! Its like anything full of good taste (although, as Diana points out, alittle bad taste is needed sometimes, its NO taste that's truly revolting) and true elegance, it leaves one feeling better about themselves and the world around them.	2003-10-11

Not to offend the generation of gay men that this book presumes to speak for but it was whiney and pathetic! Its got elements of all of Holleran's stories (which are all just different facets of Dancer From the Dance) but its not a viewpoint I particularly care for. It takes itself too seriously, again, like its the voice of a generation. Christopher Isherwood did that in A Single Man and it was bad enough. Holleran is doing it and being whiny! Whine whine whine, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS. Superficial, shallow musings about being superficial and shallow. And whereas Dancer From the Dance had that unapologetic feeling and clearly stated it was looking at a microcosm of society, The Beauty of Men is completely apologetic and never bothers to make the distinction that not all gay men are lonely, dying queens humiliating themselves and feeling ashamed. Its ridiculous. Holleran *really* let me down. It picked up SOMEWHAT by the end but not enough to justify the whole book. And unfortunately Holleran's writing style that can describe the decadent setting of New York so beautifully does little justice to more rural settings like those of the book.<br />Here's what I have to say about Andrew Holleran:<br />Read Dancer From the Dance. If you loved it and want more of it, browse through In September the Light Changes. And I mean browse. And if you're *STILL* in love with Holleran give Nights in Aruba a shot. And basically don't EVER read The Beauty of Men. If you think you want to father Andrew Holleran's children and can't imagine not liking a book of his then read A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood and ask yourself if you want to read the exact same story plot but really long, whiney, and handled badly by Holleran (despite his godlike status he must hold in your mind to even *consider* reading this piece of trash).	2003-10-04

Its basically just her espousal of liberal politics. Which don't get me wrong, I agreed with her on everything and of course it was delivered with her comedic wit. But that's really all this book is. Its not that autobiographical, it really doesn't make a solid point. Its just a collection of Whoopi's various opinions on various hot topics. My only real &quot;problem&quot; with the book is that instead of trying to make a valid point, instead of trying to change things with her opinion it seems like she's just whining alot. I mean she may be a celebrity but mulling over your opinions in a book isn't gonna get anything done. So I say run for governor, girlfriend!	2003-09-17

But hey, its Ellen DeGeneres what do you expect? Well, I suppose it didn't actually meet my expectations. It was rather shallow and not meaty at all to say the least. It was kinda just a collection of jokes and wit. Nothing personal was in it at all. In fact it was the opposite of personal as you could tell that 99% of the stories in it were made up to be funny. She wasn't even out yet so there were some hetero-oriented references in there that seemed wholly out of place. But again it was hilarious because it was Ellen and she's funny. And it only took me one night to read it which was what I was looking for at the time having come off of a binge of actual memoirs with substance. So really if you're looking for something to keep your brain occupied this isn't for you at all. But if you love Ellen DeGeneres you'll like this.	2003-09-11

Seriously I think I enjoyed his WRITING more in this than in any of his novels.<br />Also, \\"The Penthouse\\" (one of the stories) was DIVINE! I give \\"The Penthouse\\" like 100 stars! I read it twice!<br />HOWEVER, I cannot give this book more than 3 stars because...with only a few exceptions...all the stories are the same. They are all about gay men in New York in the 70's. All of them. Even ones that are technically set later on or in a different place INEVITABLY end up about gay men in New York in the 70's. And I'm sorry there's too many stories to justify the lack of diversity in subject. When place names, events, and pretty much characters themselves are repeating from story to story it gets old.<br />I really wish this book was shorter and included a cross-section of the stories in there. Heck, if it was just \\"The Penthouse\\" I would of been supremely happy. Even Andrew Holleran's fabulous writing can't save the stale subjects he ruminates on endlessly.<br />However if you love Holleran as I do, and are in the mood to search for the diamond in the rough (did I mention \\"The Penthouse\\" yet?) then I recommend!	2003-08-30

I think the writing was gorgeous, the characters were fabulous, and the story was good enough to keep me hooked. And I realize that the point of the book is to be rather mundane and maybe alittle melancholy (?) but it wasn't something I particularly enjoyed reading. It seemed like instead of focusing on some kind of story or plot it was focusing on ridiculous details. Plus there's nothing particularly deep about it. I was left at the end like, &quot;Oh, ok . . .&quot;<br />But if you're into that kind of book then go for it, honey!	2003-08-30

Part autobiography, part commentary on the struggle for \\"fat acceptance\\", this book is mostly Camryn saying \\"I've been there too\\" to anyone that's had to deal with descrimination or just plain being picked on! I recommend it to anyone and ESPECIALLY to people who are fat and ready to wake up!

In a way its worth reading as a coming out story and the writing was good enough to keep me reading. But the story...not so much. I found alot of the stuff that happened wierd at best and ridiculous at worst. And the end {bites}. I mean I got to the end and was like...um...ok...? I can't say I regretted reading it but at the same time its not something I need to remember. It jumps around alot, and it lacks valid plot points as far as I'm concerned.

I was in love with the book by page 1 when it opened with the story of the author, a madam, and her girls in jail for not the first time being harrassed by street hookers ratting their wigs and doing their nails. But this isn't some sad HBO documentary! It really is...a celibration almost of human sexuality and the people who cater to its needs.

The book is not about a non-traditional family. Its about very different, somewhat disturbed people dealing with their neurosis and never really winning. I've come to find Cunningham's work pretty stark, brutal, and somewhat dark and this is by far the best example of that. If you liked the darker, macabre aspects of The Hours this is for you.<br />In a positive note though and the reason this gets 2 stars from me - Michael is a STELLAR writer.

Some witty, funny stories and insights from the glamorous red carpet world. That's pretty much all this book has to offer. The rest of the space is the tale of the author's attempts to make it in Hollywood as...whatever it is he is. The major flaw of the book is the fact that Steven put himself into it way too much and for such a colorful person his life story is far from the autobiography of a starlet. Honestly you read more about what HE'S wearing than what the stars are wearing. And he's not the best writer in the world.

In a way it does feel very dated. The first part of the book about the main character's childhood is actually very hard to get through as it centers around early 1900's religious life. The morals of the time are very hard to understand and the seriousness and gravity with which they're treated can throw modern, liberal readers off. And the funniest thing I found was that the word \\"gay\\" is used in the book a million times but NEVER to mean homosexual! So it is quite dated feeling. But again, its a priceless story of a time pre-Boy Meets Boy (that doesn't involve suicide or some other tragedy)! And as a gay person I think its an invaluable look at where we've come from and just how far we've gotten!	2003-08-20

The book is really a very inspiring tale of love and life and everday, universal struggles (despite the fact its mainly about fame, the music industry, battles with cancer, and the struggles of lesbians).

Because despite the fact that Bobbi herself is a hugely successful artist she tones down her advice DRASTICALLY assuming that the average reader couldn't handle a brush or a pencil to save her own life. It becomes almost condescending at points when she says what should be left up to professional makeup artists and when she dictates what colors go with your skin and hair color and exactly the way you should apply them...everyday! She leaves little to no room for imagination and seems to think you'll seriously INJUR yourself if you go too far with your makeup. Someone should really tell her its JUST MAKEUP! ITS NOT PERMANENT!

I give it 4 stars because it does revolve around the sex, drugs, and disco lifestyle that alot of people don't find particularly positive. And also the characters really are a sea of dancing faces with no real depth. But if you can get past that and see the book for the slice of brutally honest gay history that it is and appreciate the lives that were lived that way it really is a fabulous, fabulous book.	2003-08-20

But it manages to! Michael's spectacular writing is definately a factor, as are the supremely interesting characters and some of the best dialogue I've ever read! I was thoroughly intrigued all the way through this giant of a story.<br />HOWEVER!!! I literally threw the book down in disgust at the end because after holding my attention that long I don't feel the ending does justice to the characters or respects the reader at ALL! It must be one of the dullest, most depressing, raw endings I've ever encountered! And to be sucked along for 500 pages for that is a MAJOR let down! I realize Michael is not the kind of author you expect a fairytale ending from but after dedicating myself to for so long to the story I definately felt SOMETHING positive could've happened. Hell, something NEGATIVE could've happend! Something needed to happen! The ending really falls off. Maybe that would work in a short story but NOT in such a thick novel!	2003-08-20

A true unveiling of the Herstory that needs to be told! This book is really an encyclopedia with entry upon entry of strong, brave, and heroic women! The author uses various sources, historical and mythological to tell the stories of these women who you'll never hear about in any other accounting of history! A pretty exhaustive source for heroines I only wish she could write an entire book about every one of the entries!!!	2003-08-20
