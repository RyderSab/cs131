Just as Naked Rooms was a radically different project from his first book, Naked In Apartment 7, this new work is another departure for him. But this time the results are more mature in their result and set Gorman on an even higher artistic plain. Gone are the highly stylized setups that characterized his first book, and the fluid, documentary style that distinguished his second book is no longer in force here. What we have is a more stable body of work from an artist who appears to possess a stronger sense of himself, and who harnesses a greater command of his craft. Gorman admits to shooting more \\"from the hip\\"  these days, and all this work was shot in the unknown terrain of his female subjects' own homes, where the lighting conditions were completely unpredictable. But the results are extraordinary, and are laced with a sense of precision not see in his previous works. The lighting, the surroundings, the girls themselves, all flow into a unified and potent ensemble of pictures that are distinctly erotic. These are not just nude portraits of attractive and interesting women - much of this work is blatantly erotic and the subjects all strut their stuff with ostentatious and confident abandon. These are sexual beings that are obviously quite comfortable sharing this aspect of themselves with Gorman. As Reed Massengill notes in the forward - this book is about art .. but it's also about titillation.	2005-01-25

Edward Lee was a recognized painter and sculptor in the UK before taking up fine art photography thirty years ago. His photos have been shown in numerous galleries and have been widely published and purchased for museum and private collections. This book represents an interest in artistic bondage that was only kindled recently when he met and befriended a model named Chloe, whom Edward attributes as the major source of inspiration for this project. <br /> <br />Erotic Bondage: The Art of Rope contains over two-hundred beautiful, black & white images of delicate young ladies in various states of bondage. The melding of rope with skin with hair and various other props, all captured in beautifully toned prints make this one of the most exciting books ever done in this genre. Although there are a few images that could be categorized as extreme, most of the work possesses a more gentle flair. This unique sense of innocence and beauty is achieved perhaps in part because Lee's models are normal, pretty, girl-next-door types, and not the leather clad, Goth queens that so typify the genre. If damsels in distress are your thing, then this is you calling card. The polished, high-end photography is just icing on the cake.	2005-01-25

Starting in 1979 with Female Trouble and going all the way to 2002 with Shanghai, this softcover retrospective covers twelve different periods and bodies of work from Ms. Rheims. Born in Paris in 1952, Bettina gained fame with the publication of her nude photos of stripper in 1980 in the exhibition called Egoste. From there she went on work with numerous high profile magazines and publishers and became well known for her work with celebrities. But through it all she retained her original focus on photography as an artistic medium. This book wonderfully conveys this, that despite all her success, Bettina Rheims held fast to her artistic vision with what Serge Bramley describes as her way of \\"seeing\\", which in the end propelled her to ever greater commercial and artistic accomplishment. All twelve chapters except Animal 1982-1983/1994 feature the human form as the central component to her work, and the naked female form is the star. We are treated to portraits of both the well known, like Kate Moss, Karen Elson, Eva Herzigova, Madonna, and Laetitia Casta, but also to those whose names we'll never know. But we get to see them all in the glorious manner that is so uniquely Bettina Rheims. Intriguing, inventive, and sometimes quite provocative, the nudes of Bettina Rheims are never short of spellbinding and across more 200 pages we are presented with a succulent treat to the work and vision of one our generation's greatest photographic talents.	2004-12-24

The 2nd Edition of this most marvelous book was officially released in June of 2004. It's actually gotten better with time. Never is an artist more articulate than when he covers terrain that is both deeply intriguing as well as being one that he's intimately familiar with. Petter is at the height of his power here.  <br /> <br />Luba would possess any man in her orbit, she is that magical (and yes, I've met her in person), but the hold she sways over her husband Petter is utterly enchanting. She continues to play a major role, the star attraction if you will, at his website, Hegre-Archives.com, and Petter's work with her continues to be some of his best material. There are 250 images of Luba contained in this hardcover edition, and almost without exception, each is a exquisite snapshot of a truly, truly beautiful woman ... who so kindly allows us to bask in the glory of her most personal, most vulnerable, and wonderfully naked moments.	2004-12-24

The one-man-media-machine that is Petter Hegre is branching out here with the release of \\"100 Naked Girls\\". His previous works were focused on individual beauties. For example his most recent book focused exclusively on his wife Luba. But it was inevitable that, given the enormous depth of material he has been forced to come up with at his website, Hegre-Archives.com, Petter would eventually start to publish from that gargantuan body of work. And so we have \\"100 Naked Girls\\", the results of which, are absolutely stunning. This is more than a creme-de-la-creme collection of nudes by a single artist - this is an epic achievement, and is perhaps the greatest collection of \\"hits\\" since the Beatles released their Red and Blue albums. Each of these one-hundred girls is worthy of a book all to herself, and though our appetites for each are only whetted and not fully satiated, it is enough that we can move on to another, equally magnificent specimen of female perfection. At almost 200 pages, with each girl featured in \\"mini-chapters\\" sorted alphabetically by their name, this book is a bit exhausting, and is almost overwhelming. There are so many wonderful photographs of so many beautiful, young girls, that it's almost impossible to put down. So, my suggestion is ... don't! Savor every little detail ... no matter how long it takes. This one is worth it!	2004-11-28

It features 120 duotones packaged in a hard cover with dimensions of 13\\" x 9.5\\". Each page presents a single, large print of a beautiful model. Few photographers working today can profess to match Gordon Thye for his sheer creative control in shooting nudes. His models, all of which are strikingly beautiful women, are each part of a larger graphic commandeered by Thye. His mastery of the lines and curves of his nude subjects, created through a combination of lighting techniques, posing maneuvers, and a brilliant sense of composition, make this one of the most thrilling works of nudes published this year.	2004-10-26

At 448 pages this is practically an encyclopedia! The format is very easy to follow: a beautiful nude photograph is featured on every other page, and the facing page contains all the information needed to duplicate the image, which is provided by the actual photographer. It covers the camera used, the film, exposure, lens, and everything else, as well as the lighting fixtures and their placements that went into creating the picture. Wow! If ever there was a fast-track to artistic success, this is it. It's amazing that so many world-class photographers were willing to share their secrets this way. That alone would make this book a worthy investment, but the nudes that are featured are absolutely breathtaking and would be a fabulous production all by themselves without all the incredible knowledge provided. So, to all photographers, get this book! Study its contents!

This is ARTISTIC sex photography ... packed with attitude!!! ... which no doubt stems from the artist, Vlastimil Kula's lifelong rebellion against the state, most notably the communist regime in his native Czechoslovakia. Shot in black & white and focusing completely on the sensual and erotic aspects of love and sex, this book is 280 pages of sheer magic. It's work like this that truly showcases what erotic photography can be, as opposed to the sophomoric, boring, mind-numbing genre that mainstream pornography generally is. This is passion, defiance, and an unabashed joy of living the erotic life. <br /> <br />Vlastimil Kula studied photography at the Prague Academy of Arts and followed up with that most capitalistic of professions: advertising. With the collapse of communism he turned his attention towards challenging the new Czech society with his art photography. His work in general and this book in particular, strongly attests to both his success in that endeavor as well as his artistic genius. This work is a visionary manifesto that should not be missed!	2004-09-07

The legend that is Lucien Clergue is a compelling and very complex one. He was one of the first true artists of the photographic medium, rising to worldwide prominence in the 1950's, and whose ambassadorship of the art form has influenced countless fans, students, and protégé's the world over. Chronicling such an achievement is quite the challenge, but one that Eva-Monika Turck has done quite well in creating this beautiful retrospective.<br />It was in 1956 that Clergue first created his famous work, Nudes of the Sea, and for many, this is the style that he will long be remembered for. Never before had we seen such a novel interpretation of the nude. His interplay of flesh and light and water with an undeniable sense of eroticism was revolutionary. That body of work is covered here in Poésie Photographique, but so is Clergue's numerous other studies: celebrity portraits, bullfights, still-lifes, studies in death, gypsies, nudes, and perhaps the most profound and compelling images of Pablo Picasso, who was a lifelong friend, mentor, and spiritual father to Clergue, that the world has ever seen. There are almost 150 photographs in this large (12 x 9.5&quot;) and finely crafted publication, and are well worth the price all unto themselves. But the accompanying text, available in English, German, and French, is what really makes this book special. As an editor Turck has gone beyond the role of biographical reporter and has written an insightful, intellectual, and thoroughly entertaining expedition into the life and times and mind of this most fascinating artist. Her writing goes into great depth and is one of the best studies of a photographer composed in recent memory. This is a must read for anyone interested in the artistic process as well as the intriguing art scene that enveloped the world right after WWII and in which Clergue was positioned front-n-center. With the inclusion of Clergue's breathtaking photography, this book is a cinematic journey that we neverwanted to end.	2004-06-29

This is the book that longtime fans of Richard Murrian's work have been waiting for. At last - it's here!!!<BR> <BR>It's been a long and often frustrating road. Given the supposed &quot;controversy&quot; of Murrian working with young females as nude models, few publishers had the courage to even enter into discussions about publishing his work. But finally, the renown and immensely respected publishing house Edition Skylight took him under their wing and gave Richard the platform he deserved. The result is this book, Reanna's Diaries, and I doubt that anyone will be disappointed. Indeed, it is arguably the most daring and exquisite vision of the human form published in the last decade.<BR> <BR>The main subject matter of the book is the young and beautiful Reanna, who first collaborated with Richard when she was just fourteen years old, but there are several other young models featured as well, each a slender, impeccably perfect beauty. Portrayed in Murrian's magical, delightfully romantic and ethereal style, his subjects transcend all traditional concepts of grace and beauty and take on a glorious, almost celestial quality. So, prepare to be spellbound. The production quality of the book itself is flawless (typical of Edition Skylight) and its dimensions of 10.5&quot; x 8.5&quot; is very satisfying. The preface and introductory text are in English, German, and French. It features 201 color plates set against a glossy white background. As an added and very intriguing bonus, each plate is accompanied by commentary (located at the back of the book) where Richard provides details of the picture such as its title, model information, his photographic technique, and various other elements that went into creating the image. A main strength of the book is that even though there are over 200 plates, they are culled from the enormous collection of work that Murrian has amassed over the last few years, and is something of a best-of-the-best collection. This is very cool ... butreally puts the pressure on Murrian if he's wanting to produce a follow-up book that equals or surpasses this most amazing initial effort.<br />The controversy that hovers around Murrian's work is his vision that young girls, at the genesis of womanhood, are subjects worthy of artistic study. But only the most radically puritanical will find anything offensive in the work presented here. Murrian's work is so highly stylized, his sincerity so obvious - if anything this work is immensely and eternally uplifting. Murrian's portraits and nudes are intimate, breathtaking glimpses into the wondrous physical and spiritual qualities of these girls. It reminds us of all the hope and promise, and the splendid perfection of youth that is so precious and so fleeting. This makes Murrian not only one of the most daring artists of our time, it also makes him one of the most important. My only hope is that the world is enlightened enough to understand what he's trying to convey.	2004-06-18

As a professional photographer, Richard Selby spent much of his career doing what most photographers do, namely working for a living - which entailed shooting color photos geared towards the commercial tastes of various magazine and publishing professionals. And admittedly, Selby was very successful in this area. But after working in Europe for many years, his return to New York in 1976 prompted him to start shooting more for himself, and it was during this period that he started experimenting with the nude figure, shooting in black & white. The results from this \\"personal renaissance\\" are extraordinary and make up the bulk of this work. <br />This is a large, hardcover, gorgeous production, consisting of 126 pages of nude photography where the artist was truly inspired to showcase the nude female in new and invigorating ways. It's difficult to believe that most of these photographs were created in the 1970's. There is a timeless quality to them and calling this work \\"vintage\\" would be completely off the mark. Most appear as though they could have been taken in 2003, and this is undoubtedly due to Selby's cutting edge vision at the time he created this work as well as the natural and superbly creative manner in which her worked with his subjects. There are seven individual bodies of work here: Angie and Louie, Umbra, Sphinx, Barber's Chair, Nike, Plein Air, and Fetish, and each is explored in a thoroughly engaging way. Selby's style definitely leans towards the creative, but make no mistake - these nudes are a sensual expose of what one can do when a photographer decides to become an artist.	2004-04-22

He changes course here in Naked Rooms, shooting entirely in color and on location in the home of each of his models, who range from stock brokers to commercial pilots to law enforcement professionals. There is also a sense of movement in much of this work, blurred movements, action, and we know some of this is from Peter's approach to his photo-sessions where he instructed his subjects to roam around the house with him &quot;chasing&quot; them. That's key to what makes this such an exciting body of work, there's very little sense that anything was staged or even prepped for the photo-session. It's fast. It's quick. It's raw. It's a kinetic journey into the private chambers of these attractive, young women .. and that they are naked makes it all the sweeter. This is a great book, but it's an even more interesting study of an art photographer who's wholly unafraid to take chances ... and that's VERY cool!	2004-03-19

Shot in hotel rooms, bathrooms, railroad tracks, parks, and various other locations, the girls dance around Coulter's Nikon with ease and joy, reveling in their naked beauty.

But for those who enter the world he's created here with an open mind, the reward will be undeniable. Sexual deviations are not the focus here; just raw sexuality, mostly between male-female couples though there are frequent glimpses of girl-girl action. Beautiful women take their men into their mouths, an interracial couple shows us everything, and lesbian lovers engage in electrifying strap-on sex. These are similar scenes that one would find in most porn magazines, yes, but none could pull it off with the artistry that Tony does. It's not the grainy texture, nor is it the black & white film; what Tony does here is something indescribable that sets his work above the average, technically-oriented, Brooks Institute-trained photographer. The scenes he's created, his composition, his choice of models, his creative angles, his flair for graphics and design, everything, when taken as a whole are much more than the sum of their parts. <br />Hey, anybody can make a Gumbo with the right recipe, but it takes a true artist to cook up what Paul Prudhomme does in the kitchen. And that's what master chef Tony Ward does here - he cooks up a 5-star jambalaya that some might say is too spicy, but I say that's what makes it soooooooooo good, cher!	2004-03-04

This stunning collection of more than 100 color illustrations from the Bertholet Collection is a magnificent achievement. Prestel has created a thoroughly engaging publication here, and never before has the world been able to view most of these breathtaking visions of love and sex from pre-modern China. Much of the visual works date to the 18th century. But, in addition to the visual feast, the entire book overflows with verses that match the age and mood of each work of art, as well as essays on the history of the art form, the effect of Taoism on erotica, Confucianism, the trials a husband undergoes getting his wife to accept a concubine, and even the history of Bertholet's collection itself, and lots more. This is a fascinating read! Intellectual, artistic, and even at times, quite humorous, this is a superb collection of erotic imagery and one of the most enjoyable publications one will find in this genre. This is one book that owners should proudly display on their \\"coffee-tables\\" for all to enjoy.	2004-03-03

And that includes the preface written by both Rankin as well as William Leith. It's not fluffed with pretty pictures of pretty men, one after another after another. It is instead strong testimony from an artist, who admittedly is far more familiar with a woman's terrain, that the male body is worthy of study, worthy of admiration, and most important, worthy of the same general acceptance as the female body is. As Leith explains it, \\"A naked women is in a way, not naked, but dressed with centuries of imagery ... naked women come already supplied with a narrative... Naked men need explaining..\\" Rankin trashes this notion! <br />Each image is impeccably photographed, as we'd expect from Rankin, and provides unique perspective on that individual. Young men, old men, beautiful men, and ugly men are paraded in their natural glory. The penis plays a major role here. It's not relegated to the background nor is it made the star player. It's just there, in almost every picture, part of the larger package. Altogether, it's packed with personality and is a wonderful slice of what the men amongst look like naked.<br />Readers looking for a fantasy or for a new vision will be disappointed - this work is purposely NOT about that. It is, nonetheless, fragrant with beauty and humor, magnificence and ridiculousness, inspiration and indignation, and (hopefully) with a new level of acceptance.	2002-03-05

US	52052984	RM3G5DV036FIP	3905514478	72684564	The Body Exposed: Views of the Body : 150 Years of the Nude in Photography	Books	5	7	7	N	N	An Excellent Visual and Literary Reference	This is an excellent reference for anyone interested in the history of  nude and erotic photography. While it's not the most visually stunning  manifesto I've ever seen it does provide a more than thorough history with  countless superb photographic examples on such topics as The Daguerreotype  (1839-1865), Colonial Ethnology (1860-1920), The Naughty Postcard  (1900-1930), Classic Glamour (1920-1940), Advertising (1960-1989),  Playmates (1960-1989), Pornography (1839-1989), The Nude Portrait  (1965-1989), and many more. It includes several rare photos - or at least  ones that I've never seen before - and is very enjoyable to read and peruse  leisurely. One chapter worth noting is News Photography (1945-1989). It  contains several graphic depictions of what happens to the human body when  it is starved, abused, mangled, and even killed. These stand in stark  contrast to the rest of the beautiful and uplifting imagery seen throughout  the book. Overall - this book is excellent.	2000-09-08

All the photos are old-time nudes and erotica but the images from the mid 1800's are astonishing. Nudes, kink, even sexual stuff! <br />The material is presented along with some excellent and insightful commentary. All in all  this book is amazing value and highly recommended!	2000-01-16

And a revolutionary approach to kinky imagery. This is not just about about beautiful bodies but about the cravings they have for one another.

The photography is a quirky and  eclectic mix of imagery that has absolutely no flow from one image to the next. It's like Mardi Gras on mushrooms: weird, reckless, and a tasteful, funloving  disaster.<br />Lots of people won't get this book - too bad for them.	1999-12-31

As a photographer Francesconi is so adept at portraying the erotic experience and does it with such artistic command that it seems almost too &quot;sweet&quot; to be of a sexual nature... kind of like a Hallmark card.  But make no mistake - it is powerful imagery from a true master and this  12-piece collection is gorgeous!	1999-10-18
