I love words and the playful way that poets make words do what they say. Latorial Faison is indeed a poet. She had me from title poem and when I stumbled upon &quot;Mirrored Soul,&quot; I knew I had found someone whose work I'd eat up...hungrily. I've also become a avid fan of haikus and #9 is my favorite with her wordplay with sun/Son. If you only buy the book for &quot;You Never Did Own Me,&quot; trust that by the time you get to &quot;I Dare You,&quot; you will be glad you did.	2003-01-28

But they are just some of the samples that as a reader makes us say, &quot;yeah, this sister opened up wide and is telling it all.&quot; That's what poetry is all about anyway. Exposing yourself. So, she's giving you what's she's got. I bought two copies and will be sharing the other copy with a friend. I invite you all to do the same thing.	2003-01-28

Butterscotch Blues is still my favorite but this book touched on something that was much needed, women need to be whole instead of thinking that wearing a man on their arm like a bracelet will bring them in touch with their true self. We go through life learning lessons, those who don't learn or won't learn are doomed to repeat them over and over again until they do.

No More Sheets by Juanita Bynum is the lay it on the line/tell it like it is approach to sex in the 90's. In this book Juanita exposes herself and her past to teach us lessons that hasten the healing of sexual sin. The struggle to get untangled from the lure of sexual sin is a process that many people camoflauge and secretly wrestle with, but Juanita encourages us in that there is much work to do in the kingdom and we need to prepare ourselves, make ourselves whole. Before we seek a mate we need to rid ourselves of the remnants of our past. Making room for God to heal and close the doors left ajar by satan will put you on the path to your miracle.<br />In this book, Juanita also encourages us to remember that we are not living on a playground but a battleground. She talks about the bondage we find ourselves in when we engage in sex and those impure spirits attach themselves to us and create a stronghold in the spirit realm, holding us hostage to lust, sin and sexual perversion.<br />Juanita Bynum says that &quot;instead of being in competition for the men in our churches, we need to begin to help each other get out and stay out of the sheets.&quot; Juanita pulled the sheets off of sex, masturbation and homosexuality and gives us the tools to gain and maintain victory over the enemy.

With the well received &quot;Woman Thou Art Loosed,&quot; and the follow up &quot;Daddy Love His Little Girls,&quot; now women everywhere are praising &quot;The Lady, Her Lover and Her Lord!&quot; He knows what women think and offer how we can get what we desire, along with scripturally-based reasons why we don't. His books touch on crucial topics such as, A Woman with Balance (chapter 5) that allows women to see the need for balance in all areas of their lives. The husband, the children, work and God need equal attention to be fruitful. If we become too one sided in our focus then something suffers. <br />In chapter 9 T.D. Jakes discusses Pillow Talk, where he enlightens us regarding the power of words and how we need to be an encouarging feminine voice that doesn't tear down, but instead learn how to compliment, encourage and build up. T.D. Jakes is saying that while we will all have disagreements, women should never become a nagging presence, but instead a soothing one, reminding the man in her life that she will now and forever support him. He urges us to allow our words to be words of caring and nurture. <br />Chapter 14 eloquently touched on the topic of Serving the Lord and Making the Money. He reminds us as the bible warns that we cannot serve two masters. Money and career is only an enhancement of our lives and should never become the scope of who we are. God should be the focus of all of our endeavors. I highly recommend this enlightening book for every woman who seeks a deeper understanding of themselves, their spouse and their God. T.D. Jakes is inspirational and gently touches on topics that meet the needs of women everywhere. The Lady Her Lover and Her Lord not only gives us Godly instruction, but also the inside track from T.D. Jakes perspective as a man.	2000-10-02

Through his whole eye-opening journey and labor to please  his woman, father, mother and the memory of his brother, I enjoyed this  novel mainly because it shows the downside of bringing others into your  dream and how friendships can be as phony as a three dollar bill. From a  relationship aspect, this novel is a psychotic terror filled ride as Thad  is strapped on to a woman who makes Glen Close in Fatal Attraction look  like Martha Stewart meets Mr. Rogers.	2000-04-23

The storytelling wasn't exceptional but it got the point across. A married friend thought the book was horrible (wonder why). The materialistic nature  of the character made it so believable, I had to wonder if I was more like  Leah than I wanted to admit. I also don't think that adultery is okay, but  facing facts that it does happen and that people get caught up is a start.  Can't wait for Grovesnor's next book.<br />I also recommend The Ties That Bind  by Monique Gilmore Scott	2000-02-01

Anything that could have been violated was in this captivating, jaw dropping novel that leaves heads nodding `yes' to the  truth we gleaned from Tanya's and Curtis' lives. In the midst of havoc,  actions and consequences are the moral conclusion. Casting the First Stone  teaches the readers life changing lesson of dedication, greed and  faithfulness to God.	2000-01-18

Many times the other woman is criticized without knowing what the married man is telling her. Now we see that although it is wrong, this books lets you ride through every emotion with  her. She's not alone, there are many of us out here who would never confess  adultery not even on our deathbed. Great job.	2000-01-18
