This is about a man's search for himself and his ability to conquer his fears and rely on true survival tactics in order to stay alive. All of the characters have their positives and negatives and after finishing this great book, you are left wanting even more. Dickey has written a masterpiece, an adventure on a large river in the Northern Georgian wilderness where there is little human contact, or so it is thought. A group of city men's camping trip becomes a fight for survival and as the back of the book says, one of the men is offered his own \\"harrowing deliverance\\". A fantastic, highly readable journey that will have you questioning yourself and looking at life a little differently.	2005-06-25

While the book has a focus on Syracuse baseball and issues pertaining to the minor league ballclub there, the book is by no means limited to this subject. Many topics are covered; they are interesting, thought provoking, and fun. Topics include Lou Gehrig's ashes as the title suggests, the \\"King of Baseball Card Collecting\\" (among many, many others) and most enjoyable, the nostalgic looks back at the game. I fondly find myself agreeing and remembering many of Kirst's looks back at the game and what it means to our country. You'll enjoy this book - it's well worth the money spent.	2005-04-20

Joel Osteen's new book, \\"Your Best Life Now\\" is simply a classic. After reading it, I am excited about life, looking forward to my future and to enjoying the great things God has blessed me with. The book tells us why it's important to be honest, trust God to give us great things and to help us, to live life with a passion and positive outlook regardless of what we are going through. Sure, most of us have problems we encounter routinely - who doesn't? But we need to stay positive and know that God has something bigger and better in store for us when we work hard, give our time and encouragement to others and live life with a passion. As Joel Osteen says in his book, \\"When one door closes, God opens a bigger and better door\\" This is a book I highly recommend for everyone - kids, teenagers, adults. You will truly be inspired to do great things and to start appreciating what God has given you, and what he has yet to give you.	2005-04-03

Joel Greenblatt's knowledge of special situation investing comes to light in this witty, engaging and fun guide on how to take advantage of such events as mergers, spinoffs and bankruptcies in unconventional ways typically not exposed to the individual investor. By far the best feature about this book are the case studies Greenblatt presents to us on various occasions. From Greenblatt's experiences profitting from a corporate spinoff, to a bankruptcy, the examples used within this easy to read and fun guide will help the reader better understand the points Greenblatt is making. The witty and down to Earth nature of this book make it a winner, as are the various off-the-beaten track investment methods that have given Greenblatt 50%+ returns at his investment fund, Gotham Capital.	2005-03-26

Williams should be a true champion for the African American population who resides in the United States. He has made a great living for himself, via teaching economic courses at George Mason and publishing two books. He is a true champion of capitalism and for the black people as a whole. Unfortunately, demagogues like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton - men with little or nothing of value to add to society except to more and more racism to the fire pander to black Americans shamelessly. Thankfully, Professor Williams makes light of this and other problems our country faces in his work \\"More Liberty Means Less Government\\". This was a fantastic, easy-to-read book. It's a collection of Williams' many articles/essays on Law, Society, Government, the Environment and many other interesting and fun topics. Many liberals claim Williams is just \\"another stuffed shirt conservative\\". This is not even close to being the case. Williams is a conservative/liberterian mix, always siding with what the Constitution has to say. Thankfully, in Williams' mind the Constitution is still \\"The Supreme Law of the Land\\". Unfortunately, others don't realize that.	2005-03-19

This bruising indictment of the American and European left's involvement and cultivation of the radical Islamic theories that are a basic tenant for terrorist attacks is quite scary. Horowitz's well-researched and thought out book clearly highlights the problems organizations such as the ACLU, CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) as well as others such as the NAACP not only have with America, but all that we stand for. They clearly hate our government, our way of life, capitalism and the principles on which our great nation was founded. Eventually, what this boils down to a support for the groups that hate America most, and in many case, they are radical Islamic terrorist groups. Horowitz's book should be required reading during this turbulent and sometimes scary time.	2005-03-01

Mr. O'Neill speaks out against John Kerry in a mannerism only a former veteran could. After reading this, I am even more convinced that if John Kerry becomes our President, we are in serious trouble as a nation. The neglections he so obviously committed in Vietnam, as well as the atrocities he has admitted to make it amazing that he would even be a considered as a candidate for the Presidency. Senator Kerry is a weak candidate as O'Neill's book so greatly shows, and contrary to popular belief, O'Neill doesn't have connections to the Republican party. This is a great work and should be read by Democrats and Republicans alike.	2004-10-22

He disgraces colleagues and friends in the attempt to make his relationship with DiMaggio look better. While the info within this book was good, it does not do justice to the life of the American icon, Joseph Paul DiMaggio. While this book is a decent effort, Richard Ben Cramer's &quot;Joe DiMaggio: A Hero's Life&quot; looks to be the better read. The one part I did enjoy was the information on DiMaggio's lawyer Morris Engelberg and his law office's campus HQ in Hollywood, FL where Yankee Clipper Enterprises is run. Decent book overall, but too much reptitiveness and not enough new info.	2003-11-09

Do not let the title fool you, it's not only for teenagers but for everyone, novices and market veterans alike. This book is a true gem. Written by a 13 year old (who is now 14), I went in expecting it to be tailored to kids and not well-written. Was I mistaken! This book is very well-written and offers simple, practical advice on how to make money over the long-term in index funds and stocks and why asset allocation plans are so important for investors. This book is a welcome relief from the stock promoting that other books by teenagers frequently exercise, and it's a great book because it doesn't offer any get rich quick schemes, only solid financial advice. <br />I do not believe this book is only for teenagers. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more, or expand their knowledge of the financial markets. Not only is this book great for the novice, but for the experienced, well-seasoned investor, as well. I hope Timothy Olsen keeps writing books - I would buy and read them all. <br />Michael LeBoeuf, Ph.D. and author of \\"The Millionaire in You\\" endorses Olsen's book on the front cover, saying: \\"Get a copy for yourself, your children and anyone you care about. You will all be richer for it.\\" I could not agree more. Buy this book for everyone you care about.	2003-08-27

As an avid investor and market researcher, I found Dan Coker's &quot;Mastering Microcaps&quot; to be the standard on investing in microcap companies. Unfortunately, while other books shed light on small caps, Coker goes the extra mile, producing 200+ pages of data on microcaps and how to select microcaps for possible investment.

This book is a tribute and biography of one of baseball's greatest, and least talked about star - Lou Gehrig. While a Yankee, Gehrig was over-shawdowed by the flamboyant Babe Ruth for the most part, and any accomplishment Gehrig took part in, Babe Ruth was still more recognized. <BR>   Gehrig was a quiet, peaceful man who truly cared about fans. He was very interested in the game and loved playing baseball and really examined the mechanics of it. Hopefully Gehrig will be more memorialized not only in the Hall of Fame, but in the hearts of baseball fans everywhere. His courage triumphed his disease.	2003-08-16

During this time, he gets the opportunity to have an experiment on him to increase his intelligence, something his mother always wanted for him when he was younger. After the experiment is performed, his knowledge increases and he becomes a genius, absorbing all types of information at rapid speeds.

Surprisingly, Jeter is unlike the common athlete today who hates fans and just plays for the money. Being a baseball player was always a dream for Jeter and he accomplished it.

I like how the author mentions that visting message board communities to hunt for ideas and rumors etc, is key while investing in penny stocks. That is very true, and not many people realize it can be a fundamental part of the investment process in penny stocks. The one downfall this book has, is that it was written in 1999 when the market was booming and the economy was robust. Now it is much harder to capitialze on the penny stocks, specifically those involved with some sort of technological advance. I found nearly half to all of the websites mentioned... to be defunct and non-operational. This just shows those penny stock pickers that investing in a bear market in such small securities is hazardous to your wealth, and nearly impossible to capitialize on.	2003-04-05
