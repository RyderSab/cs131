Actually one of Cartland's shorter (and less substantive) novels, it remains my favorite.  There is such a sweetness to the heroine Anita, and all the characters are worth meeting. <br /> <br />Our story in short:  Anita and her two older sisters have been virtually left on their own.  Their mother has traveled to Switzerland due to her illness.  We meet her briefly.  Sarah, the oldest sister has written to all their relatives, some of whom are \\"quality.\\"  They, of course, are penniless relations even though they are of good birth.  Sarah ends up with a Countess for a season, Daphne ends up with her godmother who is also kind to her but Anita ends up with an old maid great aunt with endless \\"charitable\\" works. I DO think the sisters seemed very selfish leaving poor Anita to struggle with the worst possible relation!   <br /> <br />Before Anita goes on her journey to the great-aunt, she meets Kerne, the Duke of Ollerton, at a gate while he is out riding.  It is a momentous meeting as Anita in her fanciful way thinks he looks like the fallen angel Lucifer (and tells the Duke this) and Kerne remarks on some obscure poem that Anita actually knows.  He thinks she looks like a tiny angel.  They are to meet again and sooner than he thought. <br /> <br />Kerne has asked his mother to set up a house party so he may select a wife.  His career requires it!  His future duchess must be tall, statuesque, blonde - and on and on.... and his mother invites three eligible women to his home.  Both the Duke and Duchess (his mother) meet Anita at the pumps in Harrowgate and later, Kerne thinks of a way to save her from an unsavory marriage to an old man (her great-aunt's \\"pet\\" parson as they referred to him.). <br /> <br />Anita ends up at the Ollerton estate with the Duchess.  Her charming manner soon makes her popular to the household.  She is so open and fresh.  Later when joined by Kerne and his guests, even they find her delightful.  One guest, Lord Greshem finds her a little too delightful!  The events at the house party, from balls to early morning rides to a misunderstanding between Kerne and Anita is wonderfully portrayed.  You really are not sure how it will all work out.  And does it?  Can Anita really say no when the Duke asks her to marry him?  And why would she - read this lovely book and you will find out the answer.  <br /> <br />Why a five for this book?  I judged it against others like it.  It does not have an extended storyline or detailed character development of longer Regency novels, but there is something in this one that touches my heart.  I think if you are looking for a quick read with mild villainy, you will enjoy this!   <br />	2005-10-13

It is humorous, appealing and well written.  It also lacked all the divine light and love ranting present in many that I have read - which is a plus to me!<br /><br />The Duke of Selchester, a rather conceited but well liked man, sets out to find himself a bride.  On the list are three eligible young blond, bland women.  After all, nothing should interfere with his well-run life.  You will enjoy hearing about just how everything runs so well and about those who work for him.  But the Duke did not count on meeting a dark haired beauty who. while showing him the way to the blacksmith, discusses the fact that this \\"odious Duke\\" is to come through town to visit Lord Upminster.  Of course his daughter is \\"on the list\\" and terribly unhappy since she is in love with another.  (We never get to meet any of the three on the list but only hear about them.  All very well drawn and amusing descriptions.)  It is absolutely funny to hear Verena describe the duke and his shortcomings right to his face!  Meeting Verena Winchcombe (our dark haired heroine) means the end to the Duke's well ordered life!<br /><br />When he is set upon by ruffians (and one gentleman) where the heist of gold bullion has been hidden, the Duke is forced to recover at Miss Winchcombe's home where her grandfather (a retired General) is also ill.  The Duke, though using his own name without the title, is thought to be just a military officer (which he was at one time).  Anyway, though various means, the Duke becomes Verena's guardian, Verena comes to London and his real identity is revealed.  They continue to get into scrapes as they persist in the adventure of finding highwaymen.  Has Verena lost her heart to her \\"Leopard\\"?  Yet she is engaged to another man, a cousin who of course turns out only to be a fortune hunter!  Will the Duke win his \\"Elf\\"?  Will she make a proper duchess?<br /><br />Loved the nicknames.

Each book is different and contains wonderful characters.  I am only missing a couple of her recent books and even have one of her first (perhaps her very first) books that is typewritten spiral bound from a very small publishing company.  I even had an e-book she wrote until it was lost in a computer crash!  Anyway ... just pumping you up to encourage you read her books! <br /> <br />The uniqueness of the locale is what makes this book so unusual.  Another reviewer mentions it.  The comparison between the warm sunny Jamaica and the tropical island our intrepid group is stranded on against a cool and foggy London, England is well written.  The storyline (briefly) is this.  Savina who has spent 11 years of her life in Jamaica is returning with her father to England.  His tour of duty as some sort of government official is over.  Her mother has been long dead and her father wanted to see his daughter married and well provided for.  After meeting Lord Gaston-Reade, who appeared to have a like mind and progressive attitudes towards running his plantation, she accepts his marriage proposal.  But appearances are deceiving.  A small family group of Savina, her father, Gaston-Reade, his sister Venture, her fianc William Barker, Zazu, a native Jamaican and more friend than maid to Savina, Annie, Venture's maid and Anthony Heywood. Gaston-Reade's secretary set out for England.  A storm blows the ship off course and it is taken over by an American Naval vessel whose own ship is listing badly.  The captain asks Savina to decide the passenger's fate - pledge allegiance to the USA, sail as prisoners of the vessel or be left on an island.  Savina considers carefully and decides they should be left on an island. <br /> <br />The captain puts them on an uninhabited island with supplies and promises to notify the English of their stranding.  The castaways go through all the normal trauma of disordered life.  The ineptness of some is shown and the courage of others comes forward.  I like that the author did not make the status change unbelievable.  All rose to the occasion well ... each using their own skills to make survival bearable.  This was not some \\"Lord of the Flies\\" stranding.  As Gaston-Reade reveals more of his nature, Savina realizes they will be unhappy as a married couple.  There is also a growing attraction between her and the secretary Tony.  Are there other romances brewing as well? <br /> <br />The castaways are rescued and the remainder of the book deals with how they are greeted and feted by society.  Savina's father becomes a celebrity of sort while Savina is treated differently and called \\"Lady Savage\\" due to her unkempt appearance when rescued!  Will she marry Gaston-Reade after all?  All the characters are well-fleshed with many wonderful situations and stories.  My description barely touches the surface.  I have not read a book so compelling in quite a while.  There is not much villainy (which I like) but just finely drawn personalities, some of which you admire and in the end you may pity.  I hope there is a story for Lady Venture who is rather an unhappy woman with has an air of mystery, no matter her spoiled nature.  A wonderful book, perhaps somewhat like others of this genre or \\"castaway\\" type writings, and I loved it!      <br /> <br />	2005-09-24

She had come to London after being promised a position by the Duke's brother Julius.  Unfortunately the job was in a \\"house of pleasure!\\"  She escaped from the carriage taking her away.  After a long conversation, Randolph proposes that Udela pretend to be his betrothed to save him from being blackmailed into another alliance.  She agrees and a contract is drawn up where she will receive wages for her time.  The Duke, with his grandmother who serves as chaperone, provide Udela with gowns, etc.... and her loveliness and intelligent ways soon charm them both.  But Julius lurks as the villain, even angrier that Randolph might marry and have children cutting him out of a dukedom!      Since the betrothal was to be temporary, after both are safe (one from blackmail and one from Julius), Udela prepares to leave her handsome duke as well as her heart behind.  But does Randolph have something else in mind as he hands her an envelope with her wages inside?    Nice side characters.  I've decided that Barbara Cartland must have had (or been) a wonderful grandmother because the grandmothers in her stories are so loving and kind. Pleasant romance but several violent situations.	2005-09-22

The style just didn't seem like Barbara Cartland.  Valient, Viscount Ockley, is madly in love with Niobe Barrington, a beautiful spoiled young woman.  Her wealthy father has more ambition then for her to marry the penniless Viscount especially if another \\"titled\\" man comes along.  So Niobe (who does care for Valient somewhat) strings him along and then informs him that she is to marry the Marquis of Porthcawl.  She will not elope with Valient and he storms from the house, not realizing a stowaway is hidden in his phaeton.  He finds Niobe's cousin Jemima has run away after suffering nothing but abuse and beatings at the hands of her uncle (Niobe's father) and sometimes at Niobe's instigation.  Valient, in an effort to save face (and exact revenge) marries Jemima using the special license in his pocket. <br /> <br />The rest of the story is how he and his friend Freddie make Jemima presentable to society as Valient lets out the story that he has married Miss Barrington, but not which one.  When they become strapped for money, Jemima keeps the creditors at bay by devising ways to make money.  She also works hard to restore Valient's country estate to a semblance of order.  But Valient does not appreciate Jemima and Freddie finds himself in love with her.  Will she run away with him?  Or will the love Jemima desperately desires occur with her husband? <br /> <br />Unlike other Cartland novels, Jemima is a resourceful and independent heroine.  Of course there are later situations involving the horrible Uncle and Niobe rears her ugly, spoiled head again too.  Jemima even finds a unique way to set Valient free - but does he want that in the end?  Very enjoyable. <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-09-22

So shocked she drinks much too much wine and goes home with a handsome man known only as Patrick.  Waking up almost in the buff and apparently having lost her innocence to him in a night she can't even remember, Lilli escapes from the hotel room in the morning while Patrick is in the shower. <br /> <br />But home turns out to be not much better after questioning by her father.  Later, Lilli finds out that Patrick is \\"Patrick Devlin,\\" a wealthy banker, who has her father and his business between a rock and a hard place.  This business trouble can be laid at Lilli's door in the shape of her embezzling (and gay) ex-fianc.  But Patrick has a way to save her father.  Marry him!  Her family loyalty is desirable to him since he found trusting a woman difficult after his disastrous marriage to a philandering woman.   <br /> <br />There are some humorous moments as this super Alpha man dominates the spoiled little rich girl.  And wait until you find out who the mysterious man at the party was - and even who the woman was!  I did feel that Patrick was a bully but he becomes a rather tender-hearted man in the end.  Lilli is a rather weak heroine but she is also very young.  Both Patrick and Lilli have sad childhood incidents as you find in most of these Harlequins.  I was surprised that this took place in the UK, as the recent ones in this series all take place in Australia.  Pleasant, different afternoon read, though unbelievable at times.  I judge these Harlequin Presents against similar short books and this one is fairly good.     <br />	2005-09-20

Low pay, six days a week, no partnership in the business.  She has been doing this for eleven years and she wants to say her stepmother is the villain?  What about the nine years she put in before her father died - he seems just as much to blame!  Is Holly just plain stupid?  I hate when there is just total \\"roll over and die\\" attitude in a woman.  She should just gotten on with her life WAY before this!  But then there would be no story! <br /> <br />Our hero, Richard, a rather egotistical millionaire figures all women are gold diggers including his cheating (now dead) wife and has that theory confirmed by the women he dates from the matchmaker \\"Wives Wanted.\\"  An interesting concept, this unique dating service matches wealthy men with attractive sophisticated women with marriages of convenience in mind.  I'm not sure what he expected ... but .... then Richard meets pitiful Holly who happens to be friends with his widowed mother.

I will say this is one book that I go back to read time and again.  After reading it once more, I wanted to review it though I find it almost hard to do justice to! <br /> <br />The heroine (Madelyne) is strong without losing any of her femininity.  The hero (Duncan) remains true to his character - honorable, yet tough.  Each is enhanced by the other's strengths.  Madelyne needs Duncan's strength to protect and boost her own self confidence.  Duncan needs Madelyn's joy to help him become spontaneous and less rigid.  I am always entranced by these two people!  This book is filled with wonderful, touching and funny moments from beginning to end.  Amongst my favorites are Madelyn mistaking Duncan's brother Edmund for a Cyclops when suffering a fever and the scene when all believe she is about to be run down by Duncan's huge horse!  But, there are so many memorable moments - I don't want to spoil it for you! <br /> <br />Wonderful secondary characters.  So many that I cannot even name them all - although the other brothers (Edmund and Gilard) deserve books of their own, I don't think that Garwood went on to do that.  Duncan's sister and Madelyn's Uncle were also engaging characters.  The backdrop of visits to court and battles are so well described you find yourself right in the center of action.  There are horrible villains (Madelyn's brother is just one of them) and yet another romance to concentrate on.   <br /> <br />This is one of those sweeping romances that you do not soon forget.  Worth obtaining!  <br />	2005-09-15

OK, a little bit of mindless fun can be found in these Harlequin Presents books.  But I am beginning to see a theme here - affairs with the boss and unexpected pregnancies!  I'm starting to have sympathetic morning sickness!  As usual, I judge them against similar books since they could never hold a candle against other substantial romances and definitely not \\"brilliant\\" in my opinion.   <br /> <br />Olivia gets dumped, and then decides to turn the tables on a man.  Not just any man - her boss, the rather conservative Lewis.  He, too, is suffering after the breakup of his marriage.  The rather mousey Olivia drops all her inhibitions with a few glasses of champagne at the office Christmas party and proceeds to seduce Lewis after they slip off to his office.  As the alcohol wears off, Olivia is horrified and regretful.  They both part to go on Christmas holiday with plans to \\"forget it ever happened.\\"  -- No such luck since Olivia finds herself pregnant!  Lewis (after much persuasion on his part) manages to seduce Olivia back before finding out about the pregnancy.  His (almost) ex-wife shows up once and insults and belittles Olivia.  Since Olivia figures Lewis is on the rebound, she refuses his offer of marriage.  All he cares about is the baby, right?  How long will it take until he breaks through her defenses and convinces her he really does care? <br /> <br />There were some good secondary characters.  Lewis's mother was great and promoted Olivia's independence, as long as she was independent nearby with the grandchild.  Olivia's family was great too.  For once, both main characters had normal loving childhoods - yea!  (I was beginning to see a theme with that in these too!).  These all seem to take place in Australia so there are a few words unfamiliar to an American but not difficult to figure out.  I am amazed at some of the obvious misspellings - and wonder whether there are editors reading these rather short books?

Oh pleeeeeease - do all these Harlequins have to have main characters with loveless childhoods?  Anyway, this is just the second one of this \\"Harlequin Presents\\" series that I have read.  There was some actual substance to this one which I must give credit to the author for.  In a short book - with the required intimate encounters, it is hard to develop in-depth characters.  As I have done in the past, I judge these short books against similar ones rather than a more meaty Regency or longer novel which has more space for character development.  <br /> <br />Ricardo, a rather ruthless businessman wants to gain some insider information on a high-class party planning company that he wants to take over.  To do that, he pretends that he wants to contract several parties and see what they are doing for others.  He tags along with Carly Carlisle, one of the three founders of the company.  Told by the husband of one of the other partners that Carly is out to get a rich man and is always hot-to-trot, Ricardo is rather rude and obnoxious to her.  He has a disgust of greedy, manipulative women.  As you can tell by the book's title, Carly has yet to find ANY man - at least not one she wants to sleep with!  There is a good deal of miscommunication since Ricardo looks at innocent incidents with a jaundiced eye and Carly believes him to be a rather nasty, mean spirited and angry individual.  The book follows their jaunts to two or three parties in fancy locales before the inevitable meeting of the minds and bodies occurs! <br /> <br />There were some rather strange scenes - why Carly lets Ricardo rip her robe off at the hotel before they even attempt to be intimate was rather bizarre.  Do all party planning clients do that?  They never really expressed (to each other) what sad childhoods they had, though that was one thing they had in common.  For a little harmless escape, you will find this book enjoyable, while you wing your way to fabulous, exciting parties in your mind.<br />	2005-09-14

There is much to like and dislike in a book like this.  Being rather quick reading and short, there isn't much in-depth character development but you do get an inkling of what they are like.  I judged it more against other similar books rather than a longer length historical or contemporary novel.    My likes:  The way our couple (Damien and Philly) met was interesting.  I liked that he actually thought of her as being very professional and wanted her to work on a project with him [before realizing she was the woman he romanced at a masquerade party].  The sex scenes were sensual and just intense enough.  I thought that Damian's distrust of Philly was believable and I liked that there was a gradual realization that he cared for Philly and not just the expected baby.      My dislikes:  A little too much tragedy.  Both Damian and Philly suffered such horrible losses and sometimes the sadness was overwhelming.  This one weird and stupid little moment at the beginning bothered me - if Philly's brother, his wife and 10 day old son were killed the day after getting professional pictures taken, how could Philly and her mother have one?  Who would have picked them up?  Philly's mousey to glamorous transition was not believable.  Damian's protection of Philly when her ex-fianc Bryce showed up was out of character.    All-in-all, I enjoyed this book.  There were a few secondary characters that were great, especially Enid - Damian's personal assistant.  I liked that she would stand up to him!

She does not gloss over violence against women or abandon the perception of morality associated with the Regency era.      Our book begins with Romara (our heroine) arriving at the London townhouse where her sister Caryl resides.  A cryptic note asking for help had drawn Romara from the country where she is mourning their father's passing.  Caryl had run away with Sir Harvey Wychbold almost nine months before, much to the chagrin of her father (General Sir Alexander Shaldon).  Wychbold is a rogue and not acceptable to the ton because of his tradesman background.  Romara is met with the news that Caryl is expecting and Wychbold has not married her.  Now, virtually a prisoner in the house, Caryl tells Romara of Wychbold's indifference and her fears for the future of (his) unwanted child.  Romara confronts Wychbold, who has come home drunk and angry and he proceeds to assault Romara beating her with his fists, tossing her out the door and pushing her down the steps to the pavement where she lies unconscious.      The battered woman is recovered by friends of Lord Ravenscar in the neighboring townhouse who promptly drag the bleeding woman into Lord Ravenscar's dining room.  Having just been rejected by the beautiful woman he loved, Ravenscar had vowed to his friends that he would marry the \\"ugliest woman they could find\\" before the night was out.  And so they found Romara, whose swollen face certainly makes her appear ugly, and having a gentleman-parson handy, the two are married.  I was a little appalled by the ferociousness of Wychbold's attack and the callousness of the Ravenscar's friends but there would be no story without it.    This is just the beginning.  Romara awakens, and finding out she is wed, is afraid her new husband might be as cruel as Wychbold.  But he is not.  Dedicated to making the best of a bad situation, Ravenscar shows his truly kind self and helps Romara regarding her sister.  Having served under Romara's father, he arranges for Wychbold to marry Caryl and then sends both sisters off to his country estate to recover.  Caryl has her baby boy there.  When Ravenscar arrives there, weeks later, he finds Romara, a lovely woman with a good character.  She already has made his house a home and his tenants happy just like his beloved (late) mother.      But Wychbold causes problems and eventually the sisters run away.  Their adventure during this time is interesting.  You wonder how this will all end with such a horrible villain.  But our happy ending is achieved and of course Ravenscar realizes his revenge against the woman that led him on before marrying Romara has given him the greatest gift he could wish for.  He has found true love and a wonderful caring wife, who he would have never met if all the terrible circumstances had not occurred.      Cartland stories are too short and characters not fully developed to ever get a rating of 5 from me.  Also all the \\"divine love\\" sort of drivel gets to be a little tedious but that is in all her books that I have read and you get used to it.  I judge her books against each other rather than the entire Regency genre.  This one is an interesting tale even with the violence against women in it and worth reading if you are a fan.	2005-09-10

Barbara must have had a thing about wicked stepmothers because many of her books contain them but our \\"Serpent of Satan\\" in the form of Lady Langstone, \\"Circe\\" was evil personified!  She beat and starved her stepdaughter Ophelia and even Ophelia's little spaniel Rover! <br /> <br />The Earl of Rochester, Gerald Wilmot who went by the name of \\"Rake\\" turns out to be our hero.  Considering an affair with Lady Langstone (who has her husband wrapped around her finger) he meets Ophelia while waiting to visit Circe in her London house.  Ophelia, while frightened, asks him why he lets his elderly servants languish in poverty without a pension before she scurries off to hide.  Since he has always been a generous man and has raised pensions steadily, the Earl later checks this information out.  He finds out he has been cheated, sets things right and hires another manager.  Hoping to thank Ophelia, he catches sight of her and her dog in the park.  She and the dog look so thin, frightened and ill that he forces her to tell him of their wretched life with the awful Circe.  The Earl, himself, had found the woman revolting and had decided not to have any dealings with her which was one of the reasons why Ophelia was being punished so severely. <br /> <br />Later, the Earl spirits Ophelia and Rover away when Circe has almost killed them!  As Ophelia recovers he begins to fall in love with her.  After one attempt to abduct Ophelia back is thwarted, the Earl plots the downfall of Lady Langstone. <br /> <br />I enjoyed seeing the Earl come to realize that he has lived up to his nickname of \\"Rake\\" long enough and of course the love of a good woman has made him happy.  I didn't really like the devil atmosphere of this book as they talk about black magic, etc.... Lady Langstone gets her due in the end but it is very bizarre and theEarl is involved somewhat in her death.  I hated that Ophelia's father didn't even seem to care when she disappeared, though I guess he is fooled by his wife and believes her to be visiting a friend.  I liked the little spaniel - the dog recovers just fine!  The heroine took a back seat to the wicked stepmother.  Pretty good but this would not be a favorite of mine.     <br />	2005-09-06

The ultimate goal is for him to marry her step-daughter.  (We do find out later that he did not agree to this - and the arrangements cannot be undone by the time \\"Christine\\" is sent to him.)  Christine sends Mina in her place, while she herself travels to Italy to her Uncle's home to marry her true love, Harry, the younger son of Lord Hawkstone. <br /> <br />Since Mina has just lost her father and as an orphan has few options left, she reluctantly travels to Vent Royal to stay with the Marquis.

US	52272094	R2UEX9R1MHA8AM	0553127853	261872182	Light of the Moon	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good; Compelling storyline	As I've said in other reviews, you either love Barbara Cartland's style or you don't.  Since she was born in the early 1900's, I'm sure she remembered a time when young women were as innocent as her heroines are - before the advent of mass media.  Most of her books are rather short, but lately I've found others that were a little more substantive.  This is one of those.    Our nave heroine, Neoma, has somehow held hearth and home together after the death of her parents.  Her older brother (all of nineteen), Peregrine, has moved them both to London and they reside in a rather tawdry area where many of the ton's mistresses reside.  Neoma longs to return to their country manor which held delight (and fresher food) even in its rather dilapidated condition.  But Peregrine loves the excitement of London and enjoys his club with his equally penniless friend Charles Waddesdon.  The young men joke with each other and give each other phony IOUs when playing piquet at Whites.  Unfortunately, one of these IOUs falls into the hands of the Marquis of Rosyth.  I'll leave you to find out how he obtained it.      The Marquis invites the two young men to his fabulous estate (named Syth) outside of London, where he is known for his wild parties.  They are to bring their own \\"ladies\\" for gratification.  The pair decide that perhaps the IOU can be stolen from the Marquis at this party and solve their problem since neither has money to redeem it.  Charles brings an \\"actress-friend\\" and Peregrine brings his sister - telling her to not say she is his sister and to wear a little makeup to fool their host.  (I found Peregrine to be selfish in his dealings with his sister but he does redeem himself later).      Off they go, where indeed the party is wild and the other participants debauched.  Neoma is confused about what is going on.  She is so unworldly that she has no idea these are \\"fallen\\" women.  She notes that the Marquis is rather detached from the situation and appears to watch and enjoy the depravity with a contemptuous attitude.  He has his own lovely \\"La Flame\\" to entertain him.  He, also, is confused about Neoma because she seems so untouched.  They end up riding in the morning when he finds her visiting the stable.  All the other guests are sleeping off their drunkenness!  Neoma enjoys hearing about the history of the house and visits the rooms with Syth's curator and has several conversations with the Marquis about books, paintings and other of the household contents.      There are many interesting situations within the pages of this book.  There is the ever important Derby in which the Marquis's horse is running.  Another twist involves an evil gentleman who has designs on Neoma.  Plus there is the drama of Neoma trying to steal the IOU.  She is caught by the Marquis himself who extracts a price that Neoma isn't even aware of!  How will it all end?  You find out why the Marquis is the way he is - and come to understand him better.  It all ends happily, yet there is a paragraph about what a difficult road lies ahead for our loving couple.  Typical Cartland style but pleasurable reading.	2005-09-03

Ellen Fitzgerald is a pseudonym for Florence Stevenson who also wrote gothics, regencies and even modern tales under four other names.  I am only missing a few of her books and each has proved to be a gem.    <br /> <br />I've never read a Regency novel with quite the twist this one had.  Lord Gerald Courlenay has not only become heir to his father upon the death of his elder brother but he also inherits his brother's betrothed.  The engagement to Lady Belinda Deveraux who has a large dowry and an impeccable bloodline had been arranged long ago.  Now she is 18 and the marriage is to occur.  Early in the book, we are privy to the thoughts of each about their first meeting when Gerald was 11 and Belinda was 5 - hardly a good start since Gerald threw a rock at her for disturbing his fishing adventure!  This makes for an appealing situation when they meet again as young adults <br /> <br />But each loves another and yet, neither can stop the wedding.  Descriptions of the wedding day were detailed and captivating.  The marriage starts off rocky.  Gerald remains loyal to his mistress (unknown to Belinda) and Belinda pines for intimacy and wishes she could have wed another man.  But time proves to be all that is needed for each to realize they care and love each other.  Gerald begins to realize the caresses from his mistress seem practiced and he longs to be with his innocent and passionate wife instead.  Belinda eventually understands the older man she has adored for a lifetime is just an insubstantial infatuation.  <br /> <br />But there is slight villainy afoot from the jealous mistress, Felice, and her friend Chretien de Beaufort who is commissioned to paint Belinda's portrait.  He intimates of the relationship her husband has with Felice and Belinda is heart broken and decides to return to her father's country home.  Will Gerald be able to win her love back? <br /> <br />The character development in this book is superb.  Even secondary characters such as Belinda's friend Cornelia, Lord Fueneaux (Belinda's infatuation), parents of the couple and others are really well drawn.  You empathize with many of them.  I really liked the way this book switches between what each of the characters are thinking rather than one point of view.  I just can't say enough good things about this book.           <br />	2005-09-01

Both go on their separate ways yet Orelia cannot forget her savior.  Months later, Orelia travels to London with her cousin Caroline.  Caroline has lived a rather wild life due to the unhappiness of unrequited love.  But Caroline tells Orelia that she is now engaged to a wealthy Marquis of Ryde!  Once in London, they remain in the Marquis's home with his mother as their chaperone.  The Dowager Duchess turns out to be a nasty villain who really never gets her due in the end.   <br /> <br />Of course the Marquis turns out to be the man who saved Orelia.  But he does not appear to even remember the kiss, as Orelia finds herself falling in love with him.  She begins to understand why he has a cold nature, yet is unafraid of him.  She expresses her feelings to him and in turn the Marquis begins to open up to her.  He eventually tells her the kiss meant everything to him but he must honor his betrothal to her cousin even though neither is in love.  It appears to be an unhappy marriage in the making as the wedding day approaches.   <br /> <br />Although you either love Cartland books or not, I was pleased to find this heroine had a little backbone.  Orelia fought for the people she came in contact with, whether it was the Marquis's nephew or just a servant.  She stood up for what was right and I think astonished the Marquis with her knowledge and convincing arguments.  There are some frightening situations involving a kidnapping and other assorted adventures.  This longer Cartland novel allowed for some more situations than are normally in her books.  <br /> <br />Truly enjoyable and memorable characters.     <br />	2005-08-31

It takes a very good author to make you care for the characters in such a small number of pages.  But I found this anthology to be very good and one I shall enjoy reading again.  Below are my notes on each story. <br /> <br />Catherine Anderson - one of my favorite authors and the reason I sought this book to read.  Although her couple weds under strange circumstances, you will love the ending when our hero almost loses the woman he has come to love. <br /> <br />Lisa Kleypas - another of my favorite authors and I had no idea this story was out there.  I especially enjoyed the hero's visit to a gambling house where we meet Mr. Craven, a character who is in his own book later!  The storyline about betrayal and unrequited love eventually ends happily.  There are two romances in this one short entry! <br /> <br />Loretta Chase presents a story of a \\"mad\\" earl.  The most heart wrenching of all the stories, you will enjoy the growing love between our hero and heroine, amazed at the sensuality that can be addressed in a few short pages and will become sad at the impending death to come.  Sweet and satisfying.   <br /> <br />The Kathleen Woodiwiss portion was not to my liking.  I could not drag my way through it.  I have read The Flame and the Flower long ago, but just did not like this story which is a sequel???  Yet her name is large on the cover to draw readers in.  Others may like this story better than I did. <br /> <br />Overall, it was great reading and I highly recommend it.   <br />	2005-08-27

The hero was very likeable but why he would choose Hyacinth was a mystery.  All the situations in the book seemed contrived.  Two dances and the gossip now linked them together and it seems they just went along with it.  Didn't Gareth have some sort of reputation?  Why Violet seemed to push Hyacinth towards marriage with Gareth didn't seem logical.  I didn't really like the way the rest of the Bridgerton clan treated Hyacinth. <br /> <br />The whole situation of his Italian grandmother's hidden treasure was ridiculous.  If they had found anything in Gareth's father's house it would have been stealing if they removed it.  Even though their motives were honorable, (to keep something of the St. Clair legacy intact), it would not have been an option to take them since his father was still alive and the jewels would be part of the estate.   <br /> <br />The Italian diary was an interesting element but turned out to be rather tame.  I doubt that the grandmother would have revealed who Gareth's real father was.  I did enjoy Lady Danbury - her character was the most amusing in the entire book. <br /> <br />I am reading the Bridgerton series all out of order.  Each, including this one, stands alone.  Anyone reading the series will want to read Hyacinth's story - but it is certainly not the best of the bunch.       <br />	2005-08-26

I actually found it a little different than the rest.  There were some flaws that would normally make me give it less than a 5, but because of the emotional charge I felt while reading this, I couldn't give it less!    Lady Isabelle Milborne survived an abusive marriage.  During that marriage her husband made her a partner in a scheme to revenge himself on Justin Everard, the Marquis of Wroth.  Belle was really an innocent in the matter of framing Justin and forcing a duel, but Justin believed she betrayed him.  He was in love with her and felt his actions (winning her in a card game!) were justified to save her.  Belle saw it differently, but to protect him, she pretended to have lured him into her husband's clutches.  The duel ends badly and though Lucian Milborne lives (but does not recover completely), Justin flees the country and enters the military.      Three years later, Justin returns a hero and is now the Duke of Westmore.  Belle is a widow, with a small pension and modest demeanor.  But Justin is not fooled and sets out complete his own revenge.  By implying he will court her young sister-in-law (Chloe) whom Belle loves as a sister, Justin forces Belle to become his mistress.  Just the hint of scandal makes the ton snub Belle and she is no longer even allowed to talk to Chloe!  Justin has a conscience, and removes Belle from London to his seaside home.  He shows himself to be a wonderful gentleman who continues to love and care for Belle.  Though they both try to remain impersonal and remote, they cannot hide the growing attraction and love.    There are villains that force separation of the lovers.  All the side characters are well fleshed out and I see a story or two coming out of them.  You cannot see how this will end.  Belle with her protective qualities always plays second fiddle and Justin, too, places duty above love.  Nice reading - and of course the happy ending isachieved.	2005-08-06

As I normally read historical novels, from the get-go, a modern setting it is not my favorite genre.   <br /> <br />But I did feel this one had a good plot and the storyline was believable.  Stacia, a reporter for a mildly respectable tabloid is sent to cover the wedding of Paul Curtis, a socially prominent and wealthy man.  The wedding is a merger within industry also.  Paul is actually piloting the plane that will take Stacia to the wedding.  Stacia, who wanted another assignment, takes an instant dislike to Paul as he does to her.  She is rather disillusioned with men in general, her husband having been a philandering deadbeat.  Paul dislikes her turning his wedding into tabloid fodder. <br /> <br />The plane crashes in the Sierra Nevada mountains and Stacia and Paul must act as a team to survive.  Sparks fly between them and eventually that anger turns to love as they make their way slowly to civilization.  Though Paul tries to resist, Stacia actually takes the lead in seducing him.  But can their love survive the adventure?  Will Paul's mother and fianc put an end to this romance?  And what will happen now that Stacia's ex-husband George appears again - claiming to love her still?  I enjoyed this quick, sweet romance.       <br />	2005-07-24

These are both \\"Second Chance at Love\\" books.  Normally I do not read modern romance but stick to historical or regency-era books.   <br /> <br />I was not very impressed with this short novel.  Poor Claudia barely survived all that happened to her.  Betrayed, dumped and divorced - then losing her one time husband at a young age, she is ready for a change.  Her brother sends her to a dude ranch where his rich client poses as a ranch hand.  (Why, we never really find out!).  Then Claudia almost becomes the victim of an escaped lunatic.  Surviving that encounter, she is finally off to look at turquoise with the \\"ranch hand\\" Rick Morgan - and is caught up in an earthquake!  ARG - what more can happen!   <br /> <br />Despite the various mishaps, Claudia and Rick become very close.  I did find the mild sensuality of the novel appealing.  But Rick finds out that Claudia knew who he was.  Having just suffered through an acrimonious divorce himself, he figures she is just after his money like his first wife.  There are angry words spoken and Claudia leaves the ranch and Rick's life.  She is devastated for the second time and begins to globe hop in an effort to forget Rick.  Has he forgotten their time together too?  This was a quick read and I did find it fun - just not much plot.  <br />	2005-07-24

Her heroines have huge impediments to overcome - blindness, spinal cord damage and now brain damage!  But I love a good struggle and I loved Laura in this book.  She sees life differently since a diving accident deprived her of some intellectual abilities.  Her mind is sound; just the interpretation of it is skewed.  Although her view of the world is rather nave and childlike - it is so enjoyable to watch her bring happiness to those around her.  How could Isaiah (her boss), a well educated man, be so taken by her?  But he is.  Like other Anderson heroes, it is love at first sight - but he fights the attraction!  After all, there is a written code about fraternizing with co-workers. <br /> <br />You will root for Laura in all the trials she endures.  Getting the job in the veterinarian's office as a kennel worker was one big hurdle and keeping it another.  She has made one mistake with the food; and yet another with leaving a kennel door open!  But she insists to Isaiah that it wasn't her - and that she has an eerie feeling someone else is in the building when she works the night shift.  Will he believe her?  Is there someone sinister out to get Laura? <br /> <br />The romance and intimacy which you know will eventually occur is wonderful and sweet.  But Laura will walk away from it all because Isaiah needs someone accomplished and charming; not someone \\"stupid\\" like her.  How will it all work out in the end?  I was captivated by all the main and secondary characters and the warm Coulter family.  Of course I am endeavoring to obtain and read the entire series.  I am reading it out of order but they appear to standalone quite well.  Highly recommend!   <br />	2005-06-27

The requisite happy ending was not a reality at the end of this book. Even the epilogue did not leave me with a warm and fuzzy feeling. It reminded me a little of the ending in Balogh's \\"Dancing With Clara\\" because the rake was not sure that he was reformed. Otherwise, the storyline in \\"The Rake\\" was worth following. The novel pulls you in from the beginning with an early morning duel. The \\"son\\" of the wronged man takes his father's place in a duel and is injured by Sebastian, Duke of Brabourne. Sebastian directs servants to take the injured boy to Sebastian's home for medical care. Much later Sebastian finds out the boy is Juliet Smythe-Clyde, daughter of the man he was to duel. Word gets out from Juliet's unscrupulous, man-hungry, society climbing step-mother about Juliet being in Sebastian's house and Juliet suffers the snubs and shunning of the ton.  <br /> <br />Much of the story revolves around Sebastian trying to raise Juliet's standing in society's eyes. He does not trust women at all and we find out why along the way - one can't help but sympathize with his lonely childhood. As much as Sebastian tries to avoid it, he is forced to save Juliet's reputation by marrying her. There are some interesting meetings with Prinny and Juliet's step-mother is worthy of note. She does add a different dimension to the brew! Even Juliet's weak father develops a little spine towards the end. Juliet, herself, is a wonderful heroine full of fire and innocence. I liked her a lot.  <br /> <br />One is left with hope in the end, if not complete faith in the future happiness of Sebastian and Juliet. But happiness is the gamble all couples face even under the best of circumstances. Well worth picking this book up for an entertaining read! <br />	2005-06-27

I loved how we dropped right in the middle-just one week before \\"ruined\\" Gillian is to wed Prescott. Every person is well portrayed, warts and all.  <br /> <br />The children act real and \\"not perfect,\\" though near the end, the three year old seems too advanced. Prescott is reserved but only \\"just so,\\" while still having an adult relationship with his wife. They have lively quarrels. Everyone acts mature, still having fun but not silly as in many Regencies. The extended family members, such as the overbearing mother and sister-in-law, add a superb dimension!  <br /> <br />For laughs, wait until you read the Christmas pudding scene! A \\"not-to-miss\\" enjoyable read. <br />	2005-06-27
US	52272094	R5VCIFIOSJEXB	0451409892	947961599	Phantom Waltz	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Romantic and Sweet	This was my first Catherine Anderson book.  I normally only read Historical and Regency-era novels, so a modern setting was really different for me.  What an enjoyable romance.  It was old-fashioned in many ways ... except our heroine was imperfect!  Bethany was such an unusual and strong woman.  I just loved her!  And who couldn't fall for handsome and wealthy Ryan Kendrick.  (He was just a little TOO perfect!) <br /> <br />I really enjoyed that Ryan seemed to fall in love first, and very deeply.  That he went out of his way to convince Bethany of his love by paving half his ranch and buying her horse Wink back -- I can't decide if that was too over the top or not -- a little almost \\"stalking\\" in my book -- but it did work out in the end.  The love scenes were tasteful and realistic.  The bar scene (except the almost-assault!) was funny in that EVERYONE knew there was a little trouble under the sheets for our couple.  Of course that works out in the end also.  <br /> <br />I liked when Ryan saved Bethany after she was trapped in her auto during the snow.  Saving her via a snowmobile made sense.  But after that how did his entire family, including very young children, make it to his house.  That just bothered me!  Otherwise the book made sense and was fun to read.  Highly recommend - I can see I am going into the modern world for a few more Anderson books! <br />	2005-06-26

The major portion of the story takes place with our heroine spending time with her mother (an actress) and the rest of her time as a \\"pedagogue\\" (governess) to the youngest Marchant sisters.  Diana Forsythe believes herself to be the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman much like her mother was.  Diana's mother (Flavia Forsythe) has managed to keep Diana respectable and plans to help her become a teacher after her year of experience as a governess.   <br /> <br />But these plans fall apart after Diana helps a young \\"provincial\\" aristocrat get some town polish.  Sir Sabin Mallory, recently from Canada, has fallen in love with Aurora, the older sister of Diana's wards.  While visiting the house (where he is looked at with ridicule by Aurora), Sir Sabin sees Diana.  Having met her while visiting her mother backstage one night, he had also assisted Diana another time when she injured her ankle.  Sir Sabin begs her to help him improve himself.  She does so by directing him to tailors, etc... and encourages an actor friend to serve as a teacher also.  Diana risks compromise by attending some assemblies and a masquerade to help him with dancing.  <br /> <br />During Sir Sabin's \\"come-out\\" at a ball given by the Marchant's, he is successful in gaining the detestable (as you come to find out) Aurora's attention.  He also unfortunately draws unfavorable attention to Diana after providing her a beautiful ball gown as a gift for helping him.  Of course it is really sent to her from an \\"aunt\\" but later the truth comes out.  The Marchant's, believing Diana to be Sir Sabin's mistress, throw her out into the streets!  Diana returns to her mother and the rest of the story follows their adventures traveling to other towns to put on plays.   <br /> <br />There is much more to the story after her time with the Marchants but I will not spoil it for you!  Will Diana win Sir Sabin's love now that she realizes she has fallen for him or will he stay with Aurora?  Will Flavia marry the actor she has been engaged to for a long time?  Who is the mysterious aristocratic man who travels with the theater (and trained Sir Sabin in the ways of the ton)?  All the characters and locals are well defined and fascinating!  Read this engaging book to meet them all and find out how the story ends!  <br />	2005-06-12

You are on the edge of your seat wondering how any happy ending can be achieved.   <br /> <br />Clemency Barsford plans to wed her childhood sweetheart (Damien), but her family feels she is too young.  Damien goes off to war - and is reported missing, presumed dead.  Heartbroken, Clemency barely has the will to go on.  But a neighbor, Lord Rodger Colbourne, offers her a way out of being forced to London and the marriage mart.  Marry him!  A widower, injured in the war and mourning his young wife and stillborn son, he plans a marriage, not of convenience but a way for them both to have a family without the burden of love.   <br /> <br />They had met when Rodger saved Clemency as a young teen after she had been dared by her cousin Beatrix to cross the floor of a dangerous ruin and been trapped!  Yes, you will learn early on that Beatrix is the villain.  She is the resentful orphaned cousin of Clemency - yet has been raised as a sister and not a penniless relation.  Regardless of that fact, Beatrix spends her time planning on how to BECOME Clemency! <br /> <br />Clemency does marry Rodger and as time passes realizes she loves him deeply.  More so than when she was infatuated with Damien!  But fate intervenes - Damien returns, still in love with Clemency.  Beatrix, with her sneaky ways, sparks jealousy in Rodger about Damien's role in Clemency's life and causes a huge rift between them.  This book contains both danger and passion.  You feel Clemency's pain when Rodger doubts her faithfulness.  But all is resolved in the end and even Damien finds love.  What happens to Beatrix?  You will have to read this book that I highly recommend and find out!     <br />	2005-06-12

I loved that Emily is plain and overweight - as she states herself \\"she inherited her mama's mousy brown hair and pudding bag figure.\\"  What a wonderful twist to actually make the duke prefer (and eventually come to love) such a plain woman when he had four lovely blond beauties awaiting selection as a bride.  A Regency novel just like the TV show \\"The Bachelor!\\" <br /> <br />Jarad (the Duke of Montford) truly did have a dilemma - in fact several.  And he was getting no where close to solving them.  Most Regency's never supply men solid friends outside of drinking and gambling clubs, so I especially enjoyed Jarad's relationship with his cousin/secretary. All the other characters are well fleshed out with stories of their own to follow.  <br /> <br />Highly recommend.  I could hardly put it down!	2005-06-12

I'm not much into the political climate of England during the War of 1812, but even so I found the intrigue surrounding our characters appealing.  You will also find our hero and heroine engaging too!   <br /> <br />Cecily dreams about the handsome man who saved her life.  He came to her rescue when the coach she was riding in was about to run off a cliff.  But she didn't see his face clearly.  She just knows he was nothing like her aunt's guest, a very \\"pink of the ton\\" - or is Lord Brandon not what he appears to be?   <br /> <br />I found this book pleasant but slow moving.  I didn't like the military men who were searching for smugglers and harassing all the citizens but they were integral to the storyline.  I liked Lord Brandon when he was playing the fop - there are some very funny scenes and descriptions of him. Cecily catches on very fast that this is a disguise.  Is he playing her aunt for a fool and smuggling?  Or is he a traitor to England?? <br /> <br />I did enjoy the old cat Archimedes - sometimes sweet, sometimes \\"witch cat\\" - and one of the better characters in the book!  This book was OK - not a keeper but satisfying afternoon read.	2005-06-10

Secundus was a wonderful man and his ever-faithful and patient Helen waited for him to return from his journeys.  Would he have the fortune he felt he needed to continue his pursuit of Helen?  I thought it was fantastic that Helen had created a fulfilling life (without Secundus) involving charity work.   <br /> <br />The other two romances involve Secundus's nephew and niece (Robert and Ruth).  Rutherford, Helen's brother, finds Ruth attractive but cannot see her as his wife and feels she is too well bred to be his mistress.  I liked Rutherford.  He was the one who interfered with Secundas and Helen's romance when he was young and now being too high in the in-step to follow his heart regarding Ruth.  He had a hard time bending his own rules to admit he loved Ruth.  He also looked out for his friends and family.   <br /> <br />Robert's love is Lucy Chalmers and her father stands in his way.  What father would allow his precious daughter to marry a penniless man encumbered with three siblings!  Lucy is so funny - decides she will not see her father since he said he doesn't want to see her until she forgets her infatuation.  She keeps to her room while the squire's house goes to rack and ruin - and no good meals.  See how long the stand-off lasts! <br /> <br />Hmmm I'm wondering if Lieutenant Ralston might end up waiting for Tibby to grow up.  As you will find out, there are many other delightful characters to meet including the other Alchesters and Secundus's man Paulo.  Fun reading; lighthearted; all ends happy.  <br />	2005-06-09

There is more suspense then romance but it was an enjoyable story all the same.  Another reader of my copy wrote in the front cover \\"eerily weird\\" and she was right.   <br /> <br />Arabella has been sent to her great aunt's house to recuperate a little from London town life.  A beauty and heiress beset by many young men, I tend to think her father did not want her left with just a chaperone (another aunt) while he was in France on business.  So off she goes to a rather austere castle populated by some very interesting relatives and FIVE ghosts!   <br /> <br />The racket they make!  Two young men fight with swords through the night, a young French beauty brought back as a war trophy who eventually murdered her English husband and children haunts the halls, and an ill-fated couple - a matron and her brother-in-law caught in rather compromising position in the hayloft were run through by her jealous husband and wander the halls together. <br /> <br />Besides the ghosts, there is the very handsome Sir Francis whom Arabella develops a tendre for!  But does he return her love or is he infatuated by the pretty Constance, another cousin?  Why are the ghosts becoming more bothersome?  The inside cover leads you to believe Arabella falls in love with one of the ghosts, but that is not the case.  All the inhabitants of the castle both living and dead are noteworthy.  There is a mystery to solve and some danger for our intrepid castle dwellers.  Read it and find out who wins in the end ... specter or man!  <br />	2005-06-09

I liked our heroine (Ellen), a stubborn Scot, wanting to marry for love despite the fact it was her third season.  Unique also in the fact she fell in and out of love very easily.  Our hero (Corey) is spectral through most of the book except in the beginning when he and Ellen are sharing some special moments watching fireworks.  Too bad Corey did not listen to an old family retainer Fenton who predicted doom! <br /> <br />Our hero is fatally injured when the fireworks misfire, and he is somewhat tended by Ellen who, due to her own injury, happens to be in the same room when he dies.  Corey promises to \\"find her the perfect husband before the chrysanthemums bloom\\" for her constancy to him in his last living moments.  Unfortunately Ellen has determined she is in love with Corey (and no one else will do) and the air crackles with unfulfilled passion when they meet while he is a ghost.  He cannot even touch her since the \\"glow\\" causes a burn on her skin.  You will like how Corey gets around this problem and manages to dance with Ellen - very sweet scene. <br /> <br />I felt that Ellen fell in love too quickly.  For that matter so did Corey ... but this is a romance!  Secondary characters are interesting.  I liked getting to know Corey's heir but I don't know if he will have his own romance later - I kind of wanted him to.   The ending is tied up fairly quickly but satisfies the Regency reader by being the happy one we expect.  Do not peek ahead to find out how this is achieved.  I can recommend this for some light reading - didn't touch my heart a lot.      <br />	2005-06-08

A total of five authors weave valentine romances about four young ladies and their \\"chaperone.\\"  All the stories take place in the same village of Valentine Parva, at the home of Cressida Trent.  Cressida, a widow with a young son, is only thirty-four so there is valentine love in store for her also! <br /> <br />These lovely low-key romances all occur at the same time and each story mentions incidents that happen to other characters so be prepared to jump back and forth in time (just a little!) until you reach the conclusion of the book. <br /> <br />As each story is rather short, I will not synopsize each one - that would spoil it.  I will tell you that \\"A Maid at Your Window\\" by Carola Dunn was my favorite simply because I identified the most with that heroine.  But all the stories are delightful and hard to believe they were written by different authors!  You will enjoy the young ladies, all with different circumstances and temperaments, Cressida's young son Toby, song-filled canaries and assorted beaus.  The men are all diverse too!  Highly recommend - one of the few anthologies that reads like a full book.  <br />	2005-06-01

Zabrina Faire (aka Florence Stevenson) wrote under several pseudonyms.  Sometimes her Regencies border on gothic but this particular one did not.  It was a traditional regency ... with a twist. <br /> <br />Julia, a penniless governess, has just lost another position.  Circumstances (in some cases her beauty!) have prevented her from finding long term employment.  Along comes her school friend Flora who, along with her brother, devises a scheme that will net her a little money and help Flora's brother Frederick.  Julia just has to pose as Frederick's fianc for a short time.  That way \\"old\\" Uncle Randal will not write his nephew out of his will.  Since Uncle Randal (the Earl of Combe) caught wind of Frederick's infatuation with an actress, there is danger another nephew will be chosen as heir.   <br /> <br />Julia unwillingly takes on the task and in traveling to \\"old\\" Uncle Randal's estate finds a man who is not old but definitely ill.  The doctor has urged a sea voyage to restore his health and Julia finds herself taking the voyage too!  There is a storm and Julia and the Earl end up overboard and washed away.  The remainder of the story is their adventures after being rescued by an old woman.  There is some sadness in the story as this good woman is lost to them.  Also Julia and Randal fight a growing attraction to each other.  Julia is horrified that she perpetrated such a lie about being Frederick's fianc and Randal cannot dishonor his nephew's fianc!  What a quandary! <br /> <br />There is some fun near the end - after all, the Earl was given up for dead and now that he is not there are some explanations required.  Why is that actress at the Earl's estate for one!  And will the Earl marry his friend's daughter that they met on the trip home?  Julia feels that the Earl will never return her feelings after he learns of her lie!  Can he?  Read this delightful story and find out.  Highly recommend. <br />	2005-05-30

Sophia takes her sister's place as bride to the Earl of Greshem (Alex) as the rather scatter brained Daphne decides to elope with another man.  As the Earl only needs to remain married for one year, Sophia feels she will have some financial independence when the marriage is dissolved - enough to continue her intellectual and literary pursuits.  (She is writing a book.)    But there is so much in store for her!  The rakish Earl turns out to be different than he is first portrayed.  He is caring of his tenants and they move from London to his country estate in an effort to clear up some problems.  Sophia continues to write but takes on the duties of visiting tenants and helping them.      Sophia overhears Alex discussing their marriage with a family friend and is a little afraid he has decided to make her fall in love with him and then break her heart (as revenge) when the year is over.  She is unsuccessful in remaining distant, yet never lets Alex know she loves him.  Sophia loves the country and together they redecorate their home and begin to make a life for themselves.  I liked how you see Sophia take care of Alex, fixing his tea just the way he likes and making sure his favorite cakes are served - (ok a little chauvinistic but this is the 1800s!)  There are some (mild) intimate scenes not normally found in Regency novels which enhanced the storyline.      But there is trouble in paradise.  Daphne returns unmarried yet still untouched and flirts unceasingly with Alex.  Other people also arrive to disturb them including Lady Felicia Cavendish (apparently Alex's mistress).  She flaunts her attractions under Sophia's nose and says very nasty underhanded things.  Sophia fights back by withdrawing from the domestic life even more - though working tirelessly both in the house and on her book.  She also writes love poems to her husband but hides them from view.  Will he breakher heart in the end?  Is he the unfaithful rogue he appears to be or the gentle lover she cares for?  Who will win his heart in the end?      The secondary characters are all well fleshed.  You will enjoy the whole entourage of people that descend on Alex and Sophia --from Sophia's sister to Alex's friend Robert.  Felicia is a worthy catty opponent and Sophia does show her claws on occasion too!  Wonderful reading - I could not put it down!	2005-05-30

I loved the breathtaking descriptions of exotic locations and fascinating conversation amongst the characters.  Zabrina Faire (aka Florence Stevenson) wrote wonderful regency's (also under the name Ellen Fitzgerald) but her gothic flair really comes out in this book.   <br /> <br />Jenny had felt forced to marry the disturbing \\"little man\\" Comte Hector de le Garde.  He only wanted her money which Jenny's grandmother had given her.  Jenny's grandmother, Emma, has second sight and Jenny was most like her.  Emma was a commoner who had married well (now Lady Lamkin) and the ton believed that a title is all the upstarts were after.  Even Hector's step-brother Lord Rande (Thurston) was barely civil to Jenny.  But Jenny caves in and, at her mother's and grandmother's insistence, she becomes the Comtessa de la Garde. <br /> <br />This marriage does not start on a good foot at all.  You will find the wedding night rather humorous since Jenny is unwilling to suffer Hector's advances - \\"you have my fortune ... you do not need me as well.\\"  <br /> <br />But a wedding trip to Africa - on Lord Rande's ship results in stops at foreign locations, stormy weather, meeting of interesting secondary characters and the real romance- which of course is between Jenny and her disapproving brother-in-law, Thurston.  Hector again and again proves to be nasty and overbearing and at one time has to be restrained after he erupts in violence and assaults Jenny!  His mother, Louise, has some tricks up her sleeve which are difficult to foresee but you just know something is not right!  <br /> <br />Although the mystery quite overtakes the romance, this was excellent reading and I could hardly put it down until all was resolved.  All is resolved happily for our couple in love and villains meet an untimely end.  The introduction of the paranormal (physic abilities of several characters) was very nicely woven in the theme.I truly enjoyed this book and recommend it highly.   <br />	2005-05-27

Sabrina is one of my all-time favorite contemporary love stories.  Seeing it turned into a historical novel was wonderful.  All the great plotting by business-like Garrick Throckmorten was there.  And Celeste Milford - what a heroine - our little gardener's daughter all grown up.  Determined to get her man (youngest brother Ellery Throckmorten), she has returned from being educated and polished after serving in the household of the Russian ambassador.  She has been hired to serve as governess to Garrick's daughter Penelope and Ellery's illegitimate daughter Kiki.   <br /> <br />Ellery in all his roguish glory is ready to abandon his fianc for Celeste.  But Garrick wants to preserve his careful plans for a marriage between Ellery and powerful Lord Longshaw's daughter Hyacinth. So Garrick sets out to seduce Celeste himself or at least keep her occupied and away from Ellery.  Throw in a subplot of spying and a couple of mischievous and charming children to round out the storyline.   This also made it different than the original contemporary Sabrina. <br /> <br />There is lots of fun, mayhem and laughter within these pages.  Also the physical attraction between Garrick and Celeste is acted on.  I found those scenes tender and tasteful.  Secondary characters such as Celeste's gardener father, the cook, all the other servants and the children are well fleshed out with stories of their own to tell.  The villain is nasty and gets his due.  It touches your heart in the end. <br /> <br />I believe Garrick's and Celeste's personalities were kept too hidden which made it a little unbelievable they would have fallen in love so deeply.  That is why I did not give it a 5.  In all, this is a wonderful feel-good book.  Not to be missed.   <br />	2005-05-26

That seems like a sad editing problem or whoever wrote the \\"teaser\\" couldn't make it through a synopsis!  Alissa ffolkes is the OLDEST daughter of the Baron ffolkes and as such should marry before her sisters.  But she is shy and having \\"not taken\\" during her first season was sent home early.  Will she have to endure another season?  The next oldest sister Henrietta is not a shrinking violet - beautiful, accomplished and nasty - she would like Alissa out of the way since her plans involve capturing a handsome nobleman for herself!  Elizabeth, the youngest, is sweet and adds a dimension of youth and innocence to the storyline.   <br /> <br />This starts out so well.  I loved that Alissa was different - raised falcons but suffered from severe shyness.  But this didn't seem to last and although shy at first, once Lord Ives has finagled his way into the family situation, she has no problem talking to him.  Lord Ives was different and attempts to help Alissa with her various ailments.  (She suffers a fall in the beginning of the book and has trouble walking for a while).  I just felt he was so intrusive!  Did he fall in love with her at sight?  Again the book indicates it is Alissa that falls in love immediately but the storyline does not portray that.    <br /> <br />\\"Duffy,\\" Lord Ives friend who becomes the love interest of Elizabeth is rather unique.  He spouts proverbs constantly - actually I began to wonder about his sanity since most didn't seem to match what the discussion was about.  Other secondary characters are bizarre to say the least.  Baron ffolkes only talks of dogs and sheep.  Baroness ffolkes strides around like a man and interested only in flowers.  Neither seems interested in their children - except perhaps \\"daddy's girl\\" Henrietta.   <br /> <br />I had to skim through the end of this book since I could not stand to read it closely anymore.  I have read several Hendrickson books and I have not found them to be keepers - yet I have a couple more on the shelf that I will have to wade through and see if my mind is changed.  This book may be enjoyed by others but I found it very tedious.   <br />	2005-05-23

What a dilemma!  He cannot stand her outgoing manner and her apparent dislike of him.  She hates his rakish, dissolute ways and only remembers how he tormented her as a child.  Well, this marriage must end and lawyers begin the task of annulment. <br /> <br />But Florrie's father has other plans.  He, along with Alford's father, decide these two will be a better pair then if Florrie marries Kit.  Just the thing to give Alford a purpose in life!  They both send the \\"children\\" out of London to a remote location until gossip dies down.  Of course they send them to the same house where events conspire to keep them there!  Chaos, fun, romance and mystery occur during this forced cohabitation. <br /> <br />As each tries to drive the other away from the remote house (when Ol' Mort decides to arrive!), they actually begin to see each other in a different light.  They also begin to care for one another and struggle to keep those feelings from surfacing.  After all, Florrie will marry Kit and pursue a life as a diplomat's wife even though she feels Kit sees her more as a \\"sister\\" than lover, while Alford feels he must honor his brother's fianc.  But the mystery of the \\"Lady in White\\" and some possible illegal activities going on force them into each other's arms.   <br /> <br />Of course it all ends happily!  Perhaps there is a sequel about Kit who remains unseen though this book.  There is an intimate scene not normally found in Regencies but I found it tasteful and conducive to the story.  Though fun and great reading, I did not give it a 5 since it didn't touch my heart - but I still recommend it highly. <br />	2005-05-21

The beginning was really wonderful, but I lost some interest in the middle.   <br /> <br />Livia has fallen in love.  Her blond Adonis, Lord Ormond, says all the right things - doesn't seem to mind she is an intelligent woman in her third season.  Livia has sadly been in the shadow of her lovely fair cousin Marianne, her exact opposite.  Marianne is the toast of town and not a thought in her head.  Now both are engaged!  Marianne is to marry her father's young friend Sir Justin Warre and she is not happy about it.  When her fianc comes to London for the double wedding, they all meet each other for the first time.  Livia finds Sir Justin a little unyielding and judgmental but he appears to care for Marianne.  But when the wedding day arrives, both Livia and Sir Justin are left at the altar!  Jilted - Marianne and Lord Ormond have eloped to Gretna. <br /> <br />The pursuit is on.  First Lord Semple (Marianne's father), Sir Justin, Livia and her maid Nancy set out after the errant couple.  But an accident occurs and Lord Semple and Nancy are left behind while Sir Justin and a disguised Livia carry on.  (This was a little outlandish ... but it is fiction).  Posing as uncle and nephew, robbed several times and left penniless, Livia and Justin end up at a sort of traveling fair, where there are boxing bouts, gypsies, etc...  I was not very interested in a great portion of that.  Later there is an abduction - and when Sir Justin recovers his missing \\"nephew,\\" we understand that his feelings have changed towards Livia and both are no longer pining for their respective fiancs!  He is harboring a secret which we find out about along the way. <br /> <br />Villains, including the witless Marianne, receive mild retribution at the end.  The ending was rather nice.  Pleasant reading. <br />	2005-05-18

Of course all actresses are loose so she receives her fair share of offers.  One was from William, Earl of Morgane.  She not so politely refuses his offer of protection in Bath.  Within a year, Fancy finds herself the owner of a house on hoity toity St. James Square.  The fashionable women ignore her but the men all tip their hats.  Her neighbor turns out to be the Earl of Morgane, who renews his pursuit of her.  At the same time I felt his actions were driving her away - at one point William tells her \\"Get out of St. James Square.  You are not wanted here.\\" <br /> <br />Our virtuous Fancy continues on.  She picks up a couple other admirers, one of them being the Duke of York.  By pretending the Earl has won her, Fancy deflects his interest.  There are some fascinating scenes regarding rioting at Covent Gardens due to increased rates and some other theater personalities that are mentioned and worth noting.  Fancy has a big sheep dog Hercules that is mischievous, wreaks havoc and causes some funny situations.   <br /> <br />The romance is not very believable.  She is asked to marry by both our hero and another member of the ton.  I didn't see any bonding among her and any of her beaus!  The Earl was rather cruel at times, holding her up to ridicule and letting her reputation suffer!  They were always fighting and until the end had not come to that point where I felt anger turned to love.  But this impossible tale has a happy ending.  Animals, servants and other characters made the book endearing - enjoyed the theater aspect.   <br /> <br />Recommend for calm afternoon reading.              <br />	2005-05-15

The heroine (Penelope Mayes) is NOT going to marry the hero (Lord Cheselden) in name only but his nephew!   <br /> <br />Left penniless and homeless after her father died and jilted by her fianc Alister, Penelope starts out for her new position as an instructor in a school.  Along the way she is robbed, tries her hand as a barmaid, is propositioned and almost loses her virtue!  Finally ending up under the kind auspices of Lord Chesenden's mother, Penny still insists on helping around the house - she does not want charity!  When Lord Cheselden (Jack) returns home with his \\"left at the altar\\" nephew Clive Murray, they come to a unique decision.  If Penny marries Clive, he will receive his inheritance and she will have the freedom of his name and wealth. <br /> <br />The story continues along that line but as Penny remains as a family member, Jack falls in love with her.

Another scarred hero saves our sweet neglected maiden.   This tale takes place in Portugal.  I love that Janette Radcliffe places her characters outside of England.  She describes the locales so wonderfully and it is a great change of pace.   <br /> <br />Claire Stanhope is ignored by her father and kept hiding in the wings by her lovely older sister Gloriana.  Since their father wants to continue his bachelor existence, he hopes to marry them both off - the sooner the better.  Gloriana is courted by some very eligible men and has set her mind to catch Luis de Valente.  He is handsome and wealthy but has managed to elude matrimony.  Claire catches his eyes and he thinks she would make his younger brother a suitable wife.  But, when Claire's father decides to wed her to an older man who she thoroughly dislikes, Luis finds her in tears and comes up with a solution.  She will pose as his fianc, stay in his home for the summer and protect him from marriage minded misses!  She agrees - and comes to his lovely blue tiled home (azure) - meets his family and falls in love with Luis - even knowing the engagement will end with summer. <br /> <br />Gloriana appears at the castle along with other unwanted company and turns out to be a horrible jealous villain.  How will this all sort out?  Will Luis save Claire for his brother ... or will his heart find a woman worthy of loving?   <br /> <br />This short Candlelight Regency packed a lot of adventure and love in its few pages.

But arriving home after a singularly disappointing night out - breaking up with his mistress, losing at cards, drinking with a friend, he finds a unusual young woman and her chaperone at his home.  A compatriot from the Napoleonic War has made him the guardian of his daughter Phillipa.  Sinamor's war injury which causes him to limp is evident in the storyline but not to extreme.  Sinamor quickly takes Phillipa to the home of his cousin and childhood friend, Lady Dearborne.  Winifred Dearborn with five sons takes on the task of educating Phillipa on the ways of the \\"ton.\\"  She treats her like a daughter.  There are lots of fun situations involving all the sons.  Phillipa barely keeps her reputation secure with all the scrapes that transpire.  Along the way, the mutual feelings of anger and distrust between Sinamor and Phillipa turn to love.    Every Regency has a villain and in this case one is Phillipa's cousin Gervase Wakehurst.  He poisons her mind against any other suitor including her guardian.  Of course we realize he is a fortune hunter, card shark and all around horrid person.  Another villain is Sinamor's discarded mistress Helene.  She stirs up trouble in a very unique way.     For some reason, my heart was not stirred by either the hero or heroine.  Although we are given insight into Sinamor's character due to his horrible loveless upbringing, his tormented soul was not really projected well in this book.  Phillipa cried too much and I felt was a bit immature for a supposedly hardened rake.  She also appeared to be terribly uneducated and bored with everything.  Also, there really was no evidence of Sinamor's wickedness, except for a mistress which was commonplace.      Despite the above, I did enjoy the interesting cast of characters and the horse-mad Phillipa!  My favorite part is when Phillipa puts herself in danger to save the youngest Dearborne and Sinamor is frightened by her near miss and FINALLY declares his feelings with words and action - (my paraphrase) - \\"You little fool - You might have been killed!\\"   She had little time to fret over his words ... for he took her crushingly in his arms and kissed her violently.  (She returns his kiss with equal passion.)    Nice afternoon read --	2005-05-01

Is it Priscilla or Katherine, the governess in disguise, who comes to Ivy Halls for a marriage of convenience to Lord Colton Penryhn?  Told in first person, we are Priscilla, but all others in the house are skeptical of her identity!  Ivy Halls abounds with mystery in this gothic regency.  What happened to the former mistress, her young daughter and Priscilla's twin sister who disappeared shortly after the former master died?  Can Priscilla clear her name and survive the attempts on her life?  Priscilla has also fallen in love with her cold husband who flaunts his current mistress right under her nose! <br /> <br />This was a quick but confusing read!  I never liked Colton - even after the ending - you know when you find out why he was cruel, untrusting and indifferent.  I normally can figure out the mystery but not in this case.  There was such a huge cast of characters and I couldn't keep them straight!  I didn't like the horrible violence perpetrated against the young girl - it could have been a little less severe and still kept with the storyline.  I did like the first person and Priscilla was an admirable heroine.  Just OK.   <br />	2005-05-01

Kicked out by cousin Cedric, she begins to walk towards Harrowgate but is accosted losing what few possessions she has except for a mysterious locket she believes was her mothers.  The Duke of Lyveden, whom I never came to like either, picks her up and has stimulating conversation with her as they travel along.  She only knows the name of one person in Harrowgate - Madame LeStrange - and being dropped off there is so gullible, she is drugged and dressed and prepared for the life of a courtesan.  Just too much! <br /> <br />The Duke (did I EVER know his given name?) rescues her, and proposes she pose as his fiance so he can \\"test\\" the three women he will choose from to marry.  What that will prove, I can only imagine?  Eventually they make their way to London, where we meet The Duke's obnoxious little sister and two of the ladies lucky enough to be selected by THE DUKE - the other lady in contention just ran off to America on learning the Duke was betrothed!  (Lucky her!)   <br /> <br />Dreary, dismal reading - impossible situations - no redeeming characters.  Also Antoinette is being chased by another nobleman who was to be her first lover under Madam LeStrange.  Remember we have that mysterious locket of her mothers!  At one point, Antoinette actually dresses up like a courtesan and pulls a vamp act on the Duke -which results in him slapping her \\"with such stinging force she was sent flying across the room.\\"  HORRIBLE - awful - it would have been better if they had never met!

Janette Radcliffe weaves interesting storylines with great characters.  I've noticed her main male characters normally have a scar of some sort on their face.  I cannot decide if it is to show he is flawed and overcame it or if he has great loyalty for his country and fought to preserve his way of life.  Anyway, I like her imperfect men, since the scar is mentioned just in passing and in no way dominates the story. <br /> <br />Miss Vivian Lesley has traveled with her young sisters to the home of their guardian Lord Gilbert- at his invitation.  She has spent years caring for her ill father and mothering the younger girls.  Their mother was lost when she was just 12.  They arrive to find out Lord Gilbert had not invited them and that his young sister replaced his own letter with another!  Vivian is tired and angry.  Feeling unwanted, they prepare to move onto an Aunt's house - but Gilbert convinces them to stay on to keep his sister, his brother and himself company.  Later a chaperone and her daughter Adelaide are also introduced.  It is perceived that Lord Gilbert will marry the serene Adelaide, yet he seems to value Vivian for her common sense and lively manner.  He senses she needs a rest from all her worries and responsibilities. <br /> <br />Lord Gilbert takes them all under his wing, presenting them with new clothes and new adventures all within the luxurious confines of his castle.  There are other young people around and perhaps some romances are forming among them.  But Vivian has a secret.  She writes gothic romance novels.  She is in the process of writing a third with hopes that the success of it will generate the funds to live independently.  Since Lord Gilbert stirs her anger in many ways, she has made him the villain of her novel.  Along the way, as we notice her feelings change, the villain also changes in her book.   <br /> <br />There is some intrigue, a thwarted elopement and other disappearances to solve.Will Gilbert find out her secret?  And if he does, what will he think of the villain in her book?  Will he choose Adelaide as his wife while stealing passionate kisses from Vivian?

They are light reading and sometimes you find a jewel among them.  \\"The Cardross Luck\\" is one of those jewels.  The heroine Heather Mallory is so admirable.  She is not ashamed of her background, nor does she hide it.  Her mother, widowed, married into trade when Heather was young.  Her choice of husband was poor and he worked her to death, both in his shop and taking care of his young sons.  Heather took over the work after that and when the sons died young, Frederick Bannister left his wealth to his step-daughter but entrusted to his cousin Joseph Bannister until her marriage.  As the wealth was being recklessly spent, Heather looks to contract a marriage of convenience for one year to gain control of her money.   <br /> <br />Ian Cardross has always been lucky (The Cardross Luck) but due to some bad feelings with a grandfather, he is left with a moldering castle, an orphaned nephew and no money to properly care for either.  He is an honorable man, a large laughing red-head with a scarred face from the war.  Heather (with the help of her solicitors) finds him principled enough to contract a marriage with.  He will be given a large sum of money to do with what he wants if he agrees to stay married for one year. <br /> <br />So they begin this marriage, a family of three - for the young nephew, aged 9, falls immediately into Heather's spell and trails her like a puppy.  But there is trouble in paradise.  Both Ian and Heather have bothersome cousins that spoil their happiness!  While Heather begins to make the castle a home as a way to keep busy, Ian appears to be romancing the beautiful and deceitful Amelia.  Although so loving at the beginning, she hardly recognizes this taunting man she married.  There is much unhappiness as a large party from London (including Amelia and both cousins) descend into the country. <br /> <br />Will Ian return to Heather, now that she loves him?  Will she be forced to leave him? And how canshe remain faithful to her promise to Daniel (Ian's nephew) that she will not desert him?  There are some intimate scenes in this book as the marriage is made true long before all feelings are resolved.  Wonderful storyline, interesting characters and you are left on the edge of your seat wondering who the real Ian is!   <br />	2005-04-16

It was just a similar plot used in other Regency novels.  But this one has some interesting twists which makes it different.  <br /> <br />Kathleen, our young gauche country woman (but very comfortable in her own skin) overhears some London dandies talking about her as she works in her father's stable in Ireland.  One of them (Giles, the Duke of Havenhall) is not complementary at all.  Although he admits she is beautiful, he does not think she could hold her own in a London drawing room. <br /> <br />Kathleen, seeking (mild) revenge against the Giles, travels to her grandmother's house hoping to have a season in London, but wanting to gain some polish.  Her very proper (English) grandmother has never acknowledged her grandchildren and in fact cut all contact when her daughter married an Irish Earl (Kathleen's father).  Kathleen looks so much like her daughter, dead for many years now, that she does take her in.  Kathleen works hard to learn the ways of the ton and once taken to London, she is a success. <br /> <br />Kathleen catches the eyes of Giles ... but also of other more dubious suitors such as Lord Ramsdale.  Even though Ramsdale is accepted in the best of houses, there have been rumors surrounding him.  (The reader is privy to his debaucheries.)  Giles cannot understand some of the coldness Kathleen presents him with as she remembers his rude remarks.  But he is entranced by her!  His rather abrupt marriage proposal is rebuffed.  His more formal proposal is rebuffed also!  What's a man in love to do!  (We realize that Kathleen has fallen in love with him also but not sure she is ready to forgive him.) <br /> <br />There is a kidnapping to endure but I loved how Barbara Hazard lets the heroine save herself!  Kathleen is no shrinking violet!  It does take a little help from Giles to get out of the unsavory predicament.  Kathleen also embarrasses herself in other ways - realistic since I don't think a person can change overnight.  Secondary characters such as Kathleen's five brothers, father, assorted friends and even servants are well fleshed out and have interesting minor parts to play.  The horse theme was appealing too!  I enjoyed the chapter titles - they were witty and were a sneak peek at what was to come.  It concludes with a satisfactory romantic ending.  Worth obtaining!    <br />	2005-04-16

Older, cynical man and woman who had been denied the fun things in life. But the story did not capture or hold my interest. The \\"pretend\\" courtship between Meg Sutton and Johnny Trevore wasn't even believable.  <br /> <br />Wrendale started out an interesting character but he wimped out too fast. For being so cynical he changed his tune too quickly. There was not a lot of emotion or passion between Meg and Johnny. They just seemed to fall in love without any interacton at all!  <br /> <br />Marden was pretty ingenious as a villain and was worthy of note. The most appealing character by far was Johnny's mistress Patsy Billington! A quick light read. Not much to offer. <br />	2005-04-15

I enjoyed the playing off each other that each sister did. Deirdre easily slipped into the background because she lacked the looks of the other sisters. Her own mother did not try to bring out her beauty and let her develop her inner self.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Deirdre turned out to be a very weak heroine. A very talented poet, she was willing to give it all up and even pretend she didn't enjoy any literature - all for a man! It was love at first sight, so Deirdre's sister turned her into a fashion plate and voila, she turned into a beauty with confidence to spare (too quick and too contrived!).  <br /> <br />Lord Wrotham, the hero, who had resisted all marriage minded misses was so taken with her that he too was willing to give up any hope of meeting a woman who shared his love of literature. There was a little misunderstanding and each thought the other didn't like poetry. I think he would have looked around a bit for someone who (he thought) shared more of his interests.  <br /> <br />Other characters in the book were intriguing and I liked when Deirdre met other writers. Mr. Flinder was an interesting villain. Worth a quick read but not a keeper. <br />	2005-04-15

Hilary Vane gave up her teaching position to open a finishing school of her own in Wycomb Valley. Wycomb Valley was rather remote, on the Scottish border, and she was there with her brother Matt a doctor.  <br /> <br />Enter Johnathan Rayner, Duke of Alverly. A shaggy duke in his shabby clothes, Johnathan was arrogant and overbearing at times. A true \\"border lord\\" as Hilary liked to call him - and right to his face. They get off on the wrong foot when he pooh-poohs her idea for a school and talks the farmers out of sending their daughters to it. But after the doctor and Hilary care for his injured sister, he changes his mind about the school and with just a few words brings the pupils she needs.  <br /> <br />Eventually Hilary must fight a powerful attraction to Johnathan. He offers several times to enter a discreet affair but Hilary stands firm in not wanting to be just the duke's mistress. The tension is very thick.  <br /> <br />Other characters and the side romance (though very subtle) between Matt and the duke's sister Belinda are developed quite well. Also there are several interesting situations presented such as a foiled attempt at the duke's life, scenes of a mine and the mining \\"shack-town,\\" a farmer's daughter rebelling against an arranged marriage, bearing witness at a trial and various medical situations among them. The story flows wonderfully. I thought Johnathon's excuse for avoiding marriage was a little weak. A very worthwhile read! <br />	2005-04-15

It spoke about how mundane it was and why any current news was so important-also why a new parson was a thrill - something new to gossip about!  <br /> <br />I enjoyed getting to know Claire Oliver. Her parents and she dealt with life in a mature and intelligent way. It seemed they knew how to be gracious and joyful. Mr. Bennett was an honorable hero, who had been pushed into the church. For once, it was the man with little control over his future. He made the best of it and still pursued his dream \\"to make a difference.\\"  <br /> <br />Mr. Bennett also realized that he could never marry Miss Oliver. Not only was she \\"above his touch\\" but his path was going to be a rocky one. He believed in making waves. Lord Babcock (babbling and cocky!) was a wonderful secondary character! His pursuit of Claire is hilarious, but when he really falls head over heels for Claire's cousin Lydia, it gets even better. All the secondary characters in this book are enjoyable including Claire's Aunt and Uncle (parents to Lydia).  <br /> <br />Not a lot of distress in this book, just some soul searching. It did get a bit clichd in the end with how everything was resolved, but I will not disclose the ending. Needless to say, our hero & heroine fall madly in love and do end up together.  <br /> <br />Pleasant reading. <br />	2005-04-15

Laura kept fading in and out of 1998 to the year 1898 at very dramatic times after a wish upon a star. Both hero and heroine were tormented souls who found each other despite being born a century apart. I liked how Corby did not believe Laura immediately when she spoke about 1998. It took him a long time to trust Laura and made their love all the more precious. Corby's relatives, both during 1898 and the ones Laura knew in 1998 were out of the ordinary. Corby was shown as very human and even had a side one couldn't like very well. Laura too had her own foibles. The path of love is not easy. You will cheer for a happy ending and will not be disappointed. The sexual tension was wonderful and the love scenes were sensuous. If you are a time travel fan, you will love this one. <br />	2005-04-15

I have read and enjoyed many Barbara Allister books but this was not enjoyable at all! I just wanted to slap Rosemary and tell her to stiffen her spine -- this from a reader who doesn't mind some helplessness in the heroine! Rosemary was just too weak. If I were Mr. Huntington, I would have ran the other direction as fast as I could. I did not really grow to like ANY of the characters in the book. Rosemary's father seemed bizarre at times -- didn't want to help her face her debilitating problems, yet drove himself to distraction trying to find the culprits of a strange crime against Rosemary (They cut off her hair). The stepmother blew hot and cold -- seemingly sympathetic, then remote. The hero was kind but why did he bother with Rosemary to begin with??? She did not seem his style. At least he tried to get to the root of her panic attacks which at the end of the book did seem to happen less and less. None of the other people in the book grew on me and many were not fleshed out. The book was confusing at times since they intimated at problems with Rosemary's father's first marriage and her stepmother's first marriage which made no sense at all? Are they in previous books?? The children of Stephen Huntington's brother (twins) were cute.  <br /> <br />This novel did contain a few intimate scenes normally not found in Regencys which I found interesting and there is no violence or intrigue (a plus to me!). Not that much to recommend it but -- if you like to read all the books Barbara Allister wrote you may want to slog through this one. Maybe it will make more sense to another reader. Not a keeper for me. <br />	2005-04-15

Throw them all together and you get an interesting, yet bizarre tale! Annalise is a romantic young woman, her head filled with dreams of marrying a charming prince. A commoner, she agrees to marry the new Duke of Marchfield (Bryson) having been told he is returning from a monastery. Bryson has been locked away in a horrible place in France - a priory housing the insane. Treatment was regular punishment. He had been ill when he entered and after six years his slow recovery and his own silence kept him alive. How will this travesty of a marriage come about - or survive? He is like a beast!  <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed how this author got into the minds of her characters. What a different perspective. The story takes place slightly before Regency times (hope I've got the years right!) during the French revolution and is played out in both England and France. When I began this story, I thought it was medieval times because of the situations - you don't realize how little control people had over their own fate even during later years. Some more horrible scenes are torture that happen to a French aristocrat.  <br /> <br />Everything was wrapped up a little too quickly! Otherwise, this was very good reading. Very different! <br />	2005-04-15

Her characters are not fully developed in the books that I have read, but it does make for easy reading. This novel is the 2nd in the Waverly sister's saga. Three \\"orphans\\" raised by a man- hating Mrs. Waverly grow to adulthood with a very skewed view of society and gentlemen in particular. Though we never find out why Mrs. Waverly feels so strongly, we do come to understand she only wanted the three girls to assure company in her old age and set out to make them rivals to each other. She remained cold and emotionally remote throughout this book.  <br /> <br />Frederica makes a delightful heroine because her views are strong in wanting to be an equal to men but not radically so (at least in today's standards). She seemed rational compared to Felicity, her younger sister. Lord Harry Danger (Danger??) is not dangerous at all but a true gentleman in every way seeking to capture Frederica's heart by solving the mystery of who the \\"orphans\\" really are. That mystery is NOT solved in this book. Maybe it is solved in the sequel about Felicity which I hope to obtain.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book and hope to find the prequel also. There are some escapades involving drunks, thugs and thieves which add a rather odd element but seemingly the only way to introduce a little adventure into the dull Waverly's lives. Other characters are introduced but they are not fully developed -- one is Harry's mother -- very strange woman who does not appear to have a good head on her shoulders due to the constant bullying of her late husband.  <br /> <br />Oh well, take the book as it is -- a light read with some appealing people. <br />	2005-04-15

I liked much of this story. It involves a very young duke, the nephew of our hero. Someone is trying to kill him and our heroine and hero become involved in trying to find out who that is.  <br /> <br />What bothered me was that Arden (our time traveler) felt the only way to make Royce learn to have fun again was to seduce him. I found that thinking flawed and was disappointed when he finally succumbed to her - after all he was trying to be honorable and true to his betrothed. Plus Royce was worried about who was trying to do away with the duke (his 12 year old nephew William). I felt there were other ways to help remember more carefree times... Both Arden and Royce seemed a bit shallow - I found no depth to them!  <br /> <br />Other characters in the book were interesting. Giles and the Dowager Duchess, Dora, were well fleshed out and their romance was actually better than the \\"main\\" event. Arden's Aunt Lavinia added a nice touch to the story.  <br /> <br />All loose ends were tied up much too quickly, plus Arden was too modern throughout the book - I think she would have been rejected by everyone in society for her shocking ways --  <br /> <br />Good for a quick read, not a keeper. <br />	2005-04-15

How many books have fainting dogs, man-hating dogs, escaping dogs, horse biting dogs, sheep killing dogs (unfairly labeled!), and little blind barking mites of dogs. Throw in a spy in the shape of a French courtesan, a respectable duchess, a \\"fallen\\" schoolteacher, a sweet companion (our heroine) and a toplofty viscount (our hero) and you have a delightful romp with all sorts of hilarious situations!  <br /> <br />Poor Corin (our viscount hero)! All he wants is Primrose Cottage to serve as a place to hide a spy (serving England). Now his Aunt Sophie has died, the place will be his! But Aunt Sophie had other plans and the cottage was left to her companion, Angelina. She is to care for all the remaining dogs that Aunt Sophie has collected during her life, oversee the building of a \\"home for dogs,\\" and collect a little salary besides.  <br /> <br />Corin tries hard to find homes for these dogs for the sooner they are gone, the sooner Angelina is gone. But instead he loses his heart as \\"Angel\\" becomes less a drab companion and more of a lady. The romance is very sweet. Angelina tries hard not to lose her heart since she believes she is unfit to be a Lord's wife. <br /> <br />You will laugh your way through all the dog tales (pun intended) and other intrigues that go on to a very satisfying conclusion. Well worth reading and keeping! <br />	2005-04-15

Envisioning the cover stud as Reynold in the story made me cheer that he chose not to make the church his vocation in the end. It would have been such a waste! Reynold's honor, and struggle to do what was right really touched a chord in me.  <br /> <br />There was one too many gratuitous \\"almost-rape\\" scenes but the clever way Reynold had of saving Katherine from the first villain was inspired writing.  <br /> <br />The mystery, betrayal, distrust and struggle to maintain vows to church and to her betrothed all wove together to make a compelling novel. The historical elements were good too. I have re-read this many times and highly recommend it to others. <br />	2005-04-14

Miss Lockharte thinks she is dying and does just that. In this unfortunate instance she expresses a little too much of what she has seen and felt - and then she doesn't die!!!  <br /> <br />After writing revealing letters to various people in her life, Rosellen survives the flu and now is the victim to a murderous cleric and his school mistress sister. She may not live long after all! Her letters cause all sorts of chaos and misunderstandings, some with hilarious results. Viscount Stanford (Wynn) receives one such letter - his very brusque negligence of her in the very few moments they first met led to some of her trouble.  <br /> <br />Touchingly, her letters (written in the beginning of the book) tell each person of her unfulfilled dreams - \\"I am dying and I have never had a waltz or a dog or a family Christmas ... I have never worn a silk gown ... never known a kiss from a man who loves me ... never held a child of my own.\\" But she does have a friend (Susan, Viscount Stanford's sister) and Susan convinces Wynn to leave flowers on Rosellen's grave. He attempts to do this and finds Rosellen very much alive (though doing very poorly) and decides to assist her in recovering her health and find her a husband. It took longer to convince him that she was under attack (remember the murdering cleric) -  <br /> <br />I liked how Rosellen was still strong and didn't want Wynn's charity. I'll leave you to read how that is accomplished. In the usual happy ending, Lord Stanford will be the one to fulfill most of her dreams. (How she gets the dog and what the dog is like is a hoot!) Lord Stanford becomes a better man, learning to take other people's feelings into account, and getting in touch with his own feelings. Secondary characters are well fleshed out and the bad guy gets what is due him without undue violence. Entertaining and delightful tale. Don't miss it!!! <br />  <br />	2005-04-14
US	52272094	REZXZ2YDTG5QI	0449216373	364137178	The Errant Earl	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Good Story; Still didn't like the Earl	I liked this book - worth maybe 3 1/2 stars -- the storyline was good. Much of the beginning was Scott remembering the past. I would have preferred conversation during the actual events then just the memories. It contains a typical storyline -- man marries then abandons wife for war. Wife (who is usually mousey) turns into attractive and admired woman, then man returns-- What was different is that Scott truly put Laura through the ringer before he left telling her how much he disliked her and why. Scott was forced to marry his pudgy childish country neighbor because his father wanted him to. Deep in debt, Scott was promised the freedom of a commission in the army if he agreed to his father's wish. Laura had been told that he wanted the marriage and was devastated by his callous treatment!<br /><br />The bulk of the story is after Scott's return from war. He is older and wiser and wishes to make a real marriage. Laura who never really stopped loving him guards her heart carefully. There is rivalry for her affections by an old enemy of Scott's which also adds a little intrigue into the story. Also, the woman Scott had loved before marrying Laura makes her appearance. She married and was then the widow of Scott's brother (the former Earl). There is also a \\"secret\\" which I will not reveal. The use of letters in the beginning of the book is very appealing. You find out how words can be misinterpreted when seen in another light.<br /><br />Good book but I never got over my dislike of Scott's early treatment of Laura. I didn't think he apologized very well and I am not so sure I would forgive him as easily as Laura, though he does secure her affections in the end.	2005-04-14

Using all her small inheritance, Caroline makes a splash in London during her one season. She catches the eye of the Marquis of Kimston and a match is made -- but maybe not. Caroline returns home with the Marquis giving her a vague promise but he does not come through after all. Caroline's family is left virtually penniless and she is left with the grumblings of a father (who lacks good sense) and a very ill mother.  <br /> <br />After her mother's death, Caroline is forced into marriage by her father to the Marquis of Kimston's father -- an aged, flamboyant man. Caroline comes to love him after a fashion but he dies the morning after their wedding. Was the marriage even consummated?  <br /> <br />The Marquis, now the duke, holds the purse strings and Caroline finds him heartless in his control over her. Rumors swirl around the dowager duchess and Branville (the duke) believes the gossip and tries to keep Caroline under his thumb. She pours her energy into a charity for indigent women.  <br /> <br />This is such an interesting story with lots of torment and emotion. The duke and dowager duchess love each other but circumstances and a nasty villain with goals of his own get in their way. It was hard to see how this could end happily for either party!  This is not a light hearted read and is very intense ... worth reading, a keeper! <br />	2005-04-14

He is trying to look out for the wife of his friend (Helene) and to avoid being caught sneaking around he slips into an empty room. Only it's not empty - it's inhabited by Alexandrina (Drina) Alcott, poor relation to other houseguests. Guess who gets caught? Simon offers a marriage of convenience. Thoroughly compromised, Drina has no alternative but to accept the man she is secretly fond of. Drina, with the help of Helene, becomes fashionable and Simon continues breeding his horses. She hosts wonderful parties attended by the cream of the ton and Simon is proud of her but maintains his distance. Drina comes to believe Simon's mistress is Helene and how that affects her relationship to both husband and friend is interesting. Helene is harboring a secret - a secret that brings intrigue and danger to Lord Arundale's estate. Throw in a severe grandmother and some situations become downright unbearable for our heroine.  <br /> <br />Remember this book was written in the 70s and contains some gratuitous violence towards women. Thank goodness more recent books of this genre are no longer like this. Drina confronts Simon about something his grandmother said to her and calls the grandmother a witch. (Really two pages later and I still didn't get what she was so insulted about!) Simon slaps her and off Drina runs to her room. Enter Simon, repentant with a cool rag for her face and there are mutual apologies -which leads to a kiss which leads to consummation of the marriage. Would you feel loving after a good slap & what did she have to apologize for???  <br /> <br />Good for a quick read. If not for the slap, would have enjoyed it better. <br />	2005-04-13

I took pleasure that Laurentia wore her heart on her sleeve. With so many conniving females in Regency novels, it was refreshing. Villiers was the perfect husband and perfect Lord wishing to protect the woman he came to love. They made an engaging couple. The other characters, grandmama, Coxwell (the valet), and the villain (Sir Alan) were well portrayed too.  <br /> <br />After a leisurely pace the ending came awfully quick, tying it all up with a Christmas bow. I would have preferred a little more substance at the end but... it was nice to read a light tale for a change. <br />	2005-04-13

The tenth Duke of Lowestroft, Earl of Coldfield, Viscount Alston all of four years old and known as Jackie to his guardian decides he would like a mother. And he has found the best candidate in Lady Halstead's niece Miss Amethy. The Halstead's are neighbors. Amethy is as pretty as a princess with violet eyes which she was named for. Now, if only he can make his guardian, the Earl of Northford (Desmond Marling) fall in love and marry her, he will have a mama!  <br /> <br />Thereby starts the tale with Jackie and servants conspiring to play cupid and throw the soft-hearted rake and the low-dowried Amethy together. They meet first at her Aunt's home. Lady Halstead has two young boys that play well with Jackie. She also has another on the way. It is an inauspicious first meeting. Northford thinks Amethy is marriage minded and that he is the prey and lets her know that is unacceptable. Amethy has no such ideas and believes him to be rather snobbish to think that. But there is no dispute that he is devoted to his ward and she loves children also. Later, Jackie and the servants who dote on him arrange for a \\"Winter Picnic\\" to again pair Amethy and Northford. Calamity follows the boys and the \\"inside\\" picnic turns into chaos with fake lizards, pets escaping, guests screaming and falls resulting in Jackie's nurse breaking her leg. Then Lady Halstead's baby decides to arrive. Thus, Amethy must remain with Northford and her aunt and uncle rather than be left alone with the boys at their own home.  <br /> <br />Adventures follow with three mischievous boys who are adept at escaping adult supervision no matter how strict! Amethy and Northford are always trying to find and assist them out of their predicaments. Each time there are humorous results and many muddied and destroyed footwear to the chagrin of all! Not to mention always being caught by the other adults in rather funny circumstances (not compromising since they are always with three children).  <br /> <br />There is a villain in the story - Lord Battenton trying to compromise Amethy even to the point of trying to kidnap her and another love story which develops along the way. It all ends in a tangled mess of elopement and kidnapping and carriage chasing with funny results. The children are even in on this escapade! Lord Battenton will not be amused when he finds out who he accidentally kidnapped!  <br /> <br />I found this story flowing and amusing with wonderful secondary characters. The children are amazing and the author develops real-life personas! There is not a HUGE amount of romance in it for our main characters -- mainly a uniting of minds and a realization that life will always be fun if they marry! My copy is a reissue and I am glad to have found it. It was enjoyable and fun reading and I will be looking for this author's other books. <br />	2005-04-13

I liked it very much. The writing was excellent and the story compelling!  <br /> <br />It is a dark and disturbing tale which might be good to know before you read it. This type of story causes those of us used to light-hearted tales to do some soul searching. Most books do not show the barbarism of war or mention the violence perpetrated against the innocent. Benedict and Liria are both victims tortured by their war experiences. Their journey to love is a path strewn with self-hate and denial. We catch glimpses of their torment along the way. There is not a tremendous amount of romance in this book, but there is a tremendous amount of love! Amazingly, this story centers completely around the duke unlike other Regencies. There was so much caring shown between the men which is very rare to see. I enjoyed reading about the devotion of the butler Luster to his employer. What a good man to have on your side! All the other characters are well fleshed and you are invited (maybe sucked!) into their lives.  <br /> <br />Benedict lacks the realization that he is truly a good man. He believes that any good he does is because of someone else-it takes a long time for him to understand it really WAS his nature to help others. But he was no paragon. There were enough demons in his past and some selfishness to make him human. It was very nice to meet old friends from Libby's London Merchant. Liria, of course, carries six years of bitterness and guilt in her heart. You will be heartsick when her life story is told but rejoice to know that life truly is what you make it. She was proud enough to move on. The children are a wonderful balm to both our hero and heroine. There are reminisces and reconciliation along the way.  <br /> <br />Wonderful reading; read Libby's London Merchant first if you can - Carla Kelly is a great author and you are always in for good reading when you see her name. Just remember all books are not light reading and look at this book in that light. <br />	2005-04-13

Though some disliked it, I enjoyed this pleasant tale immensely! Having just finished a gruesome historical, it was nice to escape to a slow paced, gentle romance. I liked Emma - which of us isn't embarrassed by our families (especially in our teens/twenties). She wants to disassociate herself from them as does her cousin George and they take off to London. Maybe not the best of motives but it made Emma very human. (Who wants to be called Dreadful instead of Drenville!) Both George and Emma come to appreciate and love their family by the end of the book.  <br /> <br />Emma is also a bit clumsy, forthright and honest, and as quirky as her relatives - collecting recipes! Though love changed her in many ways, Emma did not change in the end which I liked (no ugly duckling to swan transformation). Captain Nicholas Hale, jaded seaman that he was, was fascinated and amused by Emma and her family. His own family is nothing but a source of frustration. They certainly don't appreciate him except for money lending! Perhaps in the book Nicolas fell in love a little too quickly for my tastes, but I loved his gentle pursuit of Emma. Everything he did for Emma was done so sweetly (and romantically!) that I couldn't see how Emma could resist him! There is a little drama at the end with a misunderstanding, and Emma's withdraw from London. The side characters-Emma's family, Nicolas's family, George, Lord and Lady Chitting and their four sons were wonderfully portrayed. Scenes with the dance master and the four Chitting son's mischief were very amusing!  <br /> <br />I loved the letters written at the beginning of each chapter. What a great touch in telling the story! My favorite part -- the ending -- \\"A stumble ensued, followed by a timely catch and a number of kisses. Then they went down to the street, where they were embraced by a party of noisy, inquisitive, joyful Drenvilles.\\" If you are looking for a lovely drawn-out romance with well-fleshed out characters, you will enjoy reading this one. <br />	2005-04-13

There she is pursued by the obnoxious Squire Malvern. She also learns of the true nature of Lord Ramsay who helps her out of a few scrapes. Our hero is a wonderful uncle to his ward Geordie and friend to his scholarly tutor in addition to being a historian. He cares for animals and people, yet is human with foibles of his own. Olivia matures as she experiences love for the first time and with that love growing between Olivia and Gervas (Lord Ramsay) all appears to point to a rosy future.  <br /> <br />But Squire Malvern doesn't like being spurned and finding out about the earlier wager, he sets out to do mischief by informing Lord Ramsay of it.

This one follows that pattern but it just isn't as good as some of her other books.  <br /> <br />The storyline: Engaged from her christening day to \\"Smokey\\" Lord Stokely (age 6 at the time), Emilyann is cared for & loved by him and his quirky family. Emilyanne (or Sparrow as Lord Stokely calls her) is virtually ignored by her wealthy father (a duke) who never really recovered from the loss of his wife in childbirth. The child is left to follow her own headstrong ways growing up wild and adventurous. Most of the childhood adventures are shared by Smokey. After some scandalous behavior by Smokey's father, Emilyanne's father dissolves the engagement - but ten year old Emilyanne gets a reply to her smuggled letter to Smokey saying \\"Dear Sparrow, Don't worry. I'll marry you anyway.\\" This early part of the book is very heart warming and fun. You do get inside \\"Miss Meadow's Academy\\" which was mentioned in another Metzger book.  <br /> <br />The remaining bulk of the book is after both parents are dead and Emilyanne's wealth is held in trust by her ne'er do well uncle and her father's man of business until her marriage. The will also provides some bulk of the wealth to whoever has an heir first (the uncle or Emilyanne). Uncle Morgan gets it in his head to marry Emilyanne (now 17) to his rather lumpish stepson. To avoid that, a quick trip to London disguised as a boy and a reminder to now Major Lord Stokely of his promise to marry her results in a quick wedding and a marriage of convenience.  <br /> <br />While Smokey soldiers his way through major battles and dangerous campaigns, the newly married Lady Em holds down the home front becoming an excellent manager, hostess and companion to Smokey's younger siblings. In the rest of the book, the now angry Uncle schemes to kill his barren wife, his niece or her husband. Stokley on some home leave tries to make his marriage a real one but is staved off by a reluctant Emilyanne who is now surrounded by various men but only has eyes for her Smokey. When he returns to war again and is injured, she nurses him back to health and in the end happiness and love is professed by both of them.  <br /> <br />What I found annoying was the various accidents the uncle set up. No one seemed to think anything of it as they were nearly killed dozens of times. If it was supposed to be funny, it wasn't. Also, Smokey could only harp about the fact he was penniless and didn't want to live off Emilyanne, all the while ignoring his estate or any management of it or concern for his younger siblings. He sent letters dictating what she should do with only his selfish motives as a guide. He was very remote and hurtful when Emilyanne was nursing him and I never got over the fact he didn't really apologize for his behavior. I guess his declaration of love took care of all that. The introduction of a little pug dog was nice and the beginning of the book was very sweet.  <br /> <br />Anyway, I did get a book that was light reading though I had a hard time finishing it. <br />	2005-04-13

Miss Felicia Simmons not only took on the chore of being the breadwinner for her family but continued to care for others along the way. She collected waifs and strays of all kinds and some became her servants. They, in turn, were loyal to a fault. Felicia's father had lost his money due to his own generosity and went into a decline after his beloved wife died. Felicia retired from society and kept the family going by giving music lessons and selling off possessions. Her father kept to his room with his own wonderfully loyal valet who opened the windows every noon hour for his master to hear the bells of the church where he was married. The way this \\"family\\" cared for each other was touching!  <br /> <br />Felicia was proud enough to keep the front door of her fashionable residence clean and the brass knocker polished to high shine by doing it herself early in the morning. That is when Sir Christopher Wilde sees her. Thinking her a servant, he remarks on her to his friend (Bartholomew Whitiker) who lives in the apartment below. Finding out later that she is a down on her luck lady, their lives become entwined as Christopher makes Felicia his \\"project.\\" He tries to deny the attraction he has for her and very clumsily asks her to marry him for only a weak man can \\"love.\\" Much like Darcy in Jane Austin's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" he asks for her hand against his own scruples and Felicity is insulted at his manner! But Christopher does such tender things for Felicia along the way, you wish he would put his bitterness and fear aside and follow his heart!  <br /> <br />What a sweet story with amazing (and unusual) secondary characters. Felicia is innovative with her ideas on how to bring in money and never succumbs to despair even when these plans run awry. There is some intrigue with Christopher and an enemy from India I couldn't quite follow but when he is hurt, Felicia realizes the depth of her own feelings. Felicia also has an enemy butthat rival eventually gets her due - no bloodshed there.  <br /> <br />All ends happy with each person learning to trust their hearts. A pleasant tale for an afternoon read. I am looking forward to reading more in this series. <br />	2005-04-13
US	52272094	R1QC3PGWEJ5UX9	0449212793	745879101	CHERRY RIPE	Books	3	3	3	N	Y	Light reading; not true to the times	I searched for this book because it seemed interesting.  Same plot as many other Regencies - woman runs from forced marriage right into the arms of the man she was betrothed to.  In this case, Shauna Elton leaps on her horse (astride!) to race out of London away from her beloved step-mother's plan to marry her off.  Shauna ends up in trouble and Lord Drummond (Damien) saves her.  The step-mother is an interesting character, very kind, just wanting to settle Shauna down.  She believes Lord Drummond who is young yet entrusted with the care of four younger siblings will be just the man for the job.  Eventually Shauna comes into his employ bringing joy and stability to the children (twins) Felix and Francine and a voice of reason to the older Freddie who has just gotten kicked out of Eton.  (We only hear about Mary who is away at school.)  Damien cannot keep his hands off Shauna and since he believes himself betrothed to a woman in London, he suggests she become his mistress.  The story resolves itself in the usual manner but I won't give it all away! <br /> <br />I liked the lightheartedness of this book but it was so unrealistic.  Shauna was alone in a carriage with Damien for hours when he took her to her old nanny's home.  He kissed her many times.  Even compromised in such a way, not one person seemed concerned.  Shauna was too forward thinking and modern talking.  I don't think Damien would have wanted her for anything but a mistress - she had too many male friends and flirted shamelessly even with his teen-aged brother.  The name Shauna is so unusual and since Damien suspected her of being gentry, he had to be particularly dense not to realize the governess and his unseen betrothed were the same woman.  Those are just a few of the things that bothered me about this book!  <br /> <br />So there you have it; an ok read; not a keeper. <br />	2005-04-13

But it was a strange conglomeration of stories and people which sometimes became confusing. I found the interaction of the Dowager Lady Winslow with her son and his fiance more interesting at times then the actual romance between Lord Winslow and Alexa Eiseley. <br />  <br />Alexa gives shelter to young Leigh Winslow and a nosey neighbor happens to see. The nosey neighbor mistakes the nephew for the Earl and to avoid scandal Lord Winslow and Alexa agree to become engaged until gossip dies down. As expected in a Regency novel, the two recognize the good points of the other and the \\"false betrothal\\" becomes a real one in the end. But how that came about seemed unlikely since most of their conversations revolved around how to end the betrothal and very little about anything that would make them fall in love.  <br /> <br />The other characters and stories turn out to be more interesting and fun. Young Leigh Winslow finds out the debutante he has a tendre for has a boorish family and no personality outside of fashion and dancing at balls. That was funny! Also there is a counterfeiter loose in Bath and how that is resolved becomes a fascinating account.  <br /> <br />Pleasurable for afternoon reading but doesn't stir the emotions. <br />	2005-04-13

Barbara Hazard is one of my favorite authors and her books weave locales and characters of such intensity that it is hard to go back to \\"real\\" life.   <br /> <br />As another reviewer says, it was truly hard to like and forgive the four men known as \\"Satan's Rakes\\" and I'm not sure I ever did!  Two of the four are not redeemed, one dying at the hands of another of the four but on his way to a drunken finish anyway and the one who killed him is such a horrible villain, you are happy to see him gone.   <br /> <br />The two remaining, the leader of the pack Anthony (Hawk) Hawkins and Will Ashton one of Hawk's favorite yes-men end up at odds over a young woman they involved in a wager seven years earlier.  Anne Ainsworth, unwanted, beaten and starved by her aunt and uncle becomes the \\"ward\\" of Hawk and has been raised as a gentlewoman in Yorkshire.  Loved by all who know her, she is brought to Breden by Will, half in love with her himself, to be prepared for her season.  The wager was that she be presented to the ton as a lady.  Hawk sees only another woman he can use and abandon, but sets out to charm her so he can win his bet.  Unfortunately, Anne finds out about the wager and runs from Hawk with her faithful maidservant and companion.  I loved the resourcefulness of all the women in this book.   <br /> <br />Who will win her love in the end... will she become Hawk's mistress, Will's wife or will she be debauched by the horrible Sir Hartley?

But this is no fairytale life for our lovely Viola Marchmont.  What a sweet, loving heroine.  She prays for the scarred Giorgio Michieli who was somehow betrayed by her father during a diplomatic mission years earlier.  Giorgio comes to her father who is on his second tour as ambassador in Italy, and demands 100,000 pounds and marriage to one of Sir Anthony's three daughters to atone for the betrayal. <br /> <br />So Giorgio becomes part of their life as he courts the young ladies.  Viola, the youngest at 17, is not yet out.  She is more of a household drudge catering to her two lovely and pampered older sisters!  Yet, she is the first to have greeted Giorgio and her loving attitude towards him seems catch his attention.  We get to see them interact on many occasions before he tells Sir Anthony which daughter he wants to marry.  Eleanor and Bernice are appalled at a possible marriage to the penniless and horribly scarred Giorgio, so it is a great relief to them when he selects Viola.   <br /> <br />The sisters actually become jealous upon the realization that Giorgio is quite wealthy and showers Viola with jewelry, beautiful clothes and a lovely hilltop mansion.  But Viola feels she is living a lie since Giorgio has married her only for revenge and has not made her his true wife.  She harbors deep love and affection for him but the closer she draws towards him, the further away he withdraws!  He has not loved anyone since her father's betrayal caused the death of all in his family (parents and young sister).  <br /> <br />You will be entranced by the descriptions of Italy.  Since I have rarely read a Regency locale outside of England or perhaps Vienna, it was very interesting.  Plus, there is a mystery to solve and Viola's life is endangered by the intrigue surrounding Giorgio.  Can he learn to love again?  And what of her rather obnoxious sisters?  Other side characters, Viola's maid and other assorted friends are well fleshed out and a pleasure to meet.   <br /> <br />As always, enjoyable reading from this author who also writes as Janet Louise Roberts and Rebecca Danton.    <br />	2005-04-11

She peoples \\"Give Me Tonight\\" with unforgettable characters, many larger than life.  I was really taken with the father Russell in all his Texas glory.  But his role was much smaller than our hero and heroine, Ben Hunter and Adeline (Addie) Warner.  They were tinder to fire.  Wonderful tension between them which resolves itself nicely with beautifully drawn love scenes.  I enjoyed the fact that Ben keeps telling Addie he was no angel before they met ... and there is the fact that Adeline is keeping something from him too.  That something is the fact Adeline's body is now inhabited by Addie Peck from 50 years in the future.  The new Addie is different than the old Adeline.  She is caring, responsible and not spoiled at all.  She also doesn't trust Ben since in the future she was told he murdered her Great-Grandfather - who she now calls \\"father\\"!  Yes, she is in the body of the woman who was her great-aunt.  The great-aunt that disappeared 30 years before Addie was born!  So there is a mystery to solve and a life to save - and the rather bizarre Mr. Diaz with his all-knowing eyes.  You will enjoy meeting Leah (niece) and Caroline (now Addie's sister).  And the description of life in the 1930s vs. 1880s was amazing.      Now the inconsistencies - first, Ben appears in the 1930s as an old man.  He calls out to Addie \\"where have you been,\\" and later you are given the impression he found her again because of the love they shared in 1880.  When Adeline disappeared in 1880, they hardly liked each other!!  She was the spoiled boss's daughter being courted by the rich neighbor's son.  Also, the rather innocent Addie in 1930 has sensuous dreams of Ben - but since Adeline (1880) had never slept with Ben when she disappeared (to live a second life as Addie), how could she have those dreams?  Also Caroline confessed to an affair with a ranch foreman before she married and of having had a child by him.  Her husband accepted this willingly??  Even though the child's father was willing to marry her, she married someone else??  I just didn't believe it.  Now the fact that Addie in 1880 turned out to be innocent - that was even harder to believe !    OK - suspend belief - put all these irregularities behind you because you will truly enjoy the storyline.  It ends uniquely - don't peek ahead.  But it could have used an epilogue to tell us what the \\"changed\\" lives were like for those that Addie had loved in the future, most especially the young Leah.  Still - I'm glad I didn't miss reading this book!	2005-04-09

Endearing and wonderful characters	Like another reviewer, I just chanced to pull this book from my shelf. A 1982 novel with rather small print, I wasn't sure it had much promise. I was wrong. What a delightful novel with mature, though sometimes flawed, characters. There is not one person you meet that is not well fleshed out with delightful (yet VERY human) personalities. Take our heroine, Pandora. She is rather naive but so full of love and compassion for others. She really can't see the selfishness in people around her. She is taken advantage of by those who should love her best. Her older brother Courtney, army mad, manages to sweet talk her into parting with the remaining family jewels to finance his commission to America. Her younger brother William, though young and more forgivable, tends to deal only with his passions of science then the realities of life. Even her half sister Octavia begrudges Pandora the least bit of affection and attention seeing her only as some small means of advancing herself in Societies eyes.  <br /> <br />Enter the Duke of Heron, thirty-six, aloof, bored but possessing a keen sense of humor and respectability. Pandora, at nineteen, is orphaned and her father was involved in some sort of military blunder before his death. She feels compelled to make her way in the world and appeals to Heron for the position of governess. She learned from an old family friend that he has been made the guardian to two young children. Since this same family friend has told Heron she wanted to help him find a wife, he is confused and appalled by Pandora's request and thinks she is applying to be his wife! How shocking, yet how intriguing, when he realizes the mistake.  <br /> <br />The rest of the novel moves through various stages of the Season and how Heron succeeds in making many of Pandora's wishes come true. He assists (behind the scenes) in solving many problems that crop up along the way. He puzzles over why he wants to help this young woman but of course we realize he is falling in love, even if he does not. Pandora, too, matures during this time, leaving her childish infatuation with one of Courtney's friend behind her as she explores the depth of her feelings for Heron. After they marry, there are the normal \\"getting to know you\\" problems, plus danger appears in the form of a jealous woman. The story moved rapidly and without the drawn out misunderstandings rampant in other Regency novels. You must read this book and meet all the other people from the balloonist to Heron's grandmother. Wonderful must read! <br />	2005-04-02

Yet I come back time and time again to re-read \\"The Baron's Quest.\\"  <br /> <br />I enjoy the refreshing take on a medieval lord (Baron Etienne DeGuerre), arrogant and proud, yet hiding a lonely heart. He has searched his entire life for something he had never gotten - love and acceptance. It was a quest he did not even know he was on. Will the quest end with our heroine, Gabriella Frechette?  <br /> <br />Gabriella, once a lady and daughter of the household, is now reduced to a servant by the debts incurred by her father. The Baron tried to get Gabriella to leave when he took over her father's holdings even giving her money to enter a convent but she is proud and does not want to leave her childhood home. As her servitude continues, Gabriella comes to admire and love the cold Baron and brings his emotions and temper to a head on many occasions. The relationship is consummated one night when Gabriella can no longer hide her love and attraction to him. It is a mildly revealing encounter (not nearly as explicit as other books) but one of the most sensuous that I have ever read. Perhaps I have a good imagination but I can just place myself in the scene. But is her love returned? Since the Baron abandons her without a word after this tumultuous experience, Gabriella is left feeling used and ashamed. How can this end happily? <br /> <br />There are many other interesting characters to meet in this novel. They are all well fleshed out and interesting. Another love story is developed during the course of the Baron's quest and hints of other adventures to follow. I found this great reading! <br />	2005-04-02

His servants were devoted but disliked his black moods. His valet was his right hand man in the war and continues to be that way - deflecting his anger towards useful purposes. You can't help wonder why he is so bitter and reclusive. But later you learn his secret and begin to understand him. (If you read the description of this book, it unfortunately tells you what that secret is.)  <br /> <br />Since Blaize has inherited a library of books which need put in order, he seeks out his old school pal, Dracot, who had been very bookish. The letter of employment arrives at his friend's fianc's door. Diana is in desperate straits! Penniless, she is an unwelcome resident in her uncle's house and cannot bear that she and her brother are treated rather cruelly and shabbily. Dracot has been lost at Waterloo. So off she goes to take advantage of the job offer. Her brother, Archie, is an unusual young man. He can talk to the animals much like a pet psychic or horse whisperer. Although Diana and Blaize have a bad start - he yells at her - Archie has success with an uncontrollable horse and Blaize's aunt persuades him to let Diana & Archie stay on. At first they are just there for dinner but Blaize can see her reduced circumstances and as a way to repay a debt to Dracot for help when they were in school, he asks her to stay and restore the library.  <br /> <br />The storyline follows their friendship and eventual love. Also it contains a little romance for Blaize's aunt. There is a mystery to solve - Dracot's horse is found and Blaize seeks the answers to what happened to Dracot. Could he be alive - and if so, can Blaize face losing Diana?  <br /> <br />I did not find the characters well fleshed out. They were charming but I felt no real emotion while reading this book. The side story of Diana's interfering relatives (the uncle and aunt who were cruel to Diana arrive on the doorstep!) rather ridiculous and annoying. It just did not fit the story well. The arrival of Blaize's parents (the Duke and Duchess of Naunce) was fairly interesting. I like that Blaize and his father come to understand each other better. All in all, I can recommend this for a light afternoon read but not a keeper. <br />	2005-04-02

It's just the rest of the book and the other ghostly visitations are rather hurried. The book does not portray the Earl of Lyons (Lucas) as being pinchpenny or cruel (except in very vague references) so I did not perceive him as a Scrooge. I think it would have made the story more interesting if he had been shown that way. Then redemption would have been more of a Christmas Blessing as the title indicates.  <br /> <br />The story revolves around Elinor Browning, a penniless and proud widow with a young son. Her distant relative Simon Nelson endeavors to find her a position with Lucas (his cousin) as a governess to his young daughter, Annabelle. Simon appears to care very much for Elinor and encourages her to marry him several times in the book - I almost wished she would! Of course Lucas accepts her as a governess on a temporary basis and she sets out to make his house a home and a rather insipid romance develops between them. I found Lucas a sympathetic fellow, burdened with a child that could not have been his own and plagued by well meaning relatives. Elinor rather bullies the servants into creating Christmas joy and his aunt even plans to hold a Christmas party at his mansion without his consent.  <br /> <br />I felt Lucas's revelations about the ghostly visit from his father were mishandled in this novel. When he confides in Elinor that he has seen the ghost of his father, she hardly reacts at all, rather then running for the door from the madman which is what I would have done. Since she seemed so practical and down to earth, I couldn't believe this was her reaction. There were some interesting scenes including parties, illness and run-ins with Annabelle's biological father (her mother's lover) but the entire novel seemed disjointed. I couldn't empathize with any of these characters. A quick read but could have been much better -- <br />	2005-04-02

The governess does say that Lady Susan (neighbor and acquaintance of Alan's aunt) is \\"trouble,\\" but it is Alan that asks her to leave.  <br /> <br />Already starting out strange -- Alan is left high and dry without a governess and his youngest children decide it would be \\"a perfect arrangement\\" for the rather childish, immature Lady Susan to stay as a governess. At least the author had her just visit daily to attend the children and not stay overnight - that would have been too outlandish. So Lady Susan comes daily to care for the children of the widower she is attracted to. Alan's older daughter Jennifer is very adamant in her dislike of Susan as she has been of any woman that looks at her father. Throw in a rival for Alan's affections, a wounded soldier (friend to Alan), Alan's aunt and Susan's mother and you have a conglomeration of mixed messages and stilted conversations.  <br /> <br />Why all the mention of Susan's mother and gambling? Even the first kiss with Alan took place at night when Susan was recovering a stuffed bunny that young John buried with a dead kitten - YUCKO - You see... she did end up staying over when John was ill. Alan even asks this seemingly incompetent woman to teach Jennifer \\"gentlewoman's accomplishments.\\"  <br /> <br />Just one ridiculous scenario after another. They didn't seem to have anything in common - even the \\"other romance\\" in the making seemed unlikely. I did finish the entire book (barely) hoping it would get better (it didn't) and I find very little to recommend except little Anne and her anxiety attacks (stomach ache) - if you like children getting sick all over the place. <br />	2005-04-02

The emotions, the desire - all made for a wonderful story! But then it turned into a typical story of innocent man accused of murder. I don't happen to like those. I felt Lady Diana never truly accepted Jared. Although he forgave her over and over, she showed her distrust of him time after time. If I were Jared, I think I would have given up on her! Still, it was a well written book. The characters acted mature and were believable. I was not all that sympathetic to Lady Diana but I understood her. A good afternoon's read.	2005-04-02

They seemed rather superficial in their dealings to others. Even the villain did not seem particularly villainous until he made his move to kidnap Claudia in the end.  <br /> <br />Claudia, a rather pretty self-sacrificing woman cannot bear the animosity of her sister-in-law anymore. Finding it difficult to live in her brother's house and not rich enough to be independent by any means, she begins in vain to search for a position as nursemaid/governess. Not mature and much too attractive, she is not chosen by any ladies. Claudia rather lucks into the position as companion to the dowager Lady Rexford. Lady Rexford has married well above her station and is looking for a woman to assist her in facing her nephew John (the current Lord Rexford) and the family retainers at Rexford Park in Yorkshire.  <br /> <br />Miss Chambers \\"takes charge\\" of the situation convincing the rather trusting and sweet (but very respectable) Lady Rexford to appear bolder, demanding and high-handed. Lady Rexford does this by dressing in black, tapping a gold handled cane and gazing at people through a quizzing glass. Lady Rexford also allows Claudia and her trusted servant Hettie to speak for her in situations when she feels vulnerable. So off to Yorkshire they go meeting the formidable Lord Rexford and various others who set out to make life a little uncomfortable. Claudia first meets with John, throwing him a little off balance by reading him the riot act for showing up too early, too disheveled and too arrogant to even meet with Lady Rexford. This beginning portion of the book is the most enjoyable. After that, you meet Barbara Brock who all but considers herself engaged to Lord Rexford and Sir Lucas an aging dandy. Each has a role to play in making Claudia miserable. As Claudia begins to fall in love with John, she thinks he is playing her false since Barbara has told her they are engaged but it has not been announced. There is some intrigue involving a Rembrandt and a little chase involved when both the Rembrandt and Claudia are absconded with!  <br /> <br />Some of the things that did not make sense were that Lady Rexford was easily accepted into the country society and Lord Rexford became such a champion of hers so rapidly. Although he was wrong to think her ill-bred, I just don't think he or the others would have come around so easily. The whole Rembrandt/kidnapping story was just ridiculous. It was worth reading the book for the beginning when Claudia helps Lady Rexford gain confidence. But... all in all, only slightly entertaining and not a keeper. <br />	2005-04-02

I thoroughly enjoyed this tale of the \\"Ice Witch\\" and the \\"Devil's Disciple.\\" Both the heroine and hero have retreated behind the facades that society has labeled them with. Although the tangled past of each character is a little hard to follow, the details do eventually come out. Jane Grantly and Vernon (The Earl of Royce) are both wonderful characters. I loved how each sees behind their masks of indifference to fall in love! Jane's Aunt Elsbeth and her own romance is a wonderful side story.  <br /> <br />All the secondary characters are well fleshed out. The children added a nice element to the story also. The story preaches a bit about not believing everything you hear (namely all that horrible gossip) which I found a little tiresome. I supppose the author wanted to bring the point home since much revolves around looking past what is said to what a person does. Some of the incidents that occur are unbelievable but this is fiction! Read it with an open mind and you will find a fun tale with the requisite happy ending.  <br /> <br />This is my first book by this author. She has others that I will be checking out for. <br />	2005-04-02

I was constantly on the edge wondering how each turn of events would go. How could it end happy for this young woman so faithful and in love with a man eight years older than herself? Only eight years older you say but the chasm between a 12 year old and 20 year old is very deep indeed! Yes, Lady Catherine Cahill (Kitty) fell in love for the first and only time with Lionel Eden, Viscount Benning on that fateful day in December, 1811. Her family had gathered at their cousin's large estate as did the rest of the relatives of the Duke and Duchess of Wynn. Lionel of course saw her only as the young sister of his friend Emery and called her Miss Kittycat. He was much more interested in her older sister Millicent! Kitty managed to thwart Lionel's rather innocent flirtations with women closer to his own age (and adulthood!) during that momentous Christmas and in some later meetings also. But as they part, she with her family to Devon and he to go back to the Jamaican plantation he ran for his uncle, she tells him urgently \\"Wait for me! I'll grow up as fast as I can, and you must wait for me! I love you!\\"  <br /> <br />It was three long years before they met again. Kitty spent her time dreaming and hoping to mature. Lion (as Kitty called him) also spent his time maturing and missing England, remembering all his friends and relatives with fondness. Kitty was taken under the wings of the Dowager Duchess of Wynn and though still very young became more fashionable and savvy due to her influence. After seeing Kitty's reaction to Lion during this time, the dowager calls her Lady Lochinvar after a faithful knight (named Lochinvar) in a Sir Walter Scott poem (Marmion). She had noticed Kitty's preferences in 1811 and can hardly believe the steadfastness of the young woman. Lion notices her this time also. She is still much too young and he is not ready to think about marriage but being a good friend of Kitty's brother, Lion is able toride with Kitty and they enjoy each other's company. He confesses his dislike of the life in Jamaica and Kitty convinces him to pay attention to his own small estate and make that profitable. There are some other interesting events during this interlude which weave together for an amazing story.  <br /> <br />But Kitty and her family go back to the country for Millicent's wedding (Kitty managed to make sure she was engaged BEFORE Lion returned to England), and then Lionel goes back to Jamaica to inform his aunt and uncle of his new plans for life in England. By the time he returns, Kitty is almost 17. The dowager invites her to London to begin her come-out. Also to tell her some horrible news. Lionel is engaged. He is lost to Kitty forever. Kitty does meet with Lionel one last time on his estate, pouring out her heart, informing him what she has lost by his engagement and that she will love him forever. The remainder of the book deals with the torment and hopelessness that follows Kitty as she endures her season. She is lovely and her seemingly disinterest of men leads them to swarm to her. She is poised but reckless and Lion tries to dissuade her from marriage to an unsuitable man. \\"Since I shall never love anyone again, why shouldn't I marry where I please?\\" she tells him. How can this book achieve the requisite happy ending? Will she marry the reckless earl with a bad reputation? Can she survive Lion's marriage to a woman Kitty actually likes? Or does fate intervene in mysterious ways? Even though this review is long, it does not bear justice to this book. There are many twists, turns and many absolutely wonderful characters to meet including all of Kitty's family and some of Lionel's friends. A must read and a keeper. You will enjoy this book immensely! <br />	2005-04-02

Anne and Amelia are going through every governess hired for them with great speed due to their hoydenish ways. The Duke (a widower for 13 years) arrives at the family estate on a hot sticky day to find them swimming in the lake with another governess. After calling the woman a \\"wanton jade\\" he tells her to start packing and go on her way. Turning his back he orders the twins to their rooms. But it is no governess he is berating but Lady Juliet Manchester, the sister of the vicar. She has made friends with the twins and feels sorry that they have grown up motherless and their father that has left them to an army of servants for most of their lives. They have three older brothers, now at school. Anne and Amelia are restless and most of their trouble stems from boredom and loneliness. After finding out his mistake [about Juliet being a governess], Severn apologizes to her and asks for some help on dealing with the twins. He is stubborn and autocratic, expecting immediate obedience, and the twins awed by him try to comply, not out of love, but because of the tiresome punishments he imposes. (Not physical punishment, just long hours at study, etc...) Juliet feels sorry for the twins who seem to have lost their sparkle and liveliness under this strict regime. She encourages the Duke to be a little more permissive and less critical. \\"Most girls adore and idealize their fathers ' and then you will never again be the Dreadful Duke.\\" -- Juliet lets slip the nickname the girls (and indeed his sons) call their father. Severn is stung by the nickname and sets out to become a better father. As his caring nature appears, they do come to love and respect him. During an incident later in the story with his son Charlie, Severn reinforces the fact that he really does love his children and just has trouble relating to them. Between learning to show his children that he cared about them, Severn sets out to romance Juliet. He is intrigued by her coolness and apathy towards him. She finally tells him she \\"does not like men,\\" and he makes it his mission to find out why. Of course, inside her mind, we know that she finds Severn attractive and frightening at the same time and that some traumatic event has driven her to forgo marriage and intimacy. The twins actually are trying to play cupid with their father and their beloved Juliet and some of the scrapes they get into are their botched attempts at throwing them together.  <br /> <br />I loved the story because it flowed so well from the country into London ballrooms. The children are delightful, their difficulties and adventures believable and endearing. You come to respect the Duke along with them - he does not become less pompous but you do see his love and concern for his children and Juliet. I enjoyed the fact that this is an \\"older couple\\" which is different from other Regency Novels. Severn is in his mid forties and Juliet is 31. He handles Juliet's secret very appropriately becoming a much needed confessor and friend to her. He is not appalled or disgusted by the revelation of her rape as a young woman. (The reader knows this is what happened to her very early on, only a secret from the other characters in the story.) I enjoyed the fact that each character became a better person by the end of the novel and yet did not change drastically. I also liked that the Duke is the first to profess his love to Juliet, he has to earn her love which of course he does! You just know that they will have a good life from this moment on.  <br /> <br />The only reason I did not give this book five stars was that sometimes the story lagged a little and then the end was a bit hurried but all in all, wonderful reading. The beginning of this story hints at an earlier novel which I am off to find! <br />	2005-04-02

He would do almost anything to save Laceby, the family estate. Even cast himself on the marriage altar to a wealthy orphaned heiress whose father was a merchant. Susannah also marries to save her family -- most especially her sister Dinah. She wants Dinah to have the freedom to marry where she wanted and all the fops (including her cousin) that were after Susannah would not help -- just spend her money.  <br /> <br />Although they both act fairly mature in this relationship, Hanford is very heavy handed in his dealings with Susannah. He wants her to be a lady while she was used to doing for herself. He does show her he is master by selling her family house in an unfashionable part of town and some other incidents, which make him unlikeable -- but true to the times. Eventually, he becomes more open about his fear of failing the family and his worries of financial ruin and allows his wife to ease his mind. Hanford takes control in the end of his spendthrift family and finds his \\"ill-bred\\" wife is the treasure he needed all along. Secondary characters are well fleshed out - Enjoyable tale. <br />	2005-04-02

The love scenes bordered on erotic but were not overboard - they were very sensuous. But anytime I felt Cynssr and Anne were going to come to any understanding in their relationship, there he was taking her against a table - all their furniture must have strong legs!! I would have liked a little more resolution of their feelings and a little better storyline.  <br /> <br />Cynssr seemed so loving and wonderful I got a little tired of Anne pushing him away (mentally NOT physically!). It was enjoyable that Cynssr thought she was beautiful when he first saw her asleep in his bed - though all he could remember was her spectacles. I found Anne was too good at hiding her feelings, almost cold. But her life with her father and very lovely sisters must have given her the ability to hide her emotions well. It was nice that Cynssr said he loved her first and was really the one more passionate in his feelings.  <br /> <br />Onto a few things I did not like. I almost needed a roster of the other characters in this book. I couldn't keep straight who was who! I even got confused about the victims of the mysterious abductors/kidnappers. It was not a very good mystery since as a reader, I couldn't solve it. I almost thought it was going to turn out to be one of the \\"good guys.\\" Most of Cynssr's friends did not impress me. In the end I thought, thank goodness Anne didn't marry Devon since I didn't like him that much. The servants were interesting characters.  <br /> <br />I will look for the other books this author has written and may well buy others she writes but this book did not stir my emotions even though it stirred \\"other\\" feelings. <br />	2005-04-02

I first read this anthology in the heat of summer by a pool. I was transported to a cold frosty wonderland as each story revealed itself! I read each story and enjoyed every last one, my favorites of the five being \\"The Bird of Paradise\\" and \\"The Black Beast of Belleterre.\\" Each story in this anthology was well developed with fully fleshed out secondary characters. In short stories that is unusual to find.  <br /> <br />\\"The Bird of Paradise\\" was delightfully funny. I laughed at each twist of fate that was thrown at Miss Kate Thacker in this Christmas tale. Charles was as honorable hero as you could find. Their adventure, complete with penny pinching boss, dreadful aunt, sweet brother Randolph, Charles' fine family (mom, pop, siblings and kiddies!) plus a TURKEY kept me pensive, giggling and cheering.  <br /> <br />\\"The Black Beast of Belleterre\\" was a typical Beauty and the Beast story which takes place beginning in Spring and culminates at Christmas. That fairy tale is even mentioned in the story! I was kept guessing until the end what \\"The Beast\\" looked like! Don't peek ahead! This story moved me from despair to elation and all within 64 pages! Ariel and James are so brilliantly portrayed that their thoughts, dreams and wishes become your own. What a beautiful story full of surprises. And I loved the motley collection of misfit animals that James had collected. I have read this one story over and over.  <br /> <br />I think this is the best anthology I have ever read. Even if you are normally a \\"Regency\\" novel reader, you will find the Victorian times close enough to satisfy. Do not miss obtaining your own copy. <br />	2005-04-02

The scrapes this family has gotten themselves into! The Millikin's are a large family composed of ten sisters and brothers (the eldest two are the oldest children of Mr. Millikin (now deceased) and his first wife).  <br /> <br />The stories to follow are:  <br /> <br />- Rosemary, a newlywed in love with her seeming cold husband and in debt has pawned her husband's family's sapphires, and then goes to a loan shark for money to redeem them.    <br /> <br /> <br /> - Angelica, feels the ugly duckling and uses an assumed name to obtain a position of employment to help Rosemary with her debts. She falls under the spell of a rake, but uses the opportunity of disguise to ask all sorts of impertinent questions such as \\"what is an orgy!\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />- Fennel, a young man has gotten himself in trouble with the blackmailing mama of a young woman who he had flirted with.    <br /> <br />- Lily, in love with her \\"older\\" suitor decides he is not romantic enough and is trying to set up an elopement with someone else to end the engagement.  <br /> <br />- Then enter Marigold, the mother & stepmother, vacuous mind trying to problem solve. She has left the raising of her young children to Angelica and really doesn't want to lose her to a rake (besides wanting a man for herself!) (The five younger children play a role in this book too, but not huge)  <br /> <br />- Top this off with Valerian, eldest son and physician, who thinks the whole family is hugely amusing and hilarious.  <br /> <br />You will enjoy the conversation, the predicaments and ultimately the outcome of each convoluted story. Will Rosemary's cold husband divorce her or does he really care about her after all! Will Lily elope with the smooth \\"buccaneer\\" she met at the masquerade ball? Will Fennel be sued for breach of promise? Does Angelica find out what an orgy is? I loved Valerian, who would have visitors turned out of the house (consistently) by his housekeeper who invented cases of measles for him to attend to. Does he get his own due in the end? What a hoot when each Milliken in love describes their symptoms to Valerian -- heart palpitations, stomach ailments!  <br /> <br />This is not a light reading novel. You have to concentrate on the conversations closely to get the hilarious story - but it is well worth reading. I think there may be another book in this series about the younger siblings which I am off to find. <br />	2005-04-02

How he comes to love her and how she accepts and loves him is a wonderful tale.  <br /> <br />There is some intrigue in this novel also. A select group of men (ten) who were spies for England during the Napoleonic war are being killed off one by one. Nathan lost his best friend when he lost his sight and being one of the ten men, his days are numbered. How he is able to hide his infirmity and flush out the traitor is very interesting!  <br /> <br />The side characters are well fleshed out and sometimes annoying. I felt sorry for Isobel who was saddled with such a horrible selfish family! Her brothers and father appeared to be worthless drunkards. I loved it when Nathan tells her (regarding her father) \\"I will not tolerate his deliberate idiocy, and you will no longer take responsibility for it.\\" Not the last time we are exposed to them but...  <br /> <br />A wonderful story in all aspects. On the spicy side at times - loved it! <br />	2005-04-02

Of course she doesn't find out until the deed is done and the marriage is two hours old. Gabriel has deceived her and married her for the fortune she possesses. Deep down he is an honorable fellow - he desperately needs the funds to restore his recently inherited estate to its former glory. He wants the tenants to be taken care of, and his aunt also! If hard work alone could save the estate he would not have sacrificed himself on the altar.  <br /> <br />But Beatrice does find out and the marriage is off to a bad start. She punishes Gabriel by ignoring him. He punishes himself by believing she has the right to. He truly had intended to be a devoted husband and make her happy. Throughout the book you realize he desires her and she still passionately loves him but continued sharp words condemn them both to icy separateness. Enter Vicar Humbly, a man on a mission of love. He is playing Cupid to three couples he married who are not in a happy state. To retire to his simple cottage he feels compelled to assist each couple in learning to love and communicate with each other.  <br /> <br />This couple truly did have compassion and love for each other and those around them. They just needed a little push to see the good in themselves and to learn forgiveness. The Vicar advises Gabriel to woo his wife. He advises Beatrice to listen to her heart. From there on, romance begins to flourish and Beatrice comes to trust Gabriel and he, in turn, realizes he was drawn to Beatrice for all her wonderful qualities, not just her fortune. Gabriel learns he not only lusts for her, but he loves her!  <br /> <br />This story flowed superbly. You become immersed in each character's lives. Our hero and heroine realize each was different from their families in many ways. They grew up rather lonely, feeling unloved and unwanted - (even though Beatrice's family appeared to care about her). The secondary characters, the Vicar and Aunt Sarah are charming. There are funny moments, romantic moments and tense moments. Each person remains true to themselves. Gabriel does not deny that her fortune was needed, but he builds up Beatrice's confidence in her worthiness as she helps him to realize his own worth. .  <br /> <br />This novel reminded me of Balogh's \\"Dancing With Clara\\" without Balogh's dark overtones - Beatrice is crippled in her perception of herself as Clara was physically crippled. Gabriel is a much more honorable and sympathetic character then Freddie was - but each originally meant to keep the truth from their wives.  <br /> <br />This all adds up to a delightful story which is hard to put down. A MUST READ. <br />	2005-04-02

Raphael's tormented upbringing really makes you understand him.

Because of a smallpox epidemic in London and fear that the girls would be corrupted by the army in Yorkshire, the two Davenport sisters are given a short reprieve from their cloistered life. They are sent to distant relatives, Sir John and Lady Harrington. It happens to be Christmastime and though Jilly and Amanda's parents don't celebrate it, they do not realize the Harrington's do! Lady Harrington welcomes the sisters with open arms, giving them a holiday full of liveliness and spirit! She assists in making them fashionable by updating their dull clothes and buys them new gowns! Of course during this holiday in the country, there are plenty of young people and love is in the air.  <br /> <br />This book contains a great deal of conversation much like Barbara Cartland's style of writing. You had to read closely to understand the story fully. I disliked that the sisters were raised with such cruelty and felt they \\"forgave\\" their parents much too quickly in the end, but I guess those times were different and parents used drastic, corporal punishments to control their children.  <br /> <br />I loved the explanation of Regency Christmas rituals and celebrations many of which survive until today. Some of these celebrations were mentioned in other novels but I never understood fully before. If you read a lot of Regency novels, this is a great way to learn all about the traditions. This is a quick reading novel with just enough tension to make it interesting. Marion Chesney books are often full of surprises and she styles each book differently. <br />	2005-04-02

This novel revolves around a house party given by the Dowager Duchess of Carlisle to which she has invited an old schoolmate and her two nieces. Catherine and Susannah (sisters) believe this is a good chance to mingle with society and find husbands to lift them from their state of extreme poverty. The older sister Susannah, not wearing her glasses, mistakes the man pointed out as an acceptable (rich) husband with another man who of course turns out to be a respectable but poor cousin of the Duke of Carlisle. They fall in love. Catherine happens to be stumbled upon by a \\"gardener\\" who is the Duke in hiding. Since Catherine loves gardens, \\"Mr. Archibald,\\" the gardener (the Duke incognito) enjoys showing them to her and they develop a rapport and eventually begin to fall in love.  <br /> <br />I loved the premise; I loved the heroine (Catherine) and her sister. I hated the Duke!!! I disliked him for keeping his real identity a secret much too long. I disliked him further for believing Catherine was wrong in wanting to marry a gentleman with a fortune. Catherine was honest in her reasons - she had to provide for her sister Susannah and their aunt since they were left penniless by their father. Catherine even tells Stephen (the Duke) how they existed on water flavored with one onion for a week. Yet he continued to regard her as a cold hearted fortune hunter! He even tried to botch her plans for marrying his friend, Miles, the Earl of Strickland!  <br /> <br />The Duke really wants Catherine to prove her love by choosing \\"the gardener\\" and a life of being snubbed by society, never fitting in anywhere and possible poverty (he would probably lose his job if he WAS the gardener for daring to mingle with the guests!). What a choice, huh??  <br /> <br />Of course it ends happy but I think Catherine should have chosen the Earl of Strickland if you ask me. He seemed more sensible and solid. But catch the rest of Miles' story in \\"The Best Intentions\\" which is wonderful!  <br /> <br />I did not have a good feeling when I finished this one -- <br />	2005-04-01

Margaret Summerville has a wonderful way of describing her very real characters. Each character behaves appropriate for the times without appearing stilted or unbelievable. A \\"Town Tangle\\" is another example of her superb style. Viscount St. John and his friend Fitzwalter are stranded in a snowfall at the country home of Sir Jarvis. They are unimpressed with the rather miserly Sir Jarvis's hospitality but are intrigued by his lovely niece Camilla Selwyn and rather foppish nephew Dick. Throw in the large wolfhound Rufus and spinster Aunt Lucinda for a bit of comedic fun!  <br /> <br />They all meet later in London (except Sir Jarvis) where Dick is rapidly losing his fortune to unsavory \\"friends\\" and Camilla is sought out because of the special interest that Fitzwalter has paid her. But she has caught the rather snobbish St. John's interest and he vainly tries to fight the attraction. We also meet St. John's stepmother, the lovely and aristocratic dowager, Amanda St. John and his sweet half-sister, Elizabeth (Lizzy). Lizzy forms her own attachment in the book to the unacceptable (non-titled!!!) solicitor Charles MacNeil, childhood friend of Camilla. We also become acquainted with some of St. John's less distinguished relatives on his mother's \\"trade\\" side, the very respectable Chandlers.  <br /> <br />All in all, you will have a wonderful romp in London - attending balls and in gaming establishments. Note the slow but growing love between two couples. But St. John is rather hot-headed and he and stubborn Camilla are at odds many times over! Can they ever really be together especially since each attempted kiss is thwarted? And what of Dick who dressed so outlandishly and will soon be penniless! There are so many stories to follow and such a great ending to all the adventures, you will find this book hard to put down. Highly recommended! <br />	2005-04-01

The woman is Eleanor Glydon and Geoffrey proposes a scheme to free her from her guardian. They will use the special license in his pocket to marry! He has been spurned by the woman he loved and no longer needs it for her. They quickly run away from the inn (where Eleanor's guardian hoped to complete a tryst with her) and are married. A blissful wedding night follows although Eleanor had hoped to maintain some distance from Geoffrey. That encounter during the first 15 pages of the book will tell you that this is going to be a passionate pair. Except ... Geoffrey wakes up, assumes the woman in his bed is a Cyprian, throws a few coins on the bureau and leaves. Eight years later, Geoffrey is no longer a second son but the wealthy Earl of Hellistone. Almost on the eve of his betrothal ball, Eleanor shows up with the marriage lines and the ring he gave her at the wedding. She also has a surprise from the wedding night. A son, Phillip who has the de Maine looks. Geoffrey does accept both the son and his wife into his life. Although he seems to relish being a father, he is uncomfortable with the role of husband. He had wanted an open marriage and had decided to marry Alvinia, that woman who had rejected him eight years before.  <br /> <br />The problems with this book stem from my disbelief that Eleanor would run from her guardian (known) into the arms of an unknown man just because he says he \\"will take care of her.\\" Doesn't the special license have a name on it - can anyone use it? Luckily for Eleanor, pregnant and destitute she faints where a wealthy recluse takes her in, cares for her and leaves all her money to her (REALLY!!!). (We only hear about it eight years later after the fact.). Although Eleanor is motivated to present her son to his father so he can take his place in society, she spends most of her time in London becoming the belle of the ball and tempting Geoffrey. This appeared to be strange behavior for a woman who really wanted a marriage of convenience. Geoffrey has very little redeeming character. He doesn't want to fall in love but makes passionate love to Eleanor as often as possible. He flaunts his mistresses including Alvinia. He abandons her in the beginning and abandons her several times eight years later. I didn't like him!!!  <br /> <br />This is good for a quick read if you can suspend your disbelief. The secondary characters were more interesting -- <br />	2005-04-01

The romance was sweetly done. I even liked the \\"angel\\" in the form of a red-haired freckle-faced boy but near the end of the book, I was not as captivated.  <br /> <br />The story revolves around Victoria Emerson, a little older than the normal debutante, lovely and unassuming. She has yet to meet a man she loves though she has many admirers during her season. Her father, Gerald Emerson, is very possessive and no one is good enough! He gives Nick the cut direct early on and Nick sets out to flirt with Victoria as revenge. Instead he falls in love with her and finds it difficult to remove her from her father's clutches.  <br /> <br />Although I found the characters charming and the villain (Gerald Emerson) frightening, I was not drawn into their struggles as much as I could have. Nick had suffered some terrible losses but sympathy was not transmitted to me early enough in the book. He also reformed a little too quickly. Victoria seemed too complacent, never seeing the cloying nature of her father. But what I disliked most was when Victoria's mother said she always resented her and only pretended to love her. It could have been handled better and I found that portion rather sad.  <br /> <br />The prologue with Nick's great aunt and uncle (who are mentioned in the end again) was a nice touch. I have enjoyed other books in this \\"Child\\" series more. <br />	2005-04-01

But it was not a storybook life for our hero and heroine or their families. There is sadness but it is softened with a great deal of laughter and love. Georgia and Nicholas are married hastily very near the beginning of the book so that he might inherit his beloved estate, Ravens Close. Georgia has been trapped in a horrible situation sewing in a turret tower for Nicholas's step-Aunt Jacqueline in nearby Ravenswalk. She agrees to marry since it appears the only way out for her. They take up residence in Raven's Close.  <br /> <br />The home is barely habitable, robbed of most of the furniture and anything valuable, and almost falling down around them. Believing Nicholas to be poor, both Georgia and he set out to make the house a home completing all necessary repairs themselves. She coaxes the flower garden out of ruin reminding Nicholas of his mother who had gardened there before her untimely death. Helping them in their endeavors is Binkley, a very proper man of all work, butler, valet and friend. But Nicholas is not poor and he decides to woo his lovely skittish wife, knowing she would feel unworthy if his wealth is known. In fact, Nicholas fears he can never make her forget her former husband thinking him a Nordic god by the way Georgia talks about him. That was a rather funny situation as he TOTALLY misinterprets what Georgia is telling him about her first husband!  <br /> <br />There are so many ups and downs to this story. I do not want to spoil it by telling all. Nicholas is hiding other truths from Georgia. The reasons he has been away for ten years and the source of his nightmares. The other characters in this book are so well fleshed out. There is Cyril, Nicholas's dark tormented and despondent cousin, Uncle William who is Cyril's father dying slowly after a stroke, servants, friends, rescued orphan Pascal, a sweet dog Raleigh and a horrible villainess Jacqueline Raven. Jacqueline (Uncle William's wife) is evil personified and as frightening an adversary as you could ever find. She does get her due in the end.  <br /> <br />There are shipwrecks, saviors and sickness. Another reviewer mentions needing a hanky at the end and indeed you may. Eventually Nicholas and Georgia find passion and happiness and you will find the novel hard to put down and unforgettable. Highly recommended. <br />	2005-04-01

Woodiwiss novels but gave them up in the early 80's because her style seemed so demeaning to women. \\"A Rose in Winter\\" was recommended in another reader's listmania listing and I was pleasantly surprised when I decided to give it a try! This novel is full of romance and intrigue and I was drawn in from the very beginning.  <br /> <br />Poor Erienne is just a pawn to the men in her life. First she is little more than a servant to her nasty father and brother, pawed over by potential suitors and then finally sold as a wife to the highest bidder. She is \\"bought\\" by the reclusive and masked Lord Saxton and cannot bring herself to endure the touch of this scarred and crippled man. He woos her gently, dispersing her fear with his constant familiarity. During his gentle courtship, Erienne's heart begins to beat for another man, a bold Yankee, Christopher Seaton. Christopher and Erienne have a rather love/hate relationship, but his pursuit of her is relentless. Will she give in to Christopher and forsake her vows to the strange but strong Lord Saxton? Who is trying to destroy the Saxton's and what of the vengeful night rider who roams the country at night frightening some wicked men? There is redemption for some characters in this novel and retribution for others. You will cheer for the loyal tenants of Lord Saxton and the triumph over evil in the end.  <br /> <br />Erienne, though weak at times became a proud and strong woman by the end of the novel and I was satisfied that she did the best she could for the times she lived in. An engrossing read, dark at times but kept my attention to the end. I can highly recommend this. <br />	2005-04-01

I also like that Danforth's mother is introduced to us - a rather formidable free-thinker now married to a gardener! There is a villain, but I did not like that plot much. Ethne is portrayed as being young and unknowing, but I couldn't believe she would allow events to get so out of hand.  <br /> <br />I was surprised and pleased at twists in the story such as how Geoffrey died. Danforth revealed towards the end his distrust of Jane over something in her past! That was as unusual as Ethne's choice of husband!

As another reviewer pointed out, it was close to the end of the book and so out of character, I could not see what the author hoped to achieve. This novel was written in 1984 and I had hoped some of the demeaning acts against women in romance novels were long past. But not so in this case. What a shame - I've collected many Dorothy Mack novels and enjoyed them. I notice this was re-issued in 2001 as a double book. I wonder if the horrid scenes were re-written. I cannot recommend this one - I felt terrible when I was done with it and like the Neanderthal times it imitated, April our neglected, belittled and abused wife, fell madly into love with the woman hating, manipulative man who was NO gentleman at all.

I rather like these novels of women contracting marriages via an advertisement.  <br /> <br />This book had the normal premise for it -- lady down on her luck, notorious rake needing an heir but that is where the \\"normal\\" regency storyline ends. Claudia Tallon is a strong and wonderful heroine. I did not find Giles Verylan (our rake) as likable as her. Even towards the end when he redeems himself, it is in a very bizarre way.  <br /> <br />Before that ending occurs there are secrets and scandalous behavior to wade through and this novel sweeps you from gossipy ballrooms to mundane country estates. There is Verlan's 18 year old daughter to present and an heir to be conceived and born - all of this happening within one year of surprising and tense moments.  <br /> <br />You will learn the reasons for Verylan's rather haughty and cold personality but you will worry and agonize with Claudia about this supposedly loveless marriage.

Attempts to find out who sent it are in vain.  <br /> <br />In another part of town, Viscount Sarsbrook is mourning the loss of his uncle. Sarsbrook is surprised to see his frugal uncle had purchased an expensive necklace shortly before his death. His uncle's diary of amorous exploits with his mistress (Miss M) is found. Also, there is an entreaty for Sarsbrook to take care of this mistress.  <br /> <br />Sarsbrook is eventually directed to the address of the Marsh's and calls on them. When he explains why he is there - to give Pandora an income as his uncle wished, she denies knowing his uncle and tries to return the necklace. He does not believe her and the visit ends rather abruptly. Later, Pandora's elder brother, Winfield, tries to return the necklace but he does a little scheming and intimates that Pandora had been seduced by Sarsbrook's uncle but did not want to ruin her illusion of respectability. So the necklace is not returned and Pandora's brother pawns it, quickly gambling away all the proceeds.  <br /> <br />Our tangled tale continues from there. Sarsbrook finds himself attracted to Pandora and with a little help Pandora and her family are introduced to society. He does not let on that he \\"knows\\" she is a fallen woman. They, with a little help from youngest brother Nicky and little terrier \\"Mr. Stubbs,\\" seem to be thrown together at odd times and the attraction turns to love for both Sarsbrook and Pandora. But ... confusion erupts when he offers her a slip on the shoulder, saying that she will be the \\"wife of his heart\\" since they cannot wed. The emotional turmoil that follows the revelation of the truth is so well written, I found it unforgettable!<br /> <br />I found all the characters well fleshed out and believable. Everyone acted as they would in real life. There is a villain spreading vicious rumors in the form of Sarsbrook's cousin.

This was one of Margaret Summerville's early Regency novels and like the ones to follow, it is peopled with wonderful realistic characters. Each person (even the villain) is so well portrayed, you can empathize with everyone!  <br /> <br />Gillian Ashley has come to town to meet her \\"natural\\" father. Twenty years earlier, her mother was the center of a huge scandal. Not only did Roland Ashley fight a duel over his wife's infidelity with Hewitt Gambol he also divorced her! Carolyn Ashley, the unfaithful wife, died alone and penniless in Scotland 19 years later after giving birth to a daughter. Gillian, seeking her father, becomes lost in London (I love that she is beating up a footpad when we first see her!). Lord Oliver Bain meets her and brings her to his Cousin Meg's house.  Bored with the season, Margaret (Meg) Fairfax decides to give Gillian a season. Gillian does meet her father Sir Hewitt Gambol (an aging rogue plagued with gout) and he accepts her with open loving arms. He thinks it best for Gillian to remain with Meg and though they meet many times when Gillian comes to visit, he realizes any association with him will hurt her chances for an advantageous marriage.  <br /> <br />This regency does follow the typical round of balls and routs with Gillian being accepted and feted by society and has several beaus. There is a rather nice meeting with Prinny at her first ball which sets the stage for her acceptance into society. But the villains in the shape of Rowland Ashley's current wife and grown daughter are fascinating. They scheme so that Gillian is snubbed because .... (I won't give it away!).  <br /> <br />Of course because Oliver Bain becomes Gillian's true love, none of the other beaus will suit. You will enjoy the scrapes Gillian drags him into because of her sweet nature towards those less fortunate and also because of her temper!!! She cuts his snobbish nature down to size!  <br /> <br />Although the acceptance of a \\"known\\" illegitimate child and thesubsequent \\"adoption\\" by Meg Fairfax is a bit unbelievable, on the whole it is a wonderful book with endearing characters. Highly recommend. Summerville books are usually excellent reading that tug at your heartstrings! <br /> <br />	2005-04-01

There wasn't any mystery or dramatics - just well fleshed out characters with normal passions, insecurities and flaws. I like that each character was allowed to develop deeper feelings over time rather than immediately. The storyline flows evenly. Captain Edward Tremaine returns from war, tired and weakened from sickness and sees what he calls an \\"English rose\\" (Jane Hampton) tending a garden. He speaks to her for a few moments before making his way home.  <br /> <br />Jane is well acquainted with Edward's family. Edward's younger brother James recently jilted her sister Fanny. Being young and immature, James was appalled that Fanny's recent illness left her weak with a sallow complexion and hairless. Though she was improving slowly, her long hair was now short and curly and slightly darkened and his reaction to her loss of beauty was painful for all.  <br /> <br />As friendship develops between Edward and Jane, Jane's feelings intensify and she believes Edward had deeper feelings also. But when he makes a trip to London, Edward falls head over heels for a glamorous fortune-hunter Lady Julietta Blackwood. Edward brings Julietta, her aunt, and her brother (Lord Blackwood) to his country home to complete his courtship, crushing Jane's heart in the process. Although others seem to see through Julietta's ruse, it will take some time for Edward to note her shallowness and find where his heart really lies.  <br /> <br />In the meantime, there is the funny and mysterious Lord Granville who in accordance with his uncle, the late duke's will, must dress in 1700's costume while at the country estate. He is a bigger fish than Captain Tremaine and Julietta is VERY interested! Fanny, as she begins to recover and her looks improve, finds her own bevy of beaus much to James chagrin. He begins to regret his hasty reaction over her illness and wishes her back. Will he win her love again? Will Julietta snare her Duke or the Captain? Will Lord Blackwoodsucceed in seducing the disheartened Jane?  <br /> <br />Excellent reading. Enjoyable and doesn't follow the predictable storyline of other regency novels. Well worth obtaining. <br />	2005-04-01

It was a world ruled by powerful men who could be influenced by the women behind them. It was a world of harsh, illogical punishments and death was always one small misstep or illness away. Durand de Marle is our dark, haunted lord, left to mourn an unfaithful wife and raise the child that was not his. He is drawn to Christina, wife of a merchant and the newborn's wet nurse. Her life has not been an easy one after losing two daughters of her own. Her husband, Simon, typical of the times, does not respect her in any way but only uses her to advance himself. Christina makes soaps, potpourri and herbal concoctions for the inhabitants of the keep, and the author portrays the gathering of herbs and the fragrance of the items so effectively that you can smell the pungency yourself!  <br /> <br />The storyline contains intrigue, thievery, battle, contests, conquests and sacrifice for our hero and heroine. Although there are amusing parts about love potions and hair tonics, the mood is very gloomy and disturbing. I had trouble following the royal plots but mostly due to my own disinterest in King John. Although I can recommend this book, it does not have a typical \\"happy ever after\\" despite the fact that our hero and heroine find the love they desire and deserve. This book is not for the faint hearted or anyone wishing light reading. <br />	2005-04-01

This is a very different kind of Regency. Not just the fact it is \\"fairy-tale\\" based but the characters are different and interesting. I really enjoyed Gabriel Crowe, Earl of Shalford. He is twenty-six and in trying to deflect his father's anger from his younger brother Daniel, his autocratic father declares that Daniel and Gabriel are banished to the country estate and Gabriel must marry within the month. His father would cut off his funds if the marriage did not occur. Off to Surrey they go with Gabriel's mother doing her best to find a suitable bride.  <br /> <br />Luella (Ella) Sanderson, an orphan (of course!) has just arrived at her Aunt's home in Surrey. Her aunt, being a nasty woman, has decreed that Ella will earn her keep by taking care of the aunt's \\"crazy\\" brother during the day at his nearby cottage. The crazy brother turns out to be a delightful but eccentric scientist who insists that Ella call him Uncle Addison. He works with hot air balloons and Ella assists him, his dog and an aging valet in their daily routines.  <br /> <br />Gabriel and Ella meet up when Daniel and he spot Uncle Addison's hot air balloon and check it out. There are several misunderstandings to resolve since Ella has been mistaken as a servant! Even the dragon \\"Lady Latimer,\\" Gabriel's mother thinks she is a cook and hires her to prepare pastries for an elaborate picnic luncheon. The party is being thrown for Gabriel to select a bride. (Of course, Lady Latimer already has selected for him but that plan goes awry). There are many adventures in this book - a lovely party (the ball), a beautiful dress from Uncle Addison (fairy godmother), mean cousins and aunt (evil stepmother and daughters) and an unexpected ride in a hot air balloon (coach and four?).  <br /> <br />Being a Cinderella story, there are many instances of lost, ill fitting shoes scattered in the storyline which comes to a delightful conclusion when Gabriel sends Ella some that are just the right size! There are many hurdles to overcome before the happily ever after, especially when Gabriel thinks Ella has run off and married Uncle Addison! I loved the variety of people we meet in this adventure. I have only touched on a very few and not very well. Even Gabriel's father comes around a bit and is not so tyrannical in the end.  <br /> <br />This is a warm delightful tale and the last of a trilogy about three young women who were school friends. This book stands alone just fine since I have not read the other two (yet!). They each mimic a fairy tale too and hopefully will be as much fun as this one! <br />	2005-04-01

And what a sleeper hit it turned out to be. The characters are so likable and real and the situations range from funny to passionate to despairing. Our sweet heroine is Annabelle Winthrop, a true hoyden who has learned to wrap everyone around her little finger. Due to her youth and inexperience she finds herself involved in escapades that would inflame a saint. And the incidents do inflame someone - Camford Singletary, Earl of Westerbrook. After a carriage accident brings Annabelle and her aunt to his country estate where he resides with his widowed mother, Cam fights his growing attraction to the young woman who he has nicknamed \\"Angel.\\" Catching up to Annabelle and her Aunt Charlotte during the season in London, Cam champions her and protects her from her own inappropriate behavior and unsavory men. But there is a jealous rival for his affections in the form of Lucinda Moresby, a neighbor. She has held out for a marriage proposal from the Earl way too long to lose him now and sets out to ruin his attachment to Annabelle!  <br /> <br />The storyline flows from country to city and back again with ease. There are stolen moments and stolen kisses yet the Earl is determined to never fall in love so as to never feel the loss of it as his mother felt after his father died. Can he resist his tempting \\"Angel\\" especially with his mother and Annabelle's aunt playing matchmaker? Interspersed in the novel is Mr. Fitzroy, a funny little fox-terrier and various other animals that need protecting and help. All secondary characters are well fleshed out and delightful to meet.  <br /> <br />Wonderful reading, if not deeply emotional. Worth curling up with on a rainy afternoon!

Shrinking violet no longer, Emmalie refuses and then decides to accept - with conditions. If Wynncliff can pass a few tests, she will marry him. The \\"tests\\" are unusual and witty - and I will NOT give them away.  <br /> <br />This is a sweeping romance that takes you through elegant ballrooms, romantic castles, onstage, and in Prinny's conservatory! I couldn't tell where our heroine would pop up next. Along the way, Wynncliff tries to save his reputation but loses his heart.  <br /> <br />There are many moments when the story could have been made sappy (ok - I would have liked a little more sappy!) but instead flows on allowing us to meet all sorts of unusual people and animals from mastiff to lion, actors to lisping noblemen, uncaring mother? to close friends and companions.

The storyline made little sense. There were long periods of time when the two of them were far apart with no contact. The business about climbing trees could have been charming. There was a huge buildup about Marcus giving her breeches [to better climb the tree] and arranging to meet her which amounted to very little! It seemed after climbing trees for all those years, when Lord Ridley came around Clarissa kept falling out of them! Clarissa saves him from matchmaking misses a couple times. You meet Clarissa's mother who throws her into society to meet a wealthy man - much like Pride and Prejudice without the humor or style. Even Lord Ridley's mother turns her into a menial - sewing and acting as a companion. On top of that - no chemistry between Marcus and Clarissa - just some hero worship on her side. He wasn't love-shy - didn't seem to have any personality at all. Add a touching death scene and I lost my escape from reality. Dragged my way through this book and found little to recommend about it.	2005-03-31

The two romances that develop are not very strong but the characters themselves are fascinating. I knew there was at least one prequel to this and have since found out it is part of a trilogy. This book stands alone, but the storyline spoils any suspense the prequels might hold - (but typically you KNOW what will happen in a Regency novel anyway).  <br /> <br />Thea Kilmore (our heroine) a 25 year old spinster has languished in poverty in the country while her father and brother literally ran through all the money. Apparently the brother (Jason, Lord Kilmore) was less despicable (but not by much) and only lived above his means. Now that his father is dead and other schemes have fallen through, he has solved all their problems by marrying a wealthy heiress (Penelope) whose father was a lawyer. She has the means to bring the Dowager Lady Kilmore, Thea and the youngest Kilmore, Megan to London. When they finally arrive after some adventures on the road, they are not accepted into society and in fact are snubbed many times over because of a slightly unfashionable address and Lady Kilmore's lack of genealogy.  <br /> <br />Roderick, Lord Hazlewood and his cousin Mr. DeVine were met on the road to London when illness (motion sickness in Meg, morning sickness in Penny) had driven Thea to ask for assistance. Thea and her mother are very shy and the inability to relate to strangers made leaving the country difficult for both of them. I found Thea refreshing in her comments and observations which appear to be at odds with what society believed was correct behavior. Roderick finds her frankness enjoyable and he sets out to improve their reputations in the eyes of society. Megan is a little more outgoing and most of the book revolves around her triumphs in the \\"Little Season\\" and Thea overcoming her bashfulness.  <br /> <br />Believing Lord Hazlewood could never be interested romantically in her, Thea turns to him for advice and help in many instances. This makes him believe she only wants to further her family causes and that misunderstanding continues until the end. Danger in the form of Penny's villainous Uncle forces them to confess their real feelings.  <br /> <br />There is ongoing conflict between Lord Kilmore and his wife to resolve and a romance for Megan is almost thwarted by her hoydenish ways. Lord Hazlewood's relationship and breakup with his mistress of ten years was actually very sad but another example of society at that time. I can highly recommend reading this. Perhaps not a keeper but it kept my interest. <br />	2005-03-31

Yes, he was redeemed in the end, but it was only his reluctance to take the virtue of Phaedra that made me see him as anything but a liar and schemer. Phaedra seemed set on losing her virtue to him - with or without the \\"helping a friend\\" game of cards. A little ridiculous -- she was a vicar's daughter and \\"so good\\" up till now.  <br /> <br />Despite all this, I still found the story enjoyable. I thought the secondary characters were wonderful. Phaedra's father lived with his head in the clouds yet came up with insightful speeches to present to the Earl. Mrs. Lovett was earthy and delightful - one of the few characters in Regency novels that expresses herself so well. She certainly enjoyed taking care of the Earl's personal needs while he was incapacitated!  <br /> <br />Donna Simpson's books are hit and miss - some wonderful beyond belief and other's just an ok read.

I usually read Historical or Regency novels so this fantasy was outside my normal realm of experience. I loved the storyline - it was so different and intriguing. Even if you appreciate Alpha males, this was not a let down. Jorlan Reynard had enough spirit that sometimes he took the lead, even against [his] society's conventions. And Green was a wonderfully honorable woman. Both main characters had many superb qualities that I enjoyed discovering. The love scenes were sensual.     In an effort not to spoil the story for you, I will just say Dara Joy paints an amazing portrait of a different world and different way of life. It was topsy-turvy from the way life is today, but did not portray the women as \\"Amazon\\" which is the way many fantasy novels portray matriarchal societies.     The \\"special language\\" was not hard to follow but it was annoying in some instances. Sometimes I lost the trail of the story with all the nature/meaning of life references but all in all this was a wonderful journey of love. I enjoyed taking the journey and highly recommend it.	2005-03-31

He does guess that she is Prometheus and shares his own pen name with her, especially since he has one more book that has just been published.   <br /> <br />But Wynn's talkative half-sister (younger) stirs up trouble and Pippa is believed to be the Gothic Novelist Dred Valentine.  Since these books are rather \\"bawdy,\\" Pippa and her family are snubbed.  Wynn has left town on some business and Pippa tries to find him.  She is caught in a compromising position with Wynn's best friend.  Will Wynn lose Pippa to his friend Gil?  How will the family's good name be restored to the ton?  What about the speech to the House of Lords.   <br /> <br />You will want to read this pleasant tale to find out the answers.  There is plenty of tension without any villains or sinister plots.  Thoroughly enjoyable with likable, admirable characters! <br />	2005-03-31

I kept thinking poor Hazel's life could only get better. All would be well in the end ... but no. The abyss she dropped into got worse and worse. Even her love for Black John was a source of nothing but sadness and degradation. It ended like \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" -- Black John's daughter vowing revenge. The book was so well written, earthy and well paced that I was sorry I could not find any joy in reading it. I don't mind some horrible scenes and sadness (it was 1546) but I wanted to scream at the total lack of happiness or hope. If you like feeling down and depressed, this is the one for you. I had to immediately read a regency novel to gain my needed happy ending. -- Reading is entertainment - if I want depressing stories, I can always read the newspaper.	2005-03-31

I couldn't fathom how this would work out in the end. I had to force myself not to peek ahead and you should do the same!  <br /> <br />Without giving away too much of the storyline, briefly - Katrina Vernon, unwanted orphan in her relative's home goes to a ball. Her Uncle, although browbeaten by his wife, insists she is to go or he will not allow his daughter to go. He holds his niece in affection but his own household is fairly impoverished. Ill-dressed and apparently thought to be one of the horrible Vernon's, a young attractive man spends a half hour talking to Katrina, wooing her, and in effect compromising her. The Viscount \\"Devil\\" Danville has done it all for a wager, even promised double the amount if he kisses her in public. But in the short half hour as she poured her heart out to him, Danville tries to give her advice about \\"lambs amidst wolves.\\" The ball ends disastrously for Katrina among the snickers and snubs and her standing in the household is worsened!  <br /> <br />Placing an advertisement in the paper, a Vicar and his wife hire Katrina to be a companion and governess for their young daughter. Treating her like family, Katrina seeks a new life. Unfortunately, it is within the confines of Viscount Danville's land and though he is not known to visit his country estate, shortly after Katrina's arrival, he also arrives.  <br /> <br />There are many unexpected meetings and conversations filled with innuendos. What is the mystery surrounding her employer (Lady Helen) and Danville? Did he seduce her? Is he attempting to make Katrina his mistress? There is music and mayhem and mystery throughout the book and wonderful secondary characters to meet.  <br /> <br />This is not a book for the faint hearted. There is talk of poor houses and poverty and people dying in horrible conditions. There is also love and redemption. I could not put this book down. Despite the title, this is very littleabout a typical Regency \\"wager.\\" If you can find this book, it is worth obtaining. <br />	2005-03-31

I love the way Charlotte Louise Dolan gives us a succinct description of all characters, warts and all.  Each person has feelings, secrets and true depth.  You come to love, respect and sometimes hate the hero, heroine and assorted secondary characters and villains! <br /> <br />Lady Cassiopeia Anderby is being taken to London to be \\"sold\\" to the highest bidder by her spendthrift step-brother.  She has been coerced into compliance by the threat of harm to her half-sister.  On the trip to London, she meets Richard Hawk, a strange secretive man who both captivates and frightens her.  Richard suffers because of all the terrible events that occurred in his youth - he lost his freedom at one point and the love of his life.  But upon seeing Cassie's resourcefulness during this trip, he begins to fall in love again.  Once in London, he must outsmart and outmaneuver her step-brother and her \\"official\\" suitors.  He does so with the help of all the secondary characters - all wonderful friends and family who eventually find romance for themselves! <br /> <br />You will particularly enjoy Lady Leticia, a grandmother and matchmaker who works her magic throughout the book!  But there is much more in store for her!  I enjoyed that once her matchmaking was done when newly married Richard turns to her for advice she informs him she only meddled before the wedding and not after.  Some of the romances are more hurried than the main couple's but each is charming!  Can Cassie overcome her anger at being \\"sold\\" and allow Richard to fully love her?  What will become of her step-brother as he attempts to thwart the couple's plans to wed? <br /> <br />Worth obtaining and reading - wonderful storyline that kept me interested until the very end.     <br />	2005-03-31

I have been a fan for so long and am only missing three of her books. Normally, I love Mansfield characters to distraction but not this time.  <br /> <br />The premise is wonderful; an older lady and a young lord. George Frobisher carried a vision of a lovely young woman in his mind for ten years. He had caught a glimpse of Olivia Henshaw a beautiful \\"Venus\\" as she stepped from her bath ten years earlier when he was 17. Circumstances delayed his ever meeting her face to face and now, ten years later he is given the chance. He is 27 and Olivia (Livy) at 35 is well past the marrying age. Their first meeting does not go well. His face was transparent as he viewed her in disappointment. Tired from her journey, Livy looks the old maid. The relationship goes downhill from there. That is what bothered me. We should have felt some empathy for Livy on why she had never married and why she looked so old for her age, but that understanding really didn't come. She was actually very nasty to George who tried in several instances to apologize to her. Yet, Livy dresses carefully for him and tries to appear animated, all the time believing he thinks her a \\"maiden aunt\\" and she talks abominably to him. I couldn't figure out why he continued to pursue her! An unexpected journey to Livy's uncle (Sir Andrew) in Scotland where George is forced to escort her gives us a little insight into her personality. I found Sir Andrew (Livy's uncle) the most interesting character if truth be told. Grumpy and horrible, at least he was true to himself! George gives Sir Andrew a proper set down and returns to London. So the \\"romance\\" is at an end ... or is it?  <br /> <br />I shall leave the reader to find out the ending. Being a Regency, you know that Livy must somehow meet George again. How will it end? There is a secondary romance that deserved the spotlight. Bernard, George's friend, crippled in an accident many years before is pursued by a young lady (Harriet). Their romance is rocky also and I wished more time had been spent on that relationship than on George's! Anyway, I would not have missed reading this book, but it was lacking in many ways. It could have been so much better. <br />	2005-03-31

First (and looming large for most reviewers) was the idea of an illegitimate son inheriting the title. Liam was raised by his mother until she died when he was 12. Even the hint of illegitimacy would have made them a pariah to even the lowest of people. Yet Liam who shortly after his mother's death ended up onboard ship was educated and appeared aristocratic. Too perfect! No bitterness; no rough edges?  <br /> <br />Inconsistencies aside, I liked the heroine (Alexandra). She was a bit stuffy and realistic! It was fun getting to know her and what made her tick! She (of course) turns into a perfect woman by the end, able to make a bed and eat with servants without qualm! Oh well, couldn't make her too high in the in-step or she never would have let the honorable Liam into her heart. The servants - all O'Riley's were the most interesting characters in the book. I also liked Alexandra's brother Jamie and believe it or not the nasty, uncaring mother (Alexandra's mother Henrietta) who was the root of all troubles that befell her family! We never get to see the portrait of the lovely Henrietta! There is a whole story of saving a friend by means of smuggling that I found rather boring.  <br /> <br />The romance portions were sweet with our perfect hero and imperfect bride, but little else to recommend about this book. <br />	2005-03-31

I liked Gwen's spirit and Vad's sexy description. But as other reviewer's pointed out, there didn't really seem to be a whole lot of true chemistry between them. Even the first time they made love was anti-climatic. They were under the influence of some herb that made them \\"out of it.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Virtual Heaven\\" (the prequel to this book) was wonderful and I liked catching up with the characters that were mentioned in this book. Having read that book, it was easier to follow this one. I found the storyline for this book so tangled that it was hard to pick up the thread. Then almost too suddenly, it was all over. Very weak and strange villain and no real conflict there. I couldn't understand what Vad's quest was or the importance of it. I found the rescue of the maidens very strange and tedious.  This book just didn't capture my heart.  <br /> <br />The beginning of the book where Vad was in Gwen's world, and then when they first entered the game (and were sailing) were most interesting. The rest was not quite as good. But I will recommend it just for the wonderful love scenes and descriptions of Vad's beauty and guess what! -- I'm off to find Book 3 about Ardra! <br />	2005-03-31

I was absolutely enthralled with this tale of dream monsters and saviors. I loved V'Aidan who was Erin's champion against the horrible creatures that stalk her when she sleeps ... but he kept saying she didn't know him.... I immediately re-read this novella after the first go round.  <br /> <br />Amanda Ashley is an author I normally like. The storyline for \\"Darkfest\\" was ok but there was no real passion or emotion. Just sort of pleasant and boring.  <br /> <br />Shane's \\"Under Her Spell\\" just didn't capture my attention at all. Could not bring myself to read beyond a few pages and it offered no appeal to me.  <br /> <br />\\"A Wulf's Curse\\" - well Beast Tamer aka Sterling (I liked the name better than the story!) was an interesting character but the \\"curse\\" was a bit silly. Elise was rather a good heroine but this short storyline did not allow a further examination of either characters or curse. Not very good.  <br /> <br />There you have it. Better to borrow this one though it will make my keeper shelf just for the Kenyon entry. <br />	2005-03-31

I have the same mixed feeling for all the same reasons. We learn that Vam-pyre's are actually an alien species stranded for 4,000 years in a shipwreck. Awaiting the return of a ship to take them home, the all male contingent study humans and attempt to reproduce; with horrible results. Most human women do not survive the mating process and even fewer live babies are born to them.  <br /> <br />It is now 1859 and the Count of Albion finds himself with a serious problem. He is a Vam-pyre who has given up trying to reproduce but like all Vam-pyre men, when the \\"mating\\" season approaches he is driven to complete the act. Now, three unattended women have appeared at his home in Italy. He is drawn to Cordelia, the poor relation and companion to \\"Mrs. Ford.\\" A maid is also in attendance. Mrs. Ford is the daughter of an earl, traveling incognito in an attempt to conceal her out-of-wedlock pregnancy. The concealment causes great concern in the political turmoil of Austria against Italy. Are they really spies?  <br /> <br />I enjoyed Cordelia as our heroine. Her compassion, command of language and muted psychic ability makes her an interesting character. The Count treats her like an equal throughout the book which is a break from a traditional historical novel. Cordelia is NO shrinking violet. The Count, Dakon, reveals so much in his conversations with her. He is a man torn with the desire to make the world a better place and desire to make love to Cordelia. His torment is painful to watch. But she falls in love with him no matter what horrors are revealed. There were so many twists to the storyline, I didn't think it could result in anything resembling a happy ending.  <br /> <br />The other characters are half-formed and as noted in other reviews, drop out at the end with no resolution to their stories. I am not into political intrigue so those portions of the story, though well-written did not hold my interest but that is mypersonal feeling. Much of the story is left untold, but just let your imagination fill in the blanks and you will have an enjoyable, edge-of-the-chair novel to occupy a few hours. <br />	2005-03-31

It had all the promise of being very interesting. Lady who pursues a teaching career, American man who needs training to be a proper Lord... but this book does not deliver on the promise. It certainly did not delve into the characters deeply enough for me.  <br /> <br />There are many inconsistencies in behavior. First, Jared seems very coarse and vulgar. He is a gambler and apparently his closest friend in America was the prostitute, Angel. On arrival to England, he suddenly becomes very gallant and falls immediately into love with the on-the-shelf teacher (Lady Hetty)! I just didn't get the chemistry -- plus I don't think Lady Hetty would have remained at a house with a grown man. Maybe called on him each day to teach him, but sleep there? Not in those days!  <br /> <br />Even the other characters do not pan out into interesting studies, although the old butler Sanders was a nice touch.  <br /> <br />This book could have been better, but if you want a quick book that is not intense, this would be fine. <br />	2005-03-31

Miss Phillipa (Pippa) Grey and her family smell of the shop. Gentle born Mrs. Grey married outside her sphere and has been rejected by society. Her husband, a very wealthy shipper, agonizes over that fact and wants his wife to succeed in introducing their daughter and son to society. Using his great wealth, he convinces an impoverished Viscount to lend a hand at easing the way. Viscount Allingham, a respected arbiter of fashion, feels he has no choice but to take the money. He meets the family and offers his advice to each member. Bertie, the son, hangs on his every word and follows his advice without hesitation. Mrs. Gray likes Allingham, follows his advice, and they all are embraced by the ton again. Only Pippa is belligerent and bent on doing the exact opposite. His request that she not wear red results in Pippa making an entire wardrobe of the color. The ton dubs her \\"The Crimson Lady.\\" She also takes to being seen with the very people Allingham advises her not to associate with.  <br /> <br />As the Grey's become enmeshed with society, Allingham reluctantly finds himself falling in love with Pippa. She will only think him a fortune hunter and he tries to deny his attraction. Pippa, in turn, cannot understand why she is so drawn to him and yet enjoys going against his wishes. This gets her in trouble since she frequently finds herself in company with the amoral Lady Granville and despicable Lord Seagrave. Even the Grey's son Bertie finds himself in a bit of trouble when falling in with bad company.  <br /> <br />This romance is filled with provident rescues and endearing domestic animals. Secondary characters, both friends and foes are well fleshed out and interesting. The only problems I felt were that society accepted the Grey's a bit too readily and Allingham and Bertie seem to reform too quickly. I liked the stubborn heroine and there is the usual happy ending. Well worth reading. <br />	2005-03-31

Although this is considered the 1st book of the Brotherhood of the Sword series, the other two are related since characters from this book appear in the others I mentioned. There is much to like about this book. The entire story takes place over one month in one place. I like that Kinley concentrates on her characters and conversations rather than locale. I liked Stryder and Rowena for their honorable intentions and compassion for others. One of the best scenes was when Rowena visits Stryder in the dungeon and comforts him. I also loved when they \\"wrote\\" on each other - a sensual scene about  of the way through the book. The people were incredible, but I found the storyline a little bit lacking.  <br /> <br />There was so much background to convey about the Brotherhood of the Sword and what their ongoing purpose was, the storyline suffered. I don't know if it could have been woven into the storyline better and I hope the rest of the series doesn't present all these facts over and over. The main characters seem to fall for each other so quickly even as they constantly pronounce they will never fall in love or marry. That became tedious. The whole troubadour, music, song contest just didn't pan out right (for me) even though the contest is a major event at the end of the story. The intrigue was ok, but since I read for the romance, I wasn't all that interested in those parts.  <br /> <br />Overall, I was not as impressed as I was with earlier books but on the other hand - I can tell this is a series that I will be reading to the bitter end. The Brotherhood characters with their rather jaded look at life after imprisonment will be worth reading about. <br />	2005-03-31

The Christmas ones are usually the most delightful especially since I love the holidays!  <br /> <br />As with most anthologies, one or two stories stand out and I tend to read those over and over. In this grouping, Carla Kelly's \\"The Christmas Ornament,\\" and Elizabeth Fairchild's \\"Felicity's Forfeit\\" were the two that captured my heart! Both had unusual and wonderful female lead characters.  <br /> <br />\\"Livy\\" (Olivia) in \\"The Christmas Ornament\\" was intelligent, yet filled with common sense and compassion. She was not only able to express herself well but bring the shy, bookish \\"Jemmy\\" (James) out of his shell. The many secondary characters were well fleshed out even in this short story. James father advising him that \\"I have often suspected she (Olivia) is even more intelligent than you,\\" and \\"Take her seriously as you would any man ... learned that from your mother.\\" The outrageous comments that came out of James regarding Olivia - \\"You smell remarkably like a biscuit.\\" I loved his professor ways!!! But will he lose her to another - an Adonis, rich and sophisticated with an eye to changing Olivia. Or will Olivia trust her father (who had a hand at matchmaking) and her own instincts?  <br /> <br />Felicity of \\"Felicity's Forfeit\\" was a wonderful and different female lead (from America's south) and Bingham Kirby was our equally honorable male lead. Forced by the loss of his father's fortune, he must marry an heiress. Lost fortune is the key - the money was actually hidden for safekeeping by his forgetful father who makes vague references to wood and leaves when telling them where the money is. To choose a bride, Bingham hosts a holiday gathering which includes many wealthy young women. The reader is drawn into the Christmas fun and games. And Bingham's kindness shows as he invites the penniless vicar's daughters and their American cousin to join in the fun. But can there bea happily ever after? Bingham is ever mindful of his duty and a penniless American is not on his bride list!  <br /> <br />The other stories were notable, but not standouts to me. I enjoyed \\"Three Good Deeds\\" and loved the dog in \\"The Hounds of Heaven.\\" Allison Lane's \\"Second Chance\\" was a dark, disturbing tale, more like a sad pioneer historical then a regency. I found it depressing!  <br /> <br />But this book is worth having and re-reading. A keeper for me. <br />	2005-03-31

This is (I believe) the second book and I actually liked it better than a later one I read -- I loved Rejar, a \\"familiar\\" who's altered form is a cat. He was cool as an odd-eyed cat and stunning as an odd-eyed man. Totally an Alpha-male type so if your bent does not run that direction, stay away. I did feel that Rejar was a little too forceful at times and some sex scenes were not sensual but almost violent. I did like the many \\"cat\\" references and the little licks Rejar gave Lilac when she stirred while he was sleeping. Since he was sprawled all over her (just like a cat) the little licks by her ears were to comfort and settle her. Cute!  <br /> <br />Although many reviewers did not like Lilac, I did. She was not very bold but I don't think a man like Rejar would have endured a woman who stood up to him, \\"soul/life\\" mate or not. This was after all Regency England and not a modern society. She really did not like Nickolai (aka Rejar) and was as rejecting as she could be. Forced into marriage, Lilac relishes the sexual awakening but guards her heart. Of course a crisis (illness) forces both Rejar and Lilac to reexamine their feelings and admit love for each other.  <br /> <br />The secondary characters (Traed and Aunt Agatha) were interesting though not really well fleshed out. What did Jack the bottle green dressed groomsman/coachman add to this story? Anyway, all in all a fun story to read - very light on storyline, sometimes confusing when descriptions of Rejar's real world is mentioned. (I DO hate the name Rejar - though pronounced Ray-jhar, I still keep thinking he was interrupted during a canning process and had to be re-jarred??) Others will most likely enjoy meeting people from earlier books which I have on my list to find and read. I hope Traed's story is one of the books I have missed.

Her uncle is a vicar and will be \\"trading spaces\\" for a short time in another parish where they are unknown. Angel will go disguised as a poor, drab sort of relation. We meet the vicar, his wife and daughter Catherine. Then we meet Sir Gregory, Lady Elizabeth, nephew and daughter to the reigning gentry in the area Lord Grisdale. Also in the mix is Lord Welch who is vying for the hand of Lady Elizabeth. We later find out she is in love with a nearby reverend named Gerald Leigh and staying with him is the mysterious Don Marshall. There are assorted companions, servants, and other local people to deal with. TOO MANY! The story became convoluted and lost among all these characters! The mysterious Don Marshall turns out to be Lady Elizabeth's brother Lord Dominic. Lord Dominic who became a soldier against his father's wishes has been disinherited. Now he has returned from war wounded and battle-scarred. Of course in this mix are several romances and attempts at Dom's life. I liked that Angel tries to match make couples - all wrongly of course!  <br /> <br />Angel and Dom are the \\"lead\\" romance but I didn't find much spark between them. Oh yes, during one of the attempts on his life she stays near his bedside but I did not feel her emotions even then. And the other romances are just too involved to go through. Frankly, everything just became tedious in this book.  <br /> <br />Other Carola Dunn regencies are much better. This one just did not capture my heart. <br />	2005-03-31

The basic premise of this novel is Arabella trying to convince Cedric to invest some of his enormous wealth into the mill to better the conditions for workers.  <br /> <br />I liked Arabella for her boldness in discovering the plight of mill workers and attempting to correct it. The plot was a little far-fetched and some of her actions would have marked her a pariah to society but since this is fiction... I liked her loyalty to her almost blind companion and her inventor \\"coachman.\\" Cedric is a bit more of a mystery and although I came to like him, the depths of his pain (due to war) are not fully explored. You will like him for \\"rescuing\\" fighting roosters and sending them to the country because he could not tolerate the bloodshed. You will also come to admire him for seeking to protect Arabella though in a normal Regency chauvinistic way.  <br /> <br />Many side characters are interesting. A \\"detective\\" friend to Cedric, Harry Barkley, is particularly amusing as he gets himself into scrapes of all kinds. There are other characters with a hint of compelling stories - Lord Seagraves and a Mr./Lord? Layton, crippled in the war and friend to Cedric. I wished they had been fleshed out a little more - wonder if they are in other books?  <br /> <br />This is a quick afternoon read. Nothing traumatic happens though there could have been if we had seen Arabella return to her rented home which the infamous Lord Segraves now owned. And of course there is the normal happy ending.

They are normally fresh, funny and filled with animals. Although this one contained a delightful terrier named Macduff, the fresh and funny was missing from this book.  <br /> <br />Georgiana, in an attempt to manipulate her parents into approving a marriage with Thomas Jeffreys, invents a tale about being in love with the notorious Earl of Dunraven. She had met him very casually in London when his little dog ran off with her hat. In horror, her parents whisk her back to their country estate in Suffolk where (by coincidence) Dunraven has just purchased a house and decides to spend some time there. The invented tale of unrequited love makes it way through the gossip mill since Georgiana's sister has spread it to her friend.  <br /> <br />By chance, Dunraven meets her again and they are forced to spend some time together while she is trapped at his house by rain and flooding. He has heard the gossip and she confesses the deception she perpetrated. For some strange reason, Dunraven decides to pursue Georgiana and the hunt is on. The storyline is tangled with fortune hunter Thomas Jeffreys, ex-mistresses, current mistresses, pack of hounds, possible illegitimate children and a rather obnoxious friend of Dunraven's named Buckthorne. (Buckthorne is a user, adulterer and all-in-all horrible friend to have \\"stick by you\\" during a crisis - I disliked him intensely!).  <br /> <br />The story winds its way to the normal happy conclusion. It was ok - worth reading if you desire to read all Summerville works but not her best. <br />	2005-03-31

How did they become members of the demimonde?  <br /> <br />This story follows a woman who does. Like most, she became a mistress to survive. But now Marianne is pregnant and her protector is going to marry. She has been careful with money, etc, and now sets off to start life in a remote country village as a widow. Will her ruse be discovered? Can she stop the mutual attraction between herself and the gentleman doctor, Alden Venables? Her sadness is eased by the introduction of kittens and orphaned children the doctor brings around. There is a villain of course, and a nasty one.  <br /> <br />This is a very interesting and flowing story. There is a strange introduction of angels near the end of the book after Marianne has her baby. Introduced so late in the storyline, it didn't make sense and I found it annoying.  I've read other novels where angels were an integral part of the story and liked it but not here.  <br /> <br />It still is a good read despite that it ended a bit quick and of course, all is happy and resolved in the end. <br />	2005-03-31

Will plain Jane Ryder get the position? Jane has just gotten evicted from her residence and came dragging all her worldly possessions with her. (Why she ended up in London remains forever a mystery!) The witty dialogue between Eudora and Jane during the interview is wonderful. It is worth many of the less sterling chapters to follow.  <br /> <br />Speed up almost a year later and the book (Scandalbroth) is almost completed. Besides other common gossip, it relates the exploits of the infamous Fallon men. The newly titled (and young) Lord Fallon (Charles) visits Eudora in an attempt to thwart the publishing since he wishes to improve the image of the Fallon's. He is turned away after being propositioned by Lady Swann.  <br /> <br />Now Christmas is nearing and Jane is happy. She adores her employer and plans to enjoy the holidays with evergreens and specially chosen gifts. But Eudora has her own Christmas \\"scheming\\" to do and sends Jane off with a letter to Lord Fallon with a different proposition while she whisks herself out of town. This is after gifting Jane with lovely and touching items which I found very nice -  <br /> <br />In the letter to Lord Fallon, Eudora promises to consider delaying publishing of the book if he will allow Jane to research other Fallon family history. So Charles takes Jane to his family seat. He knows no written history exists but craves companionship when he returns to the place where he spent a lonely childhood.  <br /> <br />I don't want to spoil the rest of the story, but predictably they are trapped for a time in a snowstorm and share stories of their lives. I never knew whether to believe the stories and much is left unsaid. Since it is Christmastime there is special occurrence involving a baby.  <br /> <br />The romance is sweet and I loved the Lady Swann character but I never felt emotionally involved with either the hero or heroine. Ifyou crave a tame romance you will enjoy a few hours of reading and I will recommend it for those reasons. <br />	2005-03-31

But there is plenty of tension because Abigail has secrets. Miles (an Earl) is a wonderful character. He is a thoughtful man who is not obsessed with his apparent good looks. And to admit that he is hen-pecked by all the women in his life is quite a revelation for a Regency novel. Miles takes it all in stride, attempting to throw off his matchmaking mama and sisters by marrying a \\"plain, dull, ordinary\\" woman before they can leg-shackle him to someone else. That woman is Abigail who applies to him (as a distant relative) for a recommendation since she has been let go without character. Miles proposes marriage to the stranger and Abigail accepts. She turns out to be anything but plain, dull and ordinary.  <br /> <br />It is fun to read a book that has so many references to another. \\"Precious Jewel\\" occurs at the same time as this book and the paths and even whole conversations are repeated in each. It made for intriguing reading.  <br /> <br />As always, Mary Balogh really fleshes out all her characters and the side stories are as interesting as the main character's story. This is a fun and interesting read. Do not miss it. <br />	2005-03-31

Most of the characters in Regencies never have flaws but in this one both sisters have them! Meg can't see and her sister, Angela, is a bit flighty.  <br /> <br />Meg does end up in an improbable situation as a governess to Lord Bryn's niece and nephew after getting into the wrong carriage. But it is fun to read how all the characters tangle themselves in impossible situations which of course end up happy. The villainess in this case is very mild (I liked that) and gets her due in the end.  <br /> <br />A fun, quick, entertaining read. <br />	2005-03-31

Of course having caught a peek at her, Brandon (Lord Shandal) liked what he saw. Later, he finds out (as Ashley does) that they are to make a match of it. Brandon's mother and best friend (Ashley's aunt) have decided these two will marry. Ashley is dependent upon her aunt and uncle since her new sister-in-law has literally driven her from the house with barely the clothes on her back. It is a marriage of convenience but Ashley with her winning ways soon charms Brandon to live down the name \\"Lord Scandal.\\"  <br /> <br />I found it charming that Ashley was so reluctant and frightened to consummate the marriage. After all, though Brandon was handsome, he was a stranger. They work out those problems as well as the others that crop up along the way - including a irksome sister-in-law and her indebted brother. And there is the scandal of Brandon's current mistress - she appears at the house! How shocking! This is a well paced book, but not particularly light hearted.  <br /> <br />It envelopes you in the life of a woman forced to marry and forced (she thinks) to take second place in her husband's affections as was many a woman in those times. Good and pleasant reading. <br />	2005-03-31

This is a dark, moving story of a very weak and disillusioned man and the strong woman who loved him in spite of his faults. There are only two positive notes about Freddie, his looks and his apparent wish to bring Clara some much needed happiness in her life. He succeeds with bringing Clara out of the cocoon her father wrapped her in. Clara brings him the absolution he so desires. This was a very realistic portrayal of a couple who marry for reasons besides love. A very interesting book! <br />	2005-03-31

Lady Elizabeth Fairchild was a hoyden and apparently heartless. She has gone through one season and made a rather bad name for herself as a flirt. But Elizabeth has fallen in love with Lord Meridan (Brett). He shows her nothing but contempt and in a last ditch effort to attract his interest, Elizabeth attempts to best others at his house party during a fox hunt. While chasing the fox, Elizabeth has a startling revelation. She had gone against her own nature for society's acceptance and feels as hunted and desperate as the little animal running for its life. Like the fox, she too would be ravaged by the nobles. An attempt to save the animal results in a nasty spill. Elizabeth must remain at the Brett's estate and during her recovery he seems to care deeply but as soon as her awareness of it occurs, he ignores her again. She has a slight loss of memory and as it returns, Elizabeth finds she wants to become true to herself and begins to express real feelings and truthfulness to those around her. This has mixed results among society and her family.  <br /> <br />I will not spoil the story by telling all that happens but there are several romances and twisted plots and you begin to wonder if anyone will end up \\"happily ever after!\\" You will wonder why Lord Meridan denies his feelings for Elizabeth for so long and will applaud as Elizabeth takes responsibility for her previous actions. Her dysfunctional family is interesting. The fickle minds of society are fascinating as Elizabeth becomes the toast of the town and then hopes are dashed when her biggest supporter (Beau Brummell) loses his coveted status. And there is a nasty jealous ex-mistress to deal with also!  <br /> <br />A gem of a book that I thoroughly recommend. <br />	2005-03-31

I read every Summerville novel I can find (I'm only missing four of them!) because her characters are heartwarming and charming. \\"The Viscount's Lady\\" is among her first and may even be the first Regency under this name. It was a portent of things to come since the hero and heroine, Boadicea Halkyard and Cedric Hardcastle, Viscount Stansbury, are well drawn out with very human failings as true of her other books. The secondary characters are well fleshed and have interesting stories to tell also. There is even a little yellow mutt named Horatio to amuse us during the tale.  <br /> <br />The storyline is typical Regency with a little twist now and then. Viscount Stansbury is a bane to his loving parents. Almost thirty, he is interested in scholastic pursuits and has little to do with society. Being the heir to a dukedom, they expect him to be dandy, sporting and a great horseman like his father. He is none of those things - in fact his brother, Peter, is the epitome of a society gentleman, yet the parents and brother are shown as loving, if not supportive of his historical interests.  <br /> <br />In the story, Viscount Stansbury seeks a noted historian (Mr. Halkyard) in the town of Picklesworth to examine an ancient statue. Mr. Halkyard has a lovely daughter (Boadicea) who is intelligent and scholarly also. Yet, she is fun loving and enjoys dancing and parties - (maybe a little TOO perfect!). Cedric falls head over heels in love and the attraction is mutual. Trying times are ahead though and an untimely remark about Mr. Halkyard's opinions turns them away from each after a bitter quarrel. Also, a villain in the form of Mr. Grimthorpe, a bully who desires Boadicea will cause trouble for the couple.  <br /> <br />The story resolves itself in London with the typical balls, drives in the park, misunderstandings, kidnapping, and kisses. Boadicea's cousin, aunt and uncle, Cedric's servant (Thomson) and brother are all wonderful additions to the conversations and flow of the tale. I didn't like that Cedric seemed to abandon his books to become better dressed - but I believe it was only temporary. I liked that Boadicea loved him while he was still a ramshackle \\"absent-minded professor.\\" There is so much more to this book (and many other characters I don't mention) to enjoy. Worth finding a copy; wonderful reading. <br />	2005-03-31

I read it in one day so it must have captivated me. But ... the characters (Eliza and Darrin) were nasty, mean and manipulative people and neither matured or changed during the storyline. Let's start with Eliza. She was spoiled, bratty and mean. I am sure she behaved more like the real nobility during that age than our romanticized version normally does so I did not find that difficult to imagine. Our earl turned out to be manipulative, authoritative and totally unfeeling which again was most likely the norm. But this is fiction and I would liked to have seen some maturing that never occurred.  <br /> <br />Indeed, our spoiled widow spends a few harrowing days at the \\"miserly\\" Earl of Darrin's \\"castle\\" carrying coal, heating water and making toast. Hardly a life altering experience. There was a moment when a lamb dies and suddenly we feel a little sympathy. But Eliza accords more tears for the lamb then when she finds out her own young maid has died due to the rough cold trip to the Earl's home. (Oh she did pay for her care at the inn where the maid was abandoned at and she paid for a soon to be forgotten grave).  <br /> <br />The miserly Earl turns out to be a wealthy and sophisticated man, who, in cahoots with Eliza's arrogant and equally spiteful cousin Miles has concocted a scheme to bring Eliza down a notch or two (taming?). Hence a pretense of a country bumpkin in a run down manor house when Eliza comes to visit. Eliza's father, hoping to marry her off to Darrin who is the son of a friend, had sent her off to visit Darrin's mother (now widowed). Much later, back in London, Darrin browbeats Eliza into a hasty marriage after she realizes she is pregnant. (Yes, they found something to do in the country besides birthing lambs and cooking stew). He controls everything about their life including a ball they are going to give. Even the menus are brought to him after Eliza looks at them. And he WONDERS why she gives him the cold shoulder.  <br /> <br />Of course in the end, they come into accordance and love - all the while he is thinking of \\"punishing\\" her because she \\"ran\\" away from him and back to the country. And there she is looking so sweet in her calico dress and bare feet. A bit too contrived! Good for a quick read but others by Barbara Hazard are much better. <br />	2005-03-31

Not only do you hope and cheer for Harriet and her love, Tenby, but you find out what has happened to characters from other Mary Balogh books. Finding out how Freddie and Clara are faring (from Dancing with Clara) was such a bonus.<br /><br />Harriet, in the six years since we last heard of her, married a gentle older man and bore him a beautiful daughter. She is now widowed and wealthy. Although she loved her husband she realizes she never lost the tendre she felt for the Duke of Tenby. Harriet never asked what happened to Tenby after refusing him six years before when he offered her \\"carte blanche.\\" Now she is London having a \\"season\\" and Tenby is bowing to duty and looking for a bride. They meet - both realizing that Harriet would never be an appropriate choice for a duchess - but the attraction to each other is overwhelming.<br /><br />Tenby, too, has denied his love for her and up until they met again did not know she had married and does not know of her daughter. Without telling the whole story, their love becomes a tangled web of quick liaisons and hurt feelings. Tenby wants to marry her after all but is it too late? He becomes betrothed, and Harriet finds him without honor and begins to hate him. How can a happy ending be achieved?<br /><br />All the characters in this book are well portrayed. You will love Tenby's great aunt and Harriet's dear friend, Lady Sophia. She is a matchmaker in disguise and delightful. And you will agonize with both hero and heroine as they struggle with their love for each other and moral issues. This book stands alone and is enjoyable even if you have not read the prequel. This is one book that is not to be missed.	2005-03-29

Trey, the Duke of Salterdon, was going to throw his duty to family away by wedding a poor vicar's daughter, Maria. She had saved him from madness and now she ran from him, later marrying another (or so he thought). Trey found out the truth moments before his own marriage. Maria was alive, imprisoned in Menson, a mental asylum.  <br /> <br />And she was, by the time he reached her these six years later, mad. You can imagine the brutality and horror of an asylum for the criminally insane in the 1800s. Trey's grandmother, the ruthless dowager duchess, was responsible for Maria's placement in the asylum. Trey sets out to save Maria. He still loved her. Maria lives in a dark cocoon comforted only by the voice of her long dead brother and as she begins to enter the light again, remembers feelings of betrayal by Trey. She too has been misled and told lies and only remembers that her beautiful baby, Sarah, had been wrenched from her arms after giving birth to her in the asylum.  <br /> <br />The story focuses on Trey's struggle to regain pride and fortune, with the undercurrent of mystery surrounding his own birth and that of his missing child Sarah. From Devotion, we meet again with Trey's twin brother Clayton and his wife Miracle. There is the added element of tension with Lady Edwina, Trey's fianc, literally left at the altar. Will Maria ever be whole again? The ending to this novel, unlike the prequel, is very standard and appealing. I enjoyed it very much. I did not find the descriptions of Maria's stay in the asylum as oppressive as it could have been. The elements of mysticism (ghosts & miracles) are all right. The tale is uniquely told in first person. Different, wonderful reading.  <br /> <br />A must if you have read Clayton's story (Miracle) and Trey & Maria's first story (Devotion). As other reviewers note, this book lacks the sensual appeal other novels have, but I didn't miss it in the storyline. Katherine Sutcliffe has not disappointed me yet. <br />	2005-03-24

I loved the tie-in of each story to a skating party and a Valentine ball. I loved the \\"observations\\" of Lady Whistledown. I greatly admired her in all the Quinn Bridgerton novels. Each story was so unique and some had unique heroes and heroines. I will not recite what each story was about - other reviewers have done that quite adequately.  <br /> <br />My favorite and the one I felt was different from the usual genre was Mia Ryan's \\"A Dozen Kisses.\\" What a sweet, touching romance between a wounded (in the head - not physically showing) Lord and a rather sad, wounded (by circumstances) young woman. Linney and Terrance were enchanting to get to know in this rather short entry! I truly wished it was longer, just because I wanted more!  <br /> <br />All the other stories stood out in various ways. I forgot that I was not reading a Regency anthology as each heroine found themselves in ummm ... various compromising positions with their loves ... so keep in mind this is not a \\"G\\" rated anthology. None of the stories stirred my soul, but it is hard to do that in the limited pages given each storyline. Highly recommend this, especially for those who just can't get enough of Lady Whistledown. <br />	2005-03-24

Why she no longer accepts his flowers or his rather innocent kisses. He cannot put his finger on it as the wedding is postponed for one reason or another. Will he ever guess the truth?  <br /> <br />Secondary characters and situations are a joy to read about in this book. Barbara Hazard is one of my favorite authors and this is another carefully written and wonderful book. All of her characters are wonderfully drawn. You can see them in your mind's eye right down to Lady Gloriana's little skip when she moves from room to room. The use of letters in some instances isan interesting addition.  <br /> <br />Great reading, right down to the end. <br />	2005-03-24

There are two major romances going on in this story and throw the stern grandfather, Lord Ailsa, into it and you've got a good mix of romance and tall tales of Loch Ness monsters and other beasties. Of course one of the beasties may be Lord Hastings (at least according to Felicity!). Their story is one romance. The other romance is between Felicity's sister (Susan) and Lord Hasting's cousin (Kyle).  <br /> <br />The sisters are opposite in nature with Susan the shy sister who becomes very clumsy when nervous-and she is plenty nervous around the stern old Lord Ailsa. But love conquers all and she learns to stand on her own two feet winning the respect and love of all her future relatives.  <br /> <br />Felicity and Jamie (Lord Hastings) have a harder time because each is unsure of how the other feels and Felicity wants to be her own woman. Does it work out in the end?  <br /> <br />I love how Jamie breaks into a Scottish brogue when he is feeling great emotion.

But she is also mindful of her position as a governess and though rather a wild child at 17, she is quite different at 27. She returns to Chalcote Court and is reacquainted with a Camden Rutledge, Lord Treyhorn, her childhood cohort and first love. His young daughter, age 6, has not spoken in three years and is just the type of special child Helene has worked with for years. Camden, a widower, carries a world of responsibility on his shoulders. He also loves his daughter and wants the best for her. His staid personality conflicts with Helene's passionate nature and tension abounds each time they interact. Eventually even Cam cannot resist what his heart desires. The love scenes are sensual but not intense.  <br /> <br />All the secondary characters are wonderful from the aging valet, to the angelic child Ariane. Bentley, Cam's brother, and Catherine, his sister, are so well fleshed out; they feel like family to the reader! And each is scheming to achieve ... what? (I'll leave you to read the book and find out!)  <br /> <br />There are many stories in this one novel and you become thoroughly embroiled in each. And I just love a man who talks to his big ol' cat (Boadicea). I did not give this a 5 because of a rather distasteful incident involving Bentley and Helene - I didn't think it added to the story. But I still will recommend this highly - and I am off to find other Liz Carlyle books since this was my first, but definitely not my last! <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-24

I can't quite decide who was more tormented, Trey or Marie.  <br /> <br />Marie, a beautiful but abused young woman becomes a nurse/companion to Trey Hawthorne the Duke of Salterdon. She is beaten down both physically and mentally by her deranged father (a rather successful minister). Seeking a better life for herself and her mother, Marie answered an advertisement to nurse a child. Much later, after arriving at Thorn Rose manor, she finds her patient is not a child at all.  <br /> <br />Injured in an attempted robbery, Trey spends his time either catatonic or totally frustrated and abusive to his staff. Eventually at the edge of consciousness, he begins to notice and respond to Marie. And not as expected! He is rather violent! Marie, seemingly with an endless amount of compassion and forgiveness, conquers all her fears and rather than running away, she works doggedly to bring Trey back from the brink of lunacy.  <br /> <br />The storyline is harsh and frightening, yet you come to love Marie for her unfailing optimism and Trey for his desire to be free of the confines of being a duke. They both have suffered tremendous hurt as children and you realize how much they have in common, just as you realize how far in class they are apart. <br />  <br />Can this have a happy ending? Will she sacrifice him to his position and obligations. Will he sacrifice her to please his grandmother and society? I was not disappointed with the ending as others were. The ending was as gritty and real as the rest of the book.  <br /> <br />Secondary characters are so well drawn out. Trey's twin brother was a delight to meet. The dour duchess (grandmother) was also. Every character added dimension to the story. I did not like the hurried ending of the novel which wrapped up some incidents regarding \\"highwaymen.\\" This is not a light hearted novel but I can highly recommend it. I am off to read the \\"prequel\\" about Clayton, Trey's twin -- <br />	2005-03-24

He (Lord Beaumont) was an aristocrat and she (Meg Quincy), a ladies maid. Even a young servant raised along with a nobleman's daughter to be literate and charming could never have caught Richard Beaumont's eye ... or could she. I found it difficult to suspend belief, but this is fiction! So, I followed along with the unlikely romance. It was rather sweet. Meg Quincy just never learned to be humble and it got her into trouble time and time again. Lord Beaumont, an ever sought after bachelor, had never met a spitfire like Meg. They had a secret rendezvous location (a glade near the river) but only exchanged stolen kisses.  <br /> <br />Lord Beaumont was engaged to Meg's new and horrid mistress Allegra - so how could she believe his whispers of love. Because of a \\"deathbed\\" promise to his mother, Richard engaged himself to the despicable Allegra while realizing himself in love with Meg. He offers to make Meg his mistress and she rejects that offer. How can they ever have more??  <br /> <br />There are secrets to be exposed and mysteries to solve. I will not spoil it for you. The secondary characters are actually interesting. The passive Lady Semple, angry Aunt Lydia and the detestable Allegra all have interesting facets to them. I felt horrible for Meg, who had such a pathetic life - did no one hate that the family she had been with since birth to age 18 just dumped her practically into the street??? Anyway, this is a quick afternoon read - but not in anyway realistic to the class conscious Regency times. <br />	2005-03-21

Wonderful 1st book to the Bridgerton Series	I'll admit to reading this series all out of order, but each stands alone.  So after already reading both Colin's, Eloise's and the Whistledown books, I finally start at the beginning.  The Bridgerton series is about eight brothers and sisters plus their assorted friends.  The eight children are named alphabetically - Anthony, Benedict, Colin, Daphney, Eloise, Francesca, Gregory and Hyacinth.  This is Daphne's story. <br /> <br />This book had me laughing out loud and later made me teary-eyed.  For that alone it deserves a 5.  The Duke of Hastings, Simon Basset had a lonely unloved childhood.  Because of his stuttering, his own father declared to the world that his son was dead.  Never answered letters or came to see him at all!  Simon rose above the snub reaching heights he never thought he would  - surviving on his hatred to sustain him.  Yet Simon had a heart and was well liked among his peers.   <br /> <br />Daphne had been raised in the loving bosom of a large family.  Now her mother was determined to see her married and Daphne hated the endless matchmaking.  Simon (her brother Anthony's friend) has returned from abroad after his father's death. Daphne and he make a pact to protect each other from matchmaking mama's by pretending an attachment.  They really are opposites in temperament and philosophies but this is only a temporary arrangement.   <br /> <br />Of course, we know that these arrangements often go awry!  After compromising Daphne, Simon agrees to save her reputation by marrying her.  The Bridgerton brothers are very involved in this agreement!  But when Simon tells Daphne he cannot have children, she is devastated - yet willing to marry since she loves him so. <br /> <br />You will love the hilarity of Daphne's talk with her mother regarding the wedding night ... and even laugh at what Daphne reveals to Simon about it!   <br /> <br />As, Daphne and Simon adjust to their marriage, there is a terrible revelation about Simon's statement \\"cannot have children.\\"  When Daphne takes matters into her own hands, the rage and angst threaten to end the marriage within two weeks of its start!  Can any of the problems be resolved?   <br /> <br />You will love the tortured hero and revel in the extended Bridgerton family!  I love that Simon has flaws!  And who is Lady Whistledown - the mysterious gossip?  Her three times a week newsletter is the talk of the town?  You will love reading her observations at the beginning of every chapter ... ah but that is another book you must read.  The Duke and I is delightful reading ... a keeper.    <br />	2005-03-21

Lily with her love of all God's creatures proved to be the balm that Julian's bitter heart needed. I loved all the \\"cats\\" in this story, especially Sebastian!  <br /> <br />The various scrappy individuals (both human and animal!) met during this story were delightfully portrayed! The tenderness that Julian showed in caring for his grown nephew Peter was wonderful. It does not often show up in Regencies, where we expect our hero to be a ruthless rogue.  <br /> <br />Julian, who thinks he is rather a rake, turns out to be a lion that lies with the lamb.  <br /> <br />A bit of fluffy reading for a delightful couple of hours. <br />	2005-03-19

I found the characters very human and likeable. My views were not based on knowing Eloise from other Bridgerton books since I have only read one other (Colin's story). That may be why I liked Eloise better than some reviewers.  <br /> <br />Sir Phillip was a man who ran away from his problems by burying himself in botany experiments. He had learned to cope with a severely depressed wife and seemingly untamable children by retreating into himself and his greenhouse. Phillip had no foundation of good parental behavior. He thought himself a bad father but didn't try to change. He felt the best way to handle the situation after his wife's death was to find the best mother. Maybe not ok by today's standards but it needs to be examined under the early 1800's standards where his thinking and reactions were quite normal.  <br /> <br />Eloise felt restless. Her friends were marrying and she had no prospects that interested her. A quick note to the widowed husband of her cousin led to a year of letters and an unusual proposal of marriage. The letters in the beginning of each chapter gave me a wonderful portrait of her soul. I loved that touch! I wish we had been privy to more of the letters between Phillip and Eloise - more people might have found Phillip likeable. Eloise hastily runs off to meet this \\"perfect\\" man and finds that not only is he not perfect, there are a few things he neglected to tell her - especially the 8 year old (boy and girl) twins! But he is passionate and seduced by his kisses she begins to decide they will suit each other.  <br /> <br />Then the Bridgerton brothers converge on the scene after a week. There are funny situations with the brothers that made me laugh out loud. They also insist on a hasty wedding and Eloise and Phillip do not begin marriage on a good footing. Trouble with the children gets worse, Phillip retreats into himself and Eloise tries to fix everything in her dominating way. Canit work out in the end or are they doomed to passion but not love? (They do get along fine in the bedroom and I loved the sensuality of this novel).  <br /> <br />I enjoyed every aspect of this novel. The characters including the children and even the horrible nurse all add a dimension of reality. These are not cookie-cutter perfect people that you may find in other novels. There were real problems to be resolved and I was sorry to see the book come to an end. <br />	2005-03-19

She wanted to bring happiness and joy to all around her, yet she was strong enough to know what would bring joy to herself and tried not to compromise those dreams. Merrie was Christmas personified!  <br /> <br />All the side characters were wonderful and marvelous to become acquainted with - Lady Warwick and all her hypochondria, George - youthful and spirited, and the assorted friends, female rivals and leaders of the ton.  <br /> <br />Brett (the Earl of Warwick) was a believable hero. Caught up in self-importance and unwilling to notice the needs of others, he was the antithesis of Merrie. She lambasted him on all sides to make him understand how his cold hearted actions affected others. Brett could see the difference she made in others lives, but would not open his heart to her. I enjoyed their very spirited conversations and arguments.  <br /> <br />The story dragged a little bit at times, and I hated that Brett did not trust or believe Merrie at a very vulnerable time. I don't know if I could have forgiven him for that lack of faith. But all in all, it was wonderful reading and had the requisite happy ending! <br />	2005-03-19

I would have liked Christine and Vincent to have gotten to know each other a little better before declaring their love in this Beauty and the Beast story.  <br /> <br />Several story threads started and never finished. Why did Christine tell the Earl they were penniless? Why did he trust her when he trusted no others? What was the sneaking around to her bedchamber about? I thought Vincent's crime that sent him into seclusion (not the injuries) a little too contrived. Despite the flaws, I still found the story entertaining and very readable.  <br /> <br />I loved that Vincent pushed himself to come to London. I was touched by Christine's loyalty and love for him even while becoming the toast of the town. Aunt Nellis was an interesting side character though I think she sort of fizzled out at the end.  This was a quick, worthwhile read but not a keeper. <br />	2005-03-19

I was intrigued to read a book about an \\"older\\" gentleman who marries his nephew's betrothed to save her from a horrible fate at the hands of her stepbrother.  He is just keeping her with him until her fianc returns and then have the marriage annulled.  As they live in the same house the sexual tension between Edmund and Julianna is incredible. By denying themselves release, each character learns to love and care about each other for other reasons!  <br /> <br />I've read this book several times and each time I see more about Edmund and Julianna that I like. All the supporting people in the book are well fleshed out, making everything so believable. The descriptions of the countryside made me want to run through the morning dew in my bare feet!  <br /> <br />It all adds up to a delightful afternoon of reading! <br />	2005-03-19

Gabriel is so bitter and doesn't believe in love -- at least he feels he can't love! But he believes Verity is the woman who will be a perfect wife and wants her to fall in love with him. It will only take a couple weeks, right? Other women seem to fall in love with him right away!  <br /> <br />Little does he know, by courting her he shows the side of himself that is loving and accepting! Of course Verity thinks he just wants a friend and hides her growing attachment!  <br /> <br />Every incident that occurs in this book is handled so well and is so interesting. A keeper and well worth reading and re-reading.  You come to love both hero and heroine and the assorted cast of well fleshed out side characters.  (Well, you love the nice characters and enjoy the descriptions of the bad ones!)  <br /> <br />My favorite phrase from Gabriel -- \\"Tell me what kind of a husband you want and I will be that man.\\" -- wouldn't you fall in love with that man!! <br />	2005-03-19

First, as Luke and his ragamuffin daughter await his mail order bride (petite Alyssa Cannon) at the dock, a rather tall, crow-like woman is all that remains of the passengers of the stern-wheeler. She is Alyssa's sister, Emily. Emily has been left homeless and penniless after the school where she taught shuts down. All of her family has died including Alyssa and she has come in Alyssa's place hoping to help Luke and his daughter, Rose. Will he marry her or send her back to Chicago? Luke decides to go ahead with this marriage for his daughter's sake.  <br /> <br />Waiting at home is his manipulative, bossy mother-in-law, Cora. Cora does not like anyone taking her deceased daughter, Belinda's place and makes her feelings known to all. She belittles Emily and undermines Emily's attempts to befriend Rose. The tension in the house is almost unbearable. Despite the hostile atmosphere that Cora perpetuates, Emily, Luke and Rose begin to make themselves a family.  <br /> <br />There are many wonderful situations with town folk and fights aplenty with Cora. Will Emily find the family she wishes for? Can Luke forget his guilt about the way Belinda died? Will Rose become the happy child she once was? I read this story in one afternoon because I could not put it down! I liked the loyalty Luke felt towards his mother-in-law, the way he felt torn by each of the \\"women\\" in his life.  <br /> <br />The pace was a little slow and Emily did turn out to be a little too perfect for having been a city-girl living in a school but that is normal for most romance's and it did not affect my enjoyment. Since other reviewers felt this was not one of Alexis Harrington's best, I am anxious to pick up some others! I found it exceptional reading and highly recommend it! <br />	2005-03-19

George Wright (Stephen's half-brother) has ruined an innocent lady, Diana Somerville all on a dare. We find out later the attempted rape is not completed, but I felt that was glossed over. Stephen feels compelled to ask for Diana's hand since George has fled the country. Diana is an interesting character - not really concerned over her lost reputation but living in a fantasy world where she will set out to become a world traveler and adventuress when she reaches her majority.  <br /> <br />Diana's family and Lord Endicott come up with a scheme to have a sham engagement. It will restore Diana's reputation (how?)and will be over at the end of the season. Of course in true Regency style both fall in love and begin to wish the betrothal is a reality.  <br /> <br />The problem with the story is that I felt no real affection between Stephen and Diana. Oh some of the correct words are spoken but nothing that made my heart swell. Another problem is that Diana meets George (the bad brother) later and experiences none of the outrage or fear I think a normal woman would feel towards the man who attempted to rape her. Also there is no resolution to the trouble created by Stephen's stepmother and half-brother. Diana never really finds out what Stephen's real feelings about them are.  <br /> <br />A nice note is that Stephen (though browbeaten to do it) takes Diana on a few adventures, teaching her to drive a rig, talking about taking her on a boat, bringing her to lectures about the Amazon and ascending with her in a hot air balloon. All of these \\"adventures\\" lead her to decide risking life and limb was not all that enjoyable after all.  <br /> <br />An ok read but other \\"brother stand-in\\" Regencies (which is a rather common theme) have been handled better. <br /> <br/>	2005-03-19

Willing and able to take care of herself, she creates happiness around her by careful, loving manipulation of others. She is a lady through and through even though brought up common and abused. She is unwanted by her stepfather who sees her as \\"lord's leavings\\" despite his own willingness to take the lords stipend for her care! Heather fit in wherever she landed, be it a humble cottage or the Regent's palace.  <br /> <br />Beau, unbeknownst to him, is her lifelong love. I found him undeserving of her devotion, sometimes cruel. Heather teaches him many humbling lessons. Beau eventually comes to the realization that he loves her and his various heroic acts saved me from thinking badly of him.  <br /> <br />This book is filled with rich characters. The dialog and expression of feelings is wonderful. The introduction of Princess Charlotte as Heather's friend and confidante added dimension to the story.  <br /> <br />It is rather unbelievable at times and not exactly historically correct but I found it a great read -- not to be missed. <br />	2005-03-19

Her mother has been accused of misappropriating the funds for the home and someone is sending blackmail letters to \\"patrons\\" of the home. Lord Coe has connections to one such person being extorted and sets off to put an end to it. He had met Melody earlier under different circumstances and now instead of believing she is an innocent, he decides she is corrupt and conniving. All the better to make her his mistress!  <br /> <br />In the remainder of the book Lord Coe (in pursuing Melody) comes to meet the other assorted characters - children, half grown spoiled debutante, immature mother, and Amazon nurse. Melody and he get to know each other and revise their opinions over and over.  <br /> <br />There are lots of funny circumstances when you throw a badly behaved dog and a badly behaved magistrate into the picture.

This novel is no exception.  The premise is fairly predictable - country miss and rake who needs a marriage of convenience to satisfy the terms of his father's will.  Tilly is even worse than the typical country miss.  She is plump and totally uncouth.  She says the wrong thing, wears the wrong thing and walks like a man.  Left penniless by her gambling father, Tilly becomes the companion of her cousin Lady Aileen.  Aileen is so horrible, keeping Tilly close by only to ridicule her.  Calling her \\"The Beast,\\" all of Aileen's friends delight in torturing her - but rather underhandedly and Tilly only gets the uncomfortable feeling of never belonging.  She has already met and fell in love with Phillip, the Marquess of Heppleford who saves her from her aunt and cousin by marrying her.  He then immediately runs off to his beautiful French mistress on their wedding night.  Of course Tilly changes from ugly duckling to swan and the remainder of the book is Phillip trying to win Tilly's love back --   <br /> <br />The unbelievable part is that Tilly changes from fat and rather obnoxious to social butterfly in the space of three weeks with the help of her friend (French maid, Francine).  Then Tilly catches the eye of all the men at her house party including Toby Bassett, Phillip's friend.  Toby has his own stab at romance in this book and I found it rather sad.  There is a mystery involving a later will and the next in line to inherit, the sad and pimply Cecil.  Of course there are untimely accidents, irritating relatives and misunderstandings to resolve. <br /> <br />Although this was a quick read, the whole storyline was rather trite.  I didn't really come to like either Tilly (who was MUCH more fun as a country bumpkin) or Phillip.  The aunt and cousin never really get their due but actually are the most interesting of all the cast of characters presented.  An ok afternoon read - not much involvement required.         <br />	2005-03-19

For a person who loves Regency and Historical Romance, it was far outside my normal experience. There was much to like about this story. Gian was wonderfully sexy and Jenise was spirited enough to complement him. I liked the way the alien worlds were described and the way I was able to pick up the customs from the conversations and character's adventures.  <br /> <br />I felt the storyline had too many leads into other novels that have either been published or are future releases, even at the author's insistence the books are designed to stand alone. Too many unfinished thoughts and tales from Jenise's fear of power to the injured familiar left behind, to Karpon and the debilitating drug. I wouldn't mind Gian purring in my ear for a long long time, but \\"The Incarnation\\" was a bit over the top. I'm afraid if I was Jenise, we would both be fated to grow old - a body can only take so much!  <br /> <br />Even with the things about the book that bothered me, I can recommend it for those who like an amusing fantasy and I may even indulge in another purely for the fun of it. <br />	2005-03-19

I couldn't really figure out why Lord Wyland fell in love with Mary so fast. Later he says it is her honesty, but she is not really honest with him in many ways. She hides her love from him.  How was she able to resist his lovemaking?  All because she thought he was in love with another woman?  I can't believe they didn't talk even if it was in anger.  Even the vicar was a sad and confusing character - if he cared for Mary why didn't he act on it in five years?  <br /> <br />The buying of bonnets was a nice touch.  The story was ok.

If you want to know the truth my favorite was the young Penrose who spouted dark poetry of death.  That was a great characterization!   <br /> <br />Our heroine, Vanessa, fell in love with the Duke that married her sister.  His name was Richard, Duke of Greydon.  There is little interaction after the marriage - in fact it appears from the age of 13 when Vanessa saw and fell in love with him until 10 years later there is no contact at all!  But Caroline has died under mysterious circumstances, leaving one daughter Sarah.   <br /> <br />One year after Caroline's untimely death, Richard appears at Vanessa's doorstep.  Out of the blue he asks for her hand and she accepts.  Vanessa travels to the dark gloomy Castle Greyden where she is faced with Richard's bizarre family:  bitter mother-in-law who speaks vile words to all except her beloved Roland, Richard's younger twin;  Rosemund, pining a lost love with her lost mind speaks to an empty space beside her; Penrose, an odd family member whose true identity I will leave for you to discover and Sarah, around four or five yearning for the love of both mother and father.  There is the mysterious Richard too!  How she loves him but why is he so cold to his daughter?  How can she get him to love her and not the memory of her beautiful sister?  Caroline was apparently evil and soundly hated by all.  Vanessa must break the cycle of fear that surrounds the house. <br /> <br />Of course there are the usual hidden passageways, dangerous landscapes, near-miss accidents.  There is also a crying babe that signals death!  Who is behind all the mysterious happenings and could it be Richard, himself?  Could he have killed the unfaithful Caroline?  Was he out to kill Vanessa?  You will have to read the book to find out.  One thing - the mystery of the crying babe is not solved - now THAT was bizarre!       <br />	2005-03-12

Similar to a Regency novel but it was told in the first person.  I am not sure why the \\"teaser\\" on the back cover hints that the duke wanted to make our heroine Olivia his mistress.  He never once offered her that position - after all he already had a lovely mistress!   <br /> <br />Olivia has been extensively educated by traveling with her father all over Europe.  Though not a lady, Olivia does have good bloodlines and is related to a baron.  She picked up languages easily and could converse in many different ones.  Now that her father has died, she has taken on the job teaching the Duke of Queensford's ward, Penelope, French and social skills.  Olivia falls in love with both the Duke's ancestral home (a castle) and the duke - who is arrogant, autocratic, dark, manly and fascinating!  But it is just her pipe dream to believe they could ever be together.  So you enter the world of an upper servant, the jealousy of others, the slights by the aristocracy and an undercurrent of mystery.  Will Olivia be able to break through Penelope's walls of hurt.  Is the duke really Penelope's father?  And could Olivia ever hope to wrest him out of the arms of his beautiful (but married!) lover? <br /> <br />This book was a treasure to read and I will search out others by this author.  I did not give it a 5 because the ending was a little hurried after all the painstaking work to get there.  Highly recommend. <br />	2005-03-04

I cannot find anything to pick at in this one.  James is a riveting character, unloved by his father and heartbroken by the disloyalty of his mother and death of his stepmother.  He guards his heart and treasures his privacy, never letting his generosity show or sharing affection with anyone.  His responsibilities are enormous involving an ill (and ill-tempered) father and several siblings that pop up, or are mentioned throughout the story.   <br /> <br />Along comes Marguerite, a Frenchwoman, with lies, laughter and burdens of her own.  She touches him as no one else ever has and she takes on the role of housekeeper during a time of crisis.  The main house has been burned by his father and the ruin must be picked through, servants must be supervised and life must go on.  Marguerite takes on the tasks and breathes life back into Braemoor.  But can James trust her?  Will he let her in his heart?  Will she be \\"his last lover?\\"  The romance is compelling and sometimes I despaired of it ever ending happily!  Not light-hearted, the emotions this novel evoked were incredible.   <br /> <br />A \\"must-read\\" and a keeper.  I am off to find other Mary Blayney books - there are those other siblings I mentioned!	2005-03-02
US	52272094	R2FCD7ZFGQI25	0440151333	480929021	A Man of Her Choosing	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Pleasant; Heroine rather childlike	Linnet and Fanny Hungerford are the wards of Lord Farrington.  When he visited them, he told them to live frugally and their allowances became smaller as the year went by.  Linnet, the older sister, kept the home together.  The old servants, who had been granted pensions, stayed on out of love for the two.  I enjoyed reading of their country life.  Linnet was \\"horse mad\\" as her father had taught her his skills with them.  She was brown haired and considered herself a \\"plain brown bird.\\"  Fanny was the opposite.  She was a golden beauty like her mother, and Linnet wished her to have a season and find a husband.  <br /> <br />A fortuitous accident brought Lord Henry (Stephen) to their door.  When he finds out Lord Farrington had neglected his duties, he promised to speak to him.  Not to spoil it, but early on you find out the old Lord Farrington has died and it is Stephen who is now their guardian.  Young and autocratic, he and Linnet fight frequently when he brings them both to London to find husbands.  Although Linnet appears at times to be childlike, she does retain her own stubborn streak as Fanny and her go about among the \\"ton.\\"  I enjoyed all the secondary characters that are introduced, and the descriptions of all the normal Regency sites (Hyde Park, Almacks, Prinny...).   <br /> <br />Will each find their love, a man of their own choosing?  Will Linnet find her \\"exceptional man\\" as \\"Aunt\\" Templeton insists will happen?  Fanny is a very malleable character but sweet.  I did get a little tired of Linnet's insistence (many many times) of being a little brown bird (ok we got it the first 4 times!) which of course we know she is not.  These Candlelight Regency novels are very pleasant and suitable for a young girl also since they are G rated.   <br />	2005-02-20
US	52272094	R2Z7F8IQ6SKZRL	0373311761	421006746	Kenton's Countess (Harlequin Regency Romance #76)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Interesting	There is some intrigue in this storyline barely mentioned on the back cover.  Normally I don't enjoy the tenseness of smuggling, spying, etc... which you do find in many Regency novels.  In this case, it was subtle and a welcome addition to this pleasant tale.  It was a typical Regency in many ways.  Claire has fallen in love with a dashing Major and him with her.  But in the opening pages, we realize that Claire has caught the eye of a wealthy Earl and he seeks her hand.  Her family needs the marriage settlement and Nicholas Shea tells Claire he is not looking for any affection so Claire accepts his proposal.  But the Earl catches Claire on an assignation to say good-bye to Major Robert West and the marriage begins on shaky ground.   <br /> <br />What makes it even more interesting is that Nicolas and Robert become part of the intrigue I mentioned.  How will this all end?  Will Nicolas win Claire's heart or will she continue to pine for Robert?  Will Nicolas come to terms with his real feelings for Claire?  Can she accept the intimacy of marriage and give him the heir he desires?  <br /> <br />Pleasant, if not soul stirring reading.  There are the beginnings of other romances within the pages.  I'm not sure if they have their own books or if we are left to imagine the future for the secondary characters.  I liked that the Major, who might have been a villain turns out not to be and that Claire (the heroine) is allowed to have feelings for another without dire consequences.   <br />	2005-02-13
US	52272094	R3H587D6ZSAX7L	0373312075	722226070	Improper Duenna	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Wow!  Not Standard Regency Fare!	This book was languishing on my bookshelf and I was not sure why I had originally purchased it but the previous review induced me to read it.  The back cover does not describe the tempest that is contained within the pages.   <br /> <br />Sir Patrick is portrayed as a rather devil may care gentleman in pursuit of married women and a slight interest in marrying to produce an heir.  That is of course the normal fare of a Regency novel.  But we are privy to much of his thoughts and feelings and we are drawn into his psyche and understand why he became self-serving. <br /> <br />Chloe Transome, our poor relation, is such a wonderful character.  She has true backbone though she must hide much of her sparkle to keep her position.  She has been shunted from various positions and now finds herself in charge of her cousin's daughter.  Her life is rather wretched and deteriorates even lower towards the end of her employment with her cousin. <br /> <br />The cousin, Lady Marchingham, is one nasty woman, jealous and spiteful.  She wants her cake and eat it too and thinks she has pulled the wool over her rather staid husband Charles.  She has numerous affairs, Sir Patrick being her latest interest.  She invites him to her country home and as a cover he \\"courts\\" Marianne, Chloe's charge. <br /> <br />But as Charles (who turns out to be one of the best secondary characters I ever read about!) thwarts his wife's plans to continue her affair with Sir Patrick, there is a definite twist when Sir Patrick realizes the charm that Chloe holds close.  Lord Marchingham even helps the romance between Patrick and Chloe along.   There were mild sensual interludes that one usually does not find in normal Regency novels but I found very tasteful and pertinent to the storyline. <br /> <br />I will not go into the details of the story - you must read it - but I found it heart stopping with each turn of events.  There is elation and depths of despair.  Many wonderful secondary characters and thereis more than one villain though some are wretched and pitiful indeed!  This is full of angst and is not light-hearted at all.  You will be kept wondering how a happy ending can be obtained - but as usual, it is.  Great reading - obtain this book!  <br />	2005-02-12
US	52272094	RMZUL12DHEUJI	0671410059	357639564	REGENCY BELLES	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Charming	I enjoyed this tender Regency tale.  It was very unusual.  The main and secondary characters were a pleasure to get to know.  The villain was our heroine's own mother! <br /> <br />Anne Farnham was a little wood sprite - free to wander the surrounding countryside when her domineering mother was off visiting friends but totally bullied when her mother was home.  Mrs. Farnham resented her sweet and beautiful daughter and denied her any outside contact.  Working Anne like a drudge, even their maid was unkind to her.  (We find out why and that is resolved early on).  Anne comes to the attention of the Duke of Charlesworth due to interference from the Duchess of Crawley, his aunt, a rather eccentric woman, who sends him to escort the reticent Anne to her home in Dorsey. <br /> <br />Charlesworth finds Anne very dull indeed and she is soon forgotten as he hosts a hunt near Dorsey.  But his friend Brandon Russell spies a more animated Anne as she sets about gardening and looking at wildlife with some young friends from a nearby farm.  Russell's description of Anne leads the Duke to look for her also among the wildlife also.  There are various adventures and scrapes and the Duke is always there to lend a helpful hand. <br /> <br />But who will win her heart?  Is Brandon Russell leading on two women?  For there is another wonderful young lady who comes to visit the hunting lodge - Miss Evalina Pride.  Will she be friend or foe to Anne?  Is Charlesworth as cold and remote as he appears?  There were many other wonderful people in this book and you will enjoy the set down to Anne's mother.  I liked that this tale was rather pleasant with much tension surrounding the romance.  The men were very gentlemanly which also was an enjoyable change from more intense historical novels.   <br /> <br />Great afternoon read; pick up a copy and find out what happens!    <br />	2005-02-10

Eighty year old Lady Elizabeth Bournard tries her hands at matchmaking with unusual results. The romances she engineers (even one for her companion) are all wonderful but not exactly what she was expecting. There is much soul searching and actually some heartbreak involving the couples invited for a winter holiday.  <br /> <br />We are kept guessing what poor Beatrice Copland (Lady Bournard's companion) has done to make her skittish around the handsome Sir David Chappell. She somehow knew him during her \\"season\\" twenty years before and the mystery is not revealed for quite a while. I loved that Beatrice and David were older than the normal Regency couple. A nice touch that Donna Simpson has done in other books.  <br /> <br />The other characters are equally delightful. I really enjoyed the \\"colonial\\" (Canadian) Verity. What an unusual woman! And Lady Bournard is wonderful too despite her crotchety ways.  <br />The story lagged at some points. I just wanted everyone to resolve their disagreements and find the love they deserved. Eventually the proper happy ending was obtained - not a light hearted Christmas tale but definitely worth reading. <br />	2005-02-06
US	52272094	R2R428OIX3J52K	0451139135	979265868	Your Obedient Servant	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Unusual; Dramatic from beginning to end	Not the usual Regency fare, this book had an interesting array of characters.  The secondary characters had as much importance as the main ones!  Laura Adams, abandoned at birth and raised as a farmer's daughter was a hard worker with good sense.  When her adoptive mother died and her adoptive father became feeble, Laura was taken in by Lady Danville (a widow).  Although Laura performed some minor duties (sewing), Lady Danville sought to give her an education.  That stopped when Lord Danville pressed her to work in the parlor and companion his mother.  He was not impressed by Laura and had a feeling that she was not as wonderful as his mother made her out to be.  His regard was unfairly based on disparaging innuendo and gossip.      But many events occur to both raise Lord Danville's estimation of Laura and yet dash her own hopes for bettering herself.  Laura who in the years of this book becomes a lovely, yet modest woman is treated with jealousy by some servants and high-born ladies.  She also is pursued relentlessly by scoundrels she meets at a neighbor's house.    It was truly hard to guess how this would end.  There was mystery, death, abduction and redemption all between the pages of this novel.  It was a very interesting portrayal of life below stairs which is not fully explored in other books.  I found this thoroughly enjoyable reading.  I see only one other book written by this author and I will be sure to check it out.	2005-02-05

Pretty standard theme - marriage of convenience between an older (more worldly) man and a young country miss.  <br />Robert and Rebecca are very mismatched.  She somehow keeps getting into scrapes and he is never pleased with her.  Very much an alpha male character.  Early in the book, Robert punishes her disobedience by spanking her.  It is more humiliating than abusive and since he constantly tells her she is nothing but a schoolroom miss, I chose to ignore it and enjoyed the rest of the book. <br /> <br />Both characters grow during the course of the book and we see Robert falling in love and not wanting to.  We also get to see Robert in a different light and find he is not the monster Rebecca believes him to be.  I liked the secondary characters including Robert's brother.  I also liked that Rebecca rides like she was born on a horse and does not completely lose her mischievous ways.  <br /> <br />Pleasant but dated (70ish) reading. <br />	2005-02-03

As you will read much of the plot in others reviews, I will not re-hash it again.  There were so many good scenes in this novel, the best being the times spent with the other wallflowers.  Yes, like other reviewers I found the romance rather lukewarm until the end.  Not that there wasn't the usual Kleypas sizzling episodes between Simon and Annabelle but they kept their feelings well under wraps.  I totally understood Annabelle marrying for money - as she had NONE left so that even her mother took to \\"sleeping with the enemy\\" so to say.  I was not sure why Simon waited so long for Annabelle considering the snubs she gave him for years.  But I feel the main characters grew during the book and in the end, I was satisfied.  The developing secondary characters - the wallflowers, Annabelle's mother and brother, and the assorted bachelors were all wonderful to meet.  I look forward to the other books.   <br /> <br />My favorite quote is near the end of the book after Annabelle and Simon are almost killed in a foundry fire. Annabelle says to Simon -- \\"I realized something ...I would rather have died in your arms, Simon, then face a lifetime without you.\\" <br /> <br />Perhaps this is not quite as soul stirring as other Kleypas books but I would not have missed it.	2005-01-31
US	52272094	R3CBYGMHGYLDES	0440107350	850046225	BAD BARONS DAUGHTER	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Different; mismatched couple	The hero in this book was very different from the usual Regency genre male.  In fact, Lesley Byrne, Lord Linden was a true rake.  Women, gambling, etc... and all played before you in his actions and words.  He held nothing back, rather nasty and disrespectful, and had a violent temper.  I never warmed to him very much. <br /> <br />Our heroine is much like a Barbara Cartland novel, innocent beyond belief.  As others stated, Kate lived independently in the country and talked about reading a lot but seemed to have no common sense.  Written in the late 70's, I did not find this portrayal of Kate that annoying. <br /> <br />Other characters in the book were unusual too, starting with Kate's \\"friend\\" Zack who was the son of her father's mistress.  He was realistically described and eager to rid himself of Kate and solve her problems by \\"selling\\" her to a protector.  Kate's father (our \\"bad\\" Baron) did turn out to be disappointing after all but we are given so many indications of his bad moral character, it should not be a surprise.  I enjoyed reading about Lesley's grandmother, brother Andrew and cousin Suzanne.  Not enough room in the book to expand their roles but I would have liked to find out more about them. <br /> <br />All in all, though the couple was mismatched, I enjoyed the portions when Lord Linden finds himself falling in love and does some little touching things that pulled me to his side.  Kate, with her rather shallow but downtrodden persona, also has some good points.  There are some nasty villains which come to a violent end.  The storyline kept me riveted just to see how it all would turn out.  Rather different.      <br />	2005-01-24
US	52272094	R175MP1LSRIXES	0263831493	171725903	Gifford's Lady (Mills & Boon Historical)	Books	3	6	6	N	Y	OK; Heroine too Changeable	<br />I am not sure why I wanted this book so much.  I must have read a review or plot synopsis somewhere else.  While I have paid dearly for many out of print books I wanted (Mary Balogh's in particular) and felt them worth every penny, this one was not worth the rather steep used price it is offered at.  <br /> <br />What I liked:  the premise is actually interesting; a shy companion (Abigail) meets a daring sea captain Sir Gifford Raven (newly inherited a baronetcy).  One hot summer night Abigail sees Gifford leap naked from his bed in the throes of a nightmare from her window across from where he was staying.  She is intrigued and a little excited by what she saw.  Gifford had noticed her that hot summer night and he was embarrassed that she saw his weakness.  As most of the book takes place in Bath, they are introduced in the Pump Room the next day by her old friend Admiral Pullen.  It leads to a quick confession by Abigail about how brave he was to face his nightmares and some rather lurid fantasies by Gifford about what she might be like under that demure nightgown that he had seen her in.  I liked the flow as each got to know the other.  We are offered glimpses of Gifford's sea life, especially the time which causes the nightmares.  He had lost an eye in one sea adventure and wears an eye-patch.  (The references to pirates got tiresome.)   <br /> <br />Then the book changes.  Miss Wyndham (Abigail's employer) dies and at first I thought there was a little murder mystery involved but there was not.  The will is read and we find out that there is no money left for her grand-nephew Charles Johnson (our smarmy villain) who has been staving off creditors with stories of his Aunt's jewels.  Abigail is left dresses and a pianoforte.  She arranges jobs for the older staff and begins to think of her own future.  Charles, up to no good, abducts Abigail and sells her as a \\"bride.\\"  Of course our good Captain saves her - but then the mood and the heroine changes. <br /> <br />What I did not like:  The remainder of the book is the trip to London after Gifford saves Abigail.  I enjoyed most of the interaction and intimacy but Abigail turned into a rather bold woman saying and doing totally inappropriate things.  She had been a companion in Bath for over 9 years and would have understood how to maintain rigid propriety.  In one instance, she walked outside an inn in only a sheet!  I never felt close to either the Captain or Abigail.  There was a lot of misunderstandings and confusing behavior.  I found Anthony, the cousin, a more interesting character but little of the secondary characters are made known.  <br /> <br />In the end, I liked the book - descriptions of Bath and sea adventures were different than usual but the changeable heroine was not very believable.    <br />	2004-11-23

There is our hero, Rand Noble, tall & gorgeous - a doctor no less - who apparently still harbors love for his dead wife Ellie.  He agrees to an arranged marriage to Clementine Calhoun, his father's friend's daughter.  Clementine travels from Texas to Baltimore, Maryland to honor her deceased father's arrangement.  She is tall and lacking in feminine charm.  Her brother wants her out of the way since no man in Texas seems to want her.  The book opens on the wedding ... each participant harboring thoughts of their intentions.  Rand wants a son and Clementine wants to gain Rand's love.  Will each attain that goal? <br /> <br />The storyline had some fresh elements.  I enjoyed the medical intricacies and the shipyard descriptions.  The locale changes from cool northeastern weather to warm tropical-like conditions in Key West.  Also trying to banish the ghost of Ellie (Rand's first wife) was done in an interesting way by the introduction of Ruby (a widowed, single-mother, Medium!).  I enjoyed her story and that of Rand's rake of a father Johnathan immensely.  (Actually their story was more intriguing than the main romance!) <br /> <br />I did not like that Clementine lost her Texas ways so rapidly.  She used to \\"wear chaps, play poker and eat two helpings at every meal\\" and within a short amount of time she was suddenly the belle of every ball and had lost her accent - besides being unbelievable, I thought it compromised her character.  Otherwise, much of the book was pleasant and enjoyable reading for a quick joyous Christmas pick-me-up.    <br />	2004-11-12

He is a recovering alcoholic, has an illegitimate daughter, unrequited (past) love and a growing fondness for his reticent governess. The governess, Miss Elaine Deering, has already avoided the groping of a former employer and is not about to work for another rogue with a bad reputation. But her love for Valentine's daughter, Felicity, keeps her attached to both as they (and Wharton's housekeeper) go on holiday to Wales.  <br /> <br />The conversations, filled with innuendo and information give us a complete picture of both Valentine and Elaine (\\"my Deering\\" as Wharton calls her) and sometimes the picture is not pretty. I came to care deeply for both as their love for each other grows. The other characters are well portrayed and all add wonderful dimension to the story. The reasons I did not give this a 5 was the abrupt (though thought provoking) ending and the general uneasy feeling that I still had when I had finished. <br />	2004-10-06

Most storylines do not lend themselves to a compressed format and many times I want more. I was pleasantly surprised with these three stories. The heroes were typical but the heroines were all special in that they were not the characteristic beautiful, vacuous, spineless women that romance novels excel in.  <br /> <br />My favorite of the three was \\"Midsummer's Knight\\" by Kinley MacGregor.  I had just recently completed \\"Master of Desire\\" and longed to see what happened to Draven's brother Simon. The storyline was entertaining because of the misunderstanding Simon's letter writing caused. Kenna was a charming woman and did not match the perfect mold most romantic heroines adhere to. But her capacity to love even a landless knight offset any physical flaws. I was on the edge of my seat to see how this could end happily and even the short format did not rush the ending any. Loved it and have now ordered Stryder's story!  <br /> <br />The Lesa Kleypas story was also good. I enjoyed catching up with Dr. Linley who is in other Kleypas books. But you did not have to read any of the other books to follow the storyline of unrequited love on the part of Dr. Linley and realize he was a better choice of husband for Lydia than the passionless Lord Wray. I enjoyed Lydia's analytical/mathematical mind! I always enjoy Kleypas' clever conversations and sensual love scenes. Reading this led me to find Lydia's parents story ... and the prequel to that also!  <br /> <br />The last story by Julia Quinn of two sisters was endearing. It seemed a little rushed compared to the other stories but I felt empathy for all the characters (almost) trapped in an unwise marriage. But Charlotte with loyalty to her (soon to be married) sister on the line, and backbone to follow through on her plans, ends up with Ned in the end.  Both sisters were interesting!  <br /> <br />A good anthology not to be missed, especially if you have met the characters in other books.<br />	2004-10-06

The heroine (Charis) was an interesting character but in some ways never fleshed out!  Charis got into a couple scrapes along the way because of her headstrong manner.... but then she just sort of went out with a whimper.  Towards the end, her liveliness was totally subdued.   She was trying to save Marcus from two conniving women and managed to amusingly turn away one woman but the other \\"saving\\" never panned out, even when Charis was injured by the nasty woman (Alicia).   Charis' sister Harriet was also fun at the beginning but her writing a book was glossed over and she just faded in the background.  The mother was a rather vague, comical (and sad) woman.   <br /> <br />I never warmed up to Marcus.  There were some unanswered questions - what was it the Earl said to Marcus after changing his will?  Why did he think Charis would only want him to gain money?  He seemed to be the one pushing her into society to catch a husband.  Telling another man her favorite foods were cabbage and pickled pigs feet and that she was romantic and would adore abduction seemed childish and dangerous to me.   <br /> <br />I normally read books in hours - this took me weeks as I put it down to read others.  I have enjoyed other Hendrickson books but this one was just a rather tame tale without a lot to recommend.      <br />	2004-10-06

I didn't think I would ever warm up to him but the sweet Honora shows him that women can be loving, intelligent and caring (and not just in bed).  The Duke was spoiled by all the adulation that men and women sent his way and meeting an unspoiled, unimpressed young woman threw him.  The villianous Aunt Ailene was an intriguing character who eventually got her due.   <br /> <br />A quick fun read.  I love to read a Cartland for a quick uplifting story.	2004-09-14

I thought it was about a \\"betrothal for convenience\\" but tried to figure what could be \\"vengeful\\" about that.  I was totally wrong!   <br /> <br />The story begins with a funeral, then a highway robbery.  A year between each and seemingly disconnected.  Those are just the events.  The people, drawn wonderfully with words, are unique.  Our heroine, Felicity Bellwood, in the beginning, is described in the usual Regency way.  She is pretty, yet tomboyish.  She is curious and yearns for what she cannot have - but that is only scratching the surface.  You find out how intelligent she is, even as she faces the world with a quiet front.  She is seething inside with emotions.  Being forced towards marriage and becoming a dutiful wife (child breeder and housekeeper!) seems to be her only alternative in life.   <br /> <br />Our hero, Justin Havilland also is hiding his emotions.  We are not sure why.  He is a war hero, friend to Felicity's brother but something is not quite right.  As you get to know him, you are kept in the dark until the bitter end.  We first meet him at the aforementioned funeral.  Does he have anything to do with the highwayman?  What does Felicity's brother who appears to have a drinking and gambling problem have to do with this?  <br /> <br />The other characters, Aunt Harriet and her daughter Georgina, Felicity's father and the associated servants are all well fleshed and very believable.  The conversations are flowing and present the story with emotion.  And we are taunted with intrigue and upheaval and romance.  Don't read ahead!  Can this tangled tale ever work out?  The depiction of the moments Felicity and Justin realize they are in love is wonderful.  <br /> <br />Great afternoon read.	2004-09-13

Charles Rycroft, wealthy publisher, wakes up next to a beautiful stranger. In the chaos that ensues, he finds out that he was robbed and left for dead and the beautiful stranger (Maeve O'Malley) found him, was compromised by him, and is now his wife. Recovery from amnesia has driven that week's memories from him.  <br /> <br />This Boston blue-blood takes his new wife back to his home on Beacon Hill. Maeve is totally unsuitable to be his wife - Irish, low-born, a servant no less - he decides the marriage will be annulled. But complications arise. Maeve does not want the marriage annulled and Charles' mother has arrived with a marriage minded young widow in tow for the holidays. Can anything more disrupt his routine? Charles sets out to show Maeve they are unsuited for each other and also tries to avoid the man-eater widow Stella.  <br /> <br />Maeve is such a wonderful heroine. True to her nature, she tries to fit in Boston society but not at the expense of losing her heritage. Charles is captivated by her vitality and begins to break from his routine, practically inviting laughter and love into his life by assisting in Maeve's orphan charity and learning how to \\"play\\" and act spontaneous. They both draw strength from each other.  <br /> <br />The secondary characters are well fleshed out and each adds interesting elements to the storyline. I enjoyed meeting friends and family and expect there may be other books based on these characters. Another theme behind the book was the recovery of a \\"St. Nick\\" drawing stolen during the robbery which has sentimental value to Charles. Maeve attempts to find the drawing and finds herself in some danger. Will they work out their differences in the end and can Charles accept Maeve into his heart?  <br /> <br />It was a little unbelievable that Maeve would be able to act the grand lady so fast - she was a little too perfect. Also, Charles seemed to give up his hard core - \\"I will do everything proper\\" persona very quickly too. There were some emotional elements to the storyline that did not pan out or touch me like they should. But I will highly recommend this for some pleasant reading with little strife and a Christmas theme. <br />	2004-09-03
US	52272094	RPSNCAMOUIZW5	0595209017	53876304	His Brother's Child	Books	3	3	3	N	N	OK; Expected a little better	<br /> <br />Although enjoyable, this book seems aimed at a young audience.  There were too many unanswered questions in my mind.  I liked the characters.  Faith Carr, a little distrustful of men and very unconfident about herself, finds she is pregnant after a one night stand.  The father of the baby (Frank Brenner) doesn't want anything to do with her and later dies in a car accident.  The father's brother, Edward Brenner steps in and offers a way to provide for the child.  Marry him, have the baby and later divorce which will allow him to support her and the child.   <br /> <br />A little far fetched in this modern world - ever heard of trust fund - but ok we want a romance with some strife.  It's just these two great characters are never fleshed out.  What really makes them tick?  The feelings are never explained in depth.  Why does Edward fall in love with her so quickly?  It would have been better to learn more about Frank - except for the fact he was \\"wild\\" and slept with Faith on a dare - we don't find much else about him.  What did he say that made her trust him and what did Edward do that made her learn to trust again?   <br /> <br />This premise works better in Regency or early American romance when it was almost imperative a woman marry for the sake of her baby.  See the recommendations above for one of each.  But for a quick read with great characters you wish you knew more about; go for it.  If expanded, I could have empathized with Faith a little more.  There was also a mystery intertwined with the romance - it was ok; nothing special.   <br />	2004-09-03

Beast is our wounded hero Gabriel Fairchild.  His love for the beauteous Cecily led him to enlist in the Royal Navy and then led to his wounding and blindness.  No one could love him now... not his family, not his Cecily and he raged against them all in his remote family home. <br /> <br />Then our Beauty, a mysterious nurse enters his life.  Miss Samantha Wickersham doggedly goads Gabriel to make something of himself for those who did not return from war.  She practically pulls the gun from his hand when doctors continued to tell him there was no hope of regaining his sight.  He listens to her stand up against his visiting family, he admires her tenacious spirit, and he works to become all he once was.   <br /> <br />Gabriel (with a little collie Sam) repays Samantha by saving her life.  Later, after a night of passion and the realization that Gabriel's sight was returning, Miss Wikersham disappears from his bed and his life.  Though desperately in love, Samantha knows she cannot stay with him.  <br /> <br />But this plot is twisted and I will not spoil it for you.  Can there be a happy ever after?  Not the typical wounded hero theme.  There is much more to this storyline.  The secondary characters from servants to family add wonderful depth and reality to this novel.  Medeiros has not disappointed me yet and this book is well worth picking up.   <br />	2004-08-16
US	52272094	R7J9RG0BLN5ZO	0451187458	725326716	The Colonel's Lady	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Pretty good; imperfect hero and heroine	I am surprised by many of the reviews of this book.  I rather liked the spoiled Regina.  Too many Regency heroines are so perfect, it makes me gag.  Instead, Regina was rich, spoiled, used to getting her own way but had the luck of falling in love with a total loser.  Richard, who ended up marrying her to save her reputation and protect his philandering brother Charles (the loser), has his own imperfections.  He distrusts most women he meets when his real enemy (and betrayer) was his own brother. <br /> <br />There were a lot of misunderstandings which made the book a little long and laborious to read through.  It also took Regina an awful long time to realize the truth about Charles but in real life it seems to take forever to admit the man you love is unworthy.  Instead, forced into an unwanted marriage with the (seemingly) cold Richard, Regina finds what an honorable man is like.   <br /> <br />I liked the secondary characters.  I loved that Regina's four brothers were so protective and I liked that Richard and Charles got a little taste of her brother's love.   <br /> <br />I always find Oliver's books interesting.  This book was different from other Regencies she has written, but I liked it and would not have missed it.	2004-08-15

It was a sad, hopeless place where she endured beatings from her father while he vigilantly protected her virtue.  The horrible gambling man had an ace up his sleeve though and kept her pure for one purpose only -- to sell her in marriage.  Well blackmail the Marquis of Stafford into marrying her!  How her father managed to choose a man that was his opposite was just luck.  Not that the marquis is happy about the marriage.  No, he abandons the child-bride (only 16) the morning after the wedding and is gone for two years.  I didn't like him much for that reason.  Verena was thrown to the wolves but made out well!  The marquis's aunt assisted in making her a diamond of the first water and she is loved and courted by many.  But can she win her husband's love?  Her loyalty to him is commendable even if Stafford didn't deserve it.  But he did take her from the squalor she called home and provided her a better life.  In the end, Stafford does come to see her as the jewel he desires and loves.  Very nice reading!	2002-08-12

Neither appeared to give a hoot about what Charlotte wanted or needed.  Darcy (Lord Arundell) appeared cold and unfeeling towards all who would try to love him.  He even brought his mistress into his own household for Charlotte to entertain!  He blatently ignored his daughter and also seemed unconcerned with business practices that preyed on young children.  Charlotte's father, Fergus Gordon, wanted a title for his daughter and marriage to the marquis was just what he wanted. She would have to live with her husband's unfaithfulness!  In the end, all was not quite what it seemed.  Even Fergus Gordon could not stand to see his daughter made a fool of.  I enjoyed all the other characters in this novel.  The daughter Pamela was nicely portrayed as she became a little less shy under the care and love of Charlotte.  This was a very dark novel with the sad lives of mill workers exposed to us more than in other novels.  I still in the end did not quite like Darcy, even though we do see another side. It came a little too late. An interesting book, but not light reading at all.	2002-08-12

George, declared a country bumpkin by the young lady his cousin was chaperoning, developed a tendre for that same young lady!  Cecily was a fun, conceited, spoiled brat - but I loved her as she began to mature by the book's end.  George also matured and though never becoming a dandy was on his way to charming the hearts of many!  Thank goodness Cecily and George found their way into each other's hearts.  It was a sweet and charming tale with plenty of well fleshed out secondary characters.  Very nice light reading with some very funny situations!  Worth reading.	2002-08-12
US	52272094	RQLBHJABBNJ4N	0449234002	903643381	Amethyst Love	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Pretty good-different	This was a very interesting story of a couple marrying due to necessity.  Valerie was left destitute by a gambling father and brother.  Malcolm lost the roll of dice and so was \\"chosen\\" to take care of her.  He was only being honorable to marry her.  This is not a sugary romance but is about a couple who matures, learns to make the best of it, and eventually realize they are better together then apart.   There were no villainess people setting out to shoot, kidnap or compromise our heroine.  Only the selfish money grubbing Lady Deidre sets out to spoil a floundering marriage.  The central couple, Malcolm and Valerie ran hot and cold throughout the book. I never thought they would end up staying together after hearing the word \\"divorce\\" used so many times!  The secondary characters added nice dimension.  The only thing lacking was a little blurb from Malcolm about it being the best roll of dice he ever lost-but that would make it the syrupy romance it is not.	2002-07-28

The characters were well fleshed out and believable.  Their reactions and solutions to problems were so real.  Jane and Matthew reacted in accordance with the constraints of the times.  She was self-sacrificing and kept her mouth shut.  He was jaded and misunderstood what he saw and heard.  Truly, this is why they didn't understand each other in the first place.  Even I couldn't figure out how it would all work out in the end.  <br />Couldn't put this one down!	2002-02-04

I loved finding out what happened to Lady May.  The focus on Etienne made the book enjoyable.  He is so patient [ok dreamy!] -- but Lady May for all her education seemed too innocent.  After all she had lived in the country and should have known a little more than she did!  Her about-face concerning men seemed a little hasty.  Her mother's about-face, completely changing her personality wrapped it all up in a neat little package (too contrived!). <br />But it still was a fun read.  If you have read the others in the series (Lord St. Claire's Angel &amp; Lady Delafont's Dilemma) you will definately want to read this.  There are updates on both the heroines from the other books.  I don't think this book would stand alone.  You possibly need to read the others to understand Lady May at all.  But since I did read them in order, it made sense.  <br />Worth reading but not as good as the others in the series.	2002-02-04
