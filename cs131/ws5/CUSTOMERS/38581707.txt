Preston & Child know how to turn a mere story into an addictive thrill. Every little detail has nuance and meaning that becomes clear as the story continues. As soon as I'd finished it, I wanted to read it again. A must for any Agent Pendergast fan, and a delightful setting for a P&C story--the wholesome cornfields of a dying small town as opposed to the Gothic creepiness and convenience of New York. Clever as hell, loads of fun, educational as well as entertaining. Brilliant, witty, and nearly exhausting as you race to the end just to find out who did it and how. Classic P&C.	2005-09-21

Again, Preston & Child manage to mingle modern day techno-thrilling action with history in this compelling tale of murder in long past and present-day New York City. Often these guys are compared to Michael Crichton, but the absence of droning technical monologues and the injection of both very dry and occasionally silly tidbits of humor seperate them from Crichton's comparatively conservative and somewhat preachy style. This is one of Agent Pendergast's better adventures with him nearly getting bested before the case is through, and allowing the reader to peek a little further into his private life and ways of thinking. Pair this with Still Life With Crows and you'll well be on your way to becoming a huge Pendergast fan and dedicated follower. From an old Ian Fleming fan to a new Preston & Child follower, let me highly recommend to you a peak inside their Cabinet Of Curiosities.	2005-09-21

Gone are the days when I'd hunt down every Gregory McDonald novel featuring laid-back, smart-alec keen observers Fletch and Flynn...after reading every one of his titles, I'm psyched to death to've found Parker's Spenser and Hawk instead. Parker's writing is very easy to follow, extremely witty, with minimal setting and description, maximum dialogue. Was the show based on this series this good? I don't recall...if so, why didn't I find these titles sooner? The good guys are immediately likeable, and the rest of the cast of characters shady enough that it's difficult to figure out who's really bad and who's just getting swept along in the corruption at a big, high-tech company where all the upper echelon are getting perks in the bedroom as well as the boardroom. This is one of the few books I've laughed out loud at while reading to myself, and more than once--but it's not really meant to be comedy. If you enjoy snappy wisecracks, German shorthaired pointers, Boston, mysteries, or any good fiction, then there's no reason for you not to fall in love with Parker's books. Well worth reading--more than once! Highly recommended.	2005-04-13

The two things that really make this story shine, which really set it apart from other effrots in this genre are the author's wry, dry sense of humor, and his attention to detail. The humor strewn liberally through the buildup of the tale is of the Hitchcockian variety and possibly neither noticed much nor really appreciated by the unwary reader. Now that you know to look for it, I hope it'll make your experience that much more pleasurable. Nykanen seems quite masterful at mixing the humor of reality with stark terror. His attention to detail is as finely tuned as that of his most twisted antagonist, famous artist of the macabre Ashley Stassler. The final bit that makes this thriller different from similar stories you think you may have read before is that it also depicts the final touches, the honing and polishing, of a sequel-in-training in the guise of a warped woman/child sent happily over her own personal edge. A fun, nicely sick story for the horror/thriller or humorous horror fan. Well worth it.	2005-04-08
US	38581707	R2P3G2LKBSMZI7	0312286449	862049541	Desert Places	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Out Of The Blue	The title may not grab you, and the cover art tells little, but skim the first few pages, and you've got to be hooked on this fast-paced, very well crafted thriller in the shock-a-minute vein of the movie Dead Calm. The chapters are brief, but each compells the reader to push on and learn more and more until you discover to your disappointment that you have suddenly reached the end. It's a tale of how different circumstances can alter twinned lives dramatically, about how close to madness any of us might be at any time, about sacrifice and selfishness, about the living nightmares which may wander unrecognized amidst us. Author Crouch adopts Stephen Crane's technique of using color to vividly describe not only the visual environment of the story, but the mood of it as well. It's a very sensual telling with descriptions for all of the senses, drawing the reader into the tale with enough horror thrown in to keep you both mesmerized and wishing you could scurry past the worst of it...like driving by a fresh and particularly gory accident. Realistic, magnetic, and deliciously agonizing, Desert Places is the kind of book that makes you remember the author's name so you'll keep seeking his newer stuff every time you go out book hunting. Probably the best horror I've read since classic Stephen King. Crouch is a masterful storyteller who writes with cinematic vision. Deeply disturbing. Leaves you looking forward to more.	2005-04-02
US	38581707	R1FPD79YI5V56E	0739438034	145619271	The Immortals: Wild Magic; Wolf Speaker; Emperor Mage; the Realms of the Gods	Books	4	13	14	N	N	A great introduction to fantasy...	After reading The Immortals, I have to admit that it's one of the better sword & sorcery style fantasy books I've ever read. The four stories in this collection are all fairly easy to follow, pretty straight-forward, good action/adventure with a touch of romance. The tedium of those fantasy authors who go to great detail to rename everything and come up with a gigantic cast of characters whose names you can never keep track of, and featuring wild creatures the average reader will have trouble imagining is blessedly missing here. Tamora keeps things much simpler with a handful of characters per story and her own spin on classic fantasy critters with only a few newcomers she describes rather well. The collection features a strong teenaged female lead who never actually feels that strong, who attempts to adjust to a new life, blossoming womanhood, and strange developing magical abilities simultaneously under the guidance of a mysterious sorcerer, the cunning King's Champion (also female), her animal friends, and a host of magical beings and gods. I would have given this book five stars, but I believe the author could use a little spit and polish on her writing style. There are several passages where things happen so quickly from the heroine's point of view, that the story jumps its track momentarily, making the reader have to go back and re-read the lines leading up to that point in order to better understand what's going on. There are also a few areas where the question of continuity comes into play. If Tamora would slow down a bit as she writes, perhaps taking the time to re-think scenarios during her rewrites, she could probably better describe a few scenes if she'd put herself in her characters' places and really imagine what's going on rather than let the writing muse sweep her along. The technical points are minor, yet noticeable, though her storylines overall are concise and just plain fun. The Immortals is enjoyable for adults as well as teens and even boys aswell as girls. It's particularly good fun for anyone who loves nature and the things which populate it, and lovers of any good fantasy tales. Worth a read and a re-read later on! Great to read aloud to someone you care about.	2005-03-28

That's exactly what State Of Fear is all about, and while those of us who read darn near anything he puts out are getting used to his, \\"A beautiful, intelligent, athletic blonde and a lawyer walk into a novel,\\" character formula, in State he really gets to the heart of the matter, informing the general public about genuine studies dealing with things which may or may not affect our environment, and thus our future. Honestly, I found some of the situations a little contrived, but believable enough for the story's flow, and then there's the author's style which while chock full of technical terms is still very easy to follow and enjoy. Far better than Sphere or Congo, though not quite so compelling as Jurassic Park, State Of Fear is a book I hope many will gravitate to just to unclog their current media-instilled beliefs in environmental issues and inspire them to make changes for the better in their lives, and thus their world, even if they seem like very small ones.  <br /> <br />One of my favorite Crichton themes is stressed in this one--you can't believe everything you hear on the news or read in a paper. \\"Don't wanna be an American idiot/One nation controlled by the media/Information age of hysteria/It's calling out to idiot America...\\" by Green Day could well be one of his theme songs. I'm delighted that he recognizes the way the news media plays with the information it feeds to us and sincerely wish all of his readers take heed to his warnings and research those things of worldly or local interest to them for themselves. The most interesting thing about State Of Fear is that he also warns us how innaccurate alleged \\"scientific\\" data can be and why. It takes an alert, aggressive figure to uncover the truth sometimes, even ifonly through fiction. Read State Of Fear. Whether you agree with Crichton's conclusions or not, even if you like the overall story or not, it is guaranteed to generate discussions which may perhaps lead to better things somehow, someway. I highly recommend it.	2005-03-06

As usual, authors Lincoln and Child have managed to throughly mix just the right amounts of research, fiction, action, and terror to produce yet another impossible book to set down. While the arcane and sophisticated trivia flies, the story is written in an easy to follow style, but I bet you still won't find yourself able to tear through it fast enough! Agent Pendergast is a character out of The X-Files meets James Bond, and busted-down NYPD cop D'Agosta is an everyman's hard-boiled delight. Pitted against a delightfully over the top villain with all sorts of harrowing challenges, the story races along in so many directions, yet ties them all in quite nicely at the end. Even if you know who did it in the conservatory with the candlestick, you still won't know exactly why or how until the end. Compelling. Great fun. And somehow, these two authors always manage to teach you about something you probably had no previous knowledge of, and will leave you eager to research some of their references further on your own. Too bad these guys don't write text books! We all would have made the heads of our classes and had a great time getting there!	2005-03-03

He has a way with words and descriptions that flows smoothly and swiftly and compellingly so that even his thickest novels are easy to tear through and enjoy. Swan Song is not one of his better works, however, standing above his not quite satisfying Stinger, yet quite a ways below his fantastic The Wolf's Hour. There are some technical aspects which don't quite mesh and the sudden, startling leap ahead in time seven years, and the whole thing is rather predictable in many ways, yet McCammon just has that knack for grabbing a reader's attention and holding on tight until the very end. I found Swan Song enjoyable enough, though perhaps it could have matured a little further in the author's mind before he released it. Worth a read. A decent time killer. Thought provoking.	2005-02-25

The pace is fast and smooth, with everything tying in together rather nicely for an efficient overall story package. I was a tad put off by a male author writing from a female character's point of view, but it works nonetheless for the most part. The suspense is taut, the action very visual, the emotions of the characters fairly real. A good little read. I'll happily seek more works by this author based on this first tale of his I've been granted the good fortune to read. Nicely done.	2005-02-25

The first time I saw the book, I grimaced and considered looking into it another time...the second time I saw it, it was mine. The title and cover haunted me (so to speak). The book proves far more fascinating than I could have imagined, complete with trivia, history, and modern day options for those of us who contemplate what should become of our remains after death. Even the most grisly ideas don't seem too bad after Mary explains the pros and cons, always reminding us that the body is not the sum of the life but a recyclable bit with the potential to save the lives of others, nourish a tree, give practice to up and coming surgeons, inspire safety innovations, or become functional art. I highly recommend this offbeat delight to anyone who finds death interesting or who just wants to check out every option before they check out. Occasionally gross, but I'd find it hard to believe if anyone found this book offensive. Thanks for all your research, Mary. Hope you aren't still dreaming of bodies or body parts!	2004-12-23

I was handed this book without ever having picked up another in the ongoing series and was extremely pleased I was very able to follow the story without having read any of the preceding tales. The action is somewhat cliche with standard fantasy derring-do and evil vs. good and what have you, the magic portions are okay, the creatures are all rather typical and known to us, but what made this book really hold my attention was the delightful use of humor sprinkled liberally throughout the book--especially surrounding the Solamnic knight Gerard and the naively annoying \\"kender\\" Burrfoot Tasslehoff. There is a heightened sense of sword and sorcery here that brings a cinematic edge to the tale, but I must admit I was a little lost in the big battle between a Joan-of-Arc type lost soul and a gigantic fire-breathing dragon. The girl's weapon is described a being hardly the length of one of the dragon's claws, yet a teen girl is somehow able to not only pierce what we imagine must be nearly inpenetrable hide with it but also manage to find the dragon's heart and pierce that too... Ah, well...she did have a little divine help in the effort. Aside from that I found the story quite well told and capitivating and will have no hesitation when confronted with another Weis/Hickman title. Good job overall!	2004-11-25

This is the kind of book I'd have fallen in love with as a child, but am just as delighted to discover as an adult! Something more substantial than Edward Eager's tales of children playing with magic, yet delightfully not quite so involved as Rowling's Harry Potter, The Chrestomanci Quartet, while full of magical and mythological cliches, comes across as refreshing and fun. Decent enough for younger readers, clever enough for adults, the four stories contained within were a great delight to explore. My only complaint is that the title character will not show up for me when I chant his name, but perhaps I must concentrate a little harder and steal a pinch of my wife's dragon's blood ink to make the darn thing work. Does it merely sound like I'm trying to be a cheeky writer when I emphatically insist this book is enchanting? Too bad, 'cause it is.

I enjoyed the way the film left the decision as to whom main character prot really was to the viewer, so I was hesitant to purchase this second book in the trilogy. On A Beam Of Light proved a delight to tear through not only because you get to learn more about and hear more from our newest favorite alien character, but because of the ease with which the story was written, with a quick-paced style that leaves nothing out. It's great to peruse something \\"clinical\\" or technical without the author bogging the story down with pages of explanations of terms and procedures as though he or she thinks his reader is some kind of idiot. Brewer's psyche ward seems more pleasant a place to hang out and meet people than anyplace public these days, or as hero prot points out...perhaps the people within the building should be set free and everyone not undergoing constant psychiatric evaluation should be housed within.  <br /> <br />It's been a delight to hang with prot again, and I look forward to the third installment. I gave this book only four out of five stars, because I fully expect the next book the author pens to somehow be even better. <br /> <br />A great, fast read. Does well even if you never read the first book (though it makes you want to go back and get it). Highly addictive stuff.	2004-09-11

Steve Alten took it up a notch with his action-packed thrillers featuring thought-to-be-extinct megalodons. James Powlik brings the newest aquatic threat to frighten us down to microscopic proportions with no less terror or thrills. With a writing style reminiscent of Michael Crichton (but thankfully less droning with the scientific details), Mr. Powlik deserves his spot amidst the big-boys of fictional techno-thrillers. Sea Change has enough science to make it believeable, enough emotion to make it real, and enough non-stop action to make the story big-screen worthy. More intriguing than preachy, this fiction makes a great read that's hard to put down. I'd tell ya it's a great beach read, except you wouldn't want to linger near any coastlines with this title in hand! I only give it four out of five stars merely because it's Powlik's first jump out of the gate and I strongly suspect his works will only get better while Amazon will still only offer a maximum five stars. A thoughtful, exciting read. Well worth it!	2004-08-18

It's educational, it's funny, it's heartwrenching, it's all too real. Mainly trailing the exploits and adventures of specific families through various generations, we are able to follow the progression of this oft' overlooked and misunderstood chunk of the world from drifting tectonic plate to eventual statehood and beyond. The characters are warm, but the landscape can be cold and threatening. A delight from cover to cover. My only wish is that there had been more adventures on the sea included as I thrilled along with in Chesapeake. Regardless, a smashing tale.

In this story, not only are we again racing along with nervous wreck hero Jonas after another megalodon, but there are even more mega-monsters of the deep along for the ride! There's an evil megalomaniac with ties to terrorism, a bewitching evil beauty, a hapless heroine in peril, a good-buddy sidekick, plenty of twists and turns like a freshly hooked marlin, and just plain good, scary, occasionally blackly humorous fun!

It's a little more fantasy than sci-fi, but the science it utilizes, while often a bit vague, is not so terribly far-fetched in many instances. Mainly, Abduction is a story about a mixed group of professionals who inadvertantly become a part of a fantastic utopia and how they deal with it. What if heaven existed on Earth, and you could visit it anytime...just not ever return to the life you knew before? It seems worth adapting to for a single oceanographer, worth exploiting for a pair of good-ole-boy divers, worth exposing to the president of a large ocean drilling company, but only worth escaping for a former Marine who believes he has the best interests at heart for the mismatched crew he tries to make himself unofficial leader of.<BR>The tale is mostly build-up, the ending difficult to guess ahead of time, and the whole thing a light, easy read. It left me wishing Cook had spent more time developing relationships between the characters and describing more of the wonders of the futuristic world called Interterra, but was genuinely entertaining nonetheless. I hope to discover a more in-depth sci-fi story by this talented author sometime in the near future. This one wasn't a bad one to begin with.	2004-03-26

Cadillac Beach is as brilliantly wild and insane as it's lead character, the frighteningly too hard to contain Serge Storms. Yes, it does jump around through time, but if you have trouble following the storyline because of this, then this book is way beyond your mental capabilities and should be set down slowly, gently...thatta boy, now walk away from the smart and funny novel. Don't look back. Go buy yourself a nice comic book. I once followed the Fletch and Flynn series by Gregory McDonald religiously, but I'm now glad to have graduated to the grander, zanier, bloodier stories of Tim Dorsey. Can't you just see Billy Bob Thorton pulling off Serge so well in the too-short, not-as-good-as-the-book but still wildly popular movies? That should give you some idea of what you're getting into if you haven't read any of Tim's books yet. Dark, manic, goofy-ass adult fun!

US	38581707	R3W28CWNDKD6XG	0970698941	3015896	I, Vampire	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Breed Apart	I, Vampire is quite different from author Shuster's other published tales in that it is not lighthearted by any means. It took me a while to find something to properly compare it to, and if you've read Chet Raymo's Dork Of Cork, then you'll understand the very sort of gritty realism, no holds barred, that Shuster infuses this story with. Set in modern days, it tells the time-spanning yet all too brief story of Jacob, born into the clan of wampyre, who lost his first and only true love, then really found little reason to go on after that. There are similarities to other vampire stories you've read, but there is also considerable imaginative license with the basic legend, too. There are no truly seductive scenes, no vampires acting as vigilantes or heroes of any kind...it's mainly just as close to true-to-life as an author could probably take the idea, treating the creatures as little more than an offshoot of the human norm like another race or group aside from what we consider standard because of their differences. Not a feel-good novel, but more like a study of a dying, once-proud breed. I, Vampire stands on the outskirts of all current vampire fiction, not quite like any other genre piece you may have read before.	2004-02-21

His stories held a wit which came from the mundane observations of everyday life. Jeff Strand has managed to combine the best horror elements of early (not too early) classic King with the gently goofy humor of Christopher Moore and sharper, more twisted wit of fellow Florida author Tim Dorsey. Mandibles weaves the stories of a handful of hapless everyday folk (plus two psychopaths and an unfortunate entemologist) caught in the midst of a mad scientific experiment gone awry one otherwise run of the mill summer day in Tampa. As our heroes get wittled down to a meagre few (plus two psychopaths and an entemologist), beaten, battered, bruised, and bloody, they finally come together at what they think is the nexus of their giant ant problem when Strand turns up the heat and whips everything up into a frothy bug-filled nightmare! A shade darker than his Andrew Mayhem series, the laughs still come quick in this entertaining, near cinematic-like romp. Try not to get too attached to your favorite characters--you never know who's gonna get bumped off next! Bizarre, creepy, witty fun. Strand delivers more bang for the buck than many other authors. I have yet to read a book of his I haven't liked.	2004-01-31

It is the best example of my favorite genre, humorous horror, that I've ever found in print or on screen. The story is silly, yet the realistic dialogue and reactions of the characters to the various horrifyingly absurd situations which arise really bring it home and make it work. Follow likeable loser Andrew Mayhem and his equally bland, yet charming buddy, Roger, as they seek the clues behind an insidious snuff-film business so they can stop the murders of many more innocent victims before they themselves lose their own lives or limbs or beauty--it pretty much all gets threatened here. Strand tells stories at a fast and funny rollercoaster pace with an equal number of squeals of terror and delight. Highly recommended!	2003-11-14

Everyone thinks they have some grill expertise, but this book will guarantee it. It's the only cookbook I've ever used in which every single recipe I've tried so far has come out exactly as described. My only complaint is the lack of recipes for fowl, but what an excuse to enjoy succulent cuts of marinated and spice-encrusted beef, tender and savory pork, the elegant richness of well prepared venison. In this age of high-protein diets and healthier grilled foods, this book is outstanding and invaluable. It discusses various types of grills and fuels, describes numerous cuts of fresh meats, and even recommends complimentary side dishes and beverages. I simply know of no better guide for anyone who relishes the primal art of grill cooking. Extraordinary!	2003-11-13

This, by far, is one of the better collections of short works by various authors I've picked up in a very long time! It covers a range of genres, settings, and times to bring you intriguing tales of backstabbers at their best. Most of the stories are exceptional, a few thought-provoking, some are funny, some surreal, some darkly morbid. It should leave you wanting not only a second book of Treachery &amp; Treason, but also seeking more of the works of the talented authors inside--exactly what a book like this is meant to do. Congratulations on a job well done!	2003-11-12

Knights Of The Morningstar probably would not have made a good teleplay for the Quantum Leap series. The action which takes place between the characters in the time main character Sam leaps into is not terribly well developed and is overall a bit silly. The magic of this story is the stuff that goes on back at the secret lab Sam's been trying so hard to return to. The author is far better at writing emotions and empathy than a great storyline in this particular instance, but she is very good at making the reader feel for the gang behind the scenes at Project Quantum Leap. The whole bit with the second Leaper could have been eliminated, or perhaps been created more integral to the basic plot. It's an enjoyable read, but unlike any other Leap book I've read so far. Thought-provoking and emotional.	2003-11-08

Before writing this review I read a few of the others and I must agree with both those who find Dirk Pitt's adventures fantastic and those who find them lame. Cussler certainly enjoys showing off his knowledge of many different topics, and it's his attention to detail that helps carry his stories along and make them seem so realistic. His hero, alas, is so darned perfect he's nauseating--yet I like him. Shock Wave is the second Pitt book I've read. I had to read a second one before I reviewed the first one just to make sure Cussler really does write the way he does all the time. Despite the over-the-top Roger Moore era James Bond-like escapades, the, &quot;Yeah, right...,&quot; action, the overly dramatic and tragic supermodel heroines, and the needlessly over described machines, vehicles, even clothing...I still like these books. Shock Wave can't be one of the better titles in this series simply because it stretches belieavability way too thin, yet it's still fun. Once you've picked up a Pitt book, if you like it, you'll pretty much know what sort of stuff to expect from Clive from then on. He doesn't disappoint in that respect with his wry humor and undefeatable almost Olympian band of NUMA heroes. Don't let the bad reviews deterr you. Make up your own mind. Just don't start with Shock Wave unless you're like twelve...enjoy it later after you've discovered what silly fun high-adventure can be. This stuff's for lovers of James Bond films, Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, and nearly any other over-the-top action and fast romance tales. Relax, chuckle, and let it wash over you like gentle waves. Cussler is almost more entertainer than mere storyteller.	2003-10-29

If you enjoy the works of Christopher Moore (and if you've read any of them, you do), then you should undoubtedly find Lamb just as hearty and satisfying as any of his other titles. If you're just looking for a pseudo-religious book to vent over because you assume anything fictional relating to the stories in the Bible is blasphemous, you can vent over this one, but you may look rather foolish doing it. Lamb is harmless to everyone but the frighteningly fanatical, and they shouldn't be reading this stuff anyway (bad for the blood pressure). Raised Catholic, I found this title warm, hilarious, quite realistic in many places, and heartbreaking toward the end. It's basically somebody's version of the life of Christ from age six on up, and doesn't everybody have their very own interpretation of Christ's life anyway? Each of us must find our own paths to the Light, or in this case, the Lighthearted. It would be good to have been Biff, Christ's childhood pal, to get to see and hear everything around Him, get to know the real Him. Moore does a toprate job, and I envy him for being there--if in (slightly overactive)imagination only. What an undertaking and what a result! However, if you're not sure you'd enjoy this title, read Practical Demonkeeping first. If you enjoy that, you'll love Lamb. And rice. Just three grains...that's all you'll need to get started...	2003-09-28

I actually had to begin reading a second book in the series to make sure he really intended to write the way he does. Atlantis Found is a little Indiana Jones, a little James Bond (Roger Moore days) and a bit of a spoof on both of them. Let's see, greedy rich people don't care if what they do to further their own dreams causes chaos on a global level, so government employed adventurer Dirk Pitt shows up in the nick of time to save the day with wit and uncanny reflexes and endless knowledge of how to survive almost anything. How many other titles are this same story line? Who cares? Despite putting himself in each story like Hitchcock popping up in his own films, I'm starting to find Cussler almost annoyingly likeable and his fast-reading tales wryly enjoyable. You may roll your eyes and say, \\"Nuh-uh!\\" a lot, but once you've read Clive's opaline green-eyed alter ego and his exploits, I'd be surprised if you didn't find yourself hooked, too. Atlantis Found is well crafted, intriguing, and just plain fun. <BR>...	2003-09-18

There's something lacking to this still intriguing tale of a monster gone haywire--even scaring the sharks away! Benchley spends a lot of time building up the scenarios--only giving you quick glimpses of the murky menace as it kills and kills, throwing tempting morsels of info about the heroes without offering a whole package...chumming for readers, I suppose. The main problem I had was that it was simply too short. It was as if the author had something else he'd rather be working on, so he quickly cut his line and tied the whole thing off. For all its cinematic buildup, the big dispatch-with-the-monster scene came too soon and wasn't satiating enough. Not bad, a good, quick, page-turner, but it could've been longer and better.	2003-08-06

Pat Everest's second book in her Andova Alliance series continues the adventures of the predicted savior of all mankind, the unlikely, yet fitting heroine, single mother of three, former paramedic, Erin. She's a plain and simple Earth girl with a keen desire to protect her children as well as help those around her in any way she can who learns (to her amazement) she can develop formidable psychic abilities which will allegedly help her in the defeat of a terrible menace wiping out entire planet populations throughout the galaxy. Pat writes in a very relaxed, easygoing style, delivering likeable characters in a light sci-fi setting. The emphasis here is less on ray guns and bold, fearless champions and more on internal battles, emotions, and making difficult choices in dire times. It's a lighter, friendlier sci-fi perfect for younger readers or those uninterested in the genre because they don't care to memorize scads of made-up alien words and names or plow through thick paragraphs chocked with technical nonsense. A nice alternative to lasers and insectile terrors, amazingly lucky derring-do, or other standby, cliched science fiction plot points.	2003-07-10

Plenty of entertainment plus a little education makes this a nice read for Michael Crichton or Clive Cussler fans.

This is a pretty good argument for judging a book by its cover. While the scantily clad chick with the freaky weapon is not to be found anywhere within the pages of The 13 Colonies, you will find instead crooked interplanetary real estate agents, true corn-nuts, the cataclysm of Earth as witnessed from the comfort of your luxury suite on the moon, a leader willing to sacrifice everything for his people, a planet where all of your fantasies and nightmares may come true...and much more. If Shuster's Sevenacide is akin to Tales From The Crypt, then The 13 Colonies is definitely Twilight Zone or even original Star Trek style material. His writing is short and sweet (like a fried maggot, as my grandmother used to say!) with a nasty little twist at the end of most of the tales. Entertaining light reading in a \\"What If-\\" style, perfect for sci-fi bedtime stories, clean enough for some younger readers just beginning to discover sci-fi, and over all a pleasant little reading experience. Makes you think--gotta love that!	2003-06-02

Shuster was telling people at the convention we attended, &quot;You don't have to know anything about rugby to enjoy it,&quot; and he wasn't just trying to sell his book. Let's say you're flipping channels one night and you discover a Tales From The Crypt marathon with a rugby theme. Intriguing, huh? That's pretty much what Sevanacide is--a sometimes surprising, sometimes disturbing, slightly tongue-in-cheek collection of seven Crypt-ish tales more entertaining than mere warnings not to bother with things you don't understand. It's a quick read done in a light, easy style. Shuster sets up the scenario, then gets to the point right away. I could easily see each of these stories as short films, part of a miniseries, or collected into one big filmed production. Don't despair if your knowledge of rugby goes no further than how to spell it--Sevenacide is a nice little collection perfect for a spooky beach read, road trip, or as a gift for that rugby player or fan.	2003-06-02

I grew up on Ian Fleming's Bond, and while Thomas writes nothing like Fleming and Patrick Hyde is no James Bond, I have found my fast-paced espionage-based fix with Thomas and enjoy all of his works. <BR>The Last Raven moves slowly at times, but it's easy to get caught up in the author's generous descriptions of events, detailing the most minute bits of a room perhaps, or a character's nervous movements to the point his works really play out in your mind like a film. The story was not written to merely explain a fictional circumstance, but to guide you rather realistically through the dangers and horrors a man may face in order to save himself and protect his country. Patrick Hyde is a very believeable man too close to the edge, and when hunted by CIA agents, you sometimes wonder if he's already toppled over it. Because Thomas continually updates his readers with what other major characters may be up to in other parts of the world, it's sometimes tempting to skip through and read only those paragraphs pertaining to Hyde or to his boss, Kenneth Aubrey, but even the duller bits help add up the whole, and the book flows along like a mountain stream--with swirls and eddies and exciting white water all leading to the harrowing conclusion. Realistic, intricate, detailed storytelling for true spy-story fans.	2003-05-21

I found Prey extremely hard to set down, though it was plain to see where some of the intricacies were heading...some of them. The book starts off a little bland, like the hero himself, but once it gets moving the action is fast and nerve-wrackingly fun. The most refreshing thing about this particular piece is that Crichton doesn't eat up pages explaining technicalities to death or filling good story-space with graphics and such which are kind of neat, but not integral for the reader to have to take time to study. This tale is told simply, quickly, and honestly, and should sit proudly on the shelf where his other works are stored in your home. Nice job, Michael.	2003-05-08

Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine generally satisfies my thirst for crime stories, but the whole historical aspect of this collection caught my interest. Overall, the book is pleasant, yet humdrum. Many of the stories were so brief you really couldn't get a feel for any of the characters and whatever clues were required to conclude each story seemed thrust forth eagerly in an effort to just end things quickly. Some stories shone more brightly than others--mainly due to the creative use of setting. I'm uncertain how accurate some of the details were for each of the eras represented, but all seemed quite plausible, creating nearly all of the charm the book possessed. Many of the stories came across as little more than tiny one-act plays with little time for humor or any misleading of the reader, thus making them instantly forgettable. If the authors are allowed more leeway to properly flavor the next collection, perhaps it won't be quite so bland. I'd rather pay more for a thicker book or read one with fewer authors penning longer stories than see another collection so forced and underdone.	2003-04-10

If you've read the first book, you'll understand how it almost feels like somebody else wrote Hope, yet it still carries McCaig's overall simplistic and straightforward flavor. Hope is more about Hope's handler, Penny Burkeholder, and how she tries to cope with life after her family is cruelly and suddenly torn asunder. Nop's offspring, Hope, is integral to the storyline, though not so much as his sire was in Nop's Trials. There's something bleak and distant about this book that makes it feel lonely...though it is appropriate for the story, it lacks a little of the magic and sparkle of Nop's Trials. There's less humor here, less warmth, and I'm uncertain if McCaig intended it to be interpreted this way to help the reader feel what Penny and her family endure during the telling of this tale. It's a great book, but a sad one overall. Fortunately, enough strings remain untied at the end to give hope for at least one more wonderful Burkeholder story.	2003-02-20

I had to learn what I was missing and was highly pleased recently to attain a copy of this complete book for my very own. McCaig writes in a very simplistic, to the point style which flows smoothly and quickly, telling a story of how an honest, hardworking farm man loses his newest stockdog in an unfortunate series of events which only seem to bring the two even closer together at the end. Nop's trials describe not only Border Collie stockdog trials--herding sheep and such for prizes--but the trials he must endure just surviving, wondering if he will ever see his master again or work again on his farm. It is intriguing to note that while you may occasionally &quot;hear&quot; what the dog's point of view is, he is speaking in his own dog language which humans may interpret or misinterpret as they will. A great read for any age, there are a few disturbing scenes described which may upset very young or particularly zealous animal lovers of any kind. Overall, this book deserves its place with all the other great animal stories like Watership Down, Tailchaser's Song, Firebringer, White Fang, The Black Stallion, and The Plague Dogs.	2003-02-20

Shatner's Get A Life! is wonderfully honest, painting a portrait of a man who is very down-to-earth and family oriented, who is aware he's blessed and does his best to stay humble about it, who has a delightfully prickly sense of humor and all the curiosity of an adolescent raccoon. And he thought he was writing a book about the phenomena of Star Trek Conventions! The book is funny, it's almost uncomfortably weird in places, it's heartfelt, it's as pleasant to read as it is to attend one of these conventions yourself and really observe all the goings-on rather than just browse for souvenirs. You don't have to be a big Star Trek or William Shatner fan to enjoy this read. It's a psychologically fascinating glimpse into fan phenomena as told by a guy with a big smile and even bigger heart.	2003-02-17

I liked it because it smacks of honesty, though the bulk of the scenarios have been pushed to ultimately humorous extremes. There are so many characters integral to the climax that the storyline can be dizzying, especially the way Dorsey zips around and through the brief span of time involved, telling just enough to pull it all together at just the right moment. If you're able to set it down, then you're either too timid for this kind of in-your-face storytelling, or it'll haunt you until you can get back to it again. It could be titled: How To Push A Normal Joe Overboard...except that the hero's name is Jim. Of particular interest to those all-too-familiar with Tampa. A delightful exaggeration. Zany, twisted, breakneck-speed fun!	2003-02-17

I'm not really from there--just spent a number of years there. Doesn't matter. They're just jealous that western shore isn't capitalized and that somebody unique and fascinating like James Michener never wrote a book about where they live--ha! If you're lucky enough to have ties or just a handful of memories about Maryland's Eastern Shore, then you'll find this book absolutely enthralling. From the mighty warrior who became the unlikely leader of a small band of Indians later known as the gentle Choptanks to a handful of diverse European families who shaped the bountiful wilderness into the comfortably proud land it is today, Michener's book is alive with strong women, stubborn men, the crafty and the vile, the shamefully wrong and the helplessly righteous. Don't let the size of the book scare you--it's a fast read full of laughs and wonder, historically altered, yet accurate to the times and places in so many ways. A rare book describing the growth of a portion of our mighty country including the trials and tribulations of the Native Americans and the never ending struggles of the Africans brought over as slaves. He glosses through the Civil War, but I think the book might've been twice as long had he written much more about it. For everyone who's stalked the marshes and seen the skipjacks gallantly skim by, from the poor farm boy to the community-building rich--Michener's toast to you.

While the characters and dialogue are a bit flat, the story itself moves at a breakneck pace, following an all-too believable series of events meant to describe a worst-case scenario involving bacteria-laden meat and how the mistake of a couple of idiots can completely turn a handful of lives upside-down. I'm warning you this book is not for the weak-stomached or feint of heart. Cook's descriptions of a child succumbing to a particular strain of all-too-common bacteria and his portrait of a particularly nasty beef industry can make you physically ill. This was a book I couldn't put down and had a terrible time slowing myself down at the end so I could get all the details instead of just racing ahead to the intriguing conclusion. Thick, but a fast read. Prepare to eat vegetarian for awhile afterward.	2002-12-10

I sure hope that doesn't stop anyone from making or going to any future films made from the books of this fantastic writing team! Didn't see the movie? No big deal. This is definitely a case of &quot;the book is better&quot;. Far better! Someone or someTHING is going around slaughtering people in New York, and it all seems to center around one particular museum. Yeah, yeah, there's the obligatory big-thing that gets ruined in the form of a new gallery theme that goes horribly awry when the murderer decides to drop by, but Child and Preston have the magical ability to take plausible circumstances and turn them horrifically askew without the word &quot;cliche&quot; popping up in your mind at all. These guys can write! They can be technical without getting textbook about it like Crichton's works. They can explore characters without diverging from the main storyline which, with their books, always moves along like some tribal wardrum, beating slowly but rhythmically somewhere in the distance--just enough to set your nerves on edge--then gradually getting louder and picking up the pace until the wonderfully satisfying frenzied climax is reached...and you're hooked on their books like I am. It began for me with The Relic. Original idea mixed with childlike enthusiasm and great research adds up to awesome book. Not a classic--just a heck of a great read!	2002-11-24

Y'know the pulse-pounding excitement you felt the first time you saw Jurassic Park on film...the sudden danger, the cool weapons, the technical talk, the very real people in horrifically unreal circumstances? That's your average Child/Preston book! RipTide is about legendary pirate treasure on an unsafe island and the brilliant, wealthy people who've gone after it. It's about a grown man seeking the answers to his brother's mysterious disappearance when they were exploring the island as children. It's about going back home and finding nearly everything changed, while some things seem to stay the same. It's action, mystery, a touch of lusty romance, intrigue, horror, and more twists and turns than loops and whorls across an ancient pirate's treasure map.

I bought this book with the belief it would leave me depressed and discovered the true meanings of &quot;survival&quot;, &quot;civilization&quot;, and &quot;hope&quot; instead. J. Toth's book describes what most of us would think of as a nightmare--what happens to a normal, average person when they hit rock bottom, losing their home, their job, all material possessions, money, identity and what have you? In New York City a number of such people have wound up living in the sewers and subway tunnels deep beneath the streets--not like vermin, but in some cases far better than those who choose life on the sidewalks, in the alleys, sleeping in piles of cardboard and newspapers or on some park bench. Where the &quot;mole people&quot; live you can find hot showers and running electricity, schools in session, museum-worthy artists, babies being born, and friends who will do anything to help save a life. This is not a pretty picture. This is the only way these people could possibly survive, watching out for one another, continuing despite the odds with their wits and skills, their humor, and the dark wisdom they acquire as outcasts from the &quot;normal&quot; world. No pity is created in the reading of this fantastic observation, but instead it fosters a reverance for those who can keep going on, who can survive and even assist others who have fallen from the sunlight world, and lets you realize that despite woes of our daily life, life can and does go on in even the worst of circumstances, with a sense of governing, morals, and ideals intact. Of course, I wish there was some way to return these people to the hustle and bustle, the daily stresses of aboveground life...then again, I'm not certain I'd care to inflict more such punishment upon them. Are they in some strange, twisted way better off than those of us who work our butts off to pay bills, who grow fat on restaurant chow, who can't live without our herbal supplements, yoga, or vacation time? Read this book and judgefor yourself.<BR>By the way, Ms. Toth--I applaud your bravery and willingness to follow a project through. Most of us could not have written anything along these lines, researching the way you did, risking life and health and God knows what else to bring these people's plights to light. I thank you for this book.	2002-11-24

What's the point of teaching history at all if it's edited? At that point it might as well be folk tales, interesting stories lacking any real facts. Alexs Pate's version of the events surrounding the slave ship La Amistad are easy to follow thanks to his simple, direct writing style and unique ability to describe much in a few words. While a &quot;fictionalized&quot; account of true events, the story is nonetheless riveting and heartwrenching, astounding and sickening to behold. I am saddened and even a little angry I have so little knowledge of how the vast majority of Africans found their way to America and the truth of how my ancestors may have considered and treated them. The author does a fine job of remaining mostly neutral on the topic himself, letting the story unfold and almost tell itself. While some Africans had it a little better than others, during pre-Civil War days and even in some cases still today, no black man was ever truly free. Amistad is a brilliant book about suffering and the strength it may bring, about how hope may prevail under the direst of circumstances, about how mistakes can save lives and doing &quot;the right thing&quot; might end them. A quick, powerful read anyone of any color or belief may enjoy. An excellent book for anyone readying to delve into the truth of the past instead of blandly accepting some outdated school textbook of it. Masterpiece.	2002-11-12

What's more frightening than the idea of an apocalypse? How 'bout all the people out there with so many freaky ideas of how and when it will come... From a psychological standpoint, this book is absolutely fascinating, darkly humorous, and yet undeniably frightening in its portrayal of people who might be neighbors or cousins of yours and mine who await an alien takeover or the return of Christ or what have you and the extent to which these hopes or fears have affected their lives and the lives of those they know and love. Obviously, the author has focused on one particular quirk of the various lives his subjects lead, and yet what is magnified for the reader are some of the most thought-provoking and bizarre ideas and behaviors I have ever encountered in print outside of an issue of Psychology Today. A book that can be aborbed and pondered by anyone with common sense and the ability to seperate reality from fantasy, I would avoid letting this fall into the hands of impressionable or highly imaginative young readers who might become fixated on some particular section and grow fearful because of it. Disturbing in both an entertaining and harrowing way, I couldn't put it down and hope for some sort of a sequel. Amazing.	2002-11-12

Good-natured and a voracious reader, she cracked open the book and was pleasantly surprised by what she learned about herself and the way humans visually perceive things. Drawing On The Right...can't turn no-talents into featured artists at big-city galleries, but it can open the doorway between the creative mind and worried hands and allow those who &quot;can't draw a straight line&quot; to find delight in doing simple portraits or design where there was little aptitude for these things before. Emma thoroughly enjoyed the simple exercises and her work underwent an immediate leap towards the refinement of her style. It also helped her experiment artistically with styles she'd never explored before. I relented and read it myself, amazed at my own progress with simple line drawings and determining the placement of shadow. She'll always remain the artist, but now I can better express my own ideas on paper with brushes or graphite, sketching for my own enjoyment or giving her outlines she can flesh out for me with colors and shadows. Not entirely an instructional guide, Drawing...reads nothing like a boring textbook and ventures into fascinating studies of people who've suffered brain injury and how this affects perception. A fantastic and highly recommended book for artists (even great ones), art therapists, art teachers, beginning artists, or anyone who ever thought they had no talent or couldn't accomplish anything. This book gives hope where there was none before, can boost self-esteem, and improves near-perfection in art.	2002-11-12
US	38581707	RBQZGVEQRXSO4	075969155X	651969859	Datoga Island	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Mild Island	I'm assuming the person who asked if I'd review this book has already read a few of my other reviews and knows I am an honest person. With that out of the way, let me be brief: Datoga Island was written about as rocky and bumpy as the very race it describes. The story was okay...I had expected a little more based on the intriguing description on the book's back cover, something with bloody confrontations and characters being pushed to extremes of survival in a harsh environment while attempting to solve some ages-old mystery. Instead, the book comes across as a much more simple and cheerful tale that plods along hinting at excitement without ever really delivering a whole lot. If author Chetan Dave would slow down his writing style, find himself a good proof reader, and write stories with a bit more action per chapter, a bit more meat to them, he may come up with something special. Datoga Island is all sizzle, little steak. Not bad, but I know he could do better.	2002-10-10
US	38581707	RUOSV6RUL56YM	0451205677	579741281	Breed	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Read Breed!	Breed features one of the best things about classic old horror (particularly Lovecraft-type horror), in that Owl allows your imagination to portray the monster by offering only little hints as to what it looks like. As you follow a handful of characters through snippets of their daily lives, not only is he able to portray a great sense of reality through dialogue and reaction, but there is always a lingering sense of giddy anticipation and fear whether he is unleashing the terror in that particular chapter or not. The story feels familiar, but Owl is creative enough to keep throwing unexpected events abruptly in the way, constantly changing what you thought was coming up next, never letting you completely second-guess him. It's his sense of reality and his sense of humor which really keep the pace fast and fresh. I hope to see a lot more out of this talented young author.	2002-10-01

When I picked up Gone South, I was under the impression it would be something dark, gritty...something that might make me hold my breath through a few eye-popping paragraphs of horror or near-horror. What I got was totally unexpected and delightfully welcomed...Gone South is weird! Not quite weird like most of McCammon's books are, but delightfully, touchingly, wacky and weird, and chock full of action and surprises! This should be made into a film simply because it would be the oddest buddy film ever. From page to page you'll have no idea what to expect next, and the whole thing plays out like a fantastic roller coaster ride. Bizarre. Bittersweet. Laugh-out-loud. Shake your head in wonderment. Read this book!	2002-07-28
US	38581707	R1Q3NFM1UFTZTV	0671739441	958613731	Mine	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Should Be Yours	I'm picky about my horror/thrillers. Monsters and fantasy are fun, but realistic stories are what really scare me. Mine is a very plausible, and therefore very frightening tale of a wacko who steals an infant from a hospital shortly after its birth, then runs across the country with it and the baby's distraught mother in hot pursuit. With so many children being abducted in the news lately, this one can hit home whether you've got kids or not. A real goosebump-raiser, page-burner, great read of a book.	2002-07-17
US	38581707	R2F8RXC6LEWWQZ	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Time To Unwind With Adventure Of Old	If you've read Crichton before, you know he comes across as a highly intelligent, very thorough writer who feels details are the key to believable fiction. I was working for a major book retailer when Timeline came out and found it odd so many of his fans were more preoccupied with the release of a third Jurassic Park book called &quot;Embryo&quot; than his latest creation about time travel. Embryo never materialized, and Timeline sold fairly well, but I never heard any reviews or comments about it. I finally procured Timeline for myself and found it reads very much like a classic Crichton tale-a slow buildup with lots of technical descriptions in the beginning, though in this story, thank God, he was kind enough to omit the bulk of the diagrams and such he seems to favor, then on to grand adventure! Considering the scientific theories used and/or created for this piece of fiction, I still found a few points difficult to swallow-mainly character reaction to some of the goings-on. Many things seemed to fit together a little too smoothly, keeping the pace fast and the action almost non-stop, creating a high-flying, swashbuckling story that struck me as almost dull in its predictability and formulaic layout. It comes across as a little boy's knights-n-armor fantasy made true, which isn't bad. It's actually quite entertaining and fun...I just think Crichton could have roughed it up a bit and added a few more surprises instead of letting it play out to its predictable end. A bedtime story for grown-ups. Read it-don't think about it. Just relax and let Uncle Michael tell you a tale about knights and battles and beautiful conniving heroines from a long, long time ago...	2002-07-17

He is a master at manipulating a reader's emotions, a great storyteller, and the imagery he describes lets his tales play out like movies in your head. Stinger is not one of his best pieces, but it still works well as pure horror entertainment. The characters are believeable, their reactions to a terrifying alien invasion of a tiny Texas town well done, but I found some scenes lacking-such as the &quot;big surprise&quot; the antagonist called Stinger unveils to wreak havoc on the poor Earth people he calls &quot;bugs&quot;, and there were even a few chunks of text describing minor events that could have been ommitted from the story entirely without disrupting the continuity. McCammon's flow is fast, his books hard to set down, and this one was no exception. It just seemed at times he was wandering dazed through the wreckage and chaos like one of his own characters, looking for the next clue to help him wrap up the story satisfactorily. Read Stinger, but be sure to check out the author's other titles, too. The man can entertain!	2002-07-17

It sounds a bit silly-there's a werewolf spy invading WWII Germany, but, my God, the story is a wonderful blend of fact, fiction, and fun! Don't let its size intimidate you-McCammon's books are fast and furious, hard-to-put-down reads. I haven't read all of his titles yet, but this is my favorite and worth dragging back out of storage for another read every three years or so. Read it, write him, and insist on a sequel! If nothing else, maybe whoever eventually makes a film or cable series out of this will chase it with the follow-up it begs for. It would at least make a great comic-book miniseries! Buy this book. Own it. Love it. Share it. Everything great fiction should be!	2002-07-17
US	38581707	R143E0QX4LJQOM	0345350472	978657248	Blade Runner (Movie-Tie-In Edition)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Does Not Replicate The Film	Androids is as different from the film Blade Runner as most of Ian Fleming's Bond stories are from the films made after them. Deckard comes across as a more henpecked, harried man--married to an emotionally distant woman, seeking the answers to life through a simulation of the last days of a sort of messiah whose end came about similarly to Jesus'. You'll meet most of the same characters, but don't pick up this book expecting to experience the same oily, slinky, gritty feel of the noirish movie. It stands on its own as a good story, if not a little confusing at points as many of Dick's works are. True BR fans with knowledge of earlier drafts of the screenplay will have a better time making the connections between book and film, but those who've seen the movie once or twice only and thought it was \\"okay\\" or \\"pretty cool...\\" may find Androids a bit tedious and discouraging. A must for any die-hard P.K.Dick or Blade Runner fans.	2002-05-14
US	38581707	R2NIBB77LVPXOL	0886778484	288220329	Moon Shots	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Fair Shot	I just finished Moon Shots. It's an intriguing selection of fiction ranging from the more hard-core scientific to light fantasy, each story, of course, dealing in some fashion with the Moon. I read collections like these as introductions to writers I may not have otherwise heard about, and while some of the stories appealed to me more than others, overall I found this book pleasant reading late at night just before falling asleep... It's a great little book for someone whose tastes in fiction are varied and who may not have time to sit down through an entire novel. Good for a traveler or student with some interest or fascination with Luna.	2002-05-14

It's more of a guided journey through your psyche, letting you explore your beliefs and challenge what you think you already know. I've become happily bogged down in the section where you basically outline your life's history, treading from my earliest memory onward through dark and murky waters, finding that light does indeed glisten in swamps sometimes. If delving into your inner reaches intrigues you at all, this book is a winner. I recommend it for those who are open minded in their religious beliefs and have time to spend jotting down their thoughts and observations. I've been working on this for a year now, but would never dream of rushing such a delicate and emotional process. It leaves you feeling like you've had some kind of an inner cleansing and everything seems a lot brighter and less stuffy inside. Go for it!	2002-02-26

My wife was working as a buyer for a bookstore when she noticed this title in a catalog and knew it was something special I would instantly be drawn to. As a late Valentine, it was perfect, and I must say I am quite pleased with the almost museum-like quality and presentation of this book. From the first ever real American P.I. to modern films, quirky heroes, and comic books, Max Collins manages to cover every base of the detective mystery genre. The historical bits are not boring at all, but often amusing as is the fantastic selection of cover art from pulp magazines through trading cards and television promo art. A slightly tongue-in cheek tribute to a slightly tongue-in cheek style of writing by one of mystery's biggest fans and best contributers, well worth every penny!	2002-02-21

As a child, I delved almost immediately into contemporary adult fiction and skipped most of the so-called \\"classics\\" that so many of my peers were made to read in school, so now, as an author, I feel it's my duty to at least become acquainted with as many of these \\"greats\\" as I can. I've loved all of the Illustrated Classics so far, despite the fact I have not enjoyed every story. A Journey...was not an especially appealing tale for me, but I must complement the people who have brought so many classic stories to life in a short form, then gone on to give a great deal of detail about the authors, the times in which they lived, the characters, plot summaries, and even thought-provoking questions at the end. I applaud your efforts--they are what has made me want to collect the entire series. Great collector's items and wonderful aids for those just beginning to get into classic literature, once you've begun to explore these treasures, you will probably want an entire set, too!	2002-02-21

This book answered some of the questions I had concerning the film and Dick's book Androids, and also opened my eyes to a few little-known facts and unused ideas concerning the film. I loved the photos and sketches and easy style the book was written in. A must for any true Blade Runner or PK Dick fan.	2002-01-04
