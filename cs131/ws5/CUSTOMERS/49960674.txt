The fact is, the book is a good idea gone terribly wrong - as many other &quot;important&quot; works of literature. From the very beginning there's a sense of impending doom, but not as in a Thomas Hardy novel, for, in Under the Volcano, though you know something bad's going to happen, the book is so freakin' boring that you don't really care to read on in order to find out what it is that's going to happen - as you probably would with Hardy. And, besides, you probably wouldn't care to finish the book simply because of the fact that you already know what the hell is going to happen; the introduction, the preface, the postface, the prologue, the epilogue, the forward, the afterward, the abstracts, the acknowledgments, the dedication, the excerpt on the back cover all tell you what is going to happen. Of course, I exaggerate - but you get the picture. Can't the book itself unfold its events?<br />The man obviously has a mastery over the English vernacular but he just doesn't use it to any effect. And that's lamentable, because really all these fancy words mean nothing when there is absolutely no rhetorics to hang on to. There is little of poetry in this book and even littler of entertainment. The book is dull, slow-witted and slow-motioned - for that's how it seems everything in the book occurs, in slow motion. The characters - these Hemingway-ian animals - are teeming with tedium, to coin a term. And the one character who is SLIGHTLY interesting, the Frenchman Laruelle, seldom appears in the story. All these things make me question the credibility of most of these reviewers hailing the book a masterpiece. I guess sometimes a book's standing in literature renders the reader's opinion without any consideration of the book itself.<br />There should be a number of editions of this book in circulation, but I would perhaps argue that the Perennial Classics edition is the most popular, it beingthe first one to come up on the Amazon search and all. Nevertheless, it was the edition I read and I must therefore assert that it was one of the most disgraceful jobs of editing I have seen. There is, no kidding, a minimum of twenty misspelled words. It makes you wonder if this isn't actually the rough draft of Under the Volcano, mistakenly printed and never recalled.	2001-08-02

Swann's Way is generally said to be written in the stream-of-consciousness technique. Having thus said that, I daresay it is a psychoanalytic error. Both important characters in this story (Swann and the narrator himself) think in a way that is entirely incredible. They take every little aspect of their uneventful lives and seem to put it under a microscope, leaving not a single detail of that aspect, that facet, undetected. They break it down to its indivisible remains. They're relentless; they peal away until there is nothing left. That is mainly why the book drags on so much. It seems as if Swann and the narrator (both of whom, it should forthwith be established, are boring as hell) are not average in any way. They are two psychologists who'd make Freud and Jung quiver to their very skeletons.<br />Give me a break, I say. No one in real life thinks the way they do, taking pages upon endless pages in analyzing the minutiae, the most diminutive stuff that happens in their lives - stuff that in real-life goes totally ignored. Not being anything near a psychologist, I can easily tell that the characters in this story are faker than a toupee. At least Joyce, who is worlds more tedious than Proust at his worst, succeeded with near-perfect accuracy at transmitting man's consciousness from the brain to the paper. Proust, with his microscoped slides tightly clasped at the nucleus of his characters' brains, made a bad claim to the selfsame place Joyce later reached. Swann's Way, in this respect, is a dud; an exaggeration wrought by meticulosity.<br />And then, of course, it must be remembered that it is also a work of fiction. But a deceptive work of fiction at that, for the first sentence promises a story that would never melt away into one's oblivion: &quot;For a long time I would go to bed early.&quot; A simple sentence, so simple that it promises the reader that the story is filled with all possibilities. Anything may happen. But the reader soon learns that there are no possibilities, that the sense instilled into his mind by the first sentence is a false one. For in the end, nothing happens. Not that nothing is resolved, because that really doesn't matter - just that nothing happens. It's a long, boring cab-drive home.<br />And those long sentences and long paragraphs that seem to make the pages cry, filled with those tremendous blocks of text - they are of no positive effect to the overall story, or any portion of it, for that matter. That is not to say that extensive writing like this is bad in literature, keeping in mind those few writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez who made such wonderful use of his long stretches of paragraphs. Proust merely needed to trim his up, needed to remove all that bogus stream-of-consciousness. The story of M. Swann and his liaison with Mme Odette is so simple that any other writer would have taken up two hundred pages or less to tell it.<br />But of course, now, there are the positives. To say that Swann's Way - with all its barren poetry - had no wonderful passages would be a perjury. A book of such longevity would as sure as hell-fire have a couple of things one would delight in reading. Early on in the story, for instance, the narrator describes the church towers, steeples, and belfries he sees overhead one day whilst walking home. The words he uses in conveying these sublime images into the reader's mind are so delicious the reader thereafter finds himself quickly turning the pages back to reread the passages in their entireties. Sometimes, Proust's words are like a Turkish Delight for the eyes. If the Moncrieff translation is this grand, one can only imagine how good the book is in its original language. Thus, for the tender sake of language, Swann's Way is a good book. There is a practice, an exercise into language in this book that, while not unprecedented, you seldom see in others. But all the rest is nothing more than a boring prose poem that serves as the overture to an epic that must surely be painstaking to finish.rest is nothing more than a boring prose poem that serves as the overture to an epic that must surely be painstaking to finish.	2001-05-02

This book knocked me out of my seat. It's relentless from beginning to end. All throughout you want to rush through the pages to see how the story concludes. What will happen to Dorian? What will become of the  hideous painting?<br />The book's three main characters are Basil Hallward,  the painter; Dorian Gray, the paintee; and Lord Henry, the intellectual  mind behind Dorian Gray. It seems as if all of Dorian Gray's evils are  inspired by his sidekick, Lord Henry. So, throughout the story, the reader  is left asking: &quot;Is this guy a villain?&quot; As to the answer to that  question, it still remains uncertain to me.<br />And the ending - oh! -  flawless, impeccable, divine!

When it came to ordinary literature, he boldly repudiated. His goal in literature remains as obscure as his style of writing. And Intruder in the Dust is a perfect example of  what Faulkner was made of.<br />Rooted in the South - in his famous  Yoknapatawpha County - Intruder in the Dust is the story of Lucas Beauchamp  and the men who toil for his freedom. It's a story that, though complex, is  touching and wonderful. A nonconformical work of art that is surreal in  language and impressionistic in symbolism. <br />This book will not keep you  at the edge of your seat, but it will indeed make you think. There's, of  course, some entertainment (for it's the major characteristic of any  novel), but the novel is mostly made of stuff to make you think.

They fail to see the beauty of this tale. This book deserves literary merit, for it's a brave masterpiece. Not, as one prosecutor put it,  &quot;dirt for dirt's sake.&quot;<br />This book should not be seen as a piece  of work advertising pornography, but rather as a mere attack against  industrialization. Perhaps Lawrence, through the tale of Lady Chatterley  and her lover, was trying to bring a message across about industry  (Clifford Chatterley's coal mine) and the working class (significantly the  gamekeeper, Mellors). But, of course, we can't overlook the endless romance  between Lady Chatterley and her lover, for it is what this story is about.  <br />The fact that it contains that little four-lettered Anglo-Saxon word  that begins with an &quot;F&quot; is more reason why this book deserves  literary merit, for it is one of the first and foremost important works of  literature to contain it. Now, of course, it is hard to find a book, a  movie, or a song without that famous word. <br />If D. H. Lawrence should be  remembered a thousand years from now, it should be for writing this story.  He was a very courageous, very daring person to have written it. This taboo  of a story is one that will stay in the reader's mind forever.<br />(Note: If  you are to read this book, I'd recommend the unexpurgated version.)	2000-05-18

We read all these Stephen King books that seem to flock the bestseller  lists with their monsters, and gore, and goo, and we ask ourselves: Where  is this guy coming from? In this book, we could literally know where he's  coming from. <br />Anyone who has read at least one book by King knows that  he's from Maine, for it always says it on the inside of the back cover; but  do we know, for instance, that he once spent a vacation on a hotel hidden  deep inside the mountains of Colorado which later inspired him to write his  classic, The Shining? Do we know anything of how his college was like? This  book is not a biography, but tells of the places in which he has lived all  his life - which are all mostly scattered throughout Maine.<br />There is one  little flaw that this book has, though, and that is that it gives the  ending to some of his novels and short stories. So, if you haven't read  every single novel and story King has ever written, you might not want to  read this book just yet.	2000-05-07

This is a nice book of poems, but for guys? I'm a guy but I have to admit that many of these poems in here are better read by women than by men. When I think of guys' poetry, I think of war poems, sports poems, staying-at-home-watching-television poems, etc. Not something like  &quot;She Walks in Beauty&quot;! The cover of this book pictures a big man  with a T-shirt on and a pair of boxers - a man's man, you can call him. I  enjoy romantic poetry, but I am not a man's man (actually, I'm just a kid).  You see, a man's man does not enjoy romance. Most significantly, a man's  man does not enjoy something like Lord Byron's &quot;She Walks in  Beauty.&quot; He enjoys something more like &quot;I Have a Rendezvous with  Death,&quot; which shares his feelings on war and dying. <br />What exactly  the editor was trying to do in regard to this book, I have no clue. And  speaking of editing, she does a horrible job at it. You will notice many  mistakes throughout the book. For example, a line of &quot;Annabel  Lee&quot; which should have been written, &quot;I was a child and she was a  child . . .&quot; is instead written, &quot;She was a child and I was a  child . . .&quot; It might've been a mistake, of course. Or she perhaps  changed it a little. If that is indeed the case, she should've just left  the thing alone! I'm sure Poe was happy with how he wrote it. Also, you  will notice the interesting way in which she spells &quot;city&quot; in  Carl Sandburg's &quot;Chicago.&quot; And to my great disappointment, there  were no poems by Alfred, Lord Tennyson; but there were indeed some two or  three poems by a certain LORD ALFRED Tennyson.<br />The poems, I thought, were  fine. But next time some better effort should be given in compiling poetry  for guys.	2000-05-03

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is perhaps the greatest rhymester to have ever lived. His endless rhymes almost seem to stay in one's mind, refusing to go. And this edition of his collected poetry just shows Longfellow at his best. <br />This here is poetry that - though over a hundred years old - is  still fresh and alive with vigor. The poems tell tales of men and women, of  birds and beast, and of gods and demigods (such as found in The Song of  Hiawatha) in such magnificent form that it isn't a wonder why Longfellow  was known to be the greatest American poet of his time.<br />&quot;A poem  should not mean but be,&quot; Archibald MacLeish wrote in &quot;Ars  Poetica.&quot; These poems are not intricate, and they're not  incomprehensible, and they're definitely not senseless nor pointless; they  are timeless, rhetoric voices of literature that tell so much . . . of so  much. <br />And besides, how much times do we come across a poet who does not  want to talk about how he feels and his emotions? It seems to be all that  poets want to write about. It's good to sometimes read poems that simply  want to tell stories and not what the Soul, or the Heart, or the Mind  feels. Those things can be nice, but can make one ponder more than he or  she should. <br />Another thing that will become apparent to the reader of  this book is that Longfellow was a keen observer of people. In these poems,  he writes about them very well. &quot;The Village Blacksmith,&quot; for  example, is a brilliant poem that tells of one ordinary man with an  ordinary occupation: being a blacksmith. It's not of some Don Juan, or Rob  Roy, or Casanova that in real life are as scarce as an honest politician.  The story of the man in the poem - how he toils, and mourns, and triumphs,  and suffers - is one that anyone can relate to. <br />It is even possible to  find comfort in these poems that simply tell stories and not of emotional  issues. Also, as I aforementioned, the iambic tales will stay in your mind  as you might find it hard to forget them. It is probably the simplicity of  these poems that make them so easy to memorize, and are probably what made  Longfellow great.	2000-05-02

From the sorrowful and melancholic lines of &quot;Ulalume&quot; to the exclamatory rhymes of &quot;The Bells,&quot; this thin volume has it all. (Well, not exactly all, for this book does not have some of the lesser known poems of Poe such as &quot;To Isadore,&quot; &quot;A Paean,&quot; and  &quot;An Enigma&quot; - but it is nonetheless a great book to have.)<br />For  big Poe fans, especially, this is true. There are so many anthologies which  carry about two or three of his poems, but it is not easy to find one that  is solely dedicated to his complete poetry. Usually, it is his short  stories that attract publishers' attention.<br />Since Poe's poetry is so  beautifully-written and delightful to recite, it's good to have a book on  which you could look at whenever you forget a Poe poem, or simply want to  read or reread one.<br />Edgar Allan Poe never left behind as big a bulk of  literature as Charles Dickens or Henry James. In fact, compared to many  other classic writers, he didn't leave much behind. So, indeed, what little  he left can all be contained in within a section of a bookshelf. So why not  own his work?<br />Poe was an excellent literary thinker, whose imagination  will never be rivaled. And to those who enjoy good poetry, this book must  be in within your bookshelves.	2000-04-27

The result: A very dissatisfied reader.<br />Something like this won the Pulitzer Prize? If any of his plays should have won it (which a couple of them did), it should have been All  God's Chillun Got Wings, not this pointless play.<br />The family in this play  was MUCH too dysfunctional. All they did all day (which the whole play was  in one day) was argue and argue and argue. And when at times it seemed as  if the arguing would end, one of the four characters said something that  would spark up a new argument. <br />Woe be to my computer teacher for  suggesting me this book, for it bore me into tears.	2000-04-25

Stevenson couldn't have done a better job in telling the story of these two individuals trapped in the body of one. The concept is of an awesome nature, and so is the story. <br />Now, many  people that have never read this think it to be a horror tale. This is  indeed true - some of this story is horror. But more than a horror tale,  this is a psychological mystery. The way it begins, the way many of the  mysteries unfold throughout the story have all the nature, the  characteristics, the makings of a mystery. Thus, upon reading this book,  you must pay careful attention to all that's going on. If you don't pay  attention to a certain detail, you may get very mixed up and lost. It is  easy to understand why many different versions have been written for  kids.<br />The last part of the book is just wonderful. The book, though it  may not be the funnest thing to read, is all worth reading for the ending.  The ending is one that will stand high in literature.	2000-04-25
US	49960674	R3BZ5LQT0GX9S8	0684801221	737092002	The Old Man and The Sea	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A short, yet towering tale.	You don't come across a lot of stuff like this in literature: a novella that has so much depth to it. And when you do, well, you treasure it. <br />Hemingway was a phenomenal writer and this story is even more phenomenal than him. Though very short, it is like a divine piece of literature. Not  only for fishermen, but for anyone who enjoys good literature. <br />The  storyline is of much simplicity, but through those terse sentences in which  this story is written, there is so much. This is the story that really  assured Hemingway the Nobel Prize.<br />I shan't say more about it, just read  the book! This is the quintessential classic.	2000-04-25
US	49960674	RMB3U3OFOETWB	0684853515	692650386	Hearts In Atlantis	Books	5	1	1	N	N	King roars like a lion!	This book was one excellent read. All six stories were - though very sad - incredible. To many, this book brought them back to a decade they can remember as if it just ended yesteryear. Yet to others as myself, it is  like going back through eons of time to another world . . . the 60s.<br />With  its hippies waving the peace sign in the air, and writing stuff on the  college dormitories such as &quot;LBJ is a war criminal,&quot; Hearts in  Atlantis seems not only to be a great book of the 60s, but a very  informational book, as well. Much can be learned about that decade in  reading the six stories.<br />Peace, dude.	2000-04-25
US	49960674	R10Z79XL57670D	0684801469	11530247	A Farewell To Arms	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Love, war . . . and tragedy.	A Farewell to Arms has a sad air about it that is difficult to miss. Surely, this is not a book of triumph, or happiness, or joy. It's the melancholic yarn of a certain Captain Henry (though narrator of the story,  a very quiet man) and Patricia Barkley, a nurse.<br />Their romance seems to  be altered by the war taking place. Captain Henry, an American lieutenant  on the Italian front, has to choose between his lover or the inevitable war  - much like something from a Richard Lovelace poem.<br />A Farewell to Arms is  not the best book there is, and it's not an edge-of-your-seat page-turner,  but it is a wonderful and sad story that tells of the power that war has  over a man's life, and the mercilessness of that war itself.	2000-04-21
US	49960674	R1WQFIXUWSLEJA	0075536668	161451712	The Sound and The Fury	Books	3	23	30	N	N	Nice, sad, tragic.	Whether The Sound and the Fury is worthy of being accepted as one of the 20th century's greatest, I'm not sure. At times it was great, at times it was woeful, at times it was downright tedious. Much effort, I'm sure, was  given in writing this novel (though by the first part it may not seem so),  but it isn't the best book to hit the stores since the Bible.<br />The story,  through different monologues, is told by the slow-minded Benjy, the  downcast Quentin, and the apathetic Jason - all brothers of Caddy Compson.  Because Faulkner uses the stream-of-consciousness technique in the  narration of Quentin, the book becomes very difficult to understand. For  indeed, the lack of punctuation renders you mad with bafflement.<br />If read  casually, the book would seem like any other book; though if read more  carefully, it seems as if Faulkner was trying to get a message across: that  everyone suffers in their own way. Every character in the story is, in some  way or another, miserable. Not one of the characters is content with what  they have or how they live.<br />The Sound and the Fury, in concluding this  review, is a good yarn. Faulkner's experimentation in writing this book  deserves high merit. A book written in that form back then was a novelty -  too bad it could no longer be said so in this day and age. William Faulkner  made no mistake in writing The Sound and the Fury, and we should make no  mistake in reading it.	2000-03-23
US	49960674	RMWNF4AGY0FH0	0140177396	371714764	Of Mice and Men	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A tremendous story by a tremendous writer.	Steinbeck deserves a standing ovation for this book. It tells so much in so few pages. It's a tale about two laborers working at a ranch to merely have something to eat. It quickly becomes more complicated than that, as  Lennie - the slow-minded giant - proposes an idea: a house, a farm, and, of  course, the rabbits. At first, it's just a dream, but then it becomes a  possibilty as they get together with an elderly man who happens to have  some money. Of Mice and Men is a wonderful story that reveals life as it  truly is, and that reminds us that the people we think are our friends  might just become our end.	2000-03-15
US	49960674	R2CYFTDV9J3FO0	0451526104	835712680	This Side of Paradise	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Nice, yes; remarkable, not in the least.	Being a 14-year-old, I thought that I would've probably liked this book - the main character being a young man who's really not sure of anything, as myself. But the book dealt a little too much with Amory's helpless egotism  and conceitedness, thus lacking good storytelling - the damned thing never  even reaches a climax. It even goes into a rather tedious part towards the  ending which is almost written in the stream-of-consciousness technique,  save that it's written in the form of prose and not in separate lines, as  in Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. All in all, the story was somewhat  nice, but not as good as I thought it would be - keeping in mind that  Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby.	2000-03-02
US	49960674	R2L2W2AHNKJ7V2	0451518829	990924494	Sons and Lovers	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Tremendous!	Of all the 20th century books I've read, this is by all means the greatest. It's the wonderful - and at times heart-breaking - story of the Morels, significantly Paul Morel. It tells of his years as a boy and as a  man, the women he painfully loves, and his struggle to obtain peace of  mind. It's definitely a story worth reading, and one you're sure to like.	2000-03-02

Better than the story itself, was the wonderful language in which Joyce used in writing it. I think that the story is worthy of being accepted as a classic merely for Joyce's superb usage of words. Now, as for the story in  its self, it wasn't that great. I mean, it was good, but I've read better.  The story - a semiautobiographical account of the life of James Joyce - is  very emotional and at times makes you feel as if you're the main character,  Stephen Dedalus. Go ahead it and read it, just don't expect it to be a  roller-coaster ride.	2000-03-02
