With a hot cup of coffee, the kids asleep, and in my comfy lounge chair, I began reading.<br /><br />I couldn't help myself, but to read the entire book.  I didn't know what she'd be writing next, so I just keep reading and turning the pages.<br /><br />Many of the author's poems that have touched her life, has touched mine, and I'm sure many other people.  What she writes about is what happens to every woman at some point.  Happiness, Sadness, Death, Heartache, and being Blessed with Children, and then Grandchilden.  Her poems have the ability, though they came from her heart, to touch so many others.<br /><br />I hope to see more of her work published.  I truly enjoyed reading \\"Pausing to Catch my Breath\\".	2005-06-19

I bought this book because of the title, actually.<br /><br />I had not opened the book until I took my daughter to a concert she was in, and I would have a lot of time to wait for her.<br /><br />I took the book, yarn, and a set of needles with me to try it out.<br /><br />I was knitting in no time at all.  I actually did knit in one day.  No confusion, the left and right needles are different colors...and the yard to go around what needle is a different color to make it easier.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to learn to knit, I highly recommend this book for the beginner.<br /><br />The book certainly lives up to it's name.	2005-05-15

Ann Moura suggests as you read about each card, to use place the card from your deck on top of the printed card in the book....it's like hands on, and really gets you familiar with your deck.<br /><br />I highly suggest this book especially for beginners and those in the Craft of the Green Witch.	2005-02-27
