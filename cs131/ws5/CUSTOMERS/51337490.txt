The Abbey Theatre commissioned Heaney to do yet another for its centenary. In an afterword to this volume he explains the genesis of his version -- why he decided to do it and how. He explained his poetic tactics, as it were, and justified a \\"middle style\\" by referring to Yeats, who wrote of a \\"common\\" style he and others used -- many years earlier, of course -- in plays for the Abbey. <br /> <br />Hmm. There is no question that the language Heaney uses here is plain. It is possible to see his three-beat lines and his five-beat pentameter and his Beowulf-style 4-beat alliterative lines in the reading. What I don't see is poetry -- I don't actually even see much verse. The language seems neutral rather than charged. Poetry can use common words, but needs to cause shivers -- not in every line, but often enough that the reader keeps alert for more electricity. The various verse lines he uses are rather weakly distinctive: the forms hover around their ideals without touching them enough to keep a listener on track. <br /> <br />I saw the play performed by the Chicago Shakespeare Theater company on September 18, 2005. It played somewhat better than it read (e.g. the initial byplay between Antigone and Ismene, and that between Creon and Haemon). Still, though, having read it, I was listening carefully (hopefully?) for the beat of the verse -- or at least the feel of the verse. In fact, though the actors did a good job and did, as I think, justice to the text, it seemed rather flat. <br /> <br />Perhaps I disagree with the \\"plain\\" style. I think Sophocles was a powerful poet whose language rang with hard beauty and allusive power. He must have been. Perhaps, though, all this happened in the songs that the chorus, and sometimes the principals, sang. For another quarrel I have with this version is that it does not give any indications of choral parts -- strophe and antistrophe -- so even in principle it is not singable. What is more, this is a rather loose rendering of Sophocles play (a \\"version\\"), which does not really depart from the drama, but makes it more spare of expression. This comes at the expense of some of the specifically Greek elements, such as constant specific references to Zeus. Yet it is still a classical Greek play, just less of one. Moreover, there were no notes on the text, while there were at least a few puzzling parts that should have been noted, as well as the choral parts. But who knows -- maybe the Abbey Theatre made more of it than I can!	2005-10-10
US	51337490	R2KHQBM10UI91G	0195167716	960527707	Adams vs. Jefferson: The Tumultuous Election of 1800 (Pivotal Moments in American History Series)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A Racy Look at Our First Years, and Their Climax	This book covers much the same ground as The Age of Federalism by Elkins and McKitrick, but much more rapidly. In that earlier book no effort was spared to lay out the details of diplomacy and policy as they related to Federalism and the nascent \\"Republicanism\\". Here much the same is accomplished by focusing more on the personalities involved -- Jefferson and Adams primarily, of course, but also Washington, Madison, Hamilton, and (to a lesser extent) Burr and Pinkney. Hamilton does not come off that well, as the story is told from the points of view of Adams and Jefferson, both of whom disliked him (for quite different reasons), and feared him to a certain extent. So he seems more of a petty schemer than he really was. <br /> <br />Still, scheming was the order of the day -- Jefferson pursued his designs relentlessly and disingenuously. (Adams was not up to committing chicanery. Though ambitious, he was a socially clumsy intolerant moralist with an ungovernable temper.) The election of 1796 was the first real presidential contest, since Washington was not running. It was a warmup for 1800: the party lines were drawn, but party discipline was lax, so it had the awkward outcome of the prominent Federalist Adams becoming President, and the prominent Republican Jefferson Vice-President. <br /> <br />By 1800 the rancor between the two parties was greater than ever, and the electors were disciplined to vote as they were told by the party organizations, with the interesting result that Jefferson and Burr tied. They were both Republicans, and the leadership, expecting a few defections in the electors' 2nd votes, had expected Jefferson to win. So the election went to the House, and many ballots. <br /> <br />There is much here about the ways the voting went, and how each state's electors behaved. It shows rather clearly the flaws in the system, once there are parties. There is much here, too, on the political machinations of the various factions, much of it entertaining. This was a pivotal election: Jefferson won, and the Republicans had their way for a quarter century, and the Federalists just faded away. But more than that, the whole cavalcade of characters, who were consciously and unconscously setting precedents that would endure to the present day, has its own fascination.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the writing, and I enjoyed the narrative devices. To begin with, Ferling gives us interesting biographical sketches of the main players, taking them up to about 1789. As we know that the climax comes with the election of 1800, we can enjoy all the details and incidents of the previous years as contributing to the final event, and taking significance from that. This is a story, in other words, not just a recitation of historical fact. Moreover, it is gracefully written for a lay audience, with notes tucked at the end of the book. It is written as part of the series Pivotal Moments in American History. As that name suggests, it is not discursive, but focused. It accomplishes its object of illuminating one of those important turning points in our history fully, with interest, but with economy, too.  <br />	2005-03-30

Hamilton was a brave soldier, an astute politician, an extremely talented administrator, a great lawyer and a man of extraordinary personal morality and honor. These characteristics were enough to vault him to the upper reaches of early American society. But his financial and economic program -- that rescued this new and foundering nation -- is the true basis of his greatness. <br /> <br />Hamilton was a man of parts, not least of which was his technical mastery of the financial means to establish and maintain a sound currency and national credit. Apprenticed to a merchant at an early age, he quickly came to appreciate the mentally invigorating effects of the commercial life. He was naturally quick and, as in repudiation of his socially marginal origins, a rigorous adherent to morality and \\"gentlemanly\\" honor. His talents, hard work and charm bouyed him up, and he seized each new opportunity with both hands, for his ambition would not let him rest. McDonald tells the story of Hamilton's early years with vigor and interest, but it is clear that the thrust of this book is to elucidate his real accomplishment as Secretary of the Treasury. This was the funding and assumption of the debts that the just-formed United States had inherited, the taxes and tariffs to pay for these, and the financial mechanisms -- including the Bank and the sinking fund -- to create, as out of nothing (or less than nothing) a universal and sound currency, as well as a store of capital to fund businesses, which he felt must be the drivers of the economy.  <br /> <br />This book is fairly compact, but gives a good feel for Hamilton the man. If you want more in that line, then the current biography by Ron Chernow is where to look. But here you will learn what Hamiltondid that no one else could have done, and that needed doing. Even his enemies -- Jefferson especially -- found, though they repudiated the man and his politics, that in the end they couldn't do without his works.  <br />	2005-03-30

It is written by two Englishmen who are resident in America as top-level correspondents for \\"The Economist\\" magazine. As Brits, they stand outside the two great tribes of American politics, and their day job also requires them to background their biases and be good reporters. Thus it is that this is one of the very few books on our current politics that escews name-calling and rigged rhetoric. It is neither a dreary screed of right-wing triumphalism nor left-wing alarm, but simply the truth as its authors see it. <br /> <br />And it's fun. There are portraits aplenty in here of the great and the humble in modern right-wing politics. The current scene is masterfully drawn, and how we got here is cleanly and gracefully told. Mickelthwaite and Wooldridge make the point that the excesses of the liberal establishment, that had its way essentially from the New Deal through the Great Society, awoke the sleeping giant of conservatism. Finally, with startling speed and effectiveness the Right has invented institutions from which flow a torrent of ideas, created an army of personalities and footsoldiers to push them, and built a ruthless political machine to embody them. Whatever your politics, you need this book. It tells an important story, with its inspiring, sordid, and contradictory sides, that no one on the Right would want to miss, and no one on the Left can afford to.	2004-12-14

Understanding of development is new and still partial. Over the last twenty years or so scientists have been able to piece together the way certain well-studied organisms (the noble fruit fly, of course, the snapdragon, and a couple others) come to become from a single cell, how a growing body finds its orientation, its myriad internal shapes and differences, without any guiding intelligence. As we see this story unfold, we must again sit back in simple awe at the astronomical possibilities of protein, which makes the tools, the materials, the very jigs and benches where life comes together. <br /> <br />Coen does a good job in taking us on a tour of the issues that will be in play here. Biologists have been struggling for a long time with development, but it is only with the sophistication of modern chemical analysis and the viewpoint of DNA, RNA, and protein machines that the marvelous self-direction of the mechanism is starting to become evident. Amazingly, the flows of proteins from cell to cell via interdicting membranes, the interactions between proteins in one cell and those in another, the ability of a protein to change another, and -- singly or in combination -- to turn on or off specific genes (that do themselves make proteins that may furher elaborate this process) are sufficiently rich methods to build a body. Clearly such an assertion requires much detailed explication, and the author does provide this. But here I think he goes wrong by introducing an analogy to explain development. <br /> <br />The author chooses to bring in the idea of an artist painting a picture as a help to understanding the way an organism builds itself from a single cell. There is, in fact, very little about the way an artist makes a picture that resembles development, except perhaps the notion of progressive refinement. However, none daunted, he introduces \\"colors\\" to describe the presence of one or another Master Proteins, and \\"scents\\" to describe the effect of certain membrane proteins on the Master Proteins in contacting cells. These colors and scents dominate the discussion thereafter, but must, naturally, be briefly dispensed with here and there as he describes the actual mechanisms in terms of molecules, but then up they pop again. <br /> <br />There is nothing gained by this artificial isomorphism of color for molecule and scent for effect. An analogy, to be of some use, must give the mind a familiar structure as a map to an unfamiliar one. The spread of \\"colors\\" and \\"scents\\" along the segments of a developing fruit fly or diffusing dorsally/ventrally in a flower bud does not add anything. It actually requires an extra step to translate these colors back into the molecular populations they really are. This picture of molecules diffusing through a body is the conceptually simpler, as well as being, more or less, the actual. <br /> <br />As the book went on I found the discussions of symmetry and handedness to be protracted, and the conclusions drawn interesting but rather muffled by that leisureliness. Explanations of shape and proportion and of how particular patterns arise during growth were too vague, and lost in the talk of painters and painting. Certainly there is much interesting material in this book, but to a very great extent it can stand on its own. Let the occasional painting metaphor season the narrative rather than provide the main ingredient. <br /> <br />(OBSOLESCENCE CAVEAT: apparently the role of RNA in genetic regulation is just now starting to be appreciated. At the time Coen wrote, none of that was even suspected.)	2004-11-04

The predatory European powers were a danger. The states, suddenly demoted to mere parts of a much larger entity, had local interests that sometimes boisterously resisted the new central government. Even the location of the federal capital became a focus for plots and low comedy. Finally, the Constitution left many things unsaid that had to be worked out in these first few years so that the government could run at all. <br /> <br />The spine of the story, though, is the ideological split between James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, the two most brilliant exponents of the new constitution and partners in getting it accepted. They fell out over issues dear to Hamilton and repugnant to Madison: a national bank, funding of the Revolutionary War debts, and the encouraging of manufacturing and commerce. The assuming of the war debt by the new federal government and its funding through the new bank meant that various bonds, notes, and IOU's that had been floating around for years, and trading at about 1 percent of their face value, suddenly became worth something. The subsequent scramble to speculate in all this paper repelled Madison and Jefferson. Hamilton was more sophisticated than these planter-aristocrats in the ways of money, and he viewed the scenes of greed and folly as no more than the means by which the debt would approach to par value and, through the Bank, become an actual resource for the use of capitalists in need of loans. <br /> <br />Madison -- and increasingly, Jefferson -- very self-consciously formed an \\"interest\\": the Republicans. They stood for states' rights as against the too-vigorous centralizing tendencies they saw Hamilton encouraging. They stood for the independent farmer as against the \\"money men\\" of the cities and their dependent mobs of factory workers. How could the virtue necessary to a true democracy be nurtured in a dark Satanic mill or a counting house? <br /> <br />The interesting thing about this \\"interest\\" of theirs was that they dared not call it a \\"party\\": that idea was anathema to the age -- Washington himself spoke much against party and faction. But that Republican interest proved to be, in nascent form, the first political party. It was soon opposed by another equally self-concious \\"interest\\": the Federalists, whose guiding spirit was Hamilton. <br /> <br />This book traces the rivalry between Federalists and Republicans, parties before the age of political parties. The writing is fine, and charming portraits of the players in this drama, as they come and go, entertain even as they deepen the story. The authors' scholarship is well equal to the task (the book won the Bancroft history prize), and they rather playfully take time here and there to revise certain received ideas about the period, without simply setting up a new dogmatism. They are particularly strong on the diplomatic games that were afoot with France and England, to keep us out of their wars and out of their clutches. But basically it is a portrait of that most interesting time in our country -- its beginning.	2004-11-03

He expects things to be plausable even when they are not amenable to controlled testing. From the way he even-handedly discusses religions and their gods, as well as the very idea of God, I would make him an agnostic. \\"Can mystical spirituality be reconciled with science and, more broadly, with reason?\\" he asks, in his introduction. He is a journalist, and so his seeking takes the form of interviews with people prominent in various of the areas -- the \\"perennial philosophy\\", psychedelic drugs, meditation, and so on -- that are associated with the rather imprecise term \\"mysticism\\". In preparation he studies with some care the writings and reputations of those he will talk to as well as the \\"classical\\" works on mysticism and altered mental states. Moreover, he brings with him the memory of an extreme psychedelic episode of his own. <br /> <br />Then, basically, he subjects the claims, wild and mild, of the seekers, sages, and scholars with whom he talks to the test of a skeptical rationality. Sometimes they fail on Horgan's terms; sometimes they even fail on their own terms. But fail they do. To his credit it never seems a foregone conclusion that he will not embrace one or another approach. He is, after all, himself a seeker -- though of course also an author with an eye to the market -- but one for whom the need for the consolations or exhaltations of an altered perception seems to be qualified by his firm grounding in this world. <br /> <br />This book is easy to read and entertaining. The writing is clear and accomplished without being grandiose, and Horgan seems a civilized and warm-hearted guy. But he is not really into psychedelics or other drugs (although he did participate in an ahuasca ceremony for research purposes), and in the end he rather mildly concludes that perhaps the Zen exhortation to just pay attention to your life is the best we can usually do. I suspect that, for those of us that share his rational humanist outlook, our spiritual yearnings will have to be satisfied in the low-key way he finally arrives at.	2004-10-07

But it probably served me better than it would have someone who came to it to learn to use HTTP in Web programming. I cared more about the overviews of routers and servers and such, and the conceptual issues involving HTTP -- what it is and how it works. But to actually use it I would want some examples -- even just one example. Instead, we get a couple of random programs -- a mini-server in PERL, and a C program that sets up an HTTPS session using the OpenSSL routines (which themselves remain undefined). <br /> <br />The book has interesting material, but much redundancy, and much irrelevancy (chapter 19 on publishing systems is particularly worthless). Several of the appendices seem just dumps of publicly-available web sites, or, what is worse, long selections from them. The authors are good, though, about pointing to various useful web sites at chapter ends and in the appendix. But what this book really should have done, while explaining general concepts, is provide detailed documented examples, involving various configurations of client, server, router, and so on, that would illustrate exactly how HTTP is used.	2004-10-07

Each is English, has a doctorate, and writes in an engaging and literate way about evolution. Matt seems more interested in what is called \\"evolutionary psychology\\", discussing social issues in the light of our evolved traits. Mark is more the scientist, pursuing the fundamental questions of life. This book is about such a question: why did complex life evolve at all? <br /> <br />At first that might not seem like much of a question. The hard part, after all, is to get \\"simple\\" life -- a bacterium. After that, given enough time and the creative power of DNA mutations, complex life is more or less inevitable. Right? <br /> <br />Actually, from the evidence it seems that simple cellular life evolved rather quickly -- within a few hundred million years at most -- after it was possible for any life -- that is, after the planet had cooled down and water was mostly liquid. Yet, after that it may have taken two billion years for the eukaryotic cell to arise. That is such a large part of the total amount of time life has been on the planet that it is very possible that the eukaryotic cell might never evolve at all if the history of life were rerun. <br /> <br />And, according to Mark Ridley complex life -- multicellular life -- only arose because the genetic mechanisms invented by the eukaryotic cell allowed it. Complex life is complex because it has lots of parts, and requires lots of DNA, which must be duplicated from generation to generation. Copying errors turn out to be a limiting factor once you get to billions and billions of \\"letters\\" in your genome, even with the various enzymatic mechanisms for checking and correcting DNA copies (invented by bacteria billions of years ago and never improved upon). For bacteria, 99% of their offspring are perfect genetically, since their DNA is short enough that errors are unlikely. For us, we're lucky to get one or two perfect gametes in a hundred. So how in the world can we go on, generation after generation without degrading like a much-xeroxed document? <br /> <br />In a word, sex. This is really the crux and subject of the book: sex, gender, and the peculiarities of meiosis are there to overcome the daunting problem of copying error and allow beings with lots more DNA than a bacterium to quite faithfully reproduce themselves generation after generation. Even without any steamy scenes sex and gender are fascinating, and Ridley's explanation of why we have them (sex and gender are not the same thing) is convincing and entertaining. But I will say no more about that. You will just have to read the book, which I recommend, with some reservations. <br /> <br />I like Mark Ridley's writing. His sentences are graceful and laced with wit and learning. Where he falls down, though, is in the explanations, or justifications, for the material he introduces. The ideas of copying error and how it plays out in different organisms was new to me, as were the arguments justifying sex, gender, and the peculiarities of meiosis. On the way to them there were also various subsidiary conclusions, and in few cases were his explanations terribly coherent. At least part of this book had its genesis in lectures, and it shows. There are small inconsistencies: he refers to the new result of 30,000 genes in a human, for example, and later casually throws in the older presumption of 100,000, no doubt in a section lifted from an earlier talk and never corrected. But more annoyingly, his basic style of argument is what an old math professor of mine called \\"hand-waving\\". This is where you talk fast and plausably to skate over difficult points rather than using logic. Lectures to a lay audience tend to be mostly gee-whiz facts, jokes, and hand-waving arguments. Ridley is not that casual here, but still induced a kind of mental whiplash by discussing in excessive detail rather obvious points, and then making a sudden jump across an intellectual chasm toa daring conclusion, then blandly continuing. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I would recommend the book for its very interesting subject matter and breezy style. But I would add that you might find yourself wishing for a bit more rigor. Or not.	2004-10-06

Thus it claims to resolve the nature-nurture debate by meeting in the middle. <br /> <br />Ridley persuades by accumulating examples and evidence that most of what we do and are has a genetic basis, but that that is just the beginning of the story. That basis is only a potential until various genes are waked up (and others put to sleep) because of particular kinds of experiences the person carrying them has that they, the genes, have been \\"waiting\\" for. In their turn, then, the genes will cause development or behavior that creates yet more experience that further works on those same or other \\"expectant\\" genes. Thus learning to see: early childhood experience is critical, as the baby's brain is sorting out the signals from its eyes, and setting up for binocular vision and the perception of shapes. \\"Without visual experience in the first months of life, the brain cannot interpret what the eye sees.\\"(p164) And of course everyone knows that one cannot learn to speak a language natively after a certain age. In fact, from conception through senescence our genes are constantly in action, responding to our environments, and developing and running our bodies and minds. <br /> <br />So much research today points to the fact that environment can mold us only in so far as our basic makeup (our genes) allows and facilitates it; at the same time, our genes can control us only through coming to action in different ways depending on our differing experiences. Ridley takes care to make the point that our genes do not work simply during early development, but constantly, throughout our lives. <br /> <br />He has also written a couple other books that each explores a single topic in human evolution: The Red Queen on sex, and The Origins of Virtue on our tendency to think and act as members of a group. In this book, as in those, he has a rather scattershot approach that uses current research in the field under discussion along with more general arguments and wide-ranging contributions from other areas to accumulate evidence toward his particular point. His style is easy to like: it is clear (with occasional muddiness in technical explanation) and colloquial, and is lightly spiced with literary references that pay us the compliment of assuming we are familiar with them. <br /> <br />However, as in The Origins of Virtue, the point he is making is a bit slippery. Certainly, the total of what he has to say does buttress his contention that nature and nurture are both required to build a human, that genes are not destiny any more than environment is destiny (which means that both or either might be in some circumstances, and neither in other circumstances). But this proposition is not so much proved as prostrated by a thousand cuts. Whether or not you come away convinced (and I think you will), you will certainly come away entertained.	2004-10-05

This entails a sacrifice of depth to get the necessary breadth. But the task he has set himself is still to provide sufficient rigorous detail on the topics he includes (bichemistry, energetics, geology, geochemistry, etc.) to give the reader a basis for useful understanding of the complex thing that is the biosphere. It is necessary, as he asserts in his preface, to synthesize rather than specialize if we are to address the pressing questions about our living environment, which sprawls -- physically and intellectually -- over the whole world. And if you follow the references -- or just leaf through the bibliography -- you must come to realize the immense amount of learning and research that undergird this presentation. <br /> <br />The patron saint of this volume is the early 20th-century Russian scientist Vladimir Vernadsky, who was the first to use the term \\"biosphere\\" (actually, \\"biosphera\\") in the grand and inclusive way that the rest of the world is now getting around to doing. He calculated (or estimated or guessed) the primary productivity of the green world, the standing biomass divided into its varous categories of land and water autotrophs and heterotrophs, the interrelationships between life, the sun's energy, the composition and behaviors of sea and air, and the grand geochemical cycles. And Vernadsky was hopeful: he expected a planet-wide consciousness to arise that would manage the biosphere intelligently. <br /> <br />Since then, hope has waned as our knowledge and power have grown. Humanity is stressing the systems of life as much, perhaps, as any catastophe in Earth's long history. Yet this book is a hopeful gesture: it is an attempt to get a grip on the issues in play so we can act with some effect to reverse or slow the degradation of the air, land, and waters, and to restore nature to a state of robust health -- or at least to givenature some breathing room. Smil has chosen to treat in detail the questions of the origins of life, its possible existence elsewhere, and its fundamental biochemistry. He talks about life in the mass -- as a storehouse for sunlight, and as a participant in the great cycles of material through the atmosphere, waters, within the mantle of the earth, and out again. He talks about the physical constraints on life's productivity, the dynamics and organization of the biosphere. And always he is concerned with magnitudes and their relationships: it is not enough to discuss the amount of plankton in the oceans as an isolated fact. Rather, its mass and its turnover, its powers of energy sequestration, should be compared to those of land plants, and productive and unproductive sea areas contrasted. <br /> <br />It is implicit in this approach that the numbers matter. We must know the size and extent of things that we wish to affect or to stop adversely affecting. After all, without some sense of the magnitude of the particular flows of material or requirements of particular facets of the living world, we can waste our efforts on what amount to side issues. However, I wish the presentation had been more user-friendly: many of the charts and graphs were lifted from technical publications, and the others had that feel. The ultimate goal of all this numerizing should be -- let's face it -- a sort of pictoral understanding. To that end, I would have liked some synthesizing graphics that showed (maybe with fat arrows and thin arrows, big, little and even teeny-tiny barrels (or trees or bugs...)) how facets of the system compared, and at a glance showed the relative \\"importance\\" of things. <br /> <br />I know that mere magnitude is not always a safe guide to how important something is in the workings of the world. A rather small quantity of CFC's in the stratosphere has had immense effect, for counterexample. Small amounts of bottleneck chemicals like phosphorous control the richness of life in otherwise productive areas. And how unimportant is a rare -- and biospherically useless -- species? <br /> <br />Anyway, I cheer this parade of fact backed by much research and aided immensely by our current generation of planet-spanning monitoring devices. This is hard science, and it gives us baselines and error ranges, without which all discussion finally devolves into opinion and political posturing. Yet, when the last graph is in place, we go right on despoiling the world. The problem is not so much a technical difficulty as it is a matter of societal will. Smil admits as much in his last chapter. All that has gone before is not even really prelude. Without the active cooperation of the political entities that partition this vast human herd the environment cannot be saved. This is the hard part. It is rather a letdown, getting to this point in the book, to realize that science is powerless in the face of a desire to ignore it.	2004-10-05

But all conservation of wildness is self-defeating, for to cherish we must see and fondle, and when enough have seen and fondled, there is no wilderness left to cherish.\\" (from \\"Marshland Elegy\\") <br /> <br />\\"It must be poor life that achieves freedom from fear.\\" This, from reflections on being caught on horseback during a lightning storm, is a comment on the \\"civilized\\" mindset that wanted all to be safe, and so feared and destroyed wildness. <br /> <br />These essays were written mostly in the 1940's, although some of them are about earlier times in the author's life. In a way, reading Aldo Leopold is like watching Humphrey Bogart in those old movies, with his smoking and tough-guy sexism. We understand these as disreputable today, but can put them in context. Likewise, Aldo Leopold was in many ways a typical countryman of his time and place. He loved to hunt and fish, and even reflexively shot wolves, like everyone else. He came to regret that, and in fact to realize that in the new era, where hunting and fishing have become mass recreations, that the old ways just don't work anymore. But they did in his day, and he does not retrospectively apologize for having been, in a sense, just another predator. <br /> <br />But he was also a college professor, and an expert naturalist and ecologist. In this book he is a poetic writer about nature and a loving reporter of all things wild. No matter where I lived I would love this book, but having lived not too far from his sand counties and walked his restored prairies makes it the sweeter.	2004-09-04

The authors thoroughly explain HTML (and its recently-standardized twin XHTML) in its latest version (4.01). They also give a good explication of layout using the current standard (CSS2) of Cascading Style Sheets. They spend some time talking about embedded content such as pictures, Java applets and Javascript scripts. They look, too, at XML, which is the \\"meta-language\\" used to define XHTML. <br /> <br />At the time they wrote this book (2002) the versions of the standardized languages they discuss were in the avant-garde. But many of the old ways of doing things are now obsolete, and older browser versions gone. Unfortunately, the authors constantly advert to these early browser versions and their quirks, and spend much time discussing outmoded and non-standard techniques that by their own admission should be avoided. (Let me emphasize that they whole-heartedly approve of the direction away from non-standard and layout-laden HTML and toward the CSS approach.) <br /> <br />As it is, this book is quite usable whether you are writing old-fashioned HTML and loading your documents with physical layout instructions, or writing austere strict-version XHTML and restraining yourself to using style sheets to do layout. It has detailed essays on all the tags and a good chapter on CSS, and has useful appendices at the end for HTML grammer and tags, and for style sheet properties. It also has much that no longer applies. Perhaps the next edition will be less universally useful -- but also lighter.	2004-09-03

In this, though, he is moving more confidently into the political arena. His goal is nothing less than the total demolishing of three ideas that he names &quot;The Blank Slate&quot;, &quot;The Noble Savage&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost in the Machine&quot;. <br />  <br /> The Blank Slate asserts that we are, mentally, essentially the product of our environment, rather than having any prebuilt dispositions or (in the purest version) even talents. The Noble Savage is the idea that man is a naturally peaceable creature that would live harmoniously in cooperative groups were it not that pernicious social forces turn him violent and selfish. Finally, The Ghost in the Machine is our soul, our free will, our ineffable &quot;humanity&quot;, that is not caught in the net of DNA and protein, neurons and synapses, that make up our brain: whatever that brain is doing, it's not doing it all; some part of us is divine or at least &quot;spiritual&quot;. <br />  <br /> OK, I can hear you thinking, that's great: all these ideas have been controversialized to death. Everyone has taken his or her position, and all the arguments that do not reduce to wishful thinking or religious conviction have been made, remade, and believed or not. The topic is dead, or at least in cryogenic storage awaiting some further dramatic developments. <br />  <br /> Wrong. I admit I was sceptical for the first several pages that Pinker would have anything new or interesting to say (and such a fat book, too!), but knew him to be smart, learned, and witty. And since he is in my philosophical camp I was not averse to a bit of preaching to the choir. His position is, basically, that the Blank Slate is wrong, the Noble Savage is wrong, and the Ghost in the Machine is wrong. No suprise there: he is a modern scientist who specializes in cognition and embraces the viewpoint and results of evolutionary psychology. <br />  <br /> Where he differs from most writers, other than in sheer brilliance, wit, and mastery, is in fair-mindedness. He is concerned to take the best arguments of positions that oppose his own and argue against them. There is always a danger, in a debate stage-managed by the author (in Galbraith's phrase) that the opposing view will get short shrift, or get distorted. Pinker is responding, I think, to years of this sort of thing by writers on both sides of these issues. He really wants to put to rest The Blank Slate, The Noble Savage, and the Ghost in the Machine, and knows he can do it only by being fair -- and being seen to be fair -- in making his (devastating) rebuttals. <br />  <br /> The foregoing does not begin to convey, though, the richness and interest of this book. It is a tour of much of what we know for sure or are starting to learn about the mind, development, and social life. It is rigorous but not pompous, and is packed with interesting anecdote and observations. In fact, one reading does not begin to do it justice. (Which is why I have just read it again.) <br />  <br /> Naturally, these three ideas will not really be demolished by this book -- they have too large a constituency. And it is the case that many of Pinker's intellectual opponents will simply ignore him -- for now. I feel that this book is so good that it will finally become impossible to ignore. I hope that in time it puts to rest -- at least among serious and thoughtful people -- some harmful and divisive ideas that really are not a matter of opinion.	2004-07-22

Much of the material is old stuff to Wilson fans from such books as \\"Biophilia\\" or \\"The Diversity of Life\\". The theme is, of course, the massive degradation of the biosphere by man, and how to salvage what richness of life remains. While most of us are aware of the perilous state of wilderness and wildlife (as the gloomy coda to any nature show on public television reminds us), we tend not to dwell on it - it is so sad and, we feel, so unavoidable. But sometimes one must come to grips with things.<br />This book is a good start; it was written in 2001, so is pretty current. Wilson covers the ground quite well, and uses many specific examples to illustrate the general state of nature. He starts with an entertaining summary of global biodiversity, then moves into the problem of a vast, growing, and industrializing human population. He also talks about those relatively few spots that are most productive of species - usually tropical rainforests - and how important these are to the effort to retain something of what we are losing. After this he shows the ways that man, that predator without peer or restraint, is such a relentless force for extinction - and always has been.<br />After detailing the problems, Wilson launches into solutions, both the Why and the How. The least convincing chapter is \\"How Much is the Biosphere Worth?\\" His dollars and cents approach here is probably not a good idea - it is that sort of thinking, with its human focus and equating of value with money, that got us into this mess. (Interestingly, he seems guardedly in favor of transgenic agriculture as the best hope to feed the new hordes coming on line without having to chew up all the remaining wilderness just to grow crops.) But the world's best-known naturalist soon gets back into his comfort zone in admitting that we really wish to save the living world simply for \\"the love of life\\".<br />Wilson is an optimist: in spite of all that has been lost he feels hopeful and he details the ways effective private organizations are targeting important areas in the tropical lands in order to save the maximum of biodiversity. He also, and this is important, takes care to defuse the usual Us and Them stance. \\"We\\" are good, low-impact users of the planet, \\"They\\" are ruthless, short-term exploiters. Wilson has been on enough panels and committees of the great and good to realize that these are caricatures: what mostly divides us is politics; if we can forget the human for a while, we can usually meet to help the rest of nature.<br />Of course he is repeating himself in writing this book. But people tend to read the latest on timely topics, and the point of his effort is to get sympathetic readers to pay attention again to the crisis and also to bring new converts on board. E. O. Wilson is a scientist with enough prestige and with such concern for all the life on our planet that he will probably be writing this book every few years for as long as he can.	2003-08-12
US	51337490	R3HTRIEF26W2FC	0521272505	566196712	Antony and Cleopatra (The New Cambridge Shakespeare)	Books	4	10	11	N	Y	A Discerningly-edited Edition	This is a review of a specific edition of Shakespeare's \\"Antony and Cleopatra\\" - namely the New Cambridge edition of 1990, edited by David Bevington.<br />The book is a good size, and the print is easy to read. There are about 70 pages of front matter in this edition, and, on each page of the play, copious notes. Following the play's text, there is a discussion of general editorial choices and approaches, supplementing the specifics covered in notes.<br />The front matter dutifully took up the sources of the play, its dating, structure, stage history, and a number of other topics. I found it occasionally a bit heavy going, as, in many sections, any straightforward statement seemed to be buried under a pile of citations from various critics. This was by no means always the case, and in such things as stage history I found the discussion brisk but entertaining.<br />The text was thoroughly annotated - too thoroughly for my taste. It did not get tedious, as in the Arden editions, but still, too many notes were devoted to specific editorial decisions, and too many supersized with references to other plays. I guess there is some interest in this, and one does not have to read the notes one does not want to, but it does tend to slow one down. This is good though, if one wants to delve. Moreover, virtually every word or passage that might cause difficulty is discussed and interpreted, which is certainly what one wants.<br />In summary, I would say this edition is well worth having: it gives one most of the information one could conceivably need, does some interpretation, and explains the text helpfully. It does not include a transcription of Shakespeare's main sources (although this is done piecemeal in the notes), nor a plot and scene summary. These would have been nice, but are not necessary.	2003-08-12

As it turns out, Bob Smith is a fascinating man with a talent not often celebrated, but that is absolutely central to art: he is a supremely-gifted appreciator.<br />He loves painting and music and, centrally, Shakespeare. He never went to college, never wanted to learn to drive. Art museums and live theater are his ideas of heaven. He's done directing, acting, painting. But basically he loves being an audience, and feels it is his job to teach others how, as audience, to participate fully in Shakespeare's art. For him the Bard is redeeming, and is just the tonic for those that have to peel life down to its essentials - the old and the dying.<br />This is not a book that will teach you anything much about Shakespeare. True, chunks of his language punctuate the text, but Bob Smith is trying to talk about his own life. He tells his story in parallel threads - his present and his growing up.<br />There is a terrific sadness coupled with an almost manic energy and feeling running through this narrative. Paintings and Shakespeare started out as ways for Smith to escape the pain in his life, but quickly came to provide their own meaning, interest, and, primarily, joy.<br />Two or three centuries ago it was not uncommon for a person to have but one book - the Bible. He or she would read it daily, sometimes just for comfort, sometimes in bafflement, sometimes with understanding. It was vast and lasted a lifetime; its images and language permeated waking and sleeping. I don't doubt that Bob Smith reads the paper, devours an occasional trashy novel, and watches some television. But without his having explicitly said so, he leaves the definite impression that his central, focused, daily meditations are in the texts of Shakespeare. He has read them all many times, and still he finds and works new veins of meaning. What a glorious way to live, and how difficult, in the Age of Information.	2003-07-08

Not only that, but perfect strangers can sometimes tell us things about our personality that we didn't know.<br />Wilson, a psychology professor, is not really going out on a limb here, but rather reporting the strong results of recent research (some of which is his own) on the \\"adaptive unconscious\\". The new view of the mind that is gradually being built up by controlled experiments is often at variance with Freud's compelling but fanciful views on the unconscious and repression. The current model has the mind composed of a conscious part and, perhaps, several unconscious parts, each of which has a special ability, like recognizing faces, responding to emergencies, or selective remembering and forgetting. The author normally lumps these specialized parts together for purposes of discussion, since his intent is to contrast our conscious mind with our unconscious, and to re-evaluate what it is we can know about ourselves through examining our conscious motives, thoughts, and feelings.<br />Anyone who has ever been surprised at an emotion that has come over him, seemingly from nowhere, or by his actions in a new situation knows how disconcerting it can be. Are one's conscious emotions just fake - placeholders for real feelings that well up when one isn't looking? Are one's firm intentions just flimsy self-deceptions that are blown away by the right circumstances? It's probably not that bad (usually!), but we should know just how much of what we feel and think and think we remember is under our conscious control. The author is not really in the self-help business, but he does recommend several things we can do to find our real selves - and even to change. His tone is modest but hopeful: it's true that self-knowledge is elusive, but one can find out important things about one's self by indirect means. One can even influence one's unconscious, so change is possible. Perhaps an introvert will never become the life of the party, but he can take action to readjust his socializing comfort level so as to at least enjoy the party.<br />This book will interest someone who wants to see what sorts of things psychologists are learning about the mind these days, or who just wants to learn some things about his own mind. I liked it. In spite of the fact that much of the time we are running on autopilot, Wilson by no means absolves us of the responsibility for our actions, and gives us techniques  and suggestions that help us to control our (often obstreperous) unconscious minds. Most usefully, he points out that self-knowledge is not simply \\"there\\", nor is it particularly easy to get. On the other hand, he made me realize that there is a new person that I might want to know better - myself.	2003-06-04

First of all, you must care about the long-running nature/nurture controversy that swirled around the publication, in 1975, of E.O. Wilson's book Sociobiology. Also, ideally, you have long sympathized with Wilson as against his main critics, Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould. That is, you must have long felt that Wilson's assertions in that book and later ones about the heritability of cultural and mental traits in humans were reasonable-perhaps wrong in some details, but certainly interesting, and good starting points. Finally, you should find it intriguing that these three biologists were all at Harvard, and had offices in the same building.<br />I fit the bill. In 1979 I read Michael Ruse's book \\"Sociobiology: Sense or Nonsense?\\" (Sense, he concluded.) I had no sympathy for using Marxism to critique work in science or anyplace else, which is where Lewontin and (less-blatantly) Gould were coming from. Moreover, there was something so right about the idea that humans have predilections that work themselves out in culture, and so exciting about the prospects for this kind of self-knowledge, that I felt the critics of the sort of research that Wilson was proposing were spoilsports, indeed.<br />But the time was not right. The critics got the best of things early on, and the name \\"sociobiology\\" acquired such a stigma that those who wished to do research (and get funded) in genetic influences on the human mind were advised to tread lightly and call their work something else. But things changed. What emerged in the 1990's was something called \\"evolutionary psychology\\", a new name for bad old \\"sociobiology\\", now respectable and in tune with current public attitudes, which have made a massive shift to a gene-centered view of - well, of just about everything.<br />Have I just given away the game? Perhaps, but you will have to take my word for it that this book is fun to read - if you enjoy the thrust and parry of ideas and the clash of egos. And, of course, scientists' pettiness and careerism is more entertaining than their usual posturing on pedestals engraved with \\"The Noble Search for Truth\\".<br />In 1980 and 1981 a young (I assume) Ullica got interviews with the main protagonists in the debates - Wilson, Lewontin, Levins, and others in America, plus various of the British contingent as well, such as Dawkins and Maynard Smith. Her area of study was the sociology of science, and she did some shaking and baking early on, using her material for contingent articles. But she kept a weather eye on how things were going in what was really a clash that exposed cultural fault lines in evolutionary biologists who were, fundamentally, on the same side. (Creationists they were not. Some of them might want to refine Darwin, but certainly none of them wanted to reject him!)<br />Now is a good time to sum up the course this debate has taken over the last quarter-century. The original political rationale seems quaint, and the focus has shifted to concern about how genetics and environment interact - it being more or less agreed that both are crucial. (Thus, an Hegelian synthesis of the dialectical process!) If you wish to know the history and drama of issues such as genes vs. environment, kin selection, group selection, the place of moral responsibility in a world of genetic \\"determinism\\", then this is the place to come. These and other issues are explored in a quietly comprehensive way. The personalities also come out, and the whole has the feel of a story, which of course it is, to its main players. And to you, too, if you take it up.	2003-05-01

Yeats: Poems (Highbridge Classics)	Books	4	18	20	N	Y	A Good Selection, Competently Done	This is a single cassette in one of those tall boxes that could hold two. The notes are sparse - just a listing of the poems and a capsule bio of Mr. McKenna. The package also claims 80 minutes worth of poetry, but the timings printed on the tape itself for each side (35:29 for side A, 34:04 for B) leave us more than 10 minutes shy of that. I myself have not done the requisite timing, but tend to believe the (spurious?) precision of the tape's numbers.<br />The readings are workmanlike, and the selections are good. All the famous poems are there, and a good deal more. (Offhand, the only other one I would really like included is \\"Lapis Lazuli\\".) Unfortunately, the old recording by Siobhan McKenna (related?) and Cyril Cusack is no longer available. It was truly magical.<br />My gripe with this is the fact that you need to keep this oversize box around to hold your tape, and to preserve what scanty documentation there is. A regular cassette package with an included info sheet would have been better.	2003-05-01
US	51337490	R56XNKKS3BYWM	1885266405	407965399	The Poem's Heartbeat: A Manual of Prosody, Revised Edition (Story Line Press Writer's Guides)	Books	4	55	56	N	N	A Friendly Lecture on a Forbidding Topic	This (sub)titles itself \\"A Manual of Prosody\\", as it indeed is. Actually, it is a manual of the dominant prosody of the English-speaking world since 1500 or so, the accentual-syllabic sort. Other possible prosodic disciplines, such as accentual, durational, and syllabic, are mentioned and briefly exampled, but finally are dismissed as antique or foreign. Which they are: there is little point, in a book that is not a treatise, in taking up such matters.<br />So, as a manual on English-language prosody (and, to a lesser extent, verse forms), how is it? Not bad, actually: it's an easy read, and its points about varying stress levels in iambic lines are illuminating. The book introduces technical terms as it goes along, but makes no effort to highlight them. Some are indexed, but not all, so a glossary would be helpful. On a couple of occasions I found myself puzzled at his use of terms. He had covered them, but in a low-key way, and there was no easy way to get back to the discussions other than by searching through unmarked text.<br />His discussion of free verse is general and, appropriately, he talks mostly about what it is not, since it does not follow the rules of traditional prosody. (Someone else will have to tell me what it is.)<br />This book would be more helpful with visual aids. The parts of a verse line could be illustrated, and various verse forms entabled. A glossary or detailed index that allowed one to go from a poem that one is trying to analyze to a discussion of relevant points would be nice, as would a few sample deconstructions of real poems.<br /><br />Having said that, I do think that the author has achieved his stated aim of writing an introductory work on the subject, presupposing no, or little, prior knowledge. He includes fragments of poetry to illustrate his points, but not terribly much. One should probably reinforce what he says with readings from some anthology of classic poems.	2003-05-01

His writing is colloquial and accessible. It's hard to explain, but in its context that sentence above is amusing. This book is an easygoing but fairly detailed tour of cellular life. It brings us down to the level of the cell - even the bacterial cell - and then begins to investigate how things look from that perspective. <br />From a cell's-eye view, big molecules are important parts of the landscape. Particular types of macromolecules and complexes have just a few (hundred or thousand) representatives, so each is important to the cellular economy. From here, it seems as if we can, almost, understand how a cell lives.<br />Franklin Harold shows us, in broad strokes with descents into telling detail, what he knows, and what he (and everyone else) does not know at this point about the life of cells. This book gives us a rich picture of life at the most fundamental level, and shows us, too, the puzzles that are the subjects of current research. With his pictures of cellular action, metabolism, and growth, he is attempting to answer Shrodinger's question: what is life?<br />We know immensely more than we used to about the details of life's machinery. But do we understand how all that intricate, mixed-up chemistry can get up and live? Harold insists that we do not, and that these questions of biochemical detail have so mesmerized us that we no longer are even asking - as if understanding emerges from a pile of facts.<br />Franklin Harold's motivation is not lack of interest in these details (they occupied him during his years of research), nor an anti-scientific despair that says life can only be understood in some holistic and intuitive way. Rather, it is in the spirit of what is now called Complexity Theory (and used to be called General Systems Theory). Life seems to be an emergent property of the complex system we callthe cell, whose many interacting parts we more or less understand if we think about them in isolation, but whose real-time interactions are too complicated and involve too much feedback to be grasped directly.<br />He pursues this question, too, in reviewing the current state of science as it investigates the origin of life. His agnostic, but still hopeful, take on much of the rather vaporous speculation that fills in for any real results in this area rather appeals to me.<br />This book is the best sort of popular science: it gives plenty of hard fact and cogent reasoning, but avoids the trap of exhaustive textbook detail. It is a surprisingly slow read: although the author is skilled at telling us what we need to know, he is reasoning along with us about fundamental matters that are part of the dialectic of current research. When you finish this book you will feel that you have been given a straight shot of some of the heady brew that biologists these days are imbibing.	2003-04-09

The author teaches in a university botany department. These days its clear that fungi are actually more closely related to animals than they are to plants, but they have always been thought of as a vampirish offshoot of the plant kingdom, so to botany departments they go.<br />This is not really a primer on fungal structure and function, but it does manage to quickly give us a feel for the basics. Fortunately, it is possible to get to the fungal forefront, as it were, relatively quickly. These are fairly simple creatures, as creatures go. (Of course, the simplest cell is complex beyond our most complicated machines.) They are more colonies (or rugged individuals) than multicellular beasts, and most of the action centers in figuring out how they reproduce, and the cocktail of chemicals they use to go where no fungus has gone before.<br />In this book the author talks about a range of topics, such as human and animal fungal pathogens, how the different kinds of fungi make a living, fungal sex, poisonous mushrooms, and so on. But he also profiles some of the more eccentric (and productive) researchers in the field. In the course of the book, in many ways, he profiles himself as well. Our author turns out to be a thoroughly engaging sort, humanistic and unpretentious. Youll like him, and learn something about mushrooms, molds, and mycologists.	2003-03-07

Truth to tell, I didn't use it too much, but did like the various sections. I read it and got a pretty good feel for the facilities available on a Windows system. And it was good on TweakUI and a bunch of other stuff tucked in various dark corners.<br />This current incarnation of the \\"Nutshell\\" series left me disappointed, though. It has a lot in common with its predecessor, and has an excellent middle section: the Alphabetical Reference to Windows Components, which is itself about 250 pages, and pretty much gives you all the programs that come with and in Windows XP, what they do, and their command-line parameters. <br />This is the reason to own this book. Just to take another book I have around, \\"Windows XP Inside Out\\" (a Microsoft book) for comparison: it has over 1400 pages, and covers most topics of interest exhaustively (and exhaustingly), but has no list of any sort that would allow one to browse through which programs the system offers. Occasionally, and in a very low-key way, they will refer to a program you can run to do something relating to the topic at hand. But just try to find a reference to anything resembling it in the index! Moreover, they never give a model command line for a program. This Nutshell book, then, shines in this area. It also, more or less, tells you which facilities only apply to the full-blown \\"professional\\" version, and which apply to both that and the Home version of XP.<br />However, the rest of the book is less useful. There are nice general tips and definitions in the first three chapters, and there are later sections on keyboard shortcuts and system menus. There are chapters on the Registry, Networking, and the Windows Scripting Host. However, these are little more than introductions to the topics, so not much use if one needs to actually do something with the information.<br />But what really gripes me about this book is the number of errors it contains. Now, I know that computer books like this one are incredibly dense with facts, and a few mistakes are unavoidable. Still, consider: on page 520 they give a sample VBS script to illustrate error handling. It has two obvious mistakes in it. OK, now go back to the 1999 book, \\"Windows 98 in a Nutshell\\", page 466. Same script, same dumb errors. Hmm....<br />No, what REALLY gripes me about this book is its lousy index. If failed me most of the time, and even if it did list a topic, it didn't list it in all the spots it was covered. Too often, it just listed some passing reference, and missed a whole section devoted to the topic. That says to me that some deficient piece of software was used to index, and no human bothered to even see if the final product was reasonable, much less functional. (Looking again at \\"Windows XP Inside Out\\": its ratio of index items to text was over twice as great as this book's, yet even with that improvement, its index is not that good.) A technical book lives or dies on the quality of  its index. This book is definitely not in the pink of health.<br />Having said all that, let me say that indexing is crucial, but requires a devoted, technically savvy human to do it (using computational aids, of course). This costs money, and time. Computer books are published for the nonce, not for the ages, and all too often the index is viewed as having no more point than has that tired leaf of lettuce underneath your tuna salad at the local diner. Perhaps there's some official Microsoft tech book on XP that gives all its facilities in a complete and logical way, with a fully-functional index. At this point I don't know. ... this book will prove useful to anybody who has to cope with XP. Of course, you'll need other books, too....	2003-02-26
US	51337490	R21KD8NHIEL4KQ	0871138565	125376897	The Hungry Gene: The Science of Fat and the Future of Thin	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Healthful Appetizer	This book takes as its starting point the perception that people are getting too fat in general, and that a significant percentage of adults and even children are actually obese, and that THAT percentage is growing alarmingly. But our author, a journalist and academic, does not spend much ink talking about the gradations of the weight problem, the culture, the unintended consequences of our getting bigger, and so on, but jumps right into the research on obesity.  Everyone admits there is a problem. Can science solve it?<br />Maybe. But first science has to decide what the problem is. Of course, research is not done in a vacuum: the holy grail of obesity investigations is a gene that controls appetite or one that controls fat storage, whose protein can be interdicted or encouraged without complicated side-effects. As Shell makes clear, great fortunes await the researcher and his or her institution for such a magic-bullet solution to the overweight problem. Some of the workers portrayed here care deeply about the monetary rewards their research might yield. Others have rather deliberately chosen to go at the questions differently, for rewards of different sorts.<br />About half of this book is given over to a blow-by-blow of various salients into Fat Science, as it were. There are the usual portraits of crusty or visionary or harried or just plain human scientists as they talk about their work, and their hopes for it. The writing here is pleasant but not dazzling, and sometimes the science is presented without sufficient prelude. But along the way we do learn something about the physiology of fatness, and also about those relatively small number of people for whom obesity is truly a disease. For must of us, overweight is no more a disease than taxes, but about as avoidable. <br />But the real subject of this book does not really kick in until almost two-thirds of the way through it. The real subject is how our eating habits and hopes are simultaneously fed and increased by the food and drug industries. Each, in its own way, caters to our dreams and our weaknesses. And, as Shell points out, nobody is really telling us to stop eating too much and taking too many diet pills of uncertain effect.<br />I think our author is trying to lay the blame for our excesses at the feet of profit-making corporations, with their power to influence government, and their massive, seductive advertising. To a certain extent the science at the beginning of the book paves the way for the social statistics at the end, yet the two sit rather uncomfortably together. And there is little discussion of the reasons we overeat. They must be more complicated than just corporate conspiracy: modern life has disrupted so many traditional social patterns. At bottom, though, this is a book about our health, and for anyone interested in THAT, a pleasant, if unsettling, read, and a good source.	2003-02-26
US	51337490	R32TTVEJX3QUVG	0679429328	701258128	Charles Darwin:The Power of Place	Books	5	65	67	N	N	A Wonderful Life	Well, this is volume II of a magnificent two-volume biography. In its patient, sympathetic and intelligent rendering it exemplifies those qualities in Darwin himself. Moreover, this is truly the second volume. One could read this without having read \\"Voyaging\\" and make sense of it, but Darwin and his world would be less fleshed-out, he and his friends would not be old friends of yours, and the story, which is nothing less than a whole life well-lived (but not, be it noted, perfectly-lived), the less thereby. And what is more, the Darwin-Wedgewood genealogy is not reproduced here - you need volume I for that.<br />Darwin, for someone of such stature socially and scientifically, was a rooted, private man. He rarely left his spacious, gated home at Down except to visit one of his few good friends or relatives. His public appearances were nearly as noted as the Pope's. In spite of this seeming exclusiveness, he maintained an immense and warm correspondence all over the world. Alfred Russell Wallace, for example, was one of his good friends, but almost entirely by means of letters. Moreover, he received a constant stream of visitors at Down, many of whom were hardly known to him, and some of whom barely spoke English.<br />However, these visits were rarely extended beyond a courteous lunch. Darwin would often plead weakness or illness (or let one of the womenfolk do it for him) in order to get away to his study and his studies after being dutifully social. Of course, if it was Huxley, or Lyell, or Hooker visiting, then Darwin had considerably more strength for conversation. These old friends formed the core of his scientific network, and, along with Asa Gray in America, were his representatives in the larger scientific world.<br />The story of Charles Darwin is the story of a homebody: he did most of his experiments with jury-rigged apparatus in his house, garden, or greenhouse, using his children as assistants, and begging and borrowing plant and animal material from his friends and correspondents all around the world, without himself going anywhere. It is the story of a man who loved his wife, and needed her, for he was always \\"poorly\\", and he was always busy. It is the story of a man who was warm and affectionate, and constantly a-tingle with some absorbing project in natural history. Yet it is the story of a supremely absorbed man, who was as totally selfish in his dedication to his obsessions as any artist, ruthlessly (but charmingly) using the people around him and around the world to further his investigations, and shield him from those social duties that soak up so much of the lives of most of us.<br />Janet Browne gently disapproves of Darwin's selfishness, which was consistent and on at least two occasions (when he refused to go to the funerals of old friends who had helped him tremendously) nearly unforgiveable. Yet she clearly liked the man, as did almost everyone who knew him (including some of his ideological opponents). He preserved himself for his work, it is true, but he still understood the obligations of a Victorian gentleman of means. He was active in the village life at Down, using his money and time to promote worthy causes of benefit to the poorer residents. He also had a soft spot for animals, and spent much energy opposing unthinking cruelty to beasts whenever he encountered it. He also was the prime mover behind getting a government pension for Alfred Russel Wallace, who had fallen on hard times, as well as many other quiet gifts to science, and to individuals.<br />On balance, Darwin was a tremendously appealing man, and his life, personal and scientific (which were totally intertwined, both domestically and socially) a model of Victorian striving. Prudent and successful in investing his money, an obsessive list-maker and careful household manager, and a famously hard worker in his science, he came by his success, as he felt, honestly. But to me the appeal of this book lies in its location in Darwin's domestic and social milieu. This also happened to be his scientific milieu, for most of his friends, and some of his relatives, were scientists whose interests overlapped with his own.<br />This book picks up the story in 1858, when Darwin got a letter from a man known to him only as a collector, Alfred Russel Wallace. He was stunned to see that his pet theory of speciation by natural selection had occurred to Wallace during his sojourn in the jungles of the East. The cat was out of the bag, so Darwin thought he might as well write down what he knew, including his researches during the previous twenty years into the topic. This book just grew and grew, and finally became \\"The Origin of Species\\"; the main narrative thread of Darwin's later life is, of course, the fate of this \\"child\\". After 1859 he was suddenly a household name, and a fit subject for political cartoons and pulpitical denunciations. Within a few years \\"Darwinism\\" was a noun in general use. He himself spent tremendous energy in surreptitious efforts to get his theory accepted, and did not scruple to let his friends, like Huxley, savage his enemies, like Owen.<br />Janet Browne gives this story its due. As always, her mastery of the material is complete, and she tells a complicated story gracefully. But more than this, she is attuned to the sociology of the situation. She understands how scientific ideas gain acceptance, as well as how the nascent industry of popular publishing contributed to the success of Darwin's ideas among the larger public. One of the recurring pleasures of this book is to enjoy her observations on the social issues that impinge on this life story. <br />Further, it is a measure of her almost novelistic skill that our attitude toward Darwin's life changes almost insensibly: though we may have come to his story because we were curious about an idea, we are sad to see it end because we have come to care about the man himself.	2003-01-17
US	51337490	R2LZHR9VZKKDVO	0465069908	288556280	River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life (Science Masters Series)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A Well-evolved Viewpoint	This is a slim volume that summarizes Richard Dawkins's views on evolution. Dawkins is known as a pure Darwinist (\\"neo\\"-Darwinist, of course). He has taken the idea of natural selection to its logical conclusion in locating the units of selection in the atoms of life, the genes. As he puts it, \\"the great universal Utility Function, the quantity that is being diligently maximized in every cranny of the living world is, in every case, the survival of the DNA responsible for the feature you are trying to explain.\\" (p 120) His book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; is an extensive explication of this thesis.<br />This is a book in the Science Masters series, aimed at a lay audience looking for the big picture in some area of modern science from a name-brand expert. Herein, Dawkins delivers. He is reassuringly positive: there is no waffling about issues that might, in other venues, be hotly disputed. Of course he knows that some things he is saying are just his (considerably-informed) opinion, but the people are not paying to hear faint-hearted qualifications, but rather, boldly-asserted sharp-edged facts.<br />The author's prose is justly admired for its mixture of clarity, culture, and wit; the tone is as one intelligent, reasonable person to another. He never bludgeons you with his learning; the facts are displayed because they support the current discussion, but he hopes they amuse you as well. Here, the discussion of \\"African Eve\\" is too sketchy, though. I found myself drawing descendent trees to get a handle on some of his points. Perhaps, in fact, many readers will find the whole book too sketchy. It is, of course, a short treatment of topics that Dawkins does develop at book length elsewhere. But if you just want the facts, (ok, theories) and can skip drawn-out demonstrations, this may be the book for you.	2003-01-07
US	51337490	R14VUVA8XC6EUL	0674637526	738728156	On the Origin of Species: A Facsimile of the First Edition (Harvard Paperbacks)	Books	5	59	64	N	Y	The �Origin�-al	NOTE that this is a review of the Harvard University Press facsimile of the first edition of \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (intro by Ernst Mayr). This is NOT a commentary on Darwin's text.<br />I blithely bought and began reading the Modern Library's \\"Origin\\", then came across this facsimile of the first edition in the library. Hmm, I wondered. I used the quotations in the front of my copy to deduce that I was reading the sixth (and last) edition, rather than the first. While that, too, has its considerable interest in illustrating the twists and turns of Darwin's thought during those years, the evolution revolution was made by the first edition. As Ernst Mayr says in his introduction, \\"When we go back to the Origin, we want the version that stirred up the Western world, the first edition.\\" Besides which, if one is going to do any historical research, one needs this edition, for contemporary references use the first edition's pagination.<br />But most importantly, this is the firstborn of Darwin's mind, long gestating, and contains his most confident and positive statement of his thesis. He had tried to anticipate all the major objections to his theory and answer them preemptively here. Still, at the time of this writing he had no critics, so the tone and content display none of that waffling that mar, to a certain extent, the final edition.<br />This volume was put together in 1964, and Ernst Mayr's introduction dates from that time. It is a good historical introduction to Darwin and his contribution, and some more specific remarks on the first edition, its general approach and some of its path-breaking arguments. Also included in the extra matter is a bibliography of Darwin's published works, plus current works on evolution, as of 1964. There is also a quite comprehensive index of the text, which should make the book considerably more usable to us than it was to Darwin's original readers.<br />My only gripe is that Harvard University Press only offers a paperback, although it used to have a hardcover edition. The paperback version is readable enough at 5.5 by 8.2 inches, yet it's too thick for its size, and, while definitely not of poor quality, vulnerable to the binding breakage typical of the breed, so serious scholars of the work might find themselves literally pulling it apart. For you and me, though, it should be just fine.	2003-01-07

It covers lots of ground in its 400-odd pages of text, in short. Perhaps I learned some new things, perhaps not. The problem is that this God's-eye view leaves out almost all the detail that connects us to particular times and places, although Blainey takes care to come down to earth periodically and talk about actual events and people.<br />I found the writing pedestrian, and was occasionally frustrated at the way the author passed over periods and points that would have been interesting. Of course, that's the way it goes: a history is selective, but a history of the world must be very  selective. However, it is perhaps the very general level of facts that kept them from making much of an impression on me. I assume much was said, but most of it seemed so reasonable and high-level that I felt like I knew it already. (Whether I did or not: making a high-level statement is a risky business, and it looks as though Blainey has done his homework.)<br />The latter part of the twentieth century gets far more than its share of space, of course. But perhaps it deserves it: in some ways, more is happening to the human community each decade these days than happened during each millenium at the dawn of civilization. I'm afraid we do live in interesting times.	2002-11-15
US	51337490	R4JAVTNIV7Y5U	0691026068	503525538	Charles Darwin: A Biography, Vol. 1 - Voyaging	Books	5	82	84	N	N	Brilliant and Delightful	When I see a biography that tops out at over 600 pages, I usually give it a pass. I mean, how much do I really want to know about someone - anyone? Also, as far as Darwin goes, I had already read the excellent life by Desmond and Moore. Yet I went through this book avidly, and would have been sorry to see it end - but that I knew volume II was waiting!<br />I actually only noticed this book because of the laudatory reviews that appeared recently for volume II (\\"The Power of Place\\"). Perhaps it is true that I cannot get enough of Darwin, so I was drawn to this as any addict to his fix. But I think that for me the most appealing thing about Charles Darwin is his quintessential Victorianism. He lived and worked in a privileged position in a culture that was as sublimely self-confident as any the world has ever seen, and that, moreover, bestrode that world as none before or since (our blundering and half-hearted imperialism not excepted).<br />Actually, the Darwin Story is becoming canonical. Our culture is about the clash of narratives as much as anything else. The Free Market opposes the Welfare State, the Promise of Progress is really the Erosion of Identity, and, most shrilly, the Blind Watchmaker threatens to displace the Christian God.<br />So, I suppose that to read this book is to choose sides. Shame about that, but there it is. Anyway, even if you know the story, this book (and its sequel) will tell it better and deeper. Janet Browne has not only mastered the Darwin materials, but his milieu as well. She seems to have gone far afield in researching the lives of those that impinged on Darwin, just in order to make throwaway statements and large judgments on people who are perhaps bit players in his life. They, of course, have lives of their own, fully lived, and like a novelist, Browne hints at more that she tells. The occasional summarizing aside of some life that glances on Darwin's gives this book a novelistic texture and feel. The author has pulled off the difficult trick of making us feel she is telling a story that she owns. <br />Browne starts with a leisurely scene-setting that places the Darwins and the Wedgwoods (Charles's paternal and maternal lines) in the Georgian society of the day. She discusses the culture and the family traditions, and places the players in the landscape and houses them grandly. (Very helpful here is a generous genealogy in the front matter.) We see young Charles carefree and out-of-doors, with his loving and indulgent older sisters and his great friend, older brother Erasmus. We see him rather reluctantly growing up, attending Edinburgh University and then Cambridge, where he is unscathed by the official curricula, but emerges with firm friends among some bug-loving students as well as the naturalists on the faculties.<br />About one-third of this book covers the voyage of the Beagle, the forming event in Darwin's life as a scientist. Of its five years, Darwin spent more than three of them on land, exploring, collecting, and observing all up and down the coasts of South America and, finally, in islands of the Pacific (including, most famously, the Galapagos).<br />When Darwin got home his troubles began. All the glorious collecting and larking about of his school days and the grand adventure on the Beagle were over. Those experiences drew on his enthusiasm, energy, and growing expertise in zoology and geology. Now, back home, he had to make something of himself, he had to secure an identity. Could he use the physical materials he had gathered and his position in society to do it? Darwin's real story begins when he steps off the dock after five years away from home.<br />Browne tells this life in a quietly gripping way. The vast amount of material that she had to integrate does not get in the way of the tale, but allows her to tell it seamlessly. She never lets the narrative bog down in irrelevancies, but always paints a full picture of the scene, giving its human, intellectual and socialcomponents their due.<BR> <BR>The story of Charles Darwin is really the story of an idea. Darwin was the central figure, but Hooker, Wallace, Lyell, Huxley, and many others had important parts to play. But in the progress of abstract ideas the personal is important: a strong motivation for Darwin's secrecy with his thoughts on evolution was to avoid distressing his wife Emma, a fervent believer in a Heaven where she would be reunited with those siblings and children so cruelly taken from her. Browne always shows this human side to science, shows that science is a quite human endeavor. And in this volume she takes the story up to 1856, as Darwin finally decides to take the plunge, after a dozen years of doubts and obsessive preparations.<br />Now, he will write a book....<br />After he writes that book, Darwin's life is never the same. Actually, after that, nobody's life is the same. Big drama is coming up in volume II, so why bother with this book? It is entertaining and brilliantly done, but is just prologue, right?<br />I disagree. In fact, if you just glance through \\"The Origin of Species\\" you will see that Darwin put most of his life up to that point into his book. And his later life was built firmly on the foundation of his earlier: he made the friends and formed the ideas that were to become central in the controversies over natural selection. Themes have been stated and developed. Volume II will develop them further, and introduce new matter, but does not tell a separate story.	2002-11-13

If that sounds like an excessive qualification, it isn't, since the book is about houses, a subject dear, or dire, to the hearts of very many middle-class married men.<br />David Owen definitely writes as a guy. It's conceivable that a woman could enjoy this book, in the same way that some men enjoy reading Erma Bombeck. It's also true that many a woman these days finds herself, willy-nilly, the sole proprietor of some \\"huge box filled with complicated things that want to break,\\" and so will see that this book is essentially inspirational and non-gendered, and will read it anyway. It's for anyone who has a house and doesn't know how that house works. Because if you have a house and don't know something about how it works, you will regret it, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.<br />The author is a writer for, among other publications, \\"The New Yorker\\", and he has the easy, colloquial, accomplished style that we associate with that magazine. This is not a \\"humor\\" book that tries to milk laughs out of the trials of a hapless urbanite who buys a 200-year-old farmhouse and gets his comeuppance. However, he was indeed a Manhattan apartment dweller with a wife and two young children who decided to buy a 200-year-old farmhouse in Connecticut, and certain mishaps and learning experiences did follow from that action. Some are laugh-out-loud funny, but mostly you will find yourself reading along with a smile that is composed of one part sympathy and two parts relief (\\"at least my house isn't THAT screwed-up!\\").<br />Mainly, though, in the course of your reading you will learn a lot. David Owen is a professional writer, and he knows how to research a topic, be it wallboard or lumber or electricity. (Perhaps the finest part of the book is the section on wallboard and plaster.) But he's also just an ordinary guy and a home-owner, until fairly recently just as butt-ignorant as you about how a house works. He lives in a this-old-house sort of place, and most of us don't. (Although once-fine old houses do present an implicit challenge that some of us fantasize about taking on, when our skills are a bit more honed.) His discussions, though, are firmly rooted in what many of us brood about on an almost daily basis: ugly walls, bad wiring, roofing leaks and wet basements.<br />But courage! A house need not be a millstone. It can be that fort Mom never let you build. If you're a grownup you can actually go out and buy power tools and plywood and all sorts of other neat stuff, and then you can come back home and make your house better.<br />Or worse. One of the virtues of this volume is its cheerful attitude toward working on one's home: that it is essentially a pilgrimage. Nothing is ever final, and every failure, every flub, teaches you something. Perfection is not the object, but rather, engagement. After a number of years of living in it, and coping with it, your home will become, for better and/or worse, an extension of yourself. If you love yourself, eventually you will love your house, too, with all its endearing faults.	2002-10-17

Always excitable, Wittgenstein brandished a poker, then put it down. Soon he left the room. Did he threaten Popper with the poker? Did he storm out of the room in response to a clever quip of Popper's? Eyewitness accounts vary.<br />\\"There was a delightful irony in the conflicting testimonies. They had arisen between people all professionally concerned with theories of epistemology..., understanding, and truth. Yet they concerned a sequence of events where those who disagreed were eyewitnesses on crucial questions of fact.\\"(p4)<br />The authors use this rather well-known (to academic philosophers) but murky incident as a focus for a book that takes us back to the Vienna of the Hapsburgs, where the extremely wealthy Wittgensteins moved in the highest echelons of culture and social life, and the more modest Poppers also enjoyed the wide and deep intellectual life of this city of coffeehouses and tolerance. Later (but before the storm) there was the Vienna Circle, which courted Wittgenstein and excluded Popper. (Or did he exclude himself?)<br />This is a book about two great men who were both Viennese, intense, egotistical, brilliant, and contentious to a degree rarely seen. To each, every discussion bearing on philosophy became a contest that each had to win, and almost invariably did. Ironically, they never met until that night in 1946, in Cambridge, England, of all places. So it is also a book about philosophy in the 20th century that brings in G.E. Moore and Bertrand Russell (who was there that night), Moritz Schlick (the founder of the Vienna Circle), Rudolph Carnap, Stephen Toulmin, and a host of smaller fry.<br />The writing is fast-paced, as befits two journalists, and the philosophy is mostly honored in the breach, as befits a popular history. Yet we get a good feel for the issues in play on that night in Cambridge. Those of you who have struggled with Wittgenstein will find nothing here to change your view of him as a charismatic genius (but possibly totally wrong!), but the less-well-known Popper emerges as a driven man that had to win on this most esoteric of playing fields. What impressed me most about this tale was that for these men philosophy was not redemptive or illuminating. They seemed not \\"philosophical\\" in the old Socratic sense, but possessed by skewed needs that this strange cloistered university atmosphere salved, because they could show their strange skills to advantage here. Anyway, this is a delightful look at an intellectual milieu that is mostly gone, but was wonderful and strange while it lasted.	2002-07-25

Science does the same sort of thing; what makes it difficult for people is the often technical language it is couched in, and the exactness of the conditions it specifies and predictions it calculates. Yet over time science tries to learn from its mistakes (in spite of the rearguard actions of many older scientists!) and revise its views of the world, just the way a sensible individual does. The only difference between the common sense of an individual and that of a scientist is this business of technical language and precise definition. In our ordinary lives we don't bother to define things very well, because we are talking to ourselves or a few others in our circumstances. Besides, we have only one life, and setting up controlled experiments is usually out of the question. <br />Still, people form theories of the world that they act upon in their personal affairs, and change those theories if they don't seem to work. In this way, Bronowski insists, we are all scientists. We may believe in angels and lucky numbers, but we know that boiling an egg or shooting a basketball well or getting a good seat in the movies requires the application of our intelligence to the world. (For that matter, we may believe in angels but find that it makes more sense to depend on ourselves.)<br />Bronowski wrote this book in 1951, in the shadow of WWII, the atomic bomb and the new and more terrible hydrogen bomb. Moreover, quantum mechanics was still quite bizarre and controversial to the mass of scientists, nor had they really absorbed the deeper message of Relativity Theory. In 1905 Einstein had shown that there is no \\"out there\\" to be studied: the observer and the observed are, and must be, intertwined; to look at something is to interact with it.<br />The workers building up quantum mechanics absorbed this tremendous insight and added one of their own: that cause-and-effect descriptions of the world may not always be available. One should be satisfied, in the realm of the very small, with predicting a range of probable outcomes and specifying no particular underlying mechanism that controls them.<br />This book discusses the massive shift in attitudes these two new views required of scientists. Ironically, the average layman was more used to dealing with the world in these ways: one learns about the world by participating in it, and all thought of the future must be provisional, because the world always has surprises in store.<br />While these thoughts were penned half a century ago, the issues are still current. Also, of course, there are a myriad of newer and sexier books discussing these issues, and relating them to newer technologies and more recent science. Yet Bronowski's book is still a good authoritative read. He was a mathematician and participant in much of the intellectual ferment of the time, and knew many of the thinkers, such as Fermi and von Neumann. He is a master of the intellectual history, and this is a book that relates scientific attitudes to the cultural milieus in which they grew up. But especially, this book is worth reading because it gives a rounded picture, in rich, intelligent prose, of an issue that is of concern not merely to scientists, but to all of us.	2002-07-23

Eiseley does not really tell you much about his life. He was, it seems, a reasonably successful academic archeologist, and was certainly a well-known and well-loved writer of essays that are beautifully-written speculations on the nature of man, of time, and of nature.<br />He has been a solitary since his lonely and isolated childhood. It's clear that he has always loved animals, who are creatures he can love and who yet do not break in on that solitude. He married, but had no children. He intimates that perhaps his upbringing was responsible for this (failure?).<br />If you are interested in this book, it is almost certainly because you have been entranced or transported by some of Loren Eiseley's essays. Here you will not be disappointed in the prose,   which still has an otherworldly charm, but you may be left hungry for more actual details of his life. We read biography because we want to know what a person did, who he knew, and what happened to him. Here, you will find much interior monologue, and a few key incidents, but be left wondering about much. It was not clear to me how his character was forged out of his Nebraska childhood; though there are hints of his mother's role, there is not much on his father. He seemed to have had a reasonable amount of worldly success, but we're never sure how he fared as a writer and as an academic. His attitudes seem always to be those of a scorned outsider, yet this cannot be entirely accurate (otherwise why this book?). He was a teacher and a scientist, but we never get a good sense of what he did in those lines. These central activities get only the barest indirect mentions.<br />The control here is rather loose; at one point Eiseley spends a number of pages talking about paradigms (as we would call them now) in science, in connection with the book Darwin's Century, which he published in 1958. This is intrinsically interesting stuff, but really does not belong in a book devoted to a quite different topic - namely the life of the author. While we could excuse it by calling this an intellectual biography, it really is not, as the rest of the book attests.<br />Eiseley could be the dedicated and disciplined scholar, as in Darwin's Century, but preferred the speculative essay. This book is really such an essay, but rather larger than he was used to writing. It has not the coherence of his shorter pieces, so is mainly missing the revelatory power his prose could bring to bear on a small incident. Yet, for what it does say about the mind and feelings of a remarkable man that I wish I had known personally, and for the graceful way it says it, this book is well worth reading.	2002-07-12
US	51337490	R3C62S5G48VH5S	0375753729	355244229	Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat (Modern Library Paperbacks)	Books	4	13	13	N	N	On the Trail of a Demonic Idea	This is an enjoyable history of thermodynamics. Maxwell's Demon does not actually come into it until about half-way through, and then becomes, gradually, the focus. Von Baeyer's approach is to advance his topic short chapter by short chapter. Each chapter treats the work of a man (alas, in science women have not, until recently, played much of a part) as it relates to the growing knowledge of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The ideas, the experiments, the intellectual milieu, and the subject's life are all fair game in these little essays, and all are treated in a clear, serious, but still light-hearted way. The writing is very pleasing, the author's humane, humorous and cultured personality shines through.<br />The point of the book, of course, is to explore the Second Law of Thermodynamics, using the Demon invented by the physicist Maxwell. It has proved a remarkably troublesome sprite in spite of all the attempts to exorcise it over the years. Here you will learn some thermodynamics and some history, and when you are done you will have a general idea of the issues swirling around the notion of entropy. After reading this book, you very well might want to get your feet wet in an introductory text on thermodynamics, now that you know some of the issues in play. Or, if you already know some, this will fill in the human background, and may alert you to some current thinking.<br />One of the current issues is the relationship between the entropy from Information Theory and the entropy from Thermodynamics. As various folks keep trying to conflate them, our author reports on it. The discussion is detailed enough to actually convey some of the ideas that trouble modern researchers, and tantalizing enough to make the reader want to know even more. What else could one want from a popular book on the subject?	2002-05-29
US	51337490	RD2Q8Q6KARXHZ	0452011671	968238352	The Oedipus Plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Fine Example of the Translator�s Art	I'm not sure how to rate this book. For one thing, I don't know much about Greek drama. However, in some respects no one does. Our author tried to be faithful to the original in ways he feels are important: \\"I have tried to walk and to run, to rise and to sit, with the Master, but never by imitation, only by analogy, transposition, re-creation.\\" He has given us the three plays in iambic lines of varying length, with inventive syntax and vocabulary (sanctioned by the example of the original). I got annoyed with the verse at various points as it seemed just wrong: the expression seemed not to reflect the intention, and words were used (dare I say it?) sloppily. Now, I know I'm on shaky ground here. For one thing (a big thing!), I have not seen the plays performed. Moreover, our author knows the Greek, and he may be reflecting it quite closely, and my criticism should be directed at the Master. On top of that, Paul Roche, from his introduction, is clearly a good writer, so I must assume that the odd things he does he does deliberately. <br />But, anyway, as he says in a note on meter in the Appendix, \\"Indeed, the danger on the stage is not that poetry should sound monotonous but that it should not sound at all.\\" He has quite a bit more to say on the subject, which is an important one. Sophocles wrote in an \\"iambic\\" meter rather than prose. In fact, it's possible that writing a play in prose, or good parts of it in prose, made as much sense in classical Athens as writing song lyrics in prose would now, and for roughly the same reason. While the actors may not have sung all the words, certainly the chorus was singing, and song hovered around, heightening the action.<br />Having said all that, I think our author does some very good things. For one thing, he does give us a good verse translation with all the choral markings - the Episodes, the Strophes and Antistrophes, with nice summaries at their heads. He brings the speech into reasonably colloquial English without sacrificing the \\"beat\\". (As an example of that, I particularly liked the byplay between Creon and the sentry in \\"Antigone\\". Here he gives the sentry a Cockney accent and Creon the voice of one of those impatient stuffed-shirts in a screwball comedy.) Overall, he achieves the right balance between vivacity of expression and dignity. His introduction and appendix are informative, opinionated, and well-written. In summary, this is an excellent version of these three plays (only a trilogy by coincidence).	2002-05-29
US	51337490	R10RQWDF7GRGG7	0345404335	46057174	The Wars of the Roses	Books	3	18	20	N	N	A Competently-told Chronicle	The time was fascinating enough for Shakespeare to have devoted three plays to it, and several more to its prelude. The various descendants of Edward III were fighting each other for the crown of England (and parts of France) throughout the middle 15th century, in a battle of cousin against cousin (even brother against brother) that later on became known as The Wars of the Roses. In this book Alison Weir gives a blow-by-blow account of the various conflicts in the reign of Henry VI and Edward IV. She has a long prelude wherein she sets the stage with the deposing of Richard II by Henry Bolingbroke (who became, then, Henry IV), his subsequent career, and that of Henry V, who died leaving the baby Henry VI king, setting the stage for the power struggles to come.<br />Weir has clearly mastered her material, but still this story seemed curiously lifeless. There are murders and betrayals aplenty, and even occasional selfless and heroic behavior, but presented rather matter-of-factly. Besides this, there are a couple of problems that I see.<br />One is perhaps typical of a history: unless the historian has the flair of a storyteller, it just becomes one damn thing after another. I found little that was compelling in a narrative with great possibilities, nor motivation for what seemed to be bizarre behavior on everyone's part.<br />Another problem here was simply in a lack of supporting material. Maps of territories being contested, and diagrams of battles, would help to place these events in space and give each fight an identity. What is more, a dense chronicle like this one needs to be bristling with dates, perhaps as a running comment in a margin. We are given the day and the month constantly as things go on, but I found myself having forgotten the year, and unable to find it. Rather than constantly wading through detail, a reader should be able to get out and see the wider picture from time to time, too. <br />It is with some relief that I turn to the Henry VI plays, even though the history is compressed and distorted to serve the drama. In Shakespeare, it all makes sense, somehow.	2002-04-24

But, as Jones says, \\"It would be presumptuous to present this essay as more than a shadow of its original, in content or in form.\\" Moreover, \\"The Origin is...a work of high Victorian seriousness, with no concession to any desire to be entertained. In these more flippant times I yield to the temptation to leaven a scientific narrative with tales from the curious history of evolution and those who study it.\\"<br />Ok, fair enough. So, what is this book's intended audience? In Darwin's case, he was writing to the educated lay person of his day, which mostly meant Victorian gentlemen of conventional morality and religion, but interested in science, and with minds that could follow an argument and be changed. But he was writing to scientists mainly, and was acutely conscious of the need to be comprehensive, clear, and conservative as regards the evidence, and rigorous in argument.<br />Jones is not writing to convince his audience that all the variety of life that we see about us arose out of simpler forms (or, even, just one simple type of proto-creature) by descent with modification over eons of time, with the environment doing the selective breeding, as it were. His audience should already believe that. (Those that most vehemently do not are certainly not addressed here.) Rather, he is giving us an informal survey of natural history in its great and entertaining variety, using Darwin's great argument as a \\"scaffolding\\" upon which to hang his discussions. Throughout he implicitly assumes that you accept the reality of evolution. What he is doing is guiding you through its implications and outcomes in a great number of ways. Thus, for example, Darwin used the chaotic nature of the geologic strata to argue for various events that could fold rocks or raise ancient seabeds up to the tops of mountains by referring to Lyell's theories, which were still controversial. Jones simply assumes we believe the by-now-well-established facts of geology, and uses these to discuss the spottiness and contrariness of the fossil record.<br />Thus, Jones has a much easier task than Darwin had, so can have more fun with his material. And he does have fun, and so will you. This book is entertaining and enlightening: if you are familiar with the main arguments for evolution, it will remind you of them, and enrich your feeling for them. Jones talks widely about nature and the issues raised by natural selection. However, if you have never before encountered arguments for natural selection (\\"descent with modification\\"), then perhaps you should consult some more diagrammatic and focused work that lays bare the logic behind it. And then read this book.	2002-04-04

By way of contrast, Ian McKellens reading of Fagless translation of The Odyssey clocks in at 13 hours, 10 minutes. One would think, then, that this version must leave lots out. Well, yes and no. It covers all the main adventures Odysseus has, nor does it hurry over them. (In fact, the Trojan horse sequence, which is just alluded to briefly by Homer, starts the story here and is given an expansive treatment, much of which actually comes from later writers.)<br />So, Odds Bodkin tells Odysseuss story in full in four hours. Then what does he leave out? He leaves out Homers expansive way of telling a story by means of repeated heroic epithets and extended dialogs. He leaves out the gods, mostly: their part of the story is brief indeed. All the careful planning that went into the defeat of the suitors is left out as well. It leaves out the adventures of Telemachus. All Odysseuss entertaining fabrications during his travels, these have been excised. And, as this version is intended for children, it leaves out the gruesome scenes at the end where the unfaithful servants are killed.<br />You might say that it leaves out most of the matter that locates the story in a certain heroic pre-classical culture. Yet some flavor of that culture remains, and the well-known incidents in the story are certainly given their due. Thus we have, in addition to the Trojan Horse, Scylla and Charibdis, the visit to the Underworld, the cattle of Helios, the Sirens, the Isle of the Lotus Eaters, the Cyclops, the misadventures on Circes isle, and the long languishing on Calypsos isle. And it finishes up with a bang as Odysseus strings his mighty bow and lets fly an arrow through all the aligned ax-heads, then, revealed, turns in wrath upon the suitors who have been besieging his wife.<br />This is certainly an entertaining version, and an excellent way to learn the story for child or grownup. Odds Bodkin is good at voices, so he can differentiate his characters well. This adds to the fun as he mixes accents and verbal mannerisms (Polyphemus reminded me of the Cookie Monster) in an energetic and colorful telling. It also helps that there is a more-or-less continuous musical background. Celtic harp and 12-string guitar are rarely obtrusive, but rather provide push to the narration. <br />Anyway, to us, The Odyssey is a story, not a guide for living, but it is one of the central stories of our culture. And here we get that story (without undergoing trial by recitation), which is all that most of us want, really.	2002-04-03
US	51337490	R21YSK3UB7RZXL	068481434X	394552213	Shakespeare's Kings: The Great Plays and the History of England in the Middle Ages: 1337-1485	Books	4	2	2	N	N	An Absorbing History, but Not to be Confused With the Plays	This book tells the story - long, confusing, but connected - of the English kings of the late Middle Ages, from the downfall and death of Edward II in 1327 and the accession of his son Edward III. His successor Richard II was deposed and killed by the Lancastrian Henry IV. Then followed his son Henry V and a great time for England against France in their ongoing Hundred-Years War. His son Henry VI was so ineffectual he set off the long bizarre dynastic scuffle called the Wars of the Roses, from which the Yorkist Edward IV finally emerged. He had his own middle brother, George, killed, but his youngest brother, the infamous Richard of Gloucester, slaughtered his way to the throne, holding it for a tenuous two years as Richard III, until the resurgent Lancastrians finally got rid of him and the whole bloody Middle Ages, and put Henry VII (the first Tudor) on the throne in 1485 - the first decent ruler poor England had seen in a century and a half.<br />This was the period that Shakespeare chose for his history plays. To the Elizabethans these events were still reasonably current (as our Civil War is to us), and yet enough removed - and of a different dynasty - to be safe in the playing. (Not quite: Elizabeth's (former) favorite Essex paid for a special performance of Richard II, which concerns the deposing of a legitimate monarch, and soon after he was proclaimed a traitor.) The politically savvy playwright wanted to walk the fine line between telling the ripping good yarn of these brutal yet colorful fellows, while somehow not tarnishing the gloss of the monarchy itself.<br />But Shakespeare was no historian. He has modified the story to suit political and dramatic exigencies, and often, it appears, by mistake. The dynastic interweavings are confusing, and his sources had gaps and contradictions, so sometimes he misplaces characters and events. More often, though, he has to tell a long story in a short time, and give it some push. Thus the compression and conflationof events, the exaggeration of character.<br />Ok, so maybe watching the plays is not the best way to learn English history. Certainly, Norwich brings this home. He gently but relentlessly documents Will's departures from the actual history, and they are legion. Every once in a while, in this book, he devotes a chapter to the particular  play that \\"covers\\" the material he has discussed to that point. Basically, each of these chapters goes through the play at hand - I Henry IV, say - and shows how it deviates from or hews to the truth. After a few of these chapters, I just skipped them: the tale Norwich tells in his history sections is great fun, but the Shakespeare chapters simply drive home the point that the plays are at best approximations to the actual. Fair enough: I'm convinced. I still want to watch the plays: they contain cultural and emotional truth after all, besides being, many of them, great plays.<br />So, read this book for the history, rather than the Shakespeare criticism. And though the plays are not good history, reading a good popular history is not irrelevant to enjoying them: after all, they were written for a public that already had a better than nodding acquaintance with the events they portray. And so should you.	2002-03-15

To what end?<br />Well, the subtitle of this book is \\"What It Is, How It Works, and What to Make of It.\\" As he says early on: \\"For at least 150 years many societies have been trapped in an ill-tempered debate about market systems. Now we have an opportunity to think about these systems with a new dispassion and clarity. Market ideologues have learned that there is little to fear from communism... For their part, socialist ideologues have realized that aspiring for a better society is not enough. They have to face the complexities of constructing one.\\"<br />One way of bisecting the population is by distinguishing those who see an imperfect world and want to perfect it from those who see an imperfect world and want to live in it as well as its imperfections allow. Charles Lindblom, a professor of economics and political science, is of the first sort. His viewpoints become clear as the book goes along, and he makes no bones about the imperfections of the various market systems and their supporting political systems. At the same time he is not an ideologue, and does not fall into the trap of yearning for a utopia of the right, or of the left.<br />Basically, he sees the market system as inducing cooperation and preempting violent interaction over a vast range of social interactions. That these take place mostly with money as intermediary does not remove them from the social sphere: it is, he claims, a false distinction to place economic interactions in some separable sphere from social interactions. The real distinction that the market system makes is quid pro quo: interactions between people involve an exchange - of goods for money, of favor for favor, of dinner at your house for (maybe much later) dinner at my house. But the invention of money and credit has made possible society-wide cooperation (the chain of cooperators to get this computer to my desk runs into the millions, or the hundreds of millions, of cooperating humans). For this the market system gets full credit.<br />But, as we know from the history of the Industrial Revolution (still going on in speeded-up form in some parts of the world), unfettered capitalism (the unregulated market system, in our terminology) is a harsh sorter-out of its participants into a few big winners (the entrepreneurs), a large number of more-or-less-contented employees, and a large number (although, unless the society is in imminent danger of revolution, not so large as the second group) of \\"losers\\" for whom the system offers little but grinding toil and early death.<br />Excepting such as Robert Nozick and Ayn Rand, most people feel the government has a legitimate role in curbing the excesses of the market system and protecting the citizens from each other within it. For it is a particularly transparent sophistry that all participants in the system come to it as roughly equally competent. To consider just one sort of inequality: many participants cannot do the arithmetic (don't even know that there is arithmetic they should be doing!) that would tell them whether they are getting a reasonable value when they buy something on time. Nor, say, do they understand the savage rate of compounding that credit card debt, left unattended, incurs.<br />The great political schism of our time is not religious, but free-market vs. government intervention. It can take a vast number of forms, and debate can get bogged down in symbolically important issues of little practical consequence while other more important effects are ignored. It is the virtue of this book that it adopts a more neutral terminology (\\"the market system\\") and is able to discuss and evaluate a vast range of issues on which sides are taken without demonizing one side or the other.<br />The weakness of this book is its inconclusiveness. It can't be helped. One can reada book about welfare reform, for example, and come away convinced of the author's prescription, because he has carefully stage-managed his argument to minimize or hide difficulties. Lindblom does not have that luxury: every issue really does have two sides. His general views are not in doubt: the market system is a very good thing; it needs government controls; government can, does, and should use the market system when it can it further the collective goals of the society.<br />But: how much freedom, of what sort, is enough? Is a command political system that employs market incentives just about as good as democracy? What possible alternatives are there to a market system? What can be done about corporations, these vast engines of production that are increasingly out of the control of the political system?<br />I enjoyed this book, although I'm not sure what I now know that I didn't already tacitly know. There were a few epiphanies, but they went by so quickly that I suspect I could profit much from a second reading. There are no pictures, charts, or bold-faced claims: the book has no visual aids to highlight its points. The prose is calm, and the arguments for or against a position are spare, with little or no supporting evidence. One reason for this is the high level at which the points are discussed: Lindblom is not making policy, but rather pointing out the wide range of possible answers to many of the vexed questions of the day. One cannot doubt the truth of most of what he says. The question is, what is one to do with it?<br />If one is a person of the second type, the answer is, nothing. But reformers should be given pause: Perhaps, after reading this book they may be persuaded to make their solutions less sweeping, in keeping with a new appreciation of the subtlety and richness of the problems of organizing a society around a market system that is intertwined with a political system.a book about welfare reform, for example, and come away convinced of the author's prescription, because he has carefully stage-managed his argument to minimize or hide difficulties.

In the first place, it's about the getting and spending, the hope for wealth and the threat of poverty that occupy so much of our energy and emotion. This is a history of economic thought told through the lives and ideas of the most important innovators in this quintessentially modern branch of knowledge. Secondly, it is written in a style that is clear, colloquial, and intelligent. Our author knows his material so well that he can explain without strain. And finally, the organization is about as pleasing a mixture of learning and gossip as one could want. Starting with Adam Smith, going through such as Marx, Mill, and Keynes, and winding up with Joseph Schumpeter, the text treats us to charming and humorous mini-biographies of these unusual fellows along with non-technical (but not trivial!) discussions of their work.<br />But the title is not misleading: this is neither technical analysis nor, strictly speaking, science. Most of the men (they are all men!) profiled here were interested in larger issues than utility theory or supply-demand curves. Many lived before economics was separated out from more general speculation about society and morals. But even where they confined themselves to what we would call \\"economic\\" motives, they wrote prose - in some cases charming or brilliant prose - instead of equations. Economics occupies that intersection of the possibilities of brute nature and our accommodations with each other in society, so its inherently fuzzy subject matter is probably better captured in words than numbers. And life, too, happens to economists, just as it does to everyone: here we see how one's life and times can influence one's ideas. It's good to get a different take on Marx or Smith or Keynes than comes from the noisy network ideologues who yank their thoughts out of their context.<br />This book has no prerequisite but interest and an enjoyment of good writing on important matters. After all, as Keynes put it: \\"Practical men, who believe themselves exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\\"	2002-03-06

Are you, at the same time, flush enough to have (perhaps after a few years of scrimping) 25 to 50 thousand dollars that YOU DON'T NEED? Are you comfortable with numbers? Can you, or can you learn to, look annual reports and financial statements in the face without flinching (or glazing over)? Does making an average of 15 to 20 percent per year on your portfolio over the long haul (for the ride may be bumpy, with some dives as well as climbs) sound sufficiently enticing? Do you have a day job that you intend to keep? Do you have a life outside of playing the market that you intend to live? Then, and only then, this could be the book for you!<br />I love these guys. They're a couple of fresh-faced young men, brothers, who treat investing seriously, but that doesn't mean somberly. The first chapter or so of this book was so jokey I thought the ratio of matter to chatter was going to be about 1:1, but they got down to business, as it were, soon enough.<br />Their basic point is that anybody who is willing to do some work looking at the fundamentals of companies can find some to invest in and, usually, stay with, that will significantly outperform the market. A person can build a portfolio of stocks that will beat the Dow, or the S&amp;P 500, by several percentage points every year. Since the market, overall, is rising at 10 or 11 percent (ok, bad year to convince you of THAT) annually, over the long haul this 15 or 18 percent compounding of one's portfolio can lead to significant gains.<br />And the lovely thing is, most of these are tax-deferred, since only the dividends of stocks that you hold are taxed, and the plan is to hold your stocks, not to churn them. If you do your homework well you should have stocks that you stay with for years - perhaps even leave to your loved ones, who will therefore treasure your memory.<br />Yeah, yeah (I can hear you muttering): \\"willing to do some work\\"? Well, yes. YOU CAN'T GET AROUND IT! You have to crunch a few numbers, but it's fifth-grade math (some long division is required). You have to get cozy with financial statements. It'd be nice, moreover, if you understood something of what the company you want to own a chunk of does for a living (it might become YOUR living!), and some of the high points of its spectrum of the economic universe.<br />The brothers will introduce you to some good ideas, and puncture some bad ones. They demonstrate why small caps are so great for the individual investor, for example. They tell you when, with impeccable logic, it is a bad idea to short a stock (even a stock about to plummet). They talk turkey about the real costs of trading - the commissions AND the spread. They quickly demolish the allure of day-trading. They campaign tirelessly for honesty and transparency in investment advice, and point out the problem with almost all mutual funds (except for the index funds, which they like, but just not as much as individual stocks).<br />Oh, and they run a web site, which no doubt nets them a few bucks, which I certainly don't begrudge them. They are for power to the people, online power to the upwardly-mobile investor-class of people, anyway. (Hey, you have to start somewhere!)<br />Mostly, this book is inspirational. It's message is that you, the ordinary Joe or Jane, can put away a few bucks and then invest it intelligently. If you're not using the rent money, and if your time horizon is meaningful - 10 to 30 years - you can come out the other end with a real, honest-to-goodness nest egg. This is NOT a book about making quick profits, or getting wealth without work. It DOES say that it doesn't take too much work, and it does take several years, but that if you apply yourself, and hold the course, you will do better in the long run than all the fund managers in the financial industry. But more importantly, you'll do well.Also they start the book with a snippet from one of my favorite poems, so I have to trust them!	2002-02-11

And as innovations in money advanced those societies in which they arose, so this book must be a discussion of how money changed, and was changed by, the most \\"advanced\\" cultures of their time. Initially just the merchants needed something trans-national, and bars of raw gold and silver fit the bill. But it was the invention of coins, money that could be used by anyone, that started us down the path to the modern world, where all things - from pain and suffering to bushels of wheat - are commensurable in the one metric: money.<br />Jack Weatherford is an anthropologist, not an economist, so it is not surprising that he lingers over certain details that don't have a lot to do with his ostensible subject. Thus we are treated to the grisly spectacle of an Aztec human sacrifice, and how the Peruvian Indians who mine the silver that enriches others reconcile themselves to their poor and hazardous lives. Yet he does not stray far, and his depiction of the squeezing of the citizens of Rome for more and more taxes by successive emperors (plus their dilution of the currency) that led to the destruction of the free small-holding and business-owning classes, and with them the Empire, is chilling and instructive. The barbarians were kinder: they didn't use money.<br />The inventions of banking and of merchants' instruments (such as bills of exchange) are discussed, as well as the first national banks, in explaining the advent of paper money, the next great innovation. The pax Britannica is discussed, too, in a way: the British empire was not really as important, probably, as the British pound, backed by gold, and serving as a fixed monetary point, for a long period of world prosperity. For whatever logic inheres, or does not, to the \\"backing\\" of a currency by a precious metal, it did have the faith of many for a long time, and held currencies in rock-solid interrelationships for years.<br />Are things better now that all our currencies are floating, changing values relatively and absolutely every moment? Gold is a superstition, after all, so away with it! This book is at its best discussing the national hyperinflations that followed the Great War, the falling away from the gold standard, and the advent of the newer types of money and near-money. Electronic cash of various sorts, currency markets, and credit-card purchases that create private money are playing havoc with the traditional calculations of national money supply, and undermining the ability of governments to control their currency.<br />Where will it end? We'll have to surf this tidal wave of new money creation as long as we can without getting swamped: \\"The current electronic revolution in money promises to increase even more the role of money in our public and private lives, surpassing kinship, religion, occupation, and citizenship as the defining element of social life. We stand now at the dawn of the Age of Money.\\" (p268)	2002-02-05

It was a war of battles with evocative names: Bull Run, Antietam, Vicksburg, Gettysburg... Perhaps the war was about slavery, perhaps it was about the clash between an industrial democracy and a planting autocracy. But what was it really like?<br />Even the best historians fail to make compelling their descriptions of battle. It all starts to sound like business prose. We know there were real issues on the ground, real death and fear and dreadful mistakes. We know, too, that some battles were decisive, and perhaps we are given numbers - numbers dead, and so on. But unless you know how read those numbers and descriptions of troop movements (unless you yourself have toiled in the mud and trenches, or had to make choices that meant death for somebody), it all comes to seem like a company's annual report does to most of us, like figures with no blood in them.<br />The Killer Angels tells us things about the battle of Gettysburg that a history book cannot. It puts us into the minds of a few key people in the Union and Confederate armies, and it puts us on the ground during those murderous three days. We learn to look from eye level, we get some feel for the constant presence of death. We see devout soldiers, and soldiers who are willing to die without any hope of a heaven. We learn what it was like at Gettysburg, and why failures of character mattered.<br />Michael Shaara's method was to go back to the original sources - the letters and memoirs and diaries of those who were there - to find a more personal truth about the war. This is a targeted book without the pretensions of a \\"great\\" novel. It is focused in intent and rather simple in structure. It shows those days of the battle (and the agonizing nights) through the eyes of a few of the key officers of the Confederacy and a couple of junior officers of the Union. This was an interesting decision but, I think, appropriate: to a great extent, the South lost the fight because of Lee's decisions, and the North held because of those junior officers. But read this book, and draw your own conclusions. You will never think of the Civil War as mere \\"history\\" again.	2002-01-28

It has a knowing and substantial introduction by Bernard Knox that talks of the Odyssey in some detail, and of the world the Iliad and Odyssey depict. (Incidentally, his introduction to Fagles's Iliad  is identical in its more general parts, but unique where it discusses the particular poem at issue.) Robert Fagles supplies an afterword in which he discusses the reasons for his approach, and some of his strategies. There are maps, a few family genealogies and a list for further reading. Bernard Knox also supplies the notes to the poem. Finally, the poem's own line numbers are tracked, as well as those of the (Oxford) Greek edition which was its source (deviations from that source are noted).<br />This book also includes a valuable pronouncing glossary covering virtually every place-name and person-name used in the story. The translator made a fine decision to render the names in their Latin, instead of Greek, forms. In their Latin forms they can be said using ordinary English sounds for the most part, and these pronunciations are sanctioned by long usage in English literature. Thus, you do not have to stop and explain to someone that by \\"Kir-kay\\" you really mean whom they know as Circe (\\"sir-see\\").<br />The primary decision for a translator of Homer is whether to use verse or prose. Fagles wishes to bring across the Odyssey as a song or chant, as in the original, so quite properly uses verse. Homer's line was strict: its syllable count was always twelve, and while variation was permitted within the line, the last few syllables always had a narrowly-prescribed form. In addition, each line was typically a syntactic unit. These two facts control the feel of an Homeric recitation, which must have been quite rhythmic, especially with a strummed accompaniment.<br />This Homeric line is not consonant with the genius of English metrics, but Fagles constructs his lines with Homeric song in mind. They tend to be six beats and loosely iambic, but he does not hesitate to go longer or shorter at need. He also tries to keep the lines syntactic wholes - phrases or clauses - but if not the slopover is usually graceful (in that one can pause slightly at line-end without doing violence to some partially-completed phrase). His language, too, is interesting, a non-literary, plain-spoken diction larded with quaint colloquialisms (e.g. \\"heart to heart\\", \\"my hopes ride high\\") cheek by jowl with exotic allusions to the gods that I think has the intent (it certainly has the effect) of depicting the narrator as a bit old-fashioned but honest, and his story true.<br />I have also read Robert Fitzgerald's translation of The Odyssey a couple times and enjoyed it, and have partially read the verse versions of Mandelbaum and of Lattimore. I like Fagles better than these. Fitzgerald and Mandelbaum use five-beat lines; Fitzgerald's is loose, but Mandelbaum's a strict pentameter. Both of these versions read very well, but for Homer I prefer the six-beat line. Lattimore does use a consistently six-beat line, but his verse is inferior - it seems more like evenly-sliced prose. And none of these editions has the support sections the Fagles edition has (particularly that lovely pronouncing glossary).<br />As to how well the Fagles Odyssey plays, I have listened to Ian McKellan's recording of it: he does a great job - it is clearly the marriage of a fine actor and a superior text. The only thing I could wish for is someone strumming a lyre in the background.and loosely iambic, but he does not hesitate to go longer or shorter at need.

Excepting, perhaps, W. B. Yeats, he may be the greatest poet to write English in the twentieth century. (To me, it's a toss-up.) To read this volume systematically or desultorily is to become convinced of that. But Frost is, above all, accessible, so the casual reader may not appreciate the difficulty of what he does. Like much of the greatest art his looks easy, even inevitable.<br />All of Frost's poems are here, plus his two dramatic Masques. When this book first appeared (in 1969) it caused a furor: the editor, it was angrily asserted, presumed too much. He dared to clarify - inserting a hyphen here, excising a comma there. That furor has since died down, as people realize that he did not do away with the sacred texts (any emendation was noted), but simply performed his job as editor. He regularized spelling and the use of single and double quotes (though not Capitalization, which can legitimately be thought of as integral to the poet's expression (think of e.e. cummings!)), and corrected other obvious errors. The notes give the published variants for each poem, so if you wish you may make your own call on some of these finicky issues.<br />The paperback and hardcover editions are identical, except for the covers, of course. I would, however, buy the hardcover. After all, you will be reading this book for the rest of your life. It is a beautifully-built volume, of an easy size and heft for use, with understated appealing typefaces and an exemplary design. Put out by Frost's long-time publisher, this is one of the few essential books of American literature.	2002-01-14

It is a closely-argued defense of a certain position in psycholinguistics - namely that we process language by variously using memorized forms or applying rules. Thus we retrieve from memory the past tense \\"went\\" of \\"go\\" but figure out by rule the past tense \\"ambled\\" of \\"amble\\".<br />It sounds obvious, the way I have put it. I'm not sure it is all that obvious: Pinker and those investigators of like mind have taken a middle ground in a heated debate. On one side is Chomsky, who apparently feels that associational operations that allow us, for example, to retrieve the irregular past tense from memory when we have the root word in mind are illusory, that virtually every morpheme (word form) - even those that are seemingly irregular - is evoked by a strict rule from the root. On the other side stand the connectionists, who insist that the brain's \\"past-tense morpheme-builder\\", say, is a neural network (of course it is, but they mean one of a particular kind), and that it has learned, during a person's childhood, to inflect words by building connections between input root and output past tense by getting correct versions from parents and others. In this view there are no \\"rules\\" that stand outside the network: past tenses are formed by cranking through a vast web of memory that was shaped by the linguistic facts that served to train it. And so, presumably, with other grammatical forms. (I know I have compressed excessively here: Pinker does a better job - and has pictures!)<br />The first part of the book explains and elaborates these positions. Most of the rest of the book is devoted to describing experiments that take advantage of the few verbs in English that are irregular in the past tense and nouns irregular in the plural to tease out those situations in which we apply a rule versus those in which we rely on memory to come up with the appropriate word whenwe are speaking.<br />If you can understand the previous sentence, then you will have a shot at following Pinker as he gallops off in pursuit of his Grail of Words and Rules. It's not that he is obscure or incoherent (he is an engaging writer with a light touch): rather, he is steeped in this work - has been for years - and tends to forget that the reader is not, and that the reader does not have an endless appetite for slight variations on an experimental theme that may confirm or falsify certain ideas or their competitors.<br />The work Pinker describes is very much part of the current research in brain organization - not only in language performance but, as he makes persuasive, in more general sorts of cognition. It is all in the service of answering a small set of related questions, so the book has the virtue of focus. It has the additional virtue of making clear the linguistic genius of the average Joe or Jane, and further demythologizing the omniscience of the \\"language mavens\\" (a service Pinker also performed in \\"The Language Instinct\\"). When you are done you will be well-schooled in the English past tense, and probably find yourself more aware of, and in awe of, your everyday linguistic performance. It is, however, one long argument for his theory (although he does not ever formally specify the theory, we get the idea). While it does not provide the numerous epiphanies scattered through \\"The Language Instinct\\" or \\"How the Mind Works\\" this book does give the reader an excellent feel for how psychology is done these days.	2002-01-07

The citizens of the Republic and the Catholics of Ulster (not to speak of the Irish-Americans!) may not consciously condone the IRA and its methods, but their tacit approval (and sometimes more) of the aims of this terrorist organization is what keeps it going. By foregrounding this issue, O'Brien is doing that which is unpopular North and South, but needs to be done. My hat is off to him.<br />This is a personal account of the \\"troubles\\" that the Irish have inflicted on each other (with some help from the English) from Wolfe Tone (1798) on. The author spends the last third of the book discussing the current mess in Ulster - current, that is, as of 1995. CC O'Brien has been involved in various of the governments of the Republic of Ireland over the years, as well as working in the UN and being an intellectual-at-large in this country and elsewhere. He is a lapsed Catholic whose aunt Hanna was a well-known Irish Republican activist after the Easter Rising of 1916. It is his thesis that virtually everything in Irish politics that came after 1916 can be explained by reference to the sacral character of the deaths of Connolly, MacBride and others, but particularly of Patrick Pearse, who foretold his death on that occasion in prophetic and religious language that cast himself in the part of the Savior who would be a sacrifice for his country's freedom. These deaths haunt the Irish Catholics still, and those that hear most clearly the \\"ancestral voices\\" and their calls for blood in service of the nation are deferred to by those more moderate, for whom the voices are dim.<br />Actually, I picked up this book to better understand some references in James Joyce. I was not disappointed. Much of the family conversation in \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" becomes more clear: the time of the novel was just about the turn of the century, not long after the fall of Parnell (almost wrote \\"the Fall\\"), when battle lines were being drawn between Catholics and Protestants, and Catholics and Catholics. As a bonus O'Brien talks about WB Yeats and Maud Gonne and their roles in the events of the early part of the century, particularly Yeats's play \\"Cathleen ni Houlihan\\", which became a touchstone of Republican patriotism thereafter. Although Yeats got out of that mystical form of country-worship, and was repudiated by the Catholic sectarians who wanted an Irish AND Catholic nation, his play was retained as an evocative piece of propaganda.<br />This book is charming and personal, mixing family memoir with formal history. O'Brien has written other things on this painful subject of the intersection of religion and politics (I enjoyed \\"The Siege\\" when I read it a dozen years ago), but this is closer to home for him, and I found the metaphor of the \\"ancestral voices\\" to be telling: it explains a lot. (In particular, I now have a hope of understanding the movie \\"Michael Collins\\", which deals with the tangled politics of the Irish civil war of the early 1920's.) Still, though, I may get the book he and his wife wrote on the history of Ireland for a wider view of events. This book traces an important thread of that history, but must, because of its focus, leave much out.

He accompanies Ian Stevenson to Lebanon and then to India to follow up some reincarnation stories. Dr. Stevenson has been doing such investigations for many years, is 79 years old, and will probably hang up his tape recorder after these two trips. He is a physician and psychiatric researcher at the University of Virginia, where for 40 years he has been studying reincarnation, primarily as a field anthropologist would, by traveling the world and taking down likely stories, as accurately as he can, and using as many witnesses as are available.<br />There are many cultures - in India, of course, but also among the Druse of Lebanon, the Buddhists of Southeast Asia, and some Northwest Indians of the U.S. - where reincarnation is part of their view of the world. In these areas it is common for a child to claim a past life, usually of some recently dead person in his or her own culture, but not always. Many of these stories can be easily explained by \\"naturalistic\\" means. (For example, a desire to believe in a child's spontaneous knowledge of the stranger he claims to have been suppresses the parents' memory of a situation where he could have learned details of that person's life.) But some of them cannot, or cannot without the kinds of contortions that make the naturalistic explanation as incredible as a supernatural one.<br />It is these latter kinds of claims that interest Dr. Stevenson. He tries to find situations that are as \\"clean\\" as possible, ideally with little children (who are poor liars) claiming past lives that had no connection with them or their families, thus minimizing the possibility that they learned the things they know by unconsciously absorbing conversations around them. He tries, moreover, to find situations that do not work to the advantage of the child or his parents, as when someone claims to be the reincarnation of a poor person, rather than of a rich one. Yet accurate accounts are very hard to get: memories are confused; cross-cultural misunderstandings add to the confusion; hostility to arrogant Westerners (although Stevenson personally is a mild-mannered sort) may stir the pot.<br />Still, Stevenson does what he can. One way science proceeds is by accumulations of humble but hard facts: enough of them may suggest patterns that may suggest a theory. He would dearly love some attention to his work from the scientific community. Someone has to come at these reincarnation phenomena from a different direction: anecdotal evidence has to be combined with independent perspectives if we are to be able to say anything about these stories but \\"wow\\".<br />OK, fine. Tom Shroder wrote this book as a reporter, going along for the ride and bringing a typical First-World skepticism with him. He had become intrigued with Dr. Stevenson's work, and persuaded the old man to bring along a possibly-unsympathetic observer. But Stevenson had nothing to lose: he was not riding a wave of enthusiasm for reincarnation research, but just honestly hoping someone would help him explain the inexplicable. Thus begins the journey of the quietly passionate old man and the bumptious reporter.<br />The reporter definitely gets the lion's share of the ink in this book. His discomforts, fears, alternations of wonder and suspicion, plus his need to entertain put Stevenson into the background. But the past life experiences of the people are the point, after all, and on this Shroder does pretty well. Sometimes the barrage of similar-sounding foreign names makes it difficult to remember who is who and who was who, but I got a pretty good sense of the character of some typical cases. I think the author deserves credit for bringing this work to the attention of a wider public. The world is more mysterious than we can know, but perhaps it's time some mysteries were promoted to problems.	2001-12-13

The way to use this book is to read it, straight through, at a moderate pace. Like a good meal, it cannot be rushed. And, like a good meal, its particulars should be savored.<br />Enough simile! What I want to emphasize is that, while this is a book about diet, do not jump around to sections that interest you (omega-3's, low-carb diets, whatever) as if you already knew the book's basic message, and just needed a specific fact or two.<br />I admit I was tempted to do just that; diet seems so obvious, somehow. We all know about the food pyramid, and saturated fats, and roughage, and yogurt, all that stuff. But still, lately, my confidence in the simplicity of it all had been shaken by the advocates of the high-protein, high-fat diets. I knew it was nonsense, somehow, but no voices of reason in the medical community were making themselves heard. What if steak and eggs, hold the bread, three times a day, was actually good  for you? Suddenly that scene in \\"Sleeper\\" didn't seem so funny: Woody, the former health-food store owner, finds that in the future world he now inhabits medical science has determined that junk food and ice cream sundaes and so on are the real health foods ...<br />The first thing to remark about Dr. Weil is that he likes food. This is important: he is NOT a cultist who would reject the pleasures of eating and replace them with the virtuous feelings that come from suffering through some odd diet. He is trying to take what we know about good nutrition from years of research, and apply it in the lives we lead: semi-sedentary, having to buy much that is highly-processed, and much mysterious restaurant food. He wants to teach us about nutrition and preparing nutritious food, at a level that is high enough to be easy to follow without a degree in physiology, but low enough to enable us to make intelligent choices from the supermarket's tainted cornucopia to put together meals that combine tastes and textures we enjoy with the nutriments we need.<br />Thebig three - fats, carbohydrates, and protein - are treated systematically, fairly, and thoroughly, as are the essential micronutrients. By far the most startling section (to this reader, anyway) is on carbohydrate. Dr. Weil is taking advantage of some recent Australian research on the \\"glycemic index\\" of carbohydrate foods to recommend some fairly radical changes in the way we take in carbohydrates. It turns out that it makes a big difference how fast starches are digested. We always knew that sugar can give you a rush, but it turns out that starches can, too. Moreover, this sugar flooding into the system from easily-digestible starch (such as our finely-milled flours provide) turns readily to fat. (That ought to get people's attention!)<br />And the recipes look pretty good, too. My only gripe with them is that there are no applications there of our new-found knowledge of the glycemic index. I would like to see some baked goods done with coarsely-milled flour (e.g. corn meal, graham flour). All seems rather standard in that line (though olive oil is used). However, with what I have learned, I have been able to do my own experimenting (with interesting results!).<br />I won't go into any more detail here, but just observe that I would never have noticed much of importance that he said, nor really absorbed his humane, sensible message if I had not simply sat down and read the book systematically. If this book does nothing but get you to read the labels on those foods you eat that HAVE labels, it will have changed your life for the better.	2001-10-29

If you read that book, then you have read this one: the only differences (besides the lurid cover) seem to be a couple of new appendices and a change to an existing one, and an extensive questionnaire to discover one's mediators, antecedents, triggers, and effects (terms explained in the book). But, since the first edition came out in 1997 and this one in 1998, the references are still quite current.<br />Basically, Dr. Galland is making the point that modern medicine has lost its way, and is now doing much damage in some cases, and little good in many others. Of course, this is a point rather stridently made by many authors advancing alternatives to the offerings of the medical establishment, such as meditation, acupuncture, herbal therapies, dietary supplements, and so on. Dr. Galland is sympathetic to many of these alternatives, but what is different about his approach is that he wishes to bring them into the fold, as it were, rather than break from the flock. He was trained as a physician in the usual way, a way he now feels is wrong, that modern medicine is expending much effort to solve the wrong problems.<br />Healing sick people by observing them, interacting with them, and restoring their balance is the foundation of medical art, but somewhere in the 19th century that approach got displaced when microorganisms began to be associated with disease. It was a short step to claim that these microorganisms \\"caused\\" the disease - one germ, one disease. Before long a new type of doctor began to dominate medical care, the \\"specialist\\". Specialists were trained to think of a disease as an entity with characteristics that were independent of the person it happened to be afflicting. They specifically rejected the view that individual differences mattered, except in a very superficial way. They were emotionally and intellectually ill-equipped to deal with the messiness of real people whose internal ecologies and external circumstances actually determined whether they got sick, and how it showed up. Many people are infected with the TB bacillus, but only a few get TB. And so for so many other diseases.<br />Dr. Galland believes that one's diet, exercise, habits, emotional life, physical environment, as well as one's intrinsic makeup and history (even one's developmental history in the womb!) should all be factored into any diagnosis, to interpret symptoms and suggest treatment. This he calls \\"patient-centered\\" diagnosis, to distinguish is from current practice, which might be called \\"disease-centered\\" diagnosis. He believes that many problems that are today attacked with a variety of over-the-counter and prescription drugs, or, more radically, with surgery, are really the result of imbalances in a person's life. Some of these, such as diet, are rather easily correctable, and simple changes in eating habits, perhaps with a course of diet supplements, can reverse the course of what had been tenacious maladies. Other problems, such as stress or loneliness, can impair immune function, but may sometimes be difficult to correct, intertwined as they are with a person's entire way of life. This book has many case studies that bring home the reality of all these issues, and form an entertaining narrative backbone to the discussion.<br />In general, the author favors the restoration of balance over bringing in the big medical guns. But sometimes the guns are necessary. It may happen, for example, that a person has allergies or nagging illness that result from an undetected (because unchecked-for) parasite, acquired years earlier. In this case, the doctor might prescribe a course of antibiotics to kill the parasite, along with dietary supplements such as live lactobacillus to restore the intestinal flora the antibiotic will also decimate.<br />This book gives good guidance in eating, in particular, and suggests methods to avoid the health hazards and toxins endemic to modern life. And for issues he does not discuss in detail he often refers to a book that does, so a reader can learn more if he or she is interested. Dr. Galland has no answers, really, to the social and emotional barrenness that afflicts many of us. (How could he?) But he observes that our health is as much a effect of our emotional well-being as it is of anything physical that happens to us.<br />What made this book so impressive to me was the references that backed up virtually everything the author said. And these were multiple references in the scientific literature to controlled studies. So the meta-message of this book is that you do not have to check your critical faculties at the door when you go in for an holistic approach to health.	2001-09-28

It may well be my favorite; it's right up there, anyway. (At my age, picking a favorite book is dangerous: I've probably forgotten about half the strong candidates.) It is, if you will, a connected series of \\"nature\\" essays. Each one is strong, and can stand alone, but all are bound by many threads into a larger whole.<BR> <BR>Annie Dillard moved to Tinker Creek, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, in her mid-twenties (or, at any rate, this book achieved final published form when she was twenty-nine). Like Thoreau, she came to the woods to \\"keep a meteorological journal of the mind\\". Indeed, \\"Walden\\" is the model: a person of reflective tendency steps out of the stream of life, as it were, to go to the woods, just to see what he or she can see. It turns out that one's own mind is a large part of the scenery when one gets away from the rough-and-tumble of society. Big mysteries are at stake here; it is somehow appropriate that looking with all attention at minute creatures and giving oneself over momentarily to ephemeral events provide clues. Why is nature cruel? Why is there beauty? Could these be related?<br />I put it baldly, but these and other questions are more the expression on her writing's face than the subject of it. There are details, and funny descriptions, and a rifling through the wonders of her library of naturalists. But, always, there is a person doing all this: walking, having a sandwich, creeping up on a copperhead for a closer look (after patting her pocket to make sure the snakebite kit is there), or just lying in bed remembering a horrifying or glorious experience of that particular day, in the woods, on the banks of Tinker Creek.<br />Have I mentioned the quality of the writing? It's glorious. Part of its appeal is her special mix of jokiness and vernacular combined with high-toned thinking and literary reference, her gee-whiz attitude toward outrageous natural facts always butting in. Part of it comes from her sheer likeability. But all that aside, words do her bidding, and always I find myself pausing and smiling at her mastery. She wonders about beauty, and reacts to beauty. She also, here, has created it.<br />\\"Nature is, above all, profligate. Don't believe them when they tell you how economical and thrifty nature is, whose leaves return to the soil. Wouldn't it be cheaper to leave them on the tree in the first place? This deciduous business alone is a radical scheme, the brainchild of a deranged manic-depressive with limitless capital. Extravagance! Nature will try anything once...No form is too gruesome, no behavior too grotesque. If you're dealing with organic compounds, then let them combine. If it works, if it quickens, then set it clacking in the grass; there's always room for one more; you ain't so handsome yourself. This is a spendthrift economy; though nothing is lost, all is spent.\\" (chapter 4)	2001-09-18

Altruism has always been a problem for evolutionists. How does one explain a creature giving up something for another, sometimes its very life? Why, for example, will a monkey give a warning cry that alerts other members of the troop, but that gives away its own position? How could genes governing such behavior persist in the relentless competition for a place in the genome?<br />The kinds of reasoning used to explain behavior that is good for the group but perhaps not so good for the individual performing it is as old as Darwin. Until George Williams demolished whole classes of argument in his lovely 1966 book, \\"Adaptation and Natural Selection\\", it was common to invoke \\"group selection\\" as an analog to individual selection, and explain, in a vague, hand-waving sort of way, how altruistic behavior could arise by enhancing the survival of the herd, or school, or flock. And after Dawkins, both the individual and the group were banished from consideration, and the selfish gene reigned supreme.<br />Only one category of altruism has been taken as consonant with the unit of replication being the gene, namely \\"kin selection\\". This is the favoring of relatives: since relatives share genes, helping a gene-mate helps one's own genes, whether or not it benefits one's self. Yet much altruism in nature goes unexplained by kin selection. Think of the soldier who falls on the hand grenade so his (unrelated) buddies can live. There are many more examples from the lives of many creatures, most of whom never saw a war movie. How does one explain the clear patterns of altruistic behavior in animals at all levels of consciousness and cuddliness? Wilson, a biologist, and Sober, a philosopher, dare to think the unthinkable, or at least the unfashionable: is it possible that individuals or groups really do play a replicator role in evolution? They believe that group selection deserves another chance, but this time more rigorously specified.<br />I was very impressed with the first half of the book, in which they justify a group-selection model for adaptive evolution that can explain a persistent strain of altruism. What they show is that selection can take place at the level of a group of individuals in many more sorts of situations than were thought possible. (A nice bonus of this approach is that kin selection can be explained more simply using this more general context of the group.) Groups, however ephemeral, do have a role to play in selection.<br />The second half of the book is less convincing, as it involves psychological and philosophical arguments for \\"psychological altruism\\" in humans (that is, you not only behave unselfishly, but \\"want\\" to behave unselfishly), which, by its very nature, is hard (or very hard) to tease out in experiments, or to introspect to. However, the authors are reasonably convincing that nature would most likely not employ some Rube Goldberg-type of mental devices that depended on hedonism (pleasure-and-pain-driven behavior) to accomplish important tasks, such as child-rearing, but rather build in directly the mechanism to make a parent care to care for its child. In that way, the care of its child would be a primary motivation, rather than an intrumental one (sorry about the jargon!) on the way to getting pleasure or avoiding pain. Parents will find this convincing, as the desire to take care of one's children seems not to depend on how much we \\"enjoy\\" doing it.<br />This book is detailed, conscientious and well-written, but it covers a lot of ground and many of its arguments, especially in the second part, are subtle. So I recommend reading it more than once: this is contentious material. While the authors do not make anything of the political and social implications of their work, these are always waiting in the wings. Altruism, after all, is in direct opposition to selfishness. Many people see in this a political point, and a social point. Those issues are not properly a part of such a work, but do give greatinterest to its arguments and conclusions. And whether or not its conclusions finally survive intact, this book's arguments and approach seem exemplary and fruitful.interest to its arguments and conclusions.

Norman Mailer has imagined himself into a fundamentalist Jew in Roman-controlled Palestine, a small-town carpenter who believes himself to be the son of God. Right away, we must believe him, as the point of view is established as first-person omniscient. Not everyone is going to enjoy a story that puts words in Christ's mouth and thoughts in His head, and that takes issue with the Gospels.<br />But everyone is curious about Jesus; he was, after all, a great man. Mailer seems to have read much that allows him to invest his story with details of life and culture that bring it down to earth, as it were. In spite of that, the whole tone is \\"spiritual\\": his Jesus seems to be rather a stiff. He is painfully serious, with his eyes on the Lord Above at all times. Remember, though, that he was raised in the Essenes, a very strict group of ascetic fundamentalists. Still, Mailer carries you right along, as his chapters are short and his prose rhythmic and simple. Yet you get no sense of release out of this book, no sense of joy: Christ was in the grip of a tragic necessity, as was His Father. <br />Anyway, this is a nice corrective to the usual universalist reading of Christ's life: he was, after all, a Jew and preaching in a contemporary tradition, though his message would undermine it. (He claimed to respect the Law, yet viewed the Sabbath as optional, for example.) He wished to talk to those influential Pharisees who controlled religious life, and who thought punctilious observance of a mass of regulations would get them into...heaven(?). His was a mystical corrective to a mechanical accounting system (reminds one of Luther, in a way). Yet finally, within two or three hundred years, his monotheistic, sin-centered message was a direct challenge to that intricate supernatural ecology that held sway, in its multitude of forms, over the known world. The Christian church, as we know, won. And, in winning lost the point, of course, which is that losing is winning. But all that is to be expected, and Mailer, who is gently blasphemous throughout (perhaps to be the more devout-who knows?) has Christ commenting on our times as if they were the worst of times, and God, his father, sore-beset. He makes no bones about the limits to God's power. <br />This is, to be sure, a novel, a fiction. It is a retelling of one of the great stories of our culture. Of course, Jesus here spends a fair amount of time complaining that the Gospel writers who told his story distorted it; to some, this book may seem to do the same with much less justification. I disagree. The temptation in using the life of Christ for fictional purposes is that its great symbolic power can elevate a mundane text and obscure the faults of a deficient style. Mailer is a better writer than that. To be sure, his book's entire interest grows out of his choice of protagonist, but he gives back to the story, and so to the culture at large, a real addition of meaning. He fleshes out Jesus' life with authentic homely details, and plausibly shows how the world might have looked to him. In this he is doing as a novelist no more than theologians and preachers have been doing since the Year 1. But the story is never over: it is likely that upon finishing Mailer's book one will be tempted to go back to the Gospels for another read. I know I intend to.	2001-08-21

The body is always under threat from tiny invaders, and it is only the various parts of our immune system, working together, that makes it possible for us to repel them. Without it, we would be dead very quickly.<br />This book gives a good overview of the immune system, with enough detail to understand how the various cells and tissues do what they do. How does the system recognize invaders? How does it recognize self, and leave self alone? Why is foreign tissue rejected? How can the system go wrong? What is the role of the Major Histocompatibility Complex? How do we get immunity? The mechanisms cells use are molecularprotein, mostlyand the immune system is all about protein switches, detectors, and processors. The above questions and others are answered by invoking the protein mechanisms, and explaining how the cells of the immune system can do the magic that they do in recognizing and responding appropriately to the millions of different possible invaders, and why some parts of the system take longer than others to swing into action.<br />The only background you really need for this book is an intelligent laymans interest in science. You should know what proteins are (chains of amino acids), more-or-less how DNA and RNA work, and the ability to follow a technical discussion. The book was written for medical students, but knowledge of anatomy and physiology is not put to use here. The discussion is chatty, informal, and repetitive. Each of the first several chapters ends in a summary diagram of the system interactions that have been discussed up to that point, and each next chapter begins by giving an extensive review of the previous one.<br />In spite of this, the exposition is confusing. The author is doing what he can, but the immune system is inherently difficult to follow. It consists of many sloppy loops that interact with each other in approximate and varying ways. Moreover, certain important interactions are still not understood very well (as the author emphasizes), so there is some fuzziness in the picture. But the last two chapters, on auto-immune diseases and cancer, use what went before, and give the reader some perspective on the general mechanisms.<br />This is a satisfying book, and a real service. It is bringing together knowledge that otherwise would be scattered in research papers, or buried in technical books, and making it accessible. The level is low enough to explain the mechanisms, but leaves out much messiness that clinicians would probably need. No one would feel when they had finished only this book that they could treat an immune system disorder, but they would at least feel that they could comprehend it.	2001-08-21

But it always manages to stagger back, and within its digressions one gradually becomes aware that the characters have come to accept that their main business is to be about finding how their own story comes out.<br />If that sounds a bit like life itself, it isn't. It is, rather, the exuberant piling-on and folding-in of narratives by a master story-teller. In the end, evil is trumped and love triumphant, as we always knew it would be. But like those bards of old who earned their place nearest the fire by their hypnotic words and unflagging invention, Colum delights in the texture of the telling, and assumes that old bargain with his audience, where we come to the tale with an appetite for wonder and an ability to listen, and he builds those gorgeous stage-sets and animates them with his language.<br />I enjoyed this somewhat less than &quot;Nordic Gods and Heroes&quot;; although Willy Pogony does the illustrations here as well, they are not as powerfully evocative. Also, in that other book I felt I was learning something: it was a story, but it was also \\"official\\" myth. This is just a shaggy prince story that wanders confusingly. But, though not very educational, it was still a thoroughly entertaining ramble.	2001-08-03

Each volume has a table of contents, text, addenda, truly awe-inspiring endnotes, an index of names, and of subjects. This is a review of BOTH volumes.<br />\\"If in this book harsh words are spoken about some of the greatest among the intellectual leaders of mankind, my motive is not...to belittle them. ...we must break with the habit of deference to great men. Great men may make great mistakes...\\" (from the intro to the 1943 edition)<br />Karl Popper was fighting the war in his own way. He saw what was essentially the same in Stalin and Hitler: a monstrous confidence. They may have drawn on different philosophies of the state, but it came to the same thing in the end: wholesale murder as a tool of social engineering.<br />But WWII is over, and we won. Moreover, the Soviet Union has collapsed, and we won again. So what is the fuss? Relax: Marxism is dead, Platonism sounds quaint, and who the hell is Hegel, anyway? <br />But don't rest easy just yet, free-market man! Every four years we seem to reaffirm our need for a philosopher-king. And while the historicist faith is now all tarted-up with computers, networking, and the Fable of the Bees and re-christened \\"emergent order\\", it still leaves us feeling smug and moral in doing nothing but tending our own gardens.<br />Popper is pithy throughout, but I only started noting things (this time around) at the penultimate chapter of the work, 24:<br />&quot;... the fight against suffering must be considered a duty, while the right to care for the happiness of others must be considered a privilege confined to the close circle of their friends.&quot;(vII, p237)<br />[on language, and the aim of rationalism] &quot;... to use it plainly ... as an instrument of rational communication ... rather than as a means of 'self-expression', as the vicious romantic jargon of most of our educationists has it.&quot; (p239)  See also II, pp276/7 on the aims of education.<br />[On bullshit]  &quot;... irrationalism will use reason too, but without any feeling of obligation.&quot;(II,240)<br />A brilliant look at Hegelian thinking in the sociology of knowledge (II,242/3), which must be read whole, but ends:  &quot; ... their thoughts are endowed ... with 'mystical and religious faculties' not possessed by others, and who thus claim that they 'think by God's grace'.  This claim with its gentle allusion to those who do not possess God's grace, this attack upon the potential spiritual unity of mankind, is, in my opinion, as pretentious, blasphemous and anti-Christian, as it believes itself to be humble, pious, and Christian.&quot;<br />Popper is relentlessly brilliant in moral indignation.  See his pointing out that moral futurism (e.g. 'the meek shall inherit the earth') condones the abdicating of individual moral responsibility, since one need do nothing toward this certain end. His answer: &quot;...it is certainly possible to combine an attitude of the utmost reserve and even of contempt towards worldly success in the sense of power, glory, and wealth, with the attempt to do one's best in this world, and to further the ends one has decided to adopt...for their own sake.&quot;(II, 274)<br />This is one of the great works of practical philosophy of the century. Awesome in scholarship, relentless in moral vision, yet as fair-minded as his own high standards dictate, Popper has produced a book that is at once an explication of important philosophers who have had a malign impact and an attempt, largely successful, to demythologize them, and to give the average reader intellectual weapons to combat their legacy. His care is, at all times, to be clear and rational.  He is concerned to communicate, not to obscure.  The spirit of civilization shines through this work; it exemplifies what is best in our intellectual and spiritual heritage. <br />A hint: read a few of the notes to convince yourself that Popper has completely mastered his material (in several languages), that he has anticipated all the main counterarguments to his positions, and that he stands ready to defend in severe philosophical jargon anything he seems too-casually to advert to in the text. Then just read the books, and dig into the notes later, when you go back to a section for some serious research.	2001-08-03

Read this instead of, or before you read Goedels paper. Within 20 pages you will know the trick that Goedel used. Its a beauty, but it is far easier to see it under Smullyans tutelage than by coming to the classic paper cold, since Goedel uses a more difficult scheme to achieve his ends. Much work has been done since 1931, and we get the benefit of the stripping-down to essentials that such as Tarski (and Smullyan himself) have contributed.<br />The book has much of interest to those who wish to pursue the subject of the incompleteness and/or consistency of mathematics, or to come at Goedel from a number of angles. For me, though, the first 3 chapters were enough. I just wanted to find out how K.G. did what he did. Now I know, and I know where to go if I need even more.<br />The exercises are helpful to keep you on track and test your understanding. They also contribute materially to the exposition. A stumbling-block for many readers will be the extremely abstract nature of the discussion, and the new notations and definitions that constantly come at one. Viewing numbers as strings and strings as numbers (and knowing when to switch from one view to another) will be confusing at first. This is the hard part: what Goedel did, in essence, is demonstrate that one can view proofs in two ways  as numbers, and as strings of characters. As in viewing an optical illusion, it is sometimes tough to hold the proper picture in mind.<br />Smullyans book First-Order Logic is enough preparation for this work. One must here, even more than there, keep straight the difference between the proofs that are part of the subject matter (and so are strings of characters), and the proofs we go through that verify facts about these strings. Before we started reading this book, of course, we had some informal sense that we were going to prove something about proofs. What we are REALLY doing, though, is proving something about proofs. You get the picture. Goedel must have been a lot of fun at parties.	2001-08-02

The author allows a little slop into the end of the Eighteenth Century with such as Hutton and Buffon, and a bit into the Twentieth with Alfred Russell Wallace's last years, but basically this is the story of how the medieval view of the Great Chain of Being coming into sudden being along with the earth 6000-odd years ago evolved into an altogether grander but not-remotely-Biblical view of time, geology, life, and change.<br />Charles Darwin is, of course, the centerpiece of such a discussion, but by no means crowds out consideration of other thinkers and workers. In terms of space, Darwin does not take up terribly much of the book, but many of the ideas and discoveries made before him are highlighted because of the use he is to make of them, and the loss of Mendel's work is seen as ironic because it was not there when Darwin needed it. It seems to be Eiseley's position that Darwin was not making a leap that others could not make, or had not made, but that, rather, he was positioned to carry the new paradigm of natural selection through an opposition that could not combat his thorough preparation and his dedicated cadre of younger naturalists. The time was ripe, and Darwin struck. It is ironic that he was, in later editions of his book, forced to revert to rather Lamarkian explanations of organic change because of the physicists. They just wouldn't give him an Earth old enough to allow his leisurely form of natural selection by the pruning of occasional random variations to create, eventually, the great variety of life.<br />After Darwin was pruned the story goes on, of course, and Eiseley mentions the work of the Germans in cytology and heredity, the rediscovery of Mendel, and Wallace's speculations about the brain. This book was written in 1958, but Loren Eiseley anticipates, to a certain extent, the evolutionary psychology that is now explaining so much about the human mind. And he weighs in on the side of free will: finally, we must become less impressed with our technology and begin to grapple with the questions that should interest a creature that can look at itself-the basic questions of morality and the meaning of life. It is fascinating to know what we are, but we must ask what we can become.<br />This book is well worth reading (I've read it twice) for the compelling story and the fine prose style. Eiseley was a naturalist and paleontologist as well as an essayist of great evocative power. Here he proves himself a fine historian as well: he seems to have read everything that impinges on the story he is telling, and given us a clear view of a fascinating period in science.	2001-08-02

Patrick Power brought it into English in 1973. In spite of what seems a stellar job of translating, this is still a very foreign work. It is a story of the Gaels of the west of Ireland in an imaginary place where it always seems to be raining. The characters are rural poor who could not be called peasants, as they seem to raise but potatoes to fatten their pigs and keep themselves lean. Ralph Steadman's crude pencil illustrations do justice to the characters and their miserable climate and squalid habits. <br />The outside world, in the form of city people whose first language is English, is just trouble. It might take the form of 'friends' of the Gaelic language who descend on them with puzzling and degrading demands, or of brutal schoolmasters with no Gaelic and no patience, or the law, which can pluck someone away and lock him up for years without justification, or even explanation.<br />And always, there are the rain and the potatoes.<br />The book has some funny scenes, I suppose, although the humor would be called black if the whole atmosphere were not so gray. From my distance and ignorance I can imagine that the effect of this book, once it was translated, was to embarrass all of Ireland about its Gaeltacht. The misery of the people seems unrelieved, and their reason for being but to preserve the Gaelic heritage in a kind of cultural zoo. I don't know the current status of that area, nor the effect the book had, but I am curious.<br />The book takes place in an area not far from the Yeats country. In the Mythologies and the fairy tale collection, the peasantry seem not so bad off as here. I think I prefer Yeats.	2001-07-26

However, following the main argument is not terribly difficult. Ridley really makes a single point and draws an important conclusion: whatever else we are we are by nature cooperators, yet key forms of cooperation are thwarted by the conditions of modern life.<br />We are 'groupish'; we form teams and do our part, and disapprove of those who don't do their parts. We form friendships based on mutual favors, and our accounting of who owes whom what and how much is exquisitely honed and compulsively indulged. We have first-class cheat-detectors, and we use our miraculous language abilities mostly to gossip about others, and whether they are holding up their ends, are free-riders, or perhaps do more than their share, blaming and praising and so keeping everyone more or less in line.<br />These behaviors were 'designed' by evolution to aid us; those who got along with others by being generous, friendly, and trusting, yet also firmly punishing betrayal, tended to do better in life and to leave more offspring of the same ilk. These behaviors do not always translate into being 'nice', and certainly hardly ever translate into a universal love of mankind. But they do lead us to get along with those we feel are a part of our group of the moment.<br />Anyway, given this constellation of reciprocal altruism/cheat detection along with our always-vigilant looking out for Number One, it seems that we do have within us the makings of a workable social mechanism that can deliver benefit to everyone without requiring lots of police. We can, it turns out, avoid The Tragedy of the Commons and the 'war of each with each'. Most people are willing to give the benefit of the doubt in dealing with strangers -- to trust them and be honorable towards them -- if the social climate encourages this. So people all over the world have always been able to deal with common resources in the only way that really assures they can be profitably and sustainably exploited: by making them private properties.<br />Much of the first part of this book was adequately covered in Robert Wright's book &quot;The Moral Animal&quot;. I don't think Ridley adds anything new there, but his discussion of the consequences of reciprocity, or reciprocal altruism, is much more extensive than Wright's. He discusses groupishness, our tendency to operate in groups, which to him is not the same thing as submerging ourselves into some group identity. We cooperate, we trade, we work together by means of groupishness and reciprocity: they explain trust, retribution, gifts, and sharing; they allow us to gain greatly from trading with each other.<br />He notes, amusingly, that we seem to have a built-in dislike of hoarding, and that this sits uncomfortably with the vast possibilities for hoarding of property that modern societies provide. At the same time, private ownership is the engine that has ramped up our prosperity so spectacularly. People work for themselves directly and also for things that they can own. At the same time, people sort themselves into groups of similar levels of resources [that is, of wealth] so as to not have to deal with the hoarding taboo.<br />I think this book makes an important political point in a novel way. And its conclusions can be applied to other than the economic sphere. For example, laws enforcing political correctness often have the unintended consequence of reducing the tacit cooperation that would otherwise enforce community morals. <br />Anyway, Ridley basically is saying that we should use some aspects of our innate nature to control other aspects and get to the good society. Cooperation and trust, properly employed, can do more than squadrons of police to keep people in line. It's an uplifting message. I wonder how many will believe it?	2001-07-26

It was first published in 1994, and brings together a number of strands of Darwinian thought into what is now called evolutionary psychology. The author is a writer, not a scientist, and this book is not science, but journalism. It is reporting on science, but does such a grand job of synthesis, in prose so good and with an intelligence so sparkling, that it emerges as a work of art and as an intellectual edifice in its own right.<br />To explain human behavior, emotion, and cognition, evolutionary psychologists take the following concept as central:<br />Whatever behaviors caused humans (and pre-humans before them) to reproduce successfully are the behaviors that came to be preserved in modern man.<br />The above statement hides a few difficulties, but basically, those who would explain a particular behavior, such as murderous male jealousy, do it by asking how it could have helped those humans or pre-humans that exhibited such a behavior in their environment (which is usually postulated to be a small band of more-or-less close kin living by hunting and gathering) to reproduce more successfully than their fellows.  <br />When E.O. Wilson made some modest speculations about possible genetic influence on human behavior in Sociobiology: the New Synthesis back in 1975 he unleashed a storm of criticism that basically only died down when people stopped using the word \\"sociobiology\\". Well, sociobiology is back, but now it is called \\"evolutionary psychology\\". Moreover, it is legitimate science-but still hated, at least in some quarters.<br />There are lots of reasons to dislike evolutionary explanations of why humans are the way they are. The full-blown theory tends to show us in an unpleasant light, and if you prefer to think of the human as the paragon of animals, then Wright will make you uncomfortable, at least: \\"In the new view, human beings are a species splendid in their array of moral equipment, tragic in their propensity to misuse it, and pathetic in their constitutional ignorance of the misuse. The title of this book is not wholly without irony.\\"[p13]<br />But to some this new explanatory paradigm is more than merely unsettling: it threatens to undermine those convictions-about love, God, free will, our own goodness-that get us through our lives. To some these investigations seem like a vast and gratuitous effort at making us look silly where it doesn't make us out to be merely robots. So be it: there are those, and I'm one of them, who find it fascinating (and scary and disorienting) to be in on this new view of the oldest subject of all, ourselves.<br />I enjoyed tremendously Wright's device of using Charles Darwin as an exemplar of many of his points, weaving the thread of Darwin's life into the texture of the book. Some may find this distracting, but in fact using a staunch Victorian (and so being able to contrast his culture to our own) in what is basically a book that, among other things, wants to try and get at what we mean by moral behavior, is excellent for illustrating important points.<br />The only gripe I have with the author is that he very often takes as true that which is only probable. In explaining behavior that he claims is rooted in a male's constant seeking of status, for example, Wright will confidently draw conclusions in complicated situations where that impulse may indeed operate, but perhaps not as straightforwardly as he uses it. To hide difficulties is not good science, but good science often means hedging any definite statement with a cluster of qualifiers. Perhaps, unless he wanted a longer, duller book, Wright was wise to simplify. I firmly believe he remained true to the underlying concepts of the science.<br />Wright has read much, but also digested much. The book is a joy to read, full of great thinking, clear strong writing, wit, and learning. Its conclusions are exciting and important, if not always comforting.	2001-07-09
US	51337490	RUG5V4FBSEEIX	0486683702	195366542	First-Order Logic (Dover Books on Mathematics)	Books	4	73	75	N	Y	A Stripped-Down Exposition of a Bare-bones Subject	This is a book by a man I knew for his books of puzzles-chatty books of great originality that have fun with the paradoxical possibilities of logic. Here he is the teacher of logic, and aside from an occasional phrase, the serious mathematician. However, Smullyan's originality shines through in this book as well. He presents logic as a branch of mathematics rather than an abstraction of ordinary language. And he uses a method from the recent literature, tableaux, to build his proofs in a simple and satisfying way. He gets directly to the main result as to the provability of valid sentences using this method for both the propositional calculus and the predicate calculus.<br />Smullyan procedes rapidly because he makes some assumptions about the reader's knowledge. The reader must understand the difference between mathematics and meta-mathematics-that is, should be able to separate out the talking about the sentences of the system, which may contain (among other signs) the conjunction, disjunction, and negation, from the more-or-less informal arguments that prove assertions about these sentences using natural language, with its \\"and\\", \\"or\\", and \\"not\\". Moreover, the concept of \\"proof\\" is used at two levels: the particular tableau that constitutes a proof of a sentence, and the \\"proofs\\" about tableaux and other concepts of the \\"system\\".<br />Besides this, the reader should have a good feel for recursive definitions, which are used everywhere. Finally, this model reader should know the difference between countably-infinite sets and uncountably-infinite sets.<br />I knew all that, but still found the text slow going, maybe because I have been away from mathematics for decades. But there is another reason, too. Smullyan has divorced logic from its roots: logics are simply recursively-defined sets of sentences and mappings, and that is that. No discussions, ala WvO Quine, on the history or linguistic difficulties of a concept, just definition and proof. This is an abstraction of a subject which is already an abstraction. So I usually found myself trying to understand what it all meant, in other than these stark set-and-mapping terms. On the other hand, many difficulties caused by the details of historical development of the subject vanish, and the results stand-... simple, directly derived.<br />This is a slender Dover volume, of high quality and low cost. I would have given the book 5 stars, but for two things. The exercises are too hard, sometimes, and without answers, and the index is very poor. Still, I think the treatment is the best around for those who want to use logic as a basis for studying incompleteness or proof theory. It is not to be confused with a more full-blown treatment that also treats logic as a branch of the humanities.	2001-06-15

I'm not personally familiar with Hardy's work (my studies, such as they were, were in computability, provability, and the like), but it's enchanting to think of him sitting down with Housman or Russell at lunch and disputing or joking, so much shared tacit knowledge at the table.<br />The long foreward by C. P. Snow makes the subsequent text richer and more sad than it would otherwise be. Still, the most important point is made by Hardy: mathematics is a serious creative art, and is worth doing for that reason. Moreover, you should move heaven and earth to develop your abilities if you have the talent, and not bother with it otherwise. <br />More generally, Hardy places great value on the doing of something - anything! - supremely well, and has little interest in the lot of most people, which is to muddle through in their arbitrary careers. And there's the rub. Like a great athlete, a great mathematician is finished rather early. Yet he must contrive to live long after his powers have deserted him. Athletes often go to seed when their playing days are over, where less well-endowed people might remain physically active into old age. Hardy lost his math \\"legs\\" and never got over it. And here he's weighing in on Housman's side in the perennial problem of getting old: better to slip betimes away.<br />Anyway, it's a darn good read, and short, at that. And we must remember that it was written in those dark days when Germany was rolling over Europe. Can we blame Hardy for taking solace in the fact that his beloved number theory seemed to have no applications to war? (These days, of course, prime factorization methods constitute a strategic advantage...)	2001-05-14

Odin, and Thor, and Freya - the whole lot of them - are gone, long gone. But still, we do have Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday...<br />It is probably best, when talking of the gods and heroes of a people, to elevate one's tone a bit. And yet the tales must retain drama, and some humanity must stick to these wraiths, or there is no story. So the language cannot be too reverent or the whole thing becomes plodding and foreign.<br />Padraic Colum strikes just the right note, it seems to me, in these connected tales that lead up to the world-destroying-and-recreation event of the Northern peoples, the Fimbul Winter and the Twilight of the Gods. His words are evocative and rhythmic, a bit old-fashioned, and he slips in, matter-of-factly, the strangeness of that world of heroes, giants, and dwarfs, where not only the people but their things have proper names. But contributing equally to the telling are the illustrations - particularly the line drawings - of Willy Pogony. (As Alice says, what is the use of a book without pictures?) And these pictures match and amplify the text so well because they seem limnings of a magical reality, suggested in a sparse vocabulary of line that lets imagination have free play.<br />The whole book is lovely. It's a Dover book, with creamy pages, good binding, and a combination of print and display faces that add to the effect of the illustrations and prose. And it is a tale, really, not a reference work of Nordic myths, thanks be to Odin!	2001-03-16

I was hoping for a straightforward concentrated dose of Margulis's symbiogenesis theory, explaining how eucaryotic life came about as a combining of procaryotes. What I got was some of that, but mostly rather diffuse chat about herself, her colleagues, and the obstinacy of some scientists who don't see things her way. Fine, nothing wrong with such venting, but that was not what I was hoping for. Perhaps this is characteristic of the Science Masters series, where well-known folks are invited to write casually-edited, free-form summaries of the work they are known for.<br />Let me not be too negative: the book really DID talk about some fascinating things, though not in a way that would so much satisfy as tantalize. Again, nothing wrong with that, and perhaps the appropriate reader is someone coming to symbiogenesis or the Gaia hypothesis, say, for the first time. This book could inspire them to further research, and the notes to the literature would aid in that. The notes are not terribly many, but would get someone started. But from this book alone one will get more of a feel for the author than for the subject she so obviously loves.	2001-03-06

His view is that they came later - perhaps much later - after metabolism was established in cells that reproduced sloppily and approximately, but had robust-enough homeostatic mixes that a split was usually successful. This view was approximately that of a Russian named Oparin 75 years ago, but the dazzle of the genome has turned almost everyone to thinking that precise replicators had priority in the development of life over haphazard metabolizers.<br />Dyson does not depend on hand-waving and vague argument to draw these conclusions. He reviews what is known and the main extant theories of life's origin, then introduces his own, using a \\"toy model\\" that abstracts the chemistry and draws conclusions about steady-state solutions that might work. As befits a great theoretician, it is an elegant and powerful bit of theorizing, but does not wander from the constraints of the chemistry -- as far as he knows. But Dyson is clear that the point of his model is to stimulate experiment, and that organic chemists will be the ones to judge the usefulness and viability of his assumptions.<br />Unless you are a physicist, you won't follow some of his work in solving for the model, but you can trust the math and the physics when it comes from Freeman Dyson. Just glance at the equations and graphs, but follow the words in his model chapter and get a real feel for the kind of system that proto-life might have been.<br />He makes a good case for the essence of life being complexity, and that the conceptual purity and rigor of the gene has distracted us from the \\"tangled bank\\" that life at all levels, from bacterial cell to ecosystem to economy, seems to exemplify. Error tolerance -- being able to carry on in the midst of junk and in spite of \\"mistakes\\" -- seems to be more characteristic oflife than exactness. That's a pleasing notion in an uptight age.	2001-02-28

Rex and the Crater of Doom	Books	4	12	12	N	N	A 65-million-year-old Murder Mystery	This is the story of the discovery of why the dinosaurs -- and so many other creatures -- went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, 65 million years ago. Walter Alvarez was a young geologist who discovered an \\"iridium anomaly\\" in a deposit at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary that strongly suggested that an extraterrestrial event of massive effect had happened then. He was joined by his father, Luis Alvarez, a physicist at Berkeley, in the pursuit of the significance of this finding. It seems hard to believe, but most geologists were reluctant to posit anything like a meteor strike as being a significant factor in Earth's history, preferring to explain everything by invoking gradual processes.<br />Yet it became clear early on that something big had happened, and various candidates were mooted, such as a nearby supernova, or a companion star to the sun periodically throwing comet orbits out of whack. This book is the story of how geologists, chemists, physicists and others over more than a decade closed in on the solution -- a massive impact in the Yucatan Penninsula whose after-effects shrouded the Earth in darkness for many months -- starting with that original discovery back in 1977. This is a reasonably lightweight account, but with enough details to give the reader a good idea of the technical problems without descending into jargon. When you are done you don't really know much more geology than when you started, but you might wish you had become a geologist, because the field trips sure seem like a lot of fun.	2001-02-26

In this older approach, paleontologists used fossils to weave a story of species mutating into species as the relentless pressure to adapt pushed them along. The author claims that the vastness of Deep Time (that is, geologic as opposed to historical time) does not allow such narratives to be strung together by using isolated bits of bone, often separated by vast numbers of generations. Or rather, he claims that such stories are untestable, that there simply is not enough context in these widely scattered finds to build any coherent picture, to make predictions, and to verify them. In other words, it is not possible to proceed scientifically. One may have a good story as to why, for example, Triceratops had a crest and horns, but there is no way to verify that it's better than anyone else's rival story. So we're awash in \\"just-so stories\\" that advance our real knowledge not a whit.<br />Enter cladistics. Cladistics does not speculate on why the elephant has a trunk but, instead, uses that feature to help define the clade to which elephants belong, and to relate it to all the other clades, from worms to whales. Cladistics is an important advance in classification method, which makes it an important advance in knowledge, because it provides a new lens to look at old facts. It is a sometimes bracing antidote to too much story-telling with no reality checks. So the topic is an important one. It's too bad that the author fails to grapple with it.<br />I had the feeling of treading water as I read this: not getting anywhere and unable to get any purchase. The few diagrams are annoyingly uninformative, and Gee apparently is uninterested in actually illustrating anything that would support his words: though his points are mostly visual ones there are no anatomical diagrams. He never really shows just why narrative is unscientific - although he asserts it almost continuously - but more importantly, he never gives the reader any sense of how cladistics can illuminate, of where its particular power lies.<br />Henry Gee is not without charm - this book is heavy on the atmospheric evocation of person and place, and I cannot dislike anyone who heads so many chapters with apt and esoteric quotations from Borges. But he just doesn't SAY anything, not really. When one is done with this book, one has no telling counterarguments to use down at the bar when the other guys are pooh-poohing cladistics and roaring out their ad-hoc adaptionist fantasies.<br />I chose it because the blurbs were from individuals, and impressive ones at that. But, of course, paleontology is an exclusive club, and many of these same folks appear in the acknowledgement section. Perhaps what they liked about the book was that it talked about the profession a lot, and about individuals they knew. In that respect the book was a pleasant read, as it introduced a cast of characters, human and fossil, and tried to make a narrative (!) using them.

Most directors consider it has too many witches and sprites, so they cut a lot of song and dance. Then there's that banquet scene climax that comes too soon and dribbles off into the seemingly pointless byplay between Malcolm and Macduff in England. Most of this is faithful to Shakespeare's source (Holinshed), but did the Bard fail to wrestle the material into a coherent drama?<br />Wills makes a case for considering the play in its context of current events and dramatic conventions. In particular, he believes that the recently-foiled Gunpowder Plot loomed so large in the public (and particularly, the royal) mind that much of what seems mysterious or pointless to us can be seen as plain references to the Plot and the Jesuit perpetrators of it.<br />He is a master of the material, and his enthusiasm and high intellectual vigor make this a joy to read. His solution to the 'problem' of Macbeth is radical: Macbeth is a witch, and the supernatural element should be stressed, not played down. Even the scene with Malcolm and Macduff can be rescued if one can see Malcolm as a counter-witch, good as against Macbeth's evil, rather than as cautious wimp.<br />The book is full of ideas for interpreting passages that have always been puzzles, and pulling the drama together. His ultimate justification is that Shakespeare was taking advantage of the times -- and that his first audience for the play was James I himself -- and so DID know what he was doing, that much that falls flat now worked well then. I would love to see a production that -- somehow! -- retrieved this vanished topicality.	2001-02-19

Her style is, in this book of urban reminiscence, still that of the nature writer, that intoxicating blend of the particular and general, close observation and little riffs on the meaning of it all.<br />Her milieu was of the working well-off; her father ran the successful family business and they lived in a Pittsburg that still was in the shadow of the Carnegies and Mellons. They had a housekeeper and a pretty, energetic mother. Annie and her sister attended dancing school and country-club functions, and collided with the boys in her \\"set\\", from whom she was expected to find her future husband. But she also played ball until it was too dark to see, and went compulsively to the woods to watch and to wonder. She collected rocks, and she read and read.<br />Annie Doakes was born the same year I was, but is both older than me, having lived at greater speed, and younger, having, I think, maintained more youthful enthusiasm.  What is essential in this life story is its total focus on the years of childhood.  Most biography skimps this, perhaps planting a few useful images of the wide-open ranchland, or the repressive parents, or the early bereavement that later can do explanatory duty.  Each person is a mystery, of course, but I feel I know Annie Dillard, at least somewhat, after reading the adult describe the child.  After all, we must believe that the child we were is where the adult we are came from.	2001-01-04

Well, this book will not demystify money - like love it is resistant to that, but like love we can't let it go. And its progress through our culture is a fascination, attended by hopes, frauds, inventions, and, not least, desperate invocations.<br />Galbraith is a writer of enormous wit, intelligence, learning, and sympathy. But he is, of course, a liberal, so to many anything he says will be suspected as not arising out of a proper deference to the efficacy of pure market forces. Just as daunting, his strong, ironical style requires a neophyte a few pages to adjust to syntax shock. Once comfortable with the language, though, one can sit back and enjoy the colorful cavalcade of rogues and fools, madmen and prophets, as they invent and wreck institutions, impoverish whole nations, and pay for wars with worthless paper.<br />A Harvard economist, a former ambassador, and a leading Keynesian in the Roosevelt administration, John Kenneth Galbraith is at home in the twentieth century's public life as few others are, and has a firm intellectual grasp of his sometimes slippery subject. This book is a witty, but intellectually serious, history of a concept absolutely central to what we are pleased to call modern life, and how it has grown and changed from exchanging pieces of something shiny to now encompass powerful banks, puzzling foreign exchange markets, and tottering Ponzi schemes. Vast frauds separated by centuries appeal to the same base motives and use the same crude stratagems to separate us from our bit of money in hopes we'll get more. With money, like love, it seems we will never learn. But there is much enjoyment in the lessons, anyway.	2001-01-04

I was sorry to find myself, for the moment, a part of this.

I should not like to be misunderstood on this subject.  The crimes of the Nazi leaders were immeasurable. These men had placed themselves in a position where a further personal existence on this earth could have had no positive meaning for them or for anyone else.  I personally considered that it would have been best if the Allied commanders had had standing instructions that if any of these men fell into the hands of Allied forces they should, once their identity had been established beyond doubt, be executed forthwith.<br />&quot;But to hold these Nazi leader for public trial was another matter.  This procedure could not expiate or undo the crimes they had committed.  It could have been justified only as a means for conveying to the world public the repudiation, by the conscience of those peoples and governments conducting the trial, of mass crimes of every sort.  To admit to such a procedure a Soviet judge as the representative of a regime which had on its conscience not only the vast cruelties of the Russian Revolution,of collectivization, and of the Russian purges of the 1930s, as well as the manifold brutalities and atrocities perpetrated against the Poles and the peoples of the Baltic countries during the wartime period, was to make a mockery of the only purpose the trials could conceivably serve, and to assume, by association, a share of the responsibility for these Stalinist crimes themselves.&quot;(pp260/1)<br />This is a great book. It shows the progress of a fine mind possessed of a practical scholarship and a moral voice in what were often excrutiatingly ambiguous circumstances.<br />Kennan was in Moscow in 1935 when Stalin began the purges; he was in Prague in 1938 when Germany invaded the Sudetenland; he was in Berlin when Germany declared war on the U.S.; he was the chief architect of the Marshall plan.  Of course, he is associated with our Cold War policy of &quot;containment&quot; of the Soviet Union, an association that he regrets, since very little of it reflects his thinking.  The book is a fascinating look at modern power politics from a bemused, but acute, inside observer.	2000-12-28

And if the two are linked, how much more fascinating-and here's a whole book that purports to be about sex and violence, with chapter titles like \\"Rape\\", \\"Murder\\", \\"War\\", and \\"Genocide\\".<br />Alas for the devotees of Real Crime, this book looks at the subject more clinically, but that makes it more interesting, really. If you actually look at the way men behave in certain extreme circumstances, rather than sneaking sidelong glances and then looking away, and talk straightforwardly about what you see, you can come to some surprising and useful conclusions.<br />I should say that the conclusions are surprising to academic theorists of criminal behavior, but not so surprising to the average person. The average person has always felt that rape is about sex rather than domination, and that if you want to discourage mugging, just let a few victims shoot a few muggers. The average person thinks that war, too, is mostly about ganging up to try and take something that belongs to someone else, and getting into a fight. But this is a book that comes to such commonsense conclusions in a way that should also pass muster with the theoreticians.<br />However, a book that talks about extremely antisocial behavior as being linked to one particular sex is going to have tough sledding these days. Furthermore, if it embraces the insights and results of human evolutionary psychology it is going to alienate religious fundamentalists as well as swatches of others of the \\"blank slate\\" school of human mental development.<br />Still with me? Well, the book is quite good, and to this reader at least, offered the surprising insights of a couple of paragraphs back. Perhaps too many years of hearing about the Patriarchy and its strategies of domination has kept me from thinking straight about why men do what they do, from flakking junk bonds to building bridges to robbing banks. Mostly, deep down, they do what they do to get women. Not to oppress them, or dominate them, or enslave them in the kitchen, but to have sex with them. Ghiglieri is an anthropologist, and his field studies (of chimps in particular) have given him a detachment that he applies to his own species. He starts with ideological biases, of course, but apparently also an intellectual honesty that lets the data speak to him and change his mind.<br />He paints a grim picture, but rather than throw up his hands at the intractability of violent behavior, Ghighieri believes that we have the intelligence and, as important, certain countervailing behaviors-the instincts for cooperating and for monitoring cheating-to enable us to contain and channel the always latent violence in our natures. Society foils our impulses in this direction right now (in particular the criminal justice system does), but need not.<br />So I recommend this book. It's a good read, with statistics but also with stories, and its conclusions do not get out too far ahead of its numbers. (Stats on human behavior, of course, are almost always shaky!). And it will teach you some things you didn't know about chimpanzees, too.	2000-12-27

But, in a low-key way, the author leads me to believe that our system is pretty good.<br />This is not a book that analyzes the system of political parties-not a book of political science, in other words. It is a targeted history, which confines itself nicely to a single question: how did our current system of two major political parties arise?<br />I had read the book about ten years ago, and found it unmemorable. I liked it better this time, perhaps because the issue it discusses (that is, why there should be political parties, and in particular, why two of them) interests me more these days. Basically, Hofstadter contrasts the traditional views of party that Jefferson and Madison espoused, with more or less consistency at various times, with what came later-particularly through Martin van Buren and his ilk. Under the Founders parties tended to be factions in legislatures loyal to particular elites. Fairly soon, though, and under the force of necessity, they came to embrace the common man (later yet, woman), and changed character.<br />What is most interesting in this story is that parties were never planned for by those that designed our government, but it is unlikely it could have endured for more than a few years without them. Moreover, the current party situation, with two dead-even opponents of vague ideology but who agree to play by the rules, is probably about the best any democracy can hope for. We have plenty of examples in the world where ideology trumps civility, and party strife easily jumps over into violence. Not much chance of a persistent democracy there!<br />This book is an easy read for non-historians, as is appropriate in its origin as Jefferson Memorial Lectures. And it is pleasant to come out of a history book with a grasp of anything, however limited.	2000-12-06
US	51337490	R35I47P7F6WKB4	0312853025	66295034	The Demon Princes, Vol. 1: The Star King * The Killing Machine * The Palace of Love	Books	5	50	50	N	N	The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Avenger	This is really a review of both volumes One and Two, which belong together, although each one is long enough that a single book would be unwieldy.<br />There are five novellas collected here, three in the first volume and two in the second, that make up the episodic story of Kirth Gerson, who has devoted his life to revenge on the five Demon Princes, who are galactic super-criminals, for a massacre they all cooperated on when he was a child that left him bereft of family, friends, and home. Since then they have all pursued their imaginative evils independently.<br />Gerson was raised by his grandfather to be a revenge machine. He has perfected the arts of killing in all their variety, and cultivates a bland and harmless appearance so as to pursue, undetected and undeterred, the deaths of these (mostly) men.<br />But they will not succumb easily. Gerson's greatest weapon is that these enormously clever and ruthless criminals are not aware of him, or of his mission. They are, however, preternaturally vigilant (as befits those extravagantly beyond the law), masters of disguise and misdirection, and playful in ghastly and terrifying ways. They assume they have enemies, and each time Kirth Gerson draws near his quarry the roles of hunter and hunted become less clear.<br />The premise is gripping, the prose luxuriant and witty, and the action a tasteful mixture of violence and elegant repartee. Vance's inventiveness never flags, and he clearly enjoys the implausible colorful worlds he constructs with so much attention to the details of diet, costume, architecture, and custom. And what could be more appealing than innocence avenged, and dangerous evil decisively defeated?<br />These stories appeared in the old Galaxy magazine (I think!) back in the sixties, over a period of years. I remember getting hold of new ones in college after having gotten hooked by the first two stories years earlier. So, just as it took Kirth Gerson a long time to fully effect his revenge, it wasa long time before we readers had his whole story in hand. But this two-volume collection replaces that years-long suspense with more-or-less instant gratification. The stories are long, but they are all there, in the proper order. It would be cruel indeed to give volume One as a gift without supplying volume Two as well. But Vance's prose is a rich diet, and it's likely that after these books a reader will be ready for some leaner fare for quite some time.	2000-11-28

Here he has written what is essentially a political life of Abraham Lincoln, and he shows us Lincoln the politician in great detail. To be sure, Lincoln's early years are here, and his stumbling love life, but to an extraordinary degree Lincoln was an ambitious man who could only be distracted from his law work by the possibilities of politics. (Amazingly enough, it appears that he was also trustworthy and honest, though working in professions that must have sorely tested his integrity.)<br />There is much I admire in this book, but feel that it lacks the warmth and narrative felicity that make a chronicle of a life really come alive. Throughout, Donald uses \\"Lincoln\\"-never \\"Abe\\" or even \\"Abraham\\". It's a small thing, but it contributes to the book's impersonal tone. Moreover, he almost never describes Abe Lincoln's feelings, and only occasionally touches on his personal life, such as his relations with Mary, or how he reacted to the deaths of his sons. Lincoln comes to seem a man almost independent of his environment-certainly indifferent to food or comfort, or, we suspect, love-whose real passion is for the machinations of politics. However, the author does make credible Lincoln's moral and political greatness; he just does not quite give us a feel for the man. It sounds like Donald's more recent book, &quot;Lincoln at Home&quot;, could be the ideal companion volume to this one.	2000-11-27

It languished for a while, but when I started getting interested in horticultural plantings (my own and those I encountered on my walks) I started delving into it. Before too long I found a strange thing: this book seems to know everything about horticultural trees and bushes--certainly everything that I was interested in, living first in southern Wisconsin, then northern Kentucky, and finally northern Illinois.<br />It finally dawned on me that this was the reference work I had always wanted. Even when I (very rarely!) thought it didn't cover a plant, it usually did anyway (perhaps making short shrift of it in a slightly different spot). As with any other great tool, learning to use it is an iterative process: the more you learn, the better you use it, and so learn yet more.<br />So if you are a plant person, just buy this book, rather than half-a-dozen half-baked horticultural &quot;theme&quot; books. You get a great reference, and as a real bonus, you get Michael Dirr's enthusiasm and planterly asides enlivening the text. (And the paperback version is also sturdy and usable.) Put it next to your dictionary, so it's within easy reach. You'll need it.	2000-11-21

This is a delightful book that brings you into Hamlet as an actor. To see the play this way is to see it as a series of technical problems in the way of bringing off something elusive and difficult-that is, a fine and moving performance. Now Art, like Science, uses technique, but (like Science!) uses technique in the service of wonder. Bringing a great play to life should be a labor of love for the actors; in a great story it can bring them alive as well.<br />I am not an actor, and had not, before reading this book, been terribly interested in the craft. I am a playgoer, though, and had long appreciated that stage acting requires an impressive array of physical and mental skills, and to do Shakespeare well is perhaps as tasking as anything, given the requirements of diction and action, and the expectations of the audience, many of whom have seen the play many times, and tend to be hypercritical of performances of the sacred texts.<br />Pennington has much experience in classical theater, and knows Hamlet particularly well. After a refreshingly plain-spoken introduction he launches into a blow-by-blow for the five days of the play, trying to make the sequences of action and the lapses of time cohere into an intelligible and consistent narrative (a bit of challenge, actually). The running commentary here speculates on character and motivation, with rich asides on the way they did it at the Globe, or how it played in the West End recently, and alludes to other of the Bard's plays and characters without breaking stride. All of this is fun, but is also a necessary preparation. This is a story, after all, and every scene, every speech, every gesture, must contribute to the telling of it. But first, the action must make sense to the actors, or else gesture becomes grimace, and what should fizz goes flat. Reading this book will, I think, cure one of the notion that acting is simply about learning your part. Be that as it may, reading this is also a delightful way to prepare to watch the play.<br />Next, the author takes us through each character, giving us strong opinions, options, and a sense of the possibilities. In one sense, after four hundred years no one is going to have a strikingly original pose for Ophelia, or Hamlet, or Claudius. But the fact is, each generation begins anew, and as the actor forms a past and a personality for his character, he is doing it in a new world; he can't help but be original.<br />The conclusion, of the state of the Play and of the Theatre in general, widens the scope, but keeps the intimate sense of a conversation. Professionals will enjoy this book and profit from it I would think, but any playgoer will find his sense of this play-and all plays-enriched by Pennington's reflections.	2000-11-21
US	51337490	R41UO0TKQX2F2	0670852325	616237912	Chronicles of King Arthur	Books	4	7	7	N	N	An Excellent and Useful Work	This book performs a service, much needed: it gives a coherent account of the \\"King Arthur\\" stories. The author goes through the massive relevant literature-romances and poems in middle and early modern English, and in various vintages of several other languages-to arrive at a reasonably balanced narrative that gathers all the main characters and the principal tales associated with them. Now, there are probably thousands of stories that impinge on this early constellation of narratives, and more that arise every year in tribute to the perennial fascination of those bright initial inventions. But it is these core stories that are the important ones, just as are the core stories of the Bible, and some few of the Greek myths, as basic cultural equipment.<br />This is a pleasant book to read, by a scholar, but not &quot;scholarly&quot;. It is a medium-format glossy with many paintings and drawings by pre-Raphaellites like Beardsley and Burne-Jones that enhance the romance and magic that is so much of the appeal of the stories. There are wide margins to hold the occasional explanatory sidebar, as well as boxes convenient to--but out of the way of--the narrative flow, that discuss the bigger topics . Each of the stories is smoothly presented, with a seamless (but indicated) transition from Andrea Hopkin's connecting narratives to passages using the actual words (rendered into modern English) of the principal teller of the tale at hand, be it Chrétien, or Geoffrey, or some anonymous medieval writer. More than one writer may contribute his bit to a particular story, but the connecting material keeps the telling coherent and compact. This technique gives us a bit of a sense of the corporate authorship of these \\"legends\\", and some of the flavor of the individual style-especially Mallory's, whose words can be presented to us almost as they were written. <br />This book does, I think, succeed admirably, but I object to the lack of index. There is a list of the principal characters, and a glossary, but neither of these is cross-referenced by page number to the text. This book is not, strictly speaking, a work of fiction (tradition frowns upon indexing fiction!), though its \\"facts\\" happen to be the fictions of other writers. It deserves and requires an index. If it survives to a subsequent edition that repairs this lack, it will deserve a five-star rating.	2000-11-17

To be sure, Lincoln's early years are here, and his stumbling love life, but to an extraordinary degree Lincoln was an ambitious man who saw that law and politics were to be his path, and he single-mindedly applied himself to becoming a lawyer, and to political work.<br />There is much of interest in this book, but it lacks the warmth and the narrative felicity that make a chronicle of a life really come alive.

Bill Chalmers looked and acted as normal as all the other cell-phoning and stressed-out commuters. The fact that he subsequently lost his mind is not forshadowed in his appearance or behavior.<br />This would be an ungenerous quibble if it were not lamentably representative of failures throughout the book-local non-starters like the first sentence, or larger problems like characters with incomprehensible motives or with no particular relation to what seems to be the story, up to such overarching issues as the whole point of the thing.<br />Now, I'm not one of those practical souls who insists that fiction must teach or warn. By the point of the story, I guess I mean the arc of drama and character that the reader comes to care about and wants to follow. I recognize that a legitimate aim of fiction these days is to experiment with the form by dashing certain of the reader's expectations. Could this novel be one of those experimental works? Could it be that what looks like poor technique here is actually supreme control in the service of ironical meta-fiction?<br />Not.<br />I must say, though, that certain sections were much more compelling than others. In particular, the Greek \\"lessons\\", which formed a story-within-a-story, invoked atmosphere and summoned character noticeably better than did the writing in the main story. (Though there were scenes in the main story that were well-drawn, too, such as the Bingo game, or Petrov's waiting room.) But even here, in this smaller, simpler tale, the point of the action got lost. (Why did the assassin look into the third cell on the right? Who killed him in Socrates' cell? Why was the Megarian around at all?) More disturbing than that, though, was that the point of the whole Greek side of the narrative never became clear. <br />Anyway, I read the book aloud, in concert with my wife, over a period of two weeks or so. Perhaps it has a better narrative flow at a faster pace, and so I'm being unfair and picky. And perhaps I'm missing clear clues that bring the narrative into focus. Perhaps.	2000-11-09

And he believes that the elevation of the lowly, and the enhancement of everyone else, lies with the intelligent deployment certain new and even newer technology. Given this, he might have written one of two kinds of books, either a shaming screed from the left, hysterically and impractically excoriating us all for dreaming of sleeker cellphones when Bengali villagers don't even have smoke signals, or a pep talk from the right, proclaiming the Trinity of hard work, God, and the unfolding of God's plan for America, where gadgets to make life ever better just generate spontaneously-as mysterious in their origins as babies or businesses.<br />But Freeman Dyson is neither of those kinds of guys, apparently. He's English, for one thing, and he's spent his working life in contact with many of the best technical minds in the world. Although he is a theoretical physicist by profession, and dwells among theoreticians at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, he still finds the practical skills, the technical know-how, and the gadgetry that make science go to be more significant than the theories, and more congenial. \\"Science for me is the practice of a skilled craft, closer to boilermaking than to philosophy.\\"<br />This book is quietly optimistic. It is neither a hair-shirt nor a recipe for success. It informs and entertains, and makes its case for solar energy, biotech, and the empowerment that the \\"internet\\" (he never does capitalize it!) can bring. In the course of this he brings you round to an engineering point of view, and demonstrates how technical know-how coupled with good will can do a hell of a lot more than just good will.<br />But these remarks may make the book seem a bit linear. Actually, it is conversational in tone (as befits what was originally a series of talks), and elaborations and digressions into his personal and professional connections by one of the twentieth century's big scientific players simultaneously lighten this essay and lend it weight. And with all this, it is still a very short book. You will be able to read it this afternoon and still have plenty of time to go downstairs and invent something useful...	2000-10-24

In this case the conversation in question was not even unlikely, as all the participants were available in the England of 1949, and the scene and pretext for their gathering is plausible. However, such a gathering never happened (or if it did, we have not heard of it), but the author thinks it not too late to convene C.P. Snow, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin Shrödinger, J.B.S. Haldane, and Alan Turing, feed them a decent meal and get their ideas on the nature of human intelligence and how it relates to the possible nature of a thinking machine.<br />   So there they are, at Cambridge-in Darwin's old rooms, no less-on a rainy evening, enjoying a multi-course repast. For some of them, this is the best food they've had in a decade, but these are men who are sustained by ideas, so do not let the meal distract them (except perhaps for Haldane).<br />The question before these pre-eminent thinkers is this: how feasible is a thinking computer-can one be built? This is, in short, a multi-part meditation on Artificial Intelligence, come at from different directions. The setup allows Casti to start, essentially, from first principles, since in 1949 the computer is new, and there has been little thought and less work on its potential beyond the obvious uses for brute-force calculating.<br />   Snow acts as moderator, trying to keep the discussion on track, and the philosopher, physicist, biologist, and mathematician argue it out, drawing on their particular expertise and being limited by the complementary prejudices. The author gives Turing and Schrodinger the best lines, and Wittgenstein the worst. Ah, well, it's probably appropriate. So we tend to sympathize with Turing and are annoyed at Wittgenstein (both men will be dead before long, but that does not intrude here). And as a result, we also tend to agree with Turing, as I am sure Casti does-and as I do, too (although, of course, the \\"Turing\\"I'm agreeing with is just a dramatic invention of John Casti).<br />   The author also warns us that he is going deliberately to forshadow some ideas that other people actually introduced later, but give appropriate credit in the Afterword. He does this for the most part, but does not mention that the idea of kin selection (given to Turing in the conversation) is actually due to the late William Hamilton.<br />   I found Casti's writing a bit clunky at times, and the framing device-the meal, the rainy night-sometimes seemed artificially intrusive, but I still enjoyed the book. The ideas were not new to me; I have a background in theoretical computing, though not Artificial Intelligence. Someone approaching this material fresh would be enlightened, entertained, and perhaps delighted by the discussion. A lot of sophisticated chat has gone over the dam since \\"1949\\", but the questions here raised are still fresh, and by no means resolved.	2000-10-23
