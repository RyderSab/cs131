US	51706105	R1SMLYZFUONHJO	142081219X	10927771	Tomorrow Christendom	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A French Classic	Abbot Calvet provides for us a beautiful masterpiece.  He speaks of what Christendom is, why we must restore it, and how to do so based on how it was orignally created.  Although the book starts out rather slow (the first two chapters) it quickly soars to new heights.  Rarely, do I put down a book and am so proud to be a Catholic.  And yet, Dom Gerard Calvet would be so angered at that statement.  Pride is a dealy sin.  No, I am blessed to be a Catholic; God has given me such grace.  This book really shows it.   <br /> <br />I have three warnings beforehand.  The book: <br /> <br />A) does contain typographical errors, as it was not officially edited by a publisher.   <br />B) I feel it cannot be completely enjoyed without first knowing Church history.  I endorse \\"Triumph\\" by H. W. Crocker. <br />C) is not for cowardly.  This book is for those who want to submit totally to Christ.  This book is for those who look at St. Joan of Arc, St. Ignatius, St. Francis, St. Benedict, St. Thomas More, and all the saints and say, \\"Lord, for Thy greater glory, give me the grace to be like these faithful servants of Yours, so that Thy will may be done on Earth as it is in Heaven! Amen!\\"	2005-03-28

I've read many of his encyclicals, but I never read met him as a person until I read this book.  It follows his days from bishop-elect to auxillary, then archbishop, cardinal, and finally pope.  He speaks of the importance of the role of bishop, and how he fulfilled the job, both instructing his brother bishops to follow certain things, but he also says not to make the same mistakes, and mentions them.   <br /> <br />I feel now, that I know Karol Wojtyla the man, and I love him like a father.	2005-03-25

Sex is good, but it's also very dangerous.  This is the teaching of the Catholic Church.  No Church has a more counter-cultural expalantion of what sex is.  Why on Earth does it teach what it does on contraception, non-marital sex, IVF, and homosexuality?  Christopher West, using Scripture, philosophy, and a whole lot of the writings of Pope John Paul II gives a stunning explanation of it all.  A must read for everyone confused by why the Church says what it does.	2004-10-24

Sexually abused as a child, he has dedicated his life to saving the environment, for the sake of the salmon, bears, trees, and us. This is noble.  However, his logic at times takes giant leaps, or his facts are distorted. <br /> <br />I am a man that wants everything to be proven to me.  (Interestingly enough, because of this, I'm Catholic and not an atheist.)  However, Jensen does not prove to me that interspecies communication is as real as he thinks it is.  He cites a study saying most people believe in it.  Out of curiosity, I did a small scale survey of friends and coworkers.  I only found one who thinks interspecies communication is natural.  They are stated something like, \\"Yes, I believe in interspecies communication.  That's how we train dogs.  BUT it only works with domesticated animals.\\"  Could this fact have been overlooked by Jensen? <br /> <br />Jensen then uses the story of his dog his chicken.  His dog would frequently put the chicken in his mouth as a toy.  Jensen claims that his dog understood that he was to no longer do this to the chicken because Jensen said so.  Yet, Jensen admits it took many weeks of yelling at the dog to stop.  Isn't it possible the dog was TRAINED and didn't understand the first time?   <br /> <br />His other errors deal with what has happened when the culture of Europe met people of other races.  He specifically attacks Christians for being \\"bad\\" to the natives.  I would most certainly agree the Europeans were \\"bad\\" to the natives, but I surely would not say they all were or that this is Christinaity's fault (something he seems to understand little about.  Jesus was not the first environmentalist.)  Names like Blessed Juniperro Serra comes to mind, who taught irrigation to groups of Native Americans in the west.  Or Damien Vesteur, who worked amongst the sick of Hawaii.  His attack on Christianity is unfounded. <br /> <br />Although the book does raise good points (that we are in serious trouble), his solutions are lacking, and so are his attacks on what the real problem is.  Therefore, I cannot recommend this book to others.	2004-09-06

I knew seminaries were in trouble, but are they this bad? <br /> <br />I am pondering the priesthood, and a friend of mine handed me this to warn me about what I might encounter.  He wants me prepared to survive it.  However, the vocations director of my diocese says things aren't nearly as bad as Rose portrays them, and Rose rarely uses the names of seminarians who gave him this information. <br /> <br />Also, the book repeats a lot of stuff he mentioned earlier. <br /> <br />Rose talks about how the vocation shortage is contrived, orthodox diocese like Atlanta and Lincoln do not have this problem, and how those in charge do little to stop the rampent heresy and homosexuality in the seminaries.	2004-07-28

Every Catholic should read this book.<br />It isn't as good as &quot;Pierced by a Sword&quot;, his first work, for those who read it, only because this is not apocalypic at all.  The supernatural elements of the previous book aren't here and I love science fiction, so I recommend that first.	2004-07-18

Well, in his mind no one has.  I've seen studies directly contradicting him.  Interesting.<br />But my favorite was he proclaims as a fact that all credible research on the early Church says that everyone believed deaconesses to be in Holy Orders.

Going through each of the main points he had before becoming Catholic (Communion, the Bible, Authority, Salvation, the Incarnation, Mary, the end times, and moral issues) he shows how Biblically and historically the Catholic Church is the one who gets it right.

It is divided into three sections.  The first, quite short, explains the Catholic teaching on the Eucharist.  The second deals with the Eucharistic Miracles such as when the Eucharist looks like flesh and blood comes forth from it.  The last section deals with saints and their experiences with the Eucharist, such as levitating at Mass.  It is great to think these miracles still happen.  The last one recorded in the book is 1970 in Germany.  For any person who has doubts on the Catholic teaching, this will strengthen his faith and for everyone else, it shows the awesomeness of our God.  The book has both the Nihil Obstat and an Imprimatur so there is no need to worry about the book exposing false Cathlic beliefs.	2004-02-07

I just finished the work and remember quite clearly in a list of names of scientists who were &quot;correct but couldn't express it at their time&quot; was Galileo, Newton, and Darwin.  Behe isn't saying evolution is totally wrong.  Nor is he saying Darwin is totally wrong.  Behe, using the examples of blood clotting and other things, shows that the current orthodox position on Darwinism contains flaws.  Darwin may have answered how man came from pre-historic ape, but he didn't answer where pre-historic ape, or any creature, got the ability to see.  Clearly refuting other works that disagree (most titles that disagree actually, as Behe says, offer no explanation but play with words).  Any person seriously interested on where the future of the evolution debate is going must read this book.	2004-01-25

If one has read Quinn's other works, one knows that he rights about world problems from world famine, school violence, relgion, how things came to be the way they are, and how schools fail in teaching children.  In this book, all of that is left behind to another question.  Most people know that Wal*Mart is more wasteful and the local Ma and Pa.  He then examines something else.  &quot;Whould you still work if you had one billion dollars?&quot;  Most people say no.  Obviously, people hate their jobs.  Therefore, he designs a new type of work system based on the two ideas that local is better and work isn't fun.  He claims that it is our first step away from civilization, the human's most dangerous invention.  Then Quinn examines homelessness and how to deal with it.  Now comes for the typicaly conclusion to a review.  Why what others say is wrong:  people won't offer self-restraint and this doesn't solve world famine problems.  First, in &quot;Ishmael&quot; Quinn wrote about world famine. Why write more on than he needs?  No where does Quinn ask for restraint and giving up, only change for the better.  The benefits beat out the costs.  A must read.  (Read &quot;Ishmael&quot; first.)	2001-09-20
