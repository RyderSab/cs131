Who do all the work and let others take the credit? Anti-feminists argue that women lack ambition and drive, or care more, in the end, about taking care of  their families. Drawing  on a wealth of new research and her own psychiatric practice, Fels argues that ambition is social: women, like men, need positive reinforcement from others  for their work (praise, attention,  appreciation, reward, advancement), but, unlike men, are discouraged in many ways from seeking it, or even acknowledging its importance.<BR>   Not a self help book -- there are no Ten Steps to a Better You in these pages  --Necessary Dreams   will help you  think about your life in new and maybe surprising ways.   It's the perfect answer to the ongoing backlash against  feminism that has done so much to make women feel guilty  for wanting things men take for granted.  The writing is a joy, too--clear, trenchant, and witty.	2004-05-06

Henig  has the gift of conveying  complex scientific information painlessly  and the stories she tells are  riveting, full of hubris, lawsuits,medical cowboys, desperate would-be parents, nutty fundamentalists (in one protest at an in-vitro clinic, they carried a sign that read &quot;Incest in a Test Tube&quot;) and, of course, politics.  If you've been following the debate over stem cell research, cloning or the work of the President's commission on bioethics ( its chairman,Leon Kass, appears in this book as an early opponent of IVF ) Pandora's Baby is invaluable. And if you haven't been following, this is a great place to start.	2004-04-14

Here she looks into the careers of some prominent women of the Bush Administration, with devastating results.  We underrate these women at our peril.  As Flanders suggests, &quot;George W. Bush might never have snagged the White House if one woman had been laughed at less: Katherine Harris.&quot;  The media made fun of her makeup and ditzy-dictatorial manner, and missed the fact that  in Florida  Harris was well-known as a powerful, shrewd, and ambitious politician.  <BR>  Bushwomen is perfect  reading for the upcoming election season-- a great book club selection, too.	2004-03-05

I can't judge the authors' promotion of   natural  (ie plant-derived) HRT, although the overheated  hyped-up tone of the book does not inspire confidence.  However, their promotion of early childbearing -- preferably before 20! -- and MULTIPLE childbearing is preposterous.  The costs to women of having babies too early --lost education and work opportunities, hasty marriage, immature parenthood, lifelong lowered earnings -- far outweigh the modest hormonal benefits.  Basically, this is another book that tells women emancipation is bad for them -- nature wants them barefoot and pregnant and breastfeeding for 15 months per child. <BR>  To read this book you'd think no woman lived past 50 unless she followed this taxing reproductive schedule. And yet,  women's life expectancy in the US and other modern industrialized low-birthrate countries is the highest it's ever been, and getting higher.	2004-02-26

In fact, it's neither.  Jean, the hard-driving businesswoman sister, is a wonderful comic invention -- watching her always get what she wants is fascinating, and , like the serpent in the bible, she gets all the best lines, too.  Sunny, the &quot;nice&quot;  suburban-mom sister,  gets what she wants too -- but in the process she has to toughen up a bit and shed some of her illusions about what you can get with a smile.  I loved Carey's dry wit--very sharply observed.	2003-09-30

It's so much better than that ! It's about  certain kinds of deep loneliness and loss, about being just on this side of being truly odd and knowing that, about neurosis as more than a charming foible. The writing is really sharp and clever.  I read my  teenage daughter   &quot;Something Shiny,&quot;  in which the narrator finds herself  pushed out of her own real life by the actress picked to play her in the movies.

As fans of her radio work and her In These Times column know, Flanders is a great reporter, clever, incisive and bristling with facts and information. (She  even notes, for example, that despite the title of her book, women are in fact NOT the majority of the world's population, thanks to the practice in India, China and some other countries of female infanticide and the neglect-unto-death of girl children.)    You can learn a lot about the conditions of women around the world from this book -- and a lot about writing and reporting too.

Some are famous -- Whoopi Goldberg, Linda Ellerbee, Jill Clayburgh, Ursula K LeGuin, Grace Paley.  Others are not.  But all testify to the fear, desperation and danger that surround abortion when it is forced underground. Harsh religion,  sexual ignorance, unsympathetic families, and vanishing boyfriends are recurring themes. Each woman tells her own story--vividly and naturally, without slogans or jargon. Coat hangers and death by sepsis or hemorrhage are not pro-choice propaganda -- they were realities not so long ago.   I hope everyone who supports abortion rights will give this book to a friend who thinks maybe restricting abortion would be a good idea. A definite must for your local public library.	2001-03-29

Kamen interviewed lots of young women and argues that they are rewriting many of the old sexist scripts -- at work, in relationships, in bed. She finds them assertive,  independent and energetic, with high expectations for equality and intimacy, sexually frank and in control of their lives to an unprecedented extent.    A well-written, optimistic portrait of a generation that doesn't usually get such good press!	2001-03-18

I don't know how she does it, but she gets people to open up and say surprising things --  things that even surprise the people who say them. The chapter on the  Citadel is worth the price of the book all by itself. What other reporter  ferreted out the homoerotic subtext of all that soldierly beating and  bonding?      &quot;Stiffed&quot; is very sympathetic to all sorts of male  problems and predicaments-- it is not at all &quot;anti-male&quot;-- so I  am puzzled that so many men have posted strongly negative comments. I hope  that won't deter others from reading the book.  Yes, she focuses on men who  are in some ways out of the mainstream. But each of those portraits is a  jewel of characterization and analysis. And some of those men  are not  exactly obscure. The Spur posse boys, for example  became famous precisely  because they were seen as emblematic of some deep social current. It isn't  Faludi who made them iconic--it was the talk show industry and millions of  viewers. What's wrong with trying to get past the cliches and figure what  makes those teen creeps tick?   A terrifically interesting book that  deserves to be widely read and discussed.	1999-10-31

It documents the trumped up charges against daycare workers,&quot;sex rings&quot; of parents and grandparents -- accused of the most elaborate and unlikely--even  impossible-- crimes against children.  None of the charges came  spontaneously from children, who in fact  insisted nothing had happened.   Rather, children were subjected to highly coercive and manipulative  interviews by true-believer therapists, repeated over weeks and weeks.  the  therapists fed the kids the stories they wanted to hear -- and eventually  got what they wanted. What was presented as physical evidence of abuse  --microscopic bumps  and skin tags on genitals --have turned out to be as  common in nonabused kids and abused ones. Over a hundred people went to  jail, and around a dozen are still there --even though the justice system  has tacitly admitted the flaws in the original prosecutions.  After all, no  one  has brought a daycare ritual-abuse case in a decade.      What I  particularly like about this book is that--unlike some of the other books  debunking ritual abuse, repressed memory and the like-- it's written from a  feminist perspective. Nathan argues that what women and children need to be  safe from abuse is more equality within the family, and more equality for  women socially and economically. For her the tragic turn in feminism was  the turn toward psychologizing incest and sex abuse and presenting therapy  as the remedy, instead of social change. This perspective sets her apart  from the dominant strain  in the movement against intrusive child advocacy,   the &quot;parents' rights&quot; movement, which tends to see children as  family propoerty with no rights of their own, and tends to be extremely  conservative politically.   A wonderful book.	1999-10-01

It may well be unique in its field, moreover, for containing NO academic jargon. No sites are contested, no subject positions are occupied. Amazing! The clear writing makes it an excellent book both for specialists and for those  with a general interest in art and art history, the changing role of  museums, and the quote-unquote politicization of art. My favorite essays  was the one on the  exhibit of Art about the American West at the  Smithsonian a few years ago, which caused such a huge flap because it  challenged the myth of the Romance of the West. I also was fascinated by  the essay on plaster-cast museums, a now forgotten institution of the  late-nineteenth and early twentieth century. But the whole collection is  very satisfying, full of ideas and knowledge. Wallach has very interesting  things to say about the role of the museum in contemporary life -- part  shopping mall, part  leisure-time scene , part--still! -- otherworldly  repository of the Timeless and Eternal.	1999-09-08

At the Breast is sociology at its best-- we think of breastfeeding as &quot;natural&quot; but of course it is social and cultural too.

Rosemary Bray's memoir cuts through  the anti-welfare hype and contempt for poor people, especially poor black women, that brought us &quot;welfare reform.&quot;  Her mother went on AFDC because her father was a violent  gambler, and she had four kids to raise. Welfare enabled rosemary to grow  up in threadbare but at least decent poverty--food on table, roof over  head,school supplies and so forth. Far from promulgating the &quot;culture  of dependency,&quot; welfare helped Bray's mother get some independence.  And far from passing welfare on to her daughter, Rosemary went to yale.    Bray writes so perceptively about her family and her childhood, about the  racism of l960s Chicago (and of yale).  she made me think about all the  little cruelties and deprivations poor people are expected to just accept,  and how wrong this is.   I wish every white person would read this book,  and every person who thinks people are poor because they &quot;don't want  to work.&quot;   Isn't it interesting that even in the midst of the  &quot;memoir boom,&quot; this book didn't get front page reviews?	1999-01-14

I hope the Silent Duchess  changes that. It's an extraordinary book -- a historical novel set in 18th  century Sicily, whose heroine, Marianna Ucria, the deaf and dumb aristocrat  of the title, manages, in small and subtle ways, to become an independent  spirit despite a forced marriage to her uncle at age 13. The writing is  piquant and evocative-- Sicily has never seemed so intense and  alive--sights, smells, food). This is a book with everything you'd find in  a historical potboiler-- sex, love, violence, family, incest, spectacle,  tragedy.  But it's  a serious word of art, moving, sensuous,  thought-provoking.    One of the best novels I've read all year!	1998-11-29
