I'm not a fan of porn unless it's well conceived and well written. So that makes me a fan here! Editor Jesse Grant scores with this collection of stories by Jack Fritscher, some of which were first published in Drummer Magazine and in some of the Brush Creek magazines like Bear. This work is classic, no-nonsense, serious man-sex with characters and dialog for a real 3-D effect. Fritscher is the author of the very long novel Some Dance to Remember, and it's way cool to see him work in the briefer format of the short story. If there were \\"reality books\\" the way there is \\"reality TV,\\" this book would be the one to document sex and the gay psyche.	2003-06-04

The photos are erotic in content and in style, which means the pictures are sexy and shot in a sexy way. The photos are intellectually disturbing because each one makes the viewer think. That makes the photos subversive because while the viewer thinks they are merely erotic, they are thought-provoking, and even have a political edge. The photos are beautiful and unusual and are the kind of art that hides itself--which is the best kind of art. The photos get under the skin of men in an age when most media are focused on women. They are as steadfastly about gender as photos of women are about gender. In fact, these rather amazing photos taken before George W. Bush became the war president reflect the brute strength of America as perceived in the world today. In many ways, these photos are a cautionary warning about the basic American character. The fact that this book was published by a British publisher makes the vision and message of these photos about a secret side of the American character all the more revealing. It seems the photographer had a journalistic agenda to speak a truth while keeping the message about American harshness palpitating under the photos' raw beauty.	2003-05-06

The ethnicity of the main character, Ryan O'Hara, is pivotal to his character development, and adds much local color to the story. All we Irish say we are descended from kings, and so we are, and in this story Ryan is an Irish queen in the same way that his idol, Scarlet O'Hara, is. Thank God, this isn't another \\"coming-out genre\\" book, because this novel bites into what it is to be a gay man who has to grow up and fight the politically correct who are this book's analogous IRA. Some struggles never end! Actually, more than good, it may be brilliant.	2003-04-18

The militantly hetero priests, so preoccupied with chastity, taught really bad messages about sex, about women, and about how real men should behave--and this not-so-subtle gender-agenda amounted to real intellectual, psychological, physical, and spiritual abuse meant to \\"knock the corners off\\" boys, to \\"square them away,\\" to make them obedient and skilled in keeping any scandal about the priesthood or the Church from ever leaking out.<br />Rose's readers might balance his polemic by reading some of the newly emerging seminary literature written by former seminarians and priests whose picture of the Church, vocations, and women gives a more human face to the arguments Rose makes. One thinks of the memoir-novel \\"What They Did to the Kid: Confessions of an Altar Boy,\\" written by a schoolmate of Bernard Cardinal Law, or \\"Escaping God's Closet\\" by Bernard Duncan Mayes.<br />Because Rose on CNN was part of a conversation talking about the wonderful number of wholesome vocations coming out of Peoria, because of the Peoria diocese's traditional values, it is ironic that \\"What They Did to the Kid\\" actually takes place in Peoria and details how the Catholic Church recruited thousands of boys and then dumped them because they were not upper-middle-class enough, or masculine enough, or not smart enough--or, more often, too smart, too independent, too intellectual.<br />Putting these three books together on my reading stand, I realize that the Church's current problem with sex is that sexuality has always been Rome's Achilles heel. Had the Church dealt with sexuality in all its facets from genetic homosexuality to reproductive rights to women priests, this would not today be a media scandal, fueled by, and I hope enlightened by the mix of the dozen good books out there that in their pages, inside their covers, do more for analyzing the Church's sexual problems, and conservative versus liberal agenda, than do most of the talking heads on television.<br />Even with these dozen or so books about the seedbed of American seminaries and how they created a generation of accused priests, why are there not hundreds of books written by the million or so boys who from 1950 to 2000 were recruited to spend time in seminaries where anything could, and was, done to them? Ninety per cent of the boys recruited were turned back (most on their own--rescuing themselves) into the world. What did they know, or sense, and then have the good sense to know to leave, to escape, that the 10% who stayed for ordination did not, would not, could not deal with, and now stand on our altars?<br />Give Michael Rose a read. But don't believe him only. Make a reading list.	2002-06-14

Consequently, I found Jack Fritscher's novel to be as much memoir as fiction, as I was also a student at the Pontifical College Josephinum with both Law and Fritscher, and found the fictive parallels to my memories to be evocative of how we as young seminarians were taught and trained \\"to be pure and avoid scandal at all costs.\\" That, I suggest, is the  innocent essence of the secrecy the media now calls \\"cover-up.\\"  Don't all groups--from firemen and cops to Marines--close ranks around their own?<br /> If one is at all analytical, one thinks that this \\"scandal of priest sexual abuse and priest molestation\\"--driven by media terribly hungry to fill 24/7 programming--is just another part of the fundamentalist religious war to destroy Western Civilization: i.e. Christianity, and Christianity's oldest bastion, Roman Catholicism.<br /> At any rate, Fritscher's novel, despite its media-juicy title, is a gentle, yet eye-popping read about the rigors of seminary life as lived by the thousands of young men recruited by the Catholic Church in the 1950's. His insight lights up the seminary culture that produced the priests of a certain age who now stand--rightly and wrongly--accused.<BR>  <BR> The story is human, engaging, and quite literary, and never exploitative or graphically embarrassing even when confronting a variety of behavior including a Jesuit spiritual director distributing prescription drugs--without a prescription--to depressed seminarians at the fictive \\"Misericordia Seminary.\\"<br /> Actually, the novel is a credit to both the PCJ and to Monsignor Leonard J. Fick who was, apparently, so much a mentor to Fritscher that he dedicates the book to Msgr. Fick. (Anyone conjecturing about the seminary culture of Bernard Law's life might well enjoy this parallax story.)<br /> What a good writer! What an entertaining book! One suspects Fritscher kept notes hidden under his bed, because he remembers minutiaeI had long ago forgotten, but--reminded by this wonderful book--remember, with nostalgia, as true.<br /> I think a \\"novel\\" like this--better than can nonfiction--brings out a truth of how we young seminarians were trained, particularly by priests who, as returning veterans of World War II, set very high standards for priestly masculinity in the adolescent world of young seminarians. Those standards' inherent flaw froze many an adolescent emotional life at 14-years-of-age, perhaps later causing some of them to seek others also at 14-years-old. Author Fritscher even writes, \\"What happens to a boy when he is 14, marks him for life.\\" If this novel, which is never about the obvious, is at all autobiographical in its experiences, what a wonderful life for an author to have led!	2002-04-25

As gay-aware as this book is, there should be mention of the pioneering audio-recordings, films, photographs and  videos of David Hurles, the sociological artist of cons and ex-cons--and the men who love them. Hurles, even before his work began to appear in print in the \\"prison masculinity\\" of \\"Drummer\\" magazine in the 1970s, cuts way deeper than theorist Foucault with actual primary material that these editors should have addressed. The French love the declaratory, revealing, documentary work of David Hurles who has lived the life as \\"Old Reliable Studios\\" in Los Angeles, picking up the mantle of an earlier icon of cons and excons, Bob Mizer, Athletic Model Guild. Hurles revealed that there is one truth of prison masculinity universally taught: \\"Gay men are easy marks for ex-cons. There is always money, shelter, and sex.\\" I know a book always has limitations, but apparently not enough research went deep enough in this book (or was politically checked by p.c.  censorship)to get at the gay core of what prison masculinities really are in the actual lives of masculine gay men living in gay culture. I would hope that a second edition, or a second volume, could correct this flaw in an otherwise well-intentioned study that could have had valid sales in Gay Studies curricula.	2002-04-20

It's also hot. Finally, the Irish come out of the closet. None of these stories--t'anks be-- are stage Irish stereotypes, and there is no sentimental \\"How Are Things in Gloccamora\\"--more like \\"How Are Things In (Sodom and) Gomorrah.\\" Actually, the sex is tasteful, and so arousing Irish papers probably will not review this book, dismissing it as gay, when in fact it's more Irish than they will admit. The cover photo of famed Irish-Brit brat-pack author PP Hartnett is worth framing. Inside, thumbnail glossaries help the Yankee tourist out-on-the-slum with the bits of history and a couple o' Irish words used.

Sue Monk Kidd taps the genre with aplomb and grace of character and style. The book has &quot;voice&quot; as warm and engaging as another novel in this specific genre, &quot;The Geography of Women,&quot; of which Kidd reminded me considerably in the two novels' fast plots, their young white teenage heroines (Lily and Laydia) involved with women of color (Rosaleen and Jessarose) and living with alternative families (May, June, and August in &quot;Bees&quot; and Lulabelle Harms in &quot;Geography&quot;).

This is just one instance of sloppy indexing and sloppier scholarship that mars this volume,and the integrity of the editors--at least to this anal-retentive buyer of historical books. The two editors seem asleep at the wheel, relying on researchers who lack an overview. They should have paid attention. Armistead Maupin in his superficial introduction takes the usual cheap, gay potshot at Judaism and Christianity for the woes suffered by lesbigay culture, when he could have done so much more with the opportunity of the two pages to theorize/talk about the actual Gay-Bay culture itself.

Then I read that it took 3.5 hours for the Titanic to sink and only 2.5 hours for the Twin Towers to collapse. Which all brought me to this book which tells the gay stories from Titanic. Not only informative, but imaginative and probably true, and certainly erotic, particularly the scenes with the sexy Stoker below decks. The story does not trivialize disaster, but rather makes you think about what being gay and being inside a tragedy is like. AIDS, of course, is a parallel subtext symbolically present in the Titanic sinking, just as HIV scares for gay people make the anthrax scares a bit simple by comparison. (At least for now.) I recommend this book particularly at this time that everyone is watching disaster on TV and maybe wants to read some escapist fiction around disaster--where some survive. Timely and hot.	2001-11-03

Even if I did not become a priest, the seminary experience put a permanent mark on my soul. So I truly enjoyed this well-tuned novel that brought back the emotions of my adolescence. The book made me cry a bit and laugh more identifying with its crises of spiritual life mixed with boarding school strife. Despite the rather provocative title, the book is not at all about what you'd think it's about. So anyone with an intellectual curiosity regarding what were the thought processes of boys who really believed they heard the voice of God calling them to a priestly vocation, this book is, frankly, a gem. Perhaps, finally, our generation, touched by angels, is beginning to express itself about our youth and how we got the way we were, and are, and forever will be. Amen.	2001-11-03

Something must be in the air; for Morrison's book appears amazingly at the same moment this spring as two others--similar, complementary, and of literary note--particularly for Reading Lists. One is &quot;Escaping God's Closet: Revelations of a Queer Priest&quot; by Bernard Duncan Mayes. &quot;Closet&quot; is the memoirist essay of an Anglo-Catholic priest dealing with the theology of his sexual essence in San Francisco. The other, most parallel to &quot;Broken Fever: Reflections of Gay Boyhood&quot; is the memoir-in-the-shape-of- a-novel, &quot;What They Did to the Kid: Confessions of an Altar Boy&quot; by Jack Fritscher, who, the jacket says, is a graduate of the Pontifical College Josephinum, which, as a seminary fictionalized, represents the quintessential terror of Catholic education raised &quot;ad absurdum&quot; to &quot;fever&quot; pitch just at the moment when youthful identity emerges. Both Morrison and Fritscher keep their books &quot;pure.&quot; Impurity in both books is masked by &quot;wrestling&quot; which must be the most Catholic of sports for closeted gay boys. Both are &quot;poets&quot;--and perhaps victims--obviously educated in the high-Catholic humanist disciplines of literature. Morrison's &quot;Broken Fever&quot; is to nonfiction memoir as &quot;What They Did to the Kid&quot; is to fictional memoir. Both these writers, specifically Catholic, specifically literate, specifically writhing and writing about a past that, thank God, no longer exists, really ought, with these two new books, to be on the same reading tour as well as on the same reading list as well as the same tranquilizers. I find the comparison and contrast between the two books rather fortuitous coincidence. Morrison's book is I think a finely precise piece that helps expose why Catholicism deservedly collapsed after Vatican II, having for so long terrified its children. Morrison's title metaphor is apt: the Catholic &quot;fever&quot; of the past burned up more than one boy. I know. His book brought up things I hadn't thought of in years.	2001-04-19

In it a diverse group of writers and experts go on about the glories of being a gay male bear which is the latest way to be gay when a man is no longer young or pretty. Some of the writers are pitch perfect. Some of them are, sorry, pathetic intellectually. But that's what diversity rather than excellence gets you. Contributors are the usual suspects--ever-present writers like Michael Bronski, David Bergman, Jack Fritscher who do the heavy-lifting in this bear-sized book. Gronski and Bergman interview each other which--while not so much writing--is lively Charlie Rose territory. Fritscher's foreword focuses the book. The foreword gives lots of bear history and spins some of the daffiness of the authors who've spent too much time in therapeutic groups and then try to intellectualize sex with vocabulary that should dare not speak. Writing throughout book is uneven. Some points of view are wonderful, like the fresh bear from Turkey, Mehmet Ali Sahin. Others are gratuitously shallow like the attempted health advice by Lawrence D. Mass who with his credentials could actually have used this opportunity to counsel bears about usafe oral sex, avoirdupois, etc, and used his income to have hired a ghostwriter. Evidence of the editor is minimalist other than assemblage. He could have come forward and exerted his clout intellectually as the college professor he is. All in all, even with these observations, this book is a welcome addition to the few self-help books on gay men and bears that are out there. With so many bears, why aren't there more bear books, and why does this one so need a professional editor to save the reader from material that would have been dated in a magazine much more so in a book which lasts longer. Conversational tone is breezy and okay, but too many writers spend too much time congratulating each other--something the editor should have cut out. But that hugginess is part of bearness. Overall, I'm glad this book is on my shelf.	2001-04-02

Edward Lucie-Smith's intro is a lucid explanation of the frank way Fritscher photographs the masculine animus. He is Jungian and not P.C., so in his work testosterone is as honorable as estrogen in the human world he shoots. The men in these photos exude natural humanity which Fritscher dramatizes as a photographer and characterizes as a writer who is a photographer naming his frames as if they are illustrations of short stories in magazines. I've seen his work on the covers of many magazines and centerfolds in color, so this black-and-white volume collects his work but without the fey artiness of most &quot;gay&quot; photography where svelte models lean into shadows holding hula hoops. These pictures are actually meditations on the state of being male as one century dissolved into the next. Interestingly, his photographs continue in his books of fiction and in a book of fiction called &quot;Tales from the Bear Cult&quot; which circles around to one of the first books of bear photos called &quot;The Bear Cult&quot; also introduced by British art critic Edward Lucie-Smith. Fritscher was the sometime lover of Mapplethorpe and he is as personal as Mapplethorpe was formal, and both are worth staring at.	2001-03-26

I'm no longer shocked, just haunted by the humanness of Mapplethorpe. A well written reminiscence about life in the fast lane and art that draws my emotions and intellect like recent movies on Jackson Pollock and Basquiat as well as Arenas in &quot;Before Night Falls&quot;, and a bit like the film &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; about Rimbaud and Verlaine with Leonardo di Caprio. The Catholicism of both Mapplethorpe and the author Fritscher plays a fascinating role in the photographer's photo imagery and the author's desire to confess the inside curve of the fast lane of their life together. Photographer George Dureau is one of the strongest characters in the book along with the mystical photographer, Joel-Peter Witkin. Wild.	2001-03-21

As a musclebear porno queen, I read lots of gayrotica in magazines and books. So when I read gay prose that reads like gay poetry really sucking me into the language of sex, I get off on telling my friends. Corporal in Charge, which I read first in a magazine, is as rhythmic as anything Vachel Lindsay wrote in &quot;The Congo.&quot; (OK, I'm a mature Daddy Porno queen.) San Francisco erotica seems more muscular, lyrical, and sensitive than gay writing elsewhere, and this San Francisco author is one of the reasons. His brutally frank &quot;true confessions&quot; stories like &quot;B Movie on Castro Street,&quot; &quot;Hustler Bars,&quot;and &quot;By Blonds Obsessed&quot; are real insights into the downside of gay life that balance the upside of wild stories like &quot;Selfsucker&quot; and &quot;That Boy That Summer.&quot; I've read two books in this series, and this author's writing is, in this reader's opinion at least, a guiding literary light in &quot;the cool erotic fog that wraps San Francisco nights.&quot; He seems to have &quot;been there and done that&quot; to a degree that makes me &quot;believe&quot; the fiction when I'm reading...which is what I want.	2001-03-04
