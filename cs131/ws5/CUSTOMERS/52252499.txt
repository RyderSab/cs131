US	52252499	R115CD7WE2KQ6O	0553587986	126472123	Finders Keepers	Books	4	1	7	N	N	Breakout talent	The first third of the book is a stereotypical romance-novel in its structure and the internal dialogue of its characters. All the tired cliches are trotted out, and truly, much of it could be borrowed unchanged from ANY romance novel on the shelf. The sex is a tad subdued for a romance novel, but there are supermarket shelves devoted to exactly this level of graphic expression. SciFi details are present but irrelevant, in this part of the book.<br /><br />In the second half, though, the author broke out of the mold and impressed me with an interesting plot and (mostly) believable character development. Tivahr's personality changes too radically in a short time, perhaps, but ah! That's the power of love.<br /><br />Also, the 'Sko and Dezi were never described at all (unless I blinked and missed it). We want to picture things in our heads, and that made it pretty darned difficult.	2005-07-08
US	52252499	RBHJPS0RJ2SBM	0451458427	302549224	Revelation (Rai Kirah)	Books	4	12	22	N	N	Sado-masochistic much?	Despite my comments below, the writing is generally amazing.<br /><br />It's clear that Aleksander and Seyonne are sweeties; any pretense that either of them has any connection to a woman is just that -- pretense. I don't recall Aleksander and Lydia ever being in a room together, and Seyonne's wife is a cypher, a \\"beard\\" at best. He loves her, she's beautiful, but he can't spare 5 words to describe her. We never hear a hint of her voice, except when she is coldly using, judging and betraying him, lying, and stubbornly ignoring facts (including his existence). The entire Ezzarian race, apart from Seyonne himself, isn't worth spit.<br /><br />Midway through this book (second in the series), Seyonne briefly feels something for a female -- but it's a demon enchantment, nothing real. Women are almost uniformly distant, angry, and untrusting. Meanwhile, Seyonne's much-talked-about loyalty to Aleksander is unjustified by anything but, perhaps, the Stockholm Syndrome. Aleksander's frequent indignation at being \\"betrayed\\" casts him as the spoilt diva in this play -- truly a queen, not a Prince.<br /><br />A predominant theme is Seyonne's endless torture, beatings, rape, starvation, misplaced guilt, and generally histrionic martyrdom. If \\"Carol Berg\\" didn't sound like a woman's name, I would swear the author is a conflicted and closeted gay man, needlessly and extravagantly consumed with self-hatred. (Not that it matters.)<br /><br />Be that as it may, there are only so many sadistic beatings we can read before they become pointless, ineffective, and simply gratuitous. It's very much beating a dead horse or, perhaps, just wallowing in the author's private obsessions.	2005-06-23
US	52252499	R4ZVWORS0P0J5	0060506512	856200510	The Fifth Ring	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Lousy, lousy map	Overall, it's a pretty good story... an original twist on the Lord of the Rings. There are a number of proofreading problems, but that's standard. The minor character who single-handedly invents telescopes is a cliche, but that's forgivable, too.<br /><br />The MAP, however, is really annoying. Almost every geographical reference in the text directly contradicts Elizabeth Glover's map. Anderon is nowhere on the map, and neither is the province where it's supposed to be (Langton, I think it was). Anderton (with a T) IS there, in a province never mentioned in the book. Sibuyan is said to be north of Alor Sator and Bajan, not south. Bajan and Sibuyan should have borders with Elgaria, judging from the frequent skirmishes mentioned. Stermark and Toland are in the wrong country (Mirdan), where it's improbable they'd be among the first cities to fall in an invasion of Elgaria. Elberton is too far east.<br /><br />As for the text, there's too much talk about keeping secrets (at Elberton) without any actual KEEPING of secrets. Characters joke about what lousy liars they are, and they're not even lying about what matters -- where they're going and how they'll get there. Mathew and others broadcast their first names indiscriminately, and Mathew gives people his last name as well. Telling people they're from Ashford (not on the map) rather than Devondale does no good at all, if everything else is given away for free. Nobody believes they're from Ashford anyway, so the whole thing is ridiculous. All this is not particularly important, I agree, but then, why spend paragraphs on it?<br /><br />Perhaps you could use a better editor, Mitchell.	2005-06-16

Troop writes about dolphins, however, as if he heard the word somewhere but never got any details.<br /><br />Dolphins are not nearly so effective with their teeth as Troop portrays them. In packs they can kill large sharks, but they do it by ramming the fish senseless. If they could easily attack with their teeth, they wouldn't do it that way. On each fighting pass, a dolphin has just ONE chance to use his teeth, and he has no other weapons -- unless you count his ability to stun small fish with his sonar.<br /><br />Peter, with his powerful hind legs, sharp claws, and far more maneuverable neck, jaws, and teeth, could easily tear apart a dolphin twice his own weight, and there wouldn't be any such. Pit the dragon against a killer whale, yes, but a dolphin? I don't think so.<br /><br />The book really left me wondering where all the DANGEROUS fish were hiding; sharks and barracudas, for instance. In fact, the story makes more sense if all the dolphins were replaced by sharks -- except that sharks aren't intelligent enough.<br /><br />I often wondered, too, how a dragon eats a human in mid-air without choking on the clothing!	2005-05-01

Don't get me wrong; I'll undoubtedly read everything Weber writes, so he can't be doing anything a reader can't forgive.<br /><br />That said, his style can get wearying. I remember a 4-page discussion that boils down to three sentences:<br /><br />\\"Hmm... do you think she's dead?\\"<br /><br />\\"We can't be sure. Even if we had a forensics team in place, there are no DNA samples available for her.\\"<br /><br />This passage is the norm, not an exception, and that very same discussion is repeated at least four times, with no meaningful changes.<br /><br />A Weber character would never say, \\"I'm going home now.\\" No, a Weber character would say, \\"Under the circumstances, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure I won't be going home rather sooner than later.\\"<br /><br />And he'd say it again in different words, just to be sure.<br /><br />Only in a battle does Weber cast off the chains of verbosity and get things in gear.

I'm a mathematician myself, but I do think Dalrymple presented the math simply enough that most readers can understand or just skip it without serious damage. The \\"isochron\\" methods depict the solution of complex problems in comparatively simple graphical terms, and the underlying radiochemistry is clear enough, although the details are beyond a non-specialist (as they should be).<br /><br />Chapter 4, on the other hand, was far too laden down with terminology. There must be 50 words for different igneous rocks alone, and a neophyte will see no method (or reason) to distinguish between them. I kept wanting to hear verbs to go with the nouns and adjectives. The word \\"metamorphic\\" (and various synonyms) appeared a thousand times, with very few clues on what HAPPENED to cause metamorphism. Nevertheless, I was able to learn a great deal, despite these frustrations.<br /><br />I was fascinated to hear in Chapter 5 that, by 1975, over 30 thousand pages of scientific research had already been published on moon rocks. That's a lot of serious study for 382 kg of rocks -- which is quite a bit more than I thought, at that.<br /><br />The chief \\"problem\\" with the book is also its great virtue. Dozens of radiometric methods and the analysis (in some detail) of hundreds of rocks are discussed, when a few examples would suffice for most readers. This gets very soporific after a while.<br /><br />But the many, many examples and the exhaustive chronology reveal how imaginative but sometimes wrong researchers have been, and how tirelessly other researchers have triple-checked their work until finding the errors and developing more trustworthy methods. It is also clear that reliable methods have been checked copiously against the results of other methods, until there can be little doubt about the general results. One cannot read this book honestly, I think, and go away believing a few scientists conspired to come up with false answers just to please themselves.<br /><br />In the Preface, Dalrymple makes the point that geochemists and geophysicists (for example) can barely read each other's specialty literature, despite the close connections. It takes experts in those areas and many others, working together, to seriously evaluate details of the models and results presented in this book.<br /><br />That being so, it's incredible that so many non-scientists (or sometimes scientists in very unconnected fields) have the unmitigated gall to attack the findings of professionals for any reason, but especially when motivated by their interpretation of the writings of unwashed, uneducated, long-dead \\"prophets\\".<br /><br />It truly boggles the mind.themselves. <br /> <br />In the Preface, Dalrymple makes the point that geochemists and geophysicists (for example) can barely read each other's specialty literature, despite the close connections.

Here are a few lines that illustrate what I mean:<br /><br />p. 281: \\"A young man might be dead and you didn't see the need to rush!\\" Pot calling the kettle black, big time. These so-called investigators never question a witness unless he's dead, and they forget to question most of the dead ones, too. It's a serial killer of children, and they're more concerned about giving someone the impression that Lucas might be part of the Cabal someday. For half the book, just about ANYTHING else is more important than the investigation.<br /><br />p. 329: \\"That fake phone call had tested the limits of my deceptive abilities.\\" You said it, sister!<br /><br />\\"Was I casting without knowing it? ... Could I do it again? But no, I couldn't rely on magic. Not now.\\" And that's the problem. Except for one or two set-pieces per book, magic is purely a parlour trick, a distraction from more important things -- like running. It's certainly not something you'd rely on.<br /><br />p. 481: \\"Your father invited us to the masquerade. Maybe we should go.\\" This is the king of stupid ideas. The Cabal has thousands of tough guys, and you're going out in public to protect the CEO, when YOU'RE a more likely target? I don't think so.<br /><br />Even worse is the Cabal killing its only suspect without asking him any questions. He's a computer nerd, three thousand miles from most of the killings, and all they know is that he had NAMES on his hard drive. Do they ask who his accomplices are? No. Uh uh! Not in this universe!<br /><br />But what's the worst thing of all? The Fates. Sitting in a room spinning thread, cutting it, spinning, cutting... Well. At that point, it's clear none of this is the least bit serious.	2004-12-23

There's just the right amount of human (and alien) folly followed by the proportionate consequences. \\"Sense of wonder\\" is abundant, yet it doesn't take center stage -- just as it should be.<br /><br />My only gripe has to do with the SB or \\"subliminal briefing\\". The SB is a plot device and nothing more. Sure, it's a CLEVER plot device; I almost wish I'd thought of it. It helps the author delay revealing a few (quite meager) secrets.<br /><br />But it serves no purpose whatsoever for anyone in the story. Just the opposite; it could easily have caused Shan to make wrong decisions for lack of timely info. That didn't happen only because (a) her mission was terribly obvious anyway, and (b) it didn't even matter, in the end.	2004-12-19

She escaped into the worst kind of prostitution because she couldn't bear to be associated with it in any way.<br /><br />As for how Klale could decide she loved Blade, love is mysterious in any case. She saw through Blade to Simon, that's all. And he changed her.<br /><br />If I have a criticism, it's just that even a post-apocalyptic society can't allow \\"tools\\" to exist; not in the presence of education, law enforcement, and all the trappings of local democracy. Choi would be a criminal of the worst sort to these people, and they would have dug him out and dealt with him.<br /><br />That said, the book is nearly perfect.

A biologist who samples biota should recognize the same behaviour in others, and she should easily recognize the dangers of an intelligent species that grows too fast and recklessly destroys the environment. Mac's job is the study and protection of salmon populations, for pity's sake.<br /><br />Czerneda's writing is generally very adept, so it may be an editor's fault that italicized passages intended to be a character's thoughts are not treated like dialogue, as they should be. For instance, Maybe she was learning to deal with repeated shocks should have been Maybe I'm learning to deal with repeated shocks! -- or else it shouldn't have been italicized at all. I may be the only one annoyed by this, but I was VERY annoyed.<br /><br />I give the Webshifter books 10 stars (out of 5), the Trade Pact series 4 and a half, and this book? Barely 3.	2004-12-05

The 12th book of the series has 81 chapters. Count 'em. Six to eight contain some fairly interesting action.<br /><br />Another 15 to 20 chapters amount to an encyclopedia of bondage, domination, and S&M. We're used to the idea, by now, that Anita must have sex-play every few hours or somebody dies. We miss the good old days (three or four books ago), but feeding the \\"ardeur\\" is de rigeur, now. It gets annoying, but that's not the problem!<br /><br />60 chapters of CHATTER are the problem.<br /><br />Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Girl talk. Relationship talk, usually about who, why, and how Anita must \\"do\\" next and why she shouldn't feel guilty. It's girl talk between Anita and her boy-friends, mind you, not Anita talking to other girls. She's not into girls, darn it! The boys are prettier than she is, so maybe they count as girls, somehow. (But not with me.)<br /><br />LKH's writing is still competent for the most part, but the dialogue? Yikes!! Every other page, she resorts to transparent prompting, such as \\"What do you mean?\\" or \\"Define intimate\\" when it's already obvious. We must hear every detail; we can't rely on what we already know about BDSM, Anita, the boyfriends, or anything else. Discussing trivia goes on for 3-4 CHAPTERS, and it's often the same trivia as ten chapters ago. Or twenty.<br /><br />MY ADVICE: Read one sentence per page until you find some action. Read that chapter, then go back to one sentence per page. It will save a lot of time and maybe your mind, as well.<br /><br />Sadly, I had no one to give me advice like that.	2004-11-23

Josephus wasn't born until 37 C.E., so he had NO direct knowledge of Jesus; anything he wrote on the subject would be hearsay.

For instance, 2^101-1 was known to have at least 4 prime factors, but no factors were known.  At the time (1964-1966), ENIAC was being used to compute such things.  Yesterday, on my lowly Pentium 4, using Mathematica's built-in functions, I factored all the numbers completely in less than 45 minutes of computation time.  One of them (2^251-1) took 34 minutes and 7 seconds and another took 5 minutes 10 seconds -- all the rest were very fast.

Phedre is a spy, a courtesan, a diplomat, a self-made noblewoman, a pain-seeker, and a vulnerable human being --- and none of those dimensions are give short shrift.  There's little here to titillate, if that's what you want, but otherwise it's a good story all around.	2002-04-23

The love story here resonated for me, though it seemed to be fumbled away at the end, without the climax (no pun intended) it deserved.  The plot hung together well, and I liked the strong characters --- especially a new Dr. Smith, at long last here to rehabilitate the name for space voyagers everywhere.	2002-03-02

My idea of good science fiction includes many things, but caring about the characters is absolutely necessary.  The rest is bonus or worse, fluff.	2002-01-15

I was amazed to see that one computation --- finding the first two Wieferich primes --- was said to take 10.5667 seconds on a Sun workstation (in 1991 or before, I assume).  On my Pentium II notebook PC, it took 0.04 seconds!	2002-01-15

It can be useful to leave some things unexplained, but when nothing is explained or grounded in any kind of reality, the whole thing devolves into fantasy (rather than science fiction).  The difference is a sense that what happens MATTERS, because there are limits to what can be fixed.  If young Daric's &quot;love&quot; interest is dead, no problem, she's a &quot;soul&quot; that can be brought back to life.  If Daric himself slips and dies, no problem.  No matter WHAT happens, no problem.  So, why should we care?	2000-12-07

I'd forgotten the author, but now I see the resemblance.  The only thing that didn't ring quite true in \\"Lot Lizards\\" was how completely  just ONE vampire retained his humanity.  The characterizations are good,  mystery is sometimes left alone to remain mysterious (as it should be), and  in general there's not a dull moment.	1999-11-24
