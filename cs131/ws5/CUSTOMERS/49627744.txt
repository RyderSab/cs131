Also, comparing the presentation (which is chronogical), with other acclaimed books like Penguin History Of The 20th Century and Hobsbawm's 'A Short Century', I like this one much better. Its to his credit that inspite of presenting the events year-wise, the merit and positioning of his analysis of the broad sweep of events in not affected negatively. The narrative is easy to follow and one does not tend to get lost even if the book is picked up after a couple of days gap.<br />The most interesting feature of the book is the contemporary opinions of people, quotations, reports - they make the narrative come alive. I was finally able to really understand the rise of the Third Reich and the events which led to the war and (as an example) could relate it (in a way) to why the US insists Iraq be 'contained'. The complusions/motives of the actors on stage are very well explained with good insight into their personalities (with anecdotes and comments to back it up).<br />The book is more British-centered that the US, but that only makes it more refreshing.<br />For my money, he's the best writer if you want to understand the 20th Century. Next is the Penguin Book Of 20th Century history. Hobsbawms book provides good analyis but, I think, does not tell the story very well. The Oxford Book Of the 20th Century is a sham.<br />One reason for the greatness of this book could be that it does not tell you any more or any less than you would need to know in order to grasp why things happened the way they did in this tumultous period. The series is in 3 huge volumes, unlike the other books mentioned above, and gives the author enough scope to write to his hearts content (how fortunate that this was just right for me!).<BR> <BR>What else? Well, its really difficult to read at night coz the size makes it difficult to hold - dare I suggest splitting the current 3 into 6 volumes!	2002-09-17

The irreverent tone and sprinkling of humour make this a very amusing read. This book is probably not for serious student of history, but for those usu. scared of history tomes, I would recommend it unhesitatingly.	2002-09-14

When I started reading the book, I was put-off by anti-Islam statements without basis. 'Oh no, not another Islam-basher', I thought. Somehow, I persisted, and I am glad I did. The rest of the book lays a good background to why the author thinks that the Islam religion itself is a violent one. The idea is something everyone in the contemporary world is trying to find an answer too. I don't think anobody has the answer, yet.<br />Meanwhile, as part of the debate, Price presents a very good argument. His tone is not shrill but fairly calm and mature. The historical background is fairly well researched. I was reading Amos Elon's A' Blood-Dimmed Tide' along with this book and found some factual discrepancies indicating bias on part of Price.  So, apparently the author is biased, but that is what one expects in a debate of this kind. I looked at it as one side of the story. This book is probably not a must-read if you want to read about the region, but it is interesting nevertheless.<br />And yes, if you haven't read 'A Blood-Dimmed Tide' - read that too.	2002-08-31

His analysis of history, and the people who make it, is rich and personalized. Littered throughout his reports are nuggets of little known facts which greatly enhance the reading experience. His detail of observation and grip on the facts make you trust him. Its a reflection of the author's long association + first-hand experience with the issues, and wisdom. The book variously reads like a report, biography, travelogue, and history. The one I enjoyed most was the piece on Alexandria - made wish I could see the place.<br />You know how it is when you read editorials of respected newspapers/magazines - hoping to get a wise and real perspective on issues - this book is a bit like that.	2002-08-30

The series is one helluva 'tell-it-like-it-is', Kinsey is a lovely character, and the mood is always comic-sombre (a bit down but never out - even while winning! noir style?). You can enjoy every book in the series - come rain or come sunshine.	2002-08-30

I have enjoyed reading Dawkins, Gould, Maynard Smith before. This book is only slightly less enjoyable.

Had good possibilities. The plot is good towards the end - when the investigation really picks up. Overall, not so good a story - still, once you have read one Kinsey, you have got to read every single one ... and that's the truth. So read it, and enjoy whatever you get out of it.

The plot pulled me right in - all the agonizing twists and turns. Some new facets of Kinseys charatcter were exposed, I thought. The ending is - ummm - below average. I agree with some reviewers that is it perhaps too surprising - the final explanation adds up - but only just - not good enough, really.	2002-08-30

As an Indian, I really enjoyed a lot of the initial background (even though some part was 'imaginative'). But sooner than you know, the plot runs into nonsense. Tom Clancy is famous for accuracy of info - too bad he did not write this one. An example - the terrorists find that the shortest path from Srinagar to Pakistan is via Siachen - what a crock. ...! On top of this, the back cover is misleading - the story is NOT what it says on the cover - quite crazy really.Indicates pathetic editing and publishing values. I was glad I had not paid for the book - only borrowed it. <BR>The action is unbelievable - literally. I wish someone else would pick up the idea and write a better book. And I hope the author would take ONE look at the map of Kashmir (I doubt if he could visit Siachen - so the faked description of the glacier and its dubious use in the plot is excused).	2002-08-30

In all the years since, I have read and read and read, but nothing approaches this book as far as epic adventures go. If you like Alexander, Ramses etc. (which are very popular and can be found in any shop - unlike Aztec), it might interest you to know that they vanish into oblivion in comparison. Jennings is a supreme story-teller, and this is his masterpiece. The book has nearly everything: adventure, violence, sex, intrigue, and has a feel of the romantic about it. I cannot comment on the historial accuracy of the events, but don't let that stop you from reading it - Lord Of The Rings is complete fiction too, after all. I promise you you will soon be feeling smug about having read this one when others haven't and you will be recommending it to them soon.	2002-08-24

The issues related to Cosmology and Quantum Physics can get foggy for a lay reader, unless (s)he keeps reading more and more. This is just one book which is an indispensable part of the pop-science collection so necessary if you are into Cosmology and Quantum Physics. Paul Davies is a fine writer and I value his books just next to the Gribbin, Rees, Barrow, Hawking books that I have (can add Brian Green to that too). And this is one of his best. I have taken off half a star only because the book has a 'little' vagueness in the way it progresses form one topic to the other. One has to re-read it to get a wholistic picture of what has just been told - er, having written that, I'm not sure if it is criticism.	2002-08-23

And I intend finishing the series as soon as I can (or what's available in the library anyway). The protagonist, Kinsey Millhone, is a character that invites comparisons with Philip Marlowe. Chandler was dark and classy (great dialogue) - Grafton is sad-funny, and very contemporary. The way she writes has me convinced that she cannot write a bad book - and I will never hesitate to pick up any of her books.<br />As for this book - its quite good - probably the best of the series so far (of the 3 I have read - C, D being the others). The narrartive flows evenly. In crime/adventure novels, I often skip the parts where characters indulge in psycho analysis, dissecting their misery (and/or that of others), mental state, and concentrate on the action instead. But not when the writing is as impressive as in this book. This is surely pop-writing - but manages to rise a little above the genre into something more artistic. And Kinsey is lovable.<br />But hey, if you have't read Ray Chandler - I'd point you there first - anyday.	2002-08-23

This book introduces the ideas of some of the mavericks of current science. The ideas are so interesting that at times this book is better than any thriller I ever read. The only quibble is that a couple of chapters exposed ideas without much foundation (i.e. too far fetched and not really ground in science - like the one about angels - ETs - creating the universe).

Many scenarios are not plausible and read like a  mystery novel. The cavalier manner in which the journey is planned and executed is unreal. Things cannnot be happening in such style even in current expeditions. The expedition looks like a wild-west excursion, the doctor having to rely on memory for doing healthchecks, the lack of a chain of command, decision that would definitely have been taken on ground being taken in space etc. ... The story is dragged too long and the hallucinations of Nicole and the psycho-stuff grind the pace of the novel down.	2002-08-16

Diamond has done an enormous amount of data gathering and analysis. In my opinion, he's done a great service to mankind (and people like me). The stuff you will find in this book is of universal interest (in my opinion), but very hard to classify and hence tough to find in one place.

All too often, I am put off by Nobel prize winning books because they are too dense for me. Or simply because I cannot connect with the characters portrayed in them.
