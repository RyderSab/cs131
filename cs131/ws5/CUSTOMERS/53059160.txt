It goes to extreme lengths to make analysis understandable to people who have no prior exposure.  The organization is good.  Completeness is introduced early as (the &quot;piggy in the middle&quot;).  Proofs are written in detail with fill-in-the-blank spots to force the reader to follow the argument.  It has good exercises making it an easy book to teach out of.  Excellent for the absolute beginner.  Good candidate for the classroom.	2002-12-21

Loring Braces's review above is a rehash of his review in the newsletter of the National Center for Science Education.  It is a remarkably uncritical review.  Dr. Brace stresses Dr. Graves role as a scientist.  But he is also a professor of African-American Studies.  Although the book shows impressive scholarship, it seems more of a political tract than a scientific one.  To suggest that race is merely a \\"construct\\" is facile and wrong.  This is a political line of the left that does not gain credibility merely by repitition.  It is also a line imbued by disingenuousness.  To paraphrase:  race is a mere construct invented by the white race to justify the racism that is a characteristic of the white race.  Dr. Graves is to be commended for his openess about his hatred of Sir Frances Galton, but that does not make it palatable.  To blame Galton for Hitler's use of the word \\"eugenics\\" implies that Hitler's motivation was what he claimed and that he was not opportunistically stealing a term from science.  Why do people give Hitler so much credit intellectually?  Why can't they recongize that his motives were baser than he claimed?  The connection of Galton with Hitler's later use of the term \\"eugenics\\" has always been nothing but a cheap shot.	2002-09-08

I am not writing a review of its pedagogical or mathematical merits. My problem with the book is its sells for about [$$$] bucks for 153 pages but the quality of printing is so poor it makes the book hard to read. The pages are not opaque which means print from other pages appears through. The line spacing is narrow and the inner margins are very small. The hard cover seems to me to be of inferior quality as well.	2002-03-17

The book is well written and argued; far better than many of the critics can recognize.  If anything I feel Mr. Goldberg is too kind to the press.  I am struck by the many negative reviews that make the same point:  the networks are owned by giant corporations and therefore the networks would never tilt to the left.  There are two problems with this argument.  It does not answer any of the points of Mr. Goldberg.  (It is interesting how many of the critics will not give their names as well.)  Secondly, by this logic Hollywood studios, which are owned by large corporations (or are large corporations) would never release movies hostile to business.  Did you see &quot;Erin Brokavitch&quot; (or however you spell her name)?  Do you actually think that movie was accurate and fair to big business?  The litany of anti-business movies would exhaust the 1000 word limit imposed here.  In short the big-businesses-own-the-networks argument is not only irrelevant, it is wrong.	2002-01-06

We are told that Galileo ignored friction in order to get \\"neat results\\" and somehow caused Western science to only study linear systems.  He seems to think that nonlinearity and chaos are the same thing.  He tells us that nonlinear problems are not solvable.  He actually suggests that we have only recently seen that the three-body problem is chaotic.  (Instead Poincare proved the chaotic nature of the problem around 1890.)  He seems to think that Asian philosophies actually capture the mathematical substance of chaos theory.  I could go on.  If you want to study chaos get the volume \\"Chaos and Fractals:  New Frontiers of Science\\" by Peitgen, Jurgens, and Saupe.	2001-08-10

In its short space it can not do each fully, but nonetheless, she does an excellent coverage of history, philosophy, and applications.  Although this is not the ideal book for learning to do probability, I suspect many students would find it helpful.  As she herself demonstrates if you have not studied probability, you are doomed to misunderstand it even if you are otherwise mathematically sophisticated.  Consequently, this book is ideal as an introduction to the subject for people at all levels.  (For those who want to learn to do probability calculations, I would recommend two books.  If you have not had calculus you might try the book by Samuel Goldberg.  For those with calculus, I would suggest either the book &quot;Probability for Engineers and Scientists&quot;  by R. W. Hamming or the book &quot;Introduction to Probability Models&quot; by Sheldon Ross.)	2000-10-14

However, this book has problems that are interesting (often counterintuitive). They are well written as are the solutions.  Much of the book is at the pre-calculus level but the problems are not trivial; neither are they arcane.  Many teachers use this book as a source of problems.  It is great for all students of probability.	2000-10-13

Given that it is short and that I could not put it down, it was over far too quickly.  I think it would be an excellent book to read and discuss with teenagers.  One thing, unlike some other reviewers, I am sure that the main character does not talk, not out of willfulness, but because she truly is unable to.	2000-10-07

However, as is always the case in such books the  book is more formidable than it intends or than it looks.  Still it is very  friendly especially compared with, say, &quot;Numbers&quot; by Ebbinghays  et al.  The coverage is wide:  primes, reals, Cayley numbers, Eisenstein  numbers, polygonal numbers, catalan numbers, Stirling numbers of both types  and of course Bell numbers.  There are the cardinals and ordinals of Cantor  as well as Conway's own surreal numbers.  (And an earlier reviewer was  correct about misprints and color problems.)  I recommend this to anyone  whose mathematical maturity is at least as great as basic calculus (and who  is interested).	2000-09-09

Ruse, who is a professor of philosophy covers in great detail the culture  of Darwin's time with a great deal of information on the biological  theories of Darwin's day along with many of the major players and their  various attitudes and especially their philosophies of science and in  particular biology (and geology).  This book is a must for anyone who wants  a good historical view of Darwin.  It is well written and clear but it is  not a light read and it is not for the casual student.	2000-08-28

It is an ego trip lacking in really useful  information.  It is amazing how much prattle there is about fuzzy logic  without good examples or detailed discussion.  The philosophy is  superficial and misleading.  The idea that western scientists have been  stuck in a binary mode of thinking unaware of the subtle ying-yang Eastern  view, is a cliche that is false.  Western scientists have been amongst the  first to appreciate Eastern philosophy and have experimented with various  forms of multivalued logics and generalizations of probability for a long  time.  If you want Eastern philosphy go elsewhere. And I am not interested  that the author was sitting in a hot tub when he had some brilliant idea.   This is one of the most overrated books in a long time.  Let me tell you  something more, when these fuzzy logic gurus explain the shortcomings of  probability theory to solve the same problems, they usually use a  particular interpretation of probability.  However, whereas there is  general agreement about the mathematical syntax of probability, there are  many interpretations about what probability means.  Fuzzy logic is one of  the most overhyped theories of the last century.  The claims of its power  and greater ease of use, do not stand up to scrutiny.	2000-08-20

It does several different things well. Each topic is covered in increasing level of theory. That is, when it gets too theoretical for you, move on to the next area. If you do not like the proofs, no one is forcing you to read them. There are mini-courses spread around in the text; for example there is one on number theory and another on probability. These courses are well done; however given their concise nature, they are more useful as reviews than introductions. This book does require some mathematical maturity, but it is very much an undergraduate text though I myself have taught out of it at the graduate level. The writing of the algorithms in pseudo-code is as clear as I have ever seen. At the end of each section is a nice summary of the literature for that area. There are sufficient examples and the general writing quality is of a very high caliber.  Note that this review refers to the first edition.	2000-07-19

The second book is a good undergraduate introduction.  However, Topics could be use at the graduate  level.  I. N. Herstein was a great authority and his writing has unusual  clarity.  Topics is not only more advanced than the other but I think it is  simply the better book.  The first edition helped me in graduate school  some thirty years ago.  The treatment of group theory is particularly rich,  with a thorough explication of the Sylow theorems.	2000-07-12

The terminology is a little out of date, e.g. &quot;sequences&quot; are &quot;functions of a positive integral variable.&quot;  It is marked by great organization and copious examples.   What I appreciate most is the clarity and simplicity of the proofs.  This  is a great book for any serious student of real analysis prior to the  Lebesque integral.	2000-07-02

It covers most of the first half of a mathematical statistics course (which is 2 semesters long and requires the calculus sequence) which is on probability.  This book does a nice job of  covering all of the usual topics in probability in that sequence.  The  applications are to statistics, but are insufficient for a course in  statistics.  But these applications are well done and as such I think this  book is a great resource for the student taking the mathematical statistics  sequence.  As for probability, I have taught a senior level course for math  majors out of this text twice and intend to use it again.  However, I did  not have time to cover the applications to statistics (which I urge the  students to study).	2000-06-21

There is no other book on complex analysis roughly like it.  It is roughly at the junior-senior level and of course requires a background  in calculus and preferably real analysis.  I suspect many students who have  already had the C.A. course might enjoy reading this to find out what they  should have learned.  It is a must-have for anyone interested in complex  analysis.	2000-06-19

This is a brief text on complex analysis aimed at the traditional junior-senior course.  As a text it may be a little too succinct for the average undergraduate.  For example, I have no intention of teaching out of  it.  However, its clarity and presentation is absolutely refreshing.  I  think it is one of the best books written on complex analysis in the last  twenty years.  I recommend this book to any student of complex analysis.	2000-06-19

Hamming was one of the great applied mathematicians of the 20th century and was a good writer.  This was his best book.  I would not use this for a text to teach from.  However, for anyone who has had calculus  and wants to get into probability, this is my first recommendation.  It is  a great book to read and is full of tricks and insights.  It is much better  to see generating functions here than in some dry merciless presentation.  I heartily recommend this book.	2000-06-14

It essentially a book on Galois Theory based upon a course Dr. Stillwell taught (so he told me).  I am sure that that was a great course; I think that Stillwell is one of the best  writers in mathematics.  But I would not teach a course out of this book at  the undergraduate level.  It is a great book to read for the student of  Abstract Algebra.  Although he introduces group theory in the text, I think  the fundamental test is group theory:  If you already know some group  theory then you may enjoy this book as much as I did (which is quite a  lot).	2000-06-12

Essentially Professor Childs gives a minicourse on number theory as a precursor to abstract algebra.  He then developes ring theory before group theory and takes a  particularly historical approach to groups.  There is a lot of serious  attention to applications such as coding and cryptography (although both  concern &quot;codes&quot; they are different areas).  There is attention to  finite fields and the foundations of Galois theory are given if not the  full treatment.  This book is a good text if not a great one, it has enough  material to give the instructor flexibility in the course.  It is a good  book for the serious student to have in his/her library.	2000-06-10

For a short quick reference the book by Schey is delightful.  Marsden and Tromba give a more thorough and complete work.  It is well laid  out and has good illustrations.  One could look at this book as Calc III  with applications.  For most people that part of the calculus sequence was  far too quick and terse.  This book is the antidote.  It is definitely  worth considering for use in the junior-senior level course on vector  calculus.	2000-06-08
