She knows that she is adopted and decides to confront her suspicions head on by traveling from Kansas City to the Langtry ranch in Shiloh, Wyoming with Eden, her best friend and paleontologist.  The first person Sable meets is the ranch foreman, Culley Blackwolf.  He is quiet, strong, and protective of the family.  Sable and Eden pretend to be interested in Faith Langtry's pottery to get a feel for the family.  Faith invites the girls into her home where they meet Jacob, Faith's husband and Roark, her son.  After the brief visit, the girls return to Kansas City where Culley shows up suspecting who she is and telling her that she has to face this now or wonder for the rest of her life.  She and Eden end up returning to the Langtry ranch for an extended period of time where familial and romantic relationships develop.  Of course, there's the proverbial bad seed, Eden'd brother, who adds malice to the story.  I really enjoyed the two romances and found myself equally interested in both.  The women characters felt real, strong and not model perfect as many are.  However, there were a few spots where I wondered if pages were actually missing because the sentence didn't continue on the next page.  Also, Ms.London repeated the same phrase too close together a couple of times and I found that disappointing in a professional author.  The book was sappy in places, a little far fetched and the last 30 pages were not as good as the rest of the book.  However, overall I enjoyed it, but it's no 5 star.	2002-02-22

Jackson Novels)	Books	2	5	6	N	N	Confusing	This is a story about two friends, Brady and J.W., who enjoy fishing and end up trying to find two missing persons.  I just read the latest Brady Coyne novel and liked it but this book which is written by two authors was difficult to read.  The characters take turns narrating every other chapter which would be fine but the timeline was not sequential and ended up confusing me.  The two main characters were very similar and I found myself stopping to think &quot;which character am I reading?&quot;.  It was so slow that I was glad to get to the end of the book and didn't really care what had happened to the two women.	2002-01-25

It was a terrific, fast paced read.  The story surrounds an Oregon private investigator, Rainie, and an FBI profiler, Quincy, who have met on a previous case.   Quincy's daughter has a fatal car accident and he employs Rainie to investigate the circumstances.  Soon it becomes obvious that someone incredibly clever is stalking his family members.  The hunt is on to discover his identity and catch him before he kills again.  I don't want to give anything away so I will simply conclude by saying that the story was so cleverly woven in parts that I could swear I heard Lisa Gardner say &quot;Gotcha&quot; to me.	2002-01-25

Alex Carrigan's usually controlled life is turned upside-down by the sudden appearance of a 12 year-old daughter(his?), an aging, dramatic grandfather and a beautiful, smart woman trying to find her soulmate.  Alex's grandfather missed his one chance at love and now will Alex let it slip through his fingers as well?  Alex's grandfather enlists the help of Faith Christopher, a local bakery owner, to find his true love who he hasn't seen in 50 years and put to rest a terrible family curse.  Faith's former fiance's family has taken her under their wing and so she struggles with her feelings for both these families.  This is a heart warming story whose only drawback is the flashback dreams that plague Faith but they are relevant to this story so we must endure them.	2002-01-01

Tapply has written many books, this was the first one that I have read and I enjoyed it.  The editorial review of this book gives quite a bit of information about the story itself so I will focus on my opinion of the book.  I sometimes find mystery novels by male writers a little dry, so I was pleasantly surprised with PAST TENSE.  Tapply's experience as an author shines throughout the book.  The character of Brady Coyne is multi-dimensional with his honesty, yet he walks around the truth and frequently uses his attorney status to further whatever he needs. The supporting characters and small town description of Cortland was amusing and accurate.  The story itself was not fast-paced but rather developed steadily.  There are several smaller mysteries lurking in the book and while you may figure them out along the way, it's still an enjoyable ride.	2001-12-31

It's a mystery about a separated, antique collecting woman, Jane, who discovers her next door neighbor murdered and finds herself in the middle of the investigation as suspect and sleuth. The most interesting part of the book was easily information about collectibles and the hunt to find them.  Jane's character was interesting and real with some witty dialogue.  However, the whole sideline about her parents added little to the book.  The mystery itself was confusing and inconsistent. Without giving away the ending, suffice it to say that I think Jane would have seen the symptoms before the very end of the book.  I did like it but will look forward to Sharon Fiffer's next book and the improvements of experience.	2001-12-28

Tess Marsh finds herself out of gas on a deserted stretch of highway when a guy on motorcycle, Dallas, has to stop to avoid hitting a pair of elk.  She is immediately weary of his rough exterior and initially rebuffs his offer of help.  However, with her limited options and his civility, she decides to let him give her a ride to the closest town. Before they can leave, the rest of his motorcycle gang arrives who have different plans for Tess.  She is taken hostage and Dallas attempts to protect her as best he can.  The adventure takes off from here.  Characters were great, story was original and not too tidy (as many are these days), and an all around fun read.	2001-12-26

Unfortunately, the rest of the book never quite lived up to that excitement.  It simply slowly unfolded.  Mitch is a despondent film critic who has lost his wife and can't bring himself out of the ensuing depression.  His boss sends him off to do a travel article in hopes that a change of scenery will do him good.  He finds himself renting a carriage house there on the small Connecticut Island of Big Sister.  A dead body turns up and Desiree, a Lieutenant in the Major Crimes Squad, is summoned to investigate.  There were several interesting facets to the main characters.  Since Mitch is a film critic, the frequent comparisons he makes between old films and real life were right on target.  Desiree's constant search for homes for her rescued stray cats was amusing and also showed her need to produce the happy outcomes that she couldn't in her job.  However, I felt the attraction between Mitch and Desiree was forced and didn't feel real.  It could have easily been left out entirely.  Mitch has an idea on how to resolve the murders that works well with his character but I thought there could have been more of a twist at the end.	2001-12-26

The story revolves around second grade teacher and child psychologist Julia Talbot and her favorite pupil, Brian.  She helps him with baseball and even attends his games.  Brian is the son of Stephen Stratford who is a senatorial candidate. Brian starts to become withdrawn.  Julia is afraid that his father's demanding political life is taking its toll on Brian and she is not about to let that happen.  Brian's Uncle Connor is close to his nephew and knows the real problems that are facing his brother.  One night Connor gets a disturbing call from Brian's mother that she needs his help.  Stephen has become involved in gambling and blackmail and now his family is being threatened.  Connor comes to the rescue to keep things quiet from the press but when Brian goes away for a few days, Julia wont let it drop.  Connor tries to reassure Julia that everything is fine and ends up distracting her with his charm.  Julia keeps searching for answers and finds out too much.  Will she be able to help Brian before it's too late?<BR>The intensity of the romance was a little fast but had to be to go with the storyline.  The suspense was good and the supporting cast of characters were great.  I liked that the ending wasn't quite the standard formula.  The epilogue was a little too saccharine sweet for me but most readers like fairytale endings.	2001-12-20

Kat is a young woman living in California and working for her stepfather who has raised her since her mother died when she was 12.  She never quite feels truly loved by him and feels a strong desire to find her own father.  She has never known who he is but finds possible clues in her mother's old chest.  These clues lead her to a small town in Kentucky and to men with J's in their names.  She meets Zach when she almost runs into him and his horse trailer.  His horse is on its way to the Kentucky Derby and Zach is trying to prove himself to the town.  While waiting for the tow truck, she confides in him why she has come to this town.  He believes she is just a city girl who should go back home.  Kat is not deterred and proceeds to ruffle feathers of men with J's in their names.  <BR>While I guessed who her father was early on, it was entertaining to see how her appearance in town caused so much commotion.  I thought the relationship between Kat and Zach was good, and his cowboy &quot;from the wrong side of the tracks&quot; feeling was interesting.  I was a little skeptical about his spending time with Kat looking through photos just days before the Kentucky Derby a little hard to swallow, as well as what goes on at the Derby that day but it ties everything together.	2001-12-18

As a romantic suspense (with a hint of history), the romance was a 1, the suspense a 3 and the details of illuminated manuscripts a boring 1.  There was very little romantic chemistry between the lead characters and the only thing that redeemed the book was the slightly interesting (if not tidy) ending.	2001-12-16

Nick shows up to help with the extended babysitting and thus begins their journey to work through painful past events and ever present attraction.

It's about a wealthy female author who gets threatening mail and ends up with a bodyguard, Mac, to keep her safe.  The history of their relationship was never really divulged in great enough detail.  I kept feeling like they knew more than I did.  If Caitlin cried one more tme in the book, I thought I'd scream!

He makes a promise to their mother to solve the case and when his superiors feel he has become too involved they send him on a forced vacation.  He has a clue and ends up following it to vacation in Dilmun, a small town in upstate New York, &quot;where nothing bad ever happens&quot;.  Here he meets Holly Newman who has a connection to the clue and the story unfolds from here.  <BR>I particularly liked the human qualities in this book that many main characters often lack.  Vince, a seasoned cop, is deeply disturbed and overwhelmed at finding the children's bodies.  Holly is a fragile and compulsive woman who has to count steps in her head so her mind doesn't wander to frightening depths.<BR>There is a twist and ,of course, the who done it? part of this book.  I knew the twist early on but I didn't figure out the murderer.  <BR>There were a few small things that I didn't think worked like why the three townsmen met in private at late hours to have secret meetings.....for what?  Why would Reginald D'Voe move back to that town when clearly Amanda had frightening things happen to her near there and bad memories would resurface.  However, overall it was an enjoyable read and I will look for others by Maggie Shayne.	2001-12-04

She looks out the window to find the man, Will, who left her at the alter over 20 years ago and who broke her heart.  He was wild and passionate and different from Michael who she had known her entire life.  While this is an interesting enough book, I was never quite caught up in it the way I think it was intended.  I felt disappointed that Casey would pine for Will for 20 years and then he would just show up and ask her to leave with him and she would agree.  I thought the ending was the most interesting part of the book and redeemed it a bit.	2001-12-04

I gave the book's first 100 pages the benefit of the doubt but then I started skipping pages, then chapters and finally decided that I didn't care what happened to the characters and skimmed to the end. The storyline of a Brittish photographer who flees to a NYPD detective for help after meeting online wasn't convincing and didn't flow.
