Others are quite vague.<br /><br />Older wills focused on the intracicies of Jewish law; more recent wills focused more broadly on nonsectarian principles of ethics, or on vague exhortations to observe Shabbat and keep kosher.<br /><br />Older wills focused on burial details; more recent wills have rarely done so.<br /><br />The most inspirational, in my view, was David De Sola Pool's (pp. 109-11).

Nevertheless, the book raises a few interesting points:<br /><br />*pointing out the difference between appropriate behavior in private and in public.  A child is (under Jewish law) free to argue with parents in private, but must be more circumspect in public.<br /><br />*generally, Jewish law focuses on obligations of material support- understandably given that in an pre-industrial economy, parents' economic power declined as their physical strength declined.  (By contrast, today, even middle-aged children are often dependent on wealthier parents!)<br /><br />*Despite the preindustrial tradition of arranged marriages, rabbis generally (though not unanimously) held that a mature child's interest in picking an appropriate spouse overrode parental objections, based on the theory that marriage and procreation were religious obligations as weighty as honoring parents.<br /><br />*Saadia Gaon wrote that Jewish opposition to nonmarital sex arose from the danger that humans might not know their fathers as a result of unplanned pregnancies.	2005-10-06

For example, the Torah requires witnesses for a defendant to be executed, but these thinkers held that secular kings are not bound by this requirement, based on the broader necessity of social order.  Nor are the crimes listed in the Torah the only ones justifying execution: Maimoinides writes that if a king \\"is ordered by him to go to a certain place and he does not go . . . the king may, if he so decides, put him to death\\" (p. 51).<br /><br />Maimonides asserts that a king's authority may be limited in some ways: for example, tax laws should be applicable to all, not \\"to one person alone\\" (p. 63).  But Maimonides fails to suggest a remedy in case kings violate this principle.<br /><br />Maimonides also asserts that a religious aristocracy should interpret Torah law, but fails to explain how conflicts between Torah law and secular law should be resolved.<br /><br />Later thinkers such as Rashba focus on local government, emphasizing that local, self-governing Jewish communities, like kings, may do whatever the times dictate.  Rashba also discusses national law, treating Torah law as an unmet ideal rather than as a separate legal system.<br /><br />In other words, these medieval intellectuals favored a form of church/state separation- certainly not the modern view opposing religious coercion, but a more modest claim that Torah law is not always binding upon civil authorities.<br /><br />The obvious implication of this view is that even according to Jewish scholars, the Torah's protections for criminal suspects are of limited relevance to the modern world.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like: the opening chapters seemed to be so abstract that they did not seem related to the rest of the book.ited relevance to the modern world.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like: the opening chapters seemed to be so abstract that they did not seem related to the rest of the book.	2005-10-02

This book generally repeats what the author believed to be the law, rather than explaining arguments for the author's positions in detail (or mentioning \\"close calls\\" involving splits in halachic authority); the author sometimes cites sources, but often does not explain why the sources justify his position.<br /><br />On the positive side, this book discusses noble ideas in a way that any reasonably intelligent 12-year-old could understand, and the overwhelming majority of the author's points seem to be common sense.<br /><br />However, I wish the translator had put in the occasional footnote to explain or justify some of the more difficult or bizarre statements that appear in this book.  For example:<br /><br />*the book states that where the wife objects to the husband's generosity, the husband need not \\"pay heed to her, since the money is his.\\" (p. 39).  Is all household money the husband's? Or are there limits to this principle?<br /><br />*The author asserts (understandably, given the poverty of Jews in 19th-century Europe) that charity to Jews takes priority over charity to non-Jews.  So do what extent does the rules he cite apply to relationships between Jews and non-Jews?<br /><br />*One passage states that although one may pray for the sick \\"in any language . . . at the side of the patient.  When not in the patient's presence, however, he should use Hebrew only, since angels have to bear his prayers aloft and they understand no other language.\\" (p. 201).  This statement implies that angels are necessary intermediaries between man and God- a view that seems in tension with the general Jewish view that God is omnipotent and incorporeal, to put it charitably.  It seems hard to believe that a well-reputed author such as the Hafetz Hayim meant such a thing, let alone that his view would be common.<br /><br />Also, it would have been nice if the translator had explained how some of these ideas had evolved over the past century; the Hafetz Hayyim seems to have been writing for an audience of small businesspeople who lived and died by loans, while many modern Jews are professionals who have regular salaries.t his view would be common. <br /> <br />Also, it would have been nice if the translator had explained how some of these ideas had evolved over the past century; the Hafetz Hayyim seems to have been writing for an audience of small businesspeople who lived and died by loans, while many modern Jews are professionals who have regular salaries.	2005-10-02

The basic message of most essays in this book is that growth management and inclusionary zoning simply don't matter as much as their vigourous critics suggest: that neither program does much good or much harm.<br /><br />For example, one of the earliest essays compares Montgomery County, Maryland (which has a growth management policy that preserves some of the county's farmland, and which also has inclusionary zoning) with Fairfax County, Va. (which is much less restrictive as to both issues), and concludes that affordability problems existed at a roughly similar rate in both counties.<br /><br />Similarly, another essay evaluates Oregon's urban growth boundary and its affect on housing prices in Portland, and concludes that Portland has not become more expensive any faster than other western cities with conventional zoning.  (Although as William Fischel points out in a reply to that essay, a city with no zoning at all would be cheaper than either Portland OR other heavily zoned cities).<br /><br />One small quibble: the essays betrayed lots of confusion about what the ultimate goal of national housing policy should be.  For example, one response to the Portland essay (Fischel's) complains that prices are too high in the West- while another reply suggests that Oregon's policies might actually reduce home values by trying to urbanize essentially suburban areas.<br /><br />Government housing policy is afflicted by the same confusion - on the one hand, government funnels money into housing in order to increase affordability, but on the other hand government restricts development in order to bid up housing prices.  We as a culture cannot decide whether we want expensive housing to protect existing homeowners or less expensive housing to protect the people who aren't homeowners.	2005-09-12

It seemed to me to be a little more detailed as to the first issue than as to the second.<br /><br />Schnall's most interesting points:<br /><br />*The Jewish attitude towards work.  Addressing an analysis of 900 work-related statements from Talmud, Midrash, etc.  Schnall finds that 84% of references to work are positive.  For example, one rabbi interprets Moses's call to \\"choose life\\" (Deut. 30:19) as choosing a vocation (p. 48).  And the Talmud states that \\"If you eat by the work of your hands . . . Happy are you in this world, and it will go well for you in the world-to-come.\\" (p. 49).<br /><br />*More ambivalent Jewish attitudes towards some trades- various statements in the Talmud criticize vocations that would bring men into close contact with women (such as jewelers), doctors, professional movers, etc.  These criticisms, however, have had little impact on later codes- an example of the proposition that not every comment in the Talmud is relevant to modern halacha.<br /><br />*Should Torah scholars work at other trades?  Schnall again quotes an analyses of analysis of about 900 statements in the Talmud, Midrash, etc. and finds that 65% of statements endorse pursuit of Torah and work jointly, 29% favor Torah only, and 6% place work first.  In the last millenium, there has been a similar division of authority, which Schnall briefly describes - a majority view favoring Torah and work, complimented by a vigorous minority view.<br /><br />*Employer/employee relationships.  Schnall does not focus on the details of Jewish tradition, but tends to give a broad (sometimes too broad for my taste) overview, emphasizing that local custom has always been great weight - understandably given the impossibility of fixing rules that will make sense for millenia.<br /><br />*Schnall tries to compare Jewish and Catholic traditions, noting that over the past couple of centuries, popes have tended to favor employee involvement in management, an issue that has never been on the Jewish agenda. Schnall suggests that this difference exists because Jewish sources believe that \\"the seeds of religious fulfillment lie elsewhere . . . in study, prayer, peneitence and good deeds\\" (p. 196).<br /><br />Occasionally Schnall says something that begs for elaboration.  For example, he points out that prosperity depends not just on effort but on mazal, and suggests that this word connotes not only \\"luck or fate [but also] the astrological signs ascendant on the day and at the hour of birth.\\" (p. 57).  In order to avoid giving the false impression that Judaism supports astrology, Schnall might usefully have mentioned Maimonides' attacks on same.<br /><br />Schnall also makes some effort to discuss labor unions and their medieval predecessors, but I found this discussion a bit harder to follow.  For example, he quotes a Talmudic statement that laborers sometimes have the right to collectively set wages and hours- a proposition understandable where a guild of craftsmen is involved.  But how does this rule apply, if at all, where the laborers all work for the same employer?  If the laborers seek to collectively bargain, can the employer fire them?  I couldn't quite figure out whether Schnall was trying to address this issue or not.<br /><br />The very end of this book is intriguing.  He suggests that outreach groups focus on business and labor issues.  Schnall reasons that focusing on prayer, ritual and holiday observance creates a \\"largely one-sided\\" relationship because unaffiliated Jews are \\"bereft of any preparation in this realm\\" (p. 205), while economic issues are \\"a familiar subject with most people.\\"  (Id.)

Johnson Metro Series)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	some surprises	Most of the reviews I've read of this book focus on the obvious: that lots of office space is outside downtowns and \\"edge cities.\\"  (Though not all of this office space is in outer suburbs; some of it is in urban areas outside traditional downtown).  But there's more to this book than that.<br /><br />\\"Edgeless cities\\" are hardly a new type of urban form.  As early as 1980, 1/4 of office space in the 13 metro areas studied by Lang was in an \\"edgeless city\\" (that is, an area that (1) is not downtown, and (2) has less than 5 million square feet of office space).<br /><br />Lang also discusses \\"edge cities\\" (large, usually auto-oriented, collections of suburban office space) and asserts that they are in deep trouble.  In the 13 metro areas he studies, the amount of edge city space built nosedived from 322 million square feet in the 1980s to 108 million in the 1990s.  What happened to the edge city fad?  Lang suggests that NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) opposition makes it impossible for \\"edge city\\" suburbs to grow outward into residential neighborhoods, and that these suburbs are stuck with an auto-oriented street network that prevents them from \\"growing up\\" into traditional downtowns.  In short, edge cities are simply unable to grow.<br /><br />Lang's data also shows how widespread the downtown rebound of the 1990s was.  In the 1980s, downtowns had hit rock bottom: only 31% of new office space was downtown.<br /><br />By contrast, in the 1990s 40% of new office space was built in a traditional or satellite downtown, as opposed to 38.8% in edgeless cities (down from 43.2% in the 1980s) and 21.1% in edge cities (down from 25.5% in the 1980s).  So perhaps American metro areas became more centralized rather than less so in the 1990s.<br /><br />Perhaps the most extreme example of this phenomenon was Los Angeles, where the traditional downtown's percentage of 1990s office space (23.8%) was actually HIGHER than downtown's percentage of pre-1980 office space, while edgeless city office space decreased from 32.3% of pre-1980 office space to 26.8% of 1990s space.edgeless city office space decreased from 32.3% of pre-1980 office space to 26.8% of 1990s space. <br /> <br />	2005-08-30

To be sure, pre-Reform Jews universally accepted the Torah as Divine and as roughly the same as the original text.  But Shapiro asserts that historically there have been minor deviations in Torah scrolls, and that even today nine letters in Yemenite Torahs differ from those in those used by the rest of Jewry.  Shapiro also cites numerous medieval commentators' assertions that some non-halakhic portions of the Torah, although true and divinely inspired, were written by Joshua or Ezra rather than Moses.<br /><br />Shapiro also asserts that some of the Principles were arguably contradicted even by Maimonides' own later writings.<br /><br />A minor quibble: Shapiro's discussion would have been clearer if he had put Maimonides' own language in his book as an appendix.	2005-08-28

The solutions to this state of affairs were completely counterproductive: downtown business interests assumed that downtown's problem was too much congestion rather than too little, and so fought for a downtown overrun with parking lots and highways.  For example, an official of one downtown business group in Los Angeles wrote in 1940 that freeways \\"will go a long way in solving the traffic problems and consequently make the trip to downtown Los Angeles pleasant for customers and productive for downtown merchants and office tenants alike, and thereby recentralize businesses and offices in a compact area.\\" (p. 274).<br /><br />The result: even more suburban sprawl as suburbanites took advantage of easier commutes to move further out, and an even deader downtown as highways and parking lots took the place of shops and offices.<br /><br />Why did downtown boosters make this mistake?  Because in downtown's heyday at the start of the century, downtown really was immensely congested; due to the difficulties of intracity travel, nearly all business was downtown.  So like generals fighting the last war, downtown boosters were fixated on the congested downtown of 1900, and trying to apply 1900 solutions to the far less lively downtowns of the late 20th century.	2005-08-21

Gordis focuses on God's response to Job at the end of the book, asserting that God's speech about the beauty and mystery of the natural world is not merely an evasion, but a implicit claim that \\"just as there is order and harmony in the natural world, so there is order and meaning in the moral sphere, though often incomprehensible by man.\\"<br /><br />Gordis also makes some interesting points about Job- suggesting that Job's failure to consider the idea of an afterlife shows that Job is a relatively early work, and emphasizing that Job never considers atheism an option.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the first few chapters and the last few chapters are dominated by technical discussions of grammar and conjectures about Job's historical background - all of which I found to be rather dull.  I think those parts of the book to be of interest only to people with great interest in philology (i.e. not me).  In addition, Gordis's translation is not always the most readable: for example, he has Job asking: \\"Can tasteless food be eaten without salt, Or is there any savor in the juice of mallows?\\"  Since I have no idea what a \\"mallow\\" is, I much prefer another translation which has Job referring to the tastelessness of eggs.	2005-08-15

At the start of the 19th century, New Haven was just one of many small towns in south central Connecticut.  But by 1910 it was an industrial powerhouse with 80% of the region's population. What went right?<br /><br />Once railroads were invented in the early 19th century, intercity (between cities) transportation became much easier - but at the same time, intracity transportation was still cumbersome.  So industry was centralized in a few downtowns, and most people lived within a mile of their work.  And cheap energy (through coal and steam) benefited port cities which, like New Haven, lacked the power of falling water and thus did not have a large mill industry.  Moreover, coal (unlike modern electricity) was also easier to transport between downtowns than within cities.  So labor and capital were centralized in New Haven, which by 1910 was a crime-free, bustling, very urban place.<br /><br />New Haven stopped growing as early as the 1920s, and started to shrink in the 1950s.  What went wrong?<br /><br />Rae lists a variety of factors- some that were beyond the control of any politician, and some that could have been controlled through more enlightened public policy.<br /><br />In the first category, Rae mentions the rise of the automobile (which decentralized regions by making transportation within a region easier) and the rise of the electric power grid (which allowed cheap energy to go beyond regional cores).  Television decimated the city's volunteer civic organizations, and national centralization of industry meant that local groceries were supplanted by regional supermarkets and New Haven's industries were bought by corporations headquartered in other cities and often moved around the country or around the globe.<br /><br />In the second category, Rae criticizes highways that encouraged movement to suburbia, public housing projects that anchored low-skill people in urban cores that were losing low-skill manufacturing jobs, zoning that discouraged retail outside of a few commercial streets, New Deal housing agencies that discouraged investment in urban working-class neighborhoods, and urban renewal projects that bulldozed those neighborhoods in the 1950s and 1960s to build more highways and housing projects.<br /><br />Was sprawl inevitable?  Given the wide range of factors cited by Rae, some sprawl was inevitable- but the disastrous decline of New Haven probably wasn't.ered in other cities and often moved around the country or around the globe. <br /> <br />In the second category, Rae criticizes highways that encouraged movement to suburbia, public housing projects that anchored low-skill people in urban cores that were losing low-skill manufacturing jobs, zoning that discouraged retail outside of a few commercial streets, New Deal housing agencies that discouraged investment in urban working-class neighborhoods, and urban renewal projects that bulldozed those neighborhoods in the 1950s and 1960s to build more highways and housing projects.   <br /> <br />Was sprawl inevitable?

Although once in a while Freundel mentions other Jewish movements, his tone towards non-Orthodox movements is reasonably respectful, and he writes much more about differences within Orthodoxy.<br /><br />A few points I thought were especially noteworthy or surprising:<br /><br />*The key difference between the Five Books of Moses and the rest of the Tanach: the first are sources of law, the second generally not.<br /><br />*Freundel admits the existence of possible corruptions in the biblical text, noting that 8th-century scholars sought to correct such corruptions and that even now, there is a one-letter deviation between Ashkenazic and Sephardic versions of the Torah. But Freundel argues that any small errors in the text are \\"not legally consequential\\" because Judaism rejects literal interpretation of the Bible, and Jewish law is based instead on centuries of rabbinic analysis.<br /><br />*Freundel asserts that Judaism is optimistic about man's capacities, and gives an interesting example of this: human cloning.  Catholics oppose cloning because cloning constitutes \\"playing God in the work of creation\\" while many Orthodox Jews support cloning in principle because \\"becoming a partner with God in the works of creation\\" is essentially noble.  A Protestant theologican argued against cloning in a Congression hearing because \\"people have a right not to be created in this way\\". By contrast, Freundel asserts that human existence is sufficiently noble that existence is better than nonexistence regardless of how it is created.<br /><br />*Freundel's detailed explanations of the relationship between God and Evil.  Unlike some fringe characters, Freundel rejects the notion that evil is always a punishment for sin (though of course it might be).  Orthodox Jews have also endorsed other explanations, since as human free will, Divine self-limitation, evil as a challenge that humans were created to remedy, and possible compensation (to good people who suffer and bad people who do not) in the next world.<br /><br />Freundel does occasionally lapse into overly technical language; he once asserts that Israel \\"is a cutting edge issue in the debate between more modern and yeshivish expressions of Orthodoxy.\\"  I suspect that many readers who are not Jewish or who grew up outside Orthodoxy won't understand what \\"yeshivish\\" means - but thankfully, such lapses are few and far between.ion that evil is always a punishment for sin (though of course it might be).

But I also think that some of Hayden's language was unclear, needlessly polemical, or both.  For example, she writes that ducks (buildings that serve as advertisements) \\"are always out of context and do little to unify neighborhoods.\\"  But what does it mean for a building to be \\"out of context\\"?  How does a cheese shop \\"unify a neighborhood\\", whether it is ugly or pretty?  Also, Hayden's points sometimes have little to do with sprawl- for example, she has an entry on \\"Export Garbage\\" but she does not explain why she thinks suburbs generate more garbage than cities.<br /><br />But on balance I liked this book, mainly because she spends only a paragraph or two on each concept, so even the text entries I would have written differently did not take up a lot of my time.	2005-08-01

What he does do is try to analyze where Roman Catholicism went right (and wrong) over the past couple of centuries.  A couple of questions he answers, or tries to answer, are:<br /><br />*Why did the Church become so dominant over the Dark Ages?  What did it do right?  Johnson points out that the Church was not only the only source of education, but also \\"a carrier of superior economic techniques\\" (p. 138).  Churchmen were the only farmers who knew how to plan ahead, keep accounts etc.  They taught Europe's tribes the idea of written freehold estates (i.e. estates with perpetual possession)- and because monastery land was owned by a collective, monks' cultivation of the land was not interrupted by deaths, overly young owners, etc., thus allowing more the monastery to invest for the future.  In other words, monasteries didn't just save European culture, they saved European agriculture.<br /><br />*What went wrong later in the middle ages?<br /><br />Economically, the Church didn't know how to accomodate trade, and thus stopped being a positive economic force.  And by the later Middle Ages, the church soaked up 25% of the GNP, arguably becoming a drag on the economy rather than an engine of growth.  One particularly onerous tax was the mortuary; the Church often ordered the families of the dead to hand over the garments of the deceased to the Church, a huge imposition upon the poor in those days.  And of course, the instability caused by the Church's murderous heretic-hunts could not possibly have been good for business.<br /><br />Culturally, the Church became obsessed with practices that later generations often viewed as supersitition (e.g. collection of relics of saints).  And the Church's desire for uniformity led to an obsession with heresy. (The latter factor, I think, might partially explains the vigor of medieval Judaism: why convert to Christianity where the Church/Inquisition heretic-burning machine was as eager to murder \\"heretic\\" Christians as to murder Jews?)<br /><br />Administratively, the Church developed a huge body of canon law which reduced its flexibility.<br /><br />And the very power of the Church corrupted it: because people entered monastic orders and the priesthood for nonspiritual reasons, the orders became extravagant.<br /><br />*What caused discontent with the Church's misconduct to boil over into the Reformation?  Johnson points out that the printing press and increased links to the Mediterranean gave European scholars the opportunity to study the Bible in its original languagues (Hebrew and Greek), as well as to encounter Greek philosophical works that had been lost during the Dark Ages.  In addition, murder in the guise of heretic-hunting may have discredited the Church.<br /><br />*Why is the Roman Catholic Church so centralized?  Why didn't it become decentralized like Judaism?  In the early days of Christianity, the bishop of Rome was apparently just another bishop.  The body of St. Peter was buried in Rome, so the relic cult enhanced the prestige of Rome.  And in the past few centuries, the growth of mass media and the decline of monarchy (and thus of state influence over Catholicism in France, Spain etc.) meant that popes could go over the heads of bishops and communicate with the masses.<br /><br />By contrast, in the late Middle Ages and the early Enlightenment period (15th-18th centuries) kings became powerful enough to create centralized nation-states, and in the process essentially took over churches.  For example, the papacy had little control over the Spanish Inquisition.<br /><br />*Why did Eastern Orthodoxy sweep the Slavic world?  Because western Christianity's insistence on uniformity (e.g. the Latin mass, even though Greek was more commonly used in slavic areas) alienated the East.<br /><br />*Why has Christianity flourished in some areas outside Europe but not others?  Johnson explains that Christianity consistently outcompetes paganism because paganism provides no explanation of the afterlife, while Christianity promises salvation. So in primitive areas where Christianity's only competitor is paganism, Christianity spreads.  But Islam (and to a lesser extent, other major religions) addresses these issues to the satisfaction of many- so in areas where most people are Muslim, Buddhist, etc. Christian claims tend to be unpersuasive.  In addition, Christian missionaries often made little effort to create a cadre of educated Third World priests.<br /><br />*Did Vatican II ruin the church?  Johnson asserts that Catholicism declined throughout the 20th century, because traditional Catholicism's failure to compromise with modernity made it look ridiculous.  For example, Pope Leo XIII, a relatively moderate Pope, rejected the idea that \\"it would be universally lawful or expedient for state and church to be, as in America, disserved and divorced\\" (p. 468).<br /><br />*What went wrong in the 20th century?  Johnson focuses not only on the Catholic Church's backwardness, but also on the failure of both Catholic and Protestant institutions to prevent Christians from slaughtering each other in the World Wars, and on German Christianity's failure to protest Hitler's atrocities.  Although Hitler repeatedly expressed hostility towards Christianity, he also tripled state subsidies for German churches between 1933 and 1938.  And both Catholic and Protestant churches generally allowed themselves to be bought off.  Johnson goes into great detail on the Christian pattern of truckling to Hitler.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like: Johnson often seems to assume lots of familiarity with concepts that most readers might not know much about: as another reviewer wrote, this book is sometimes hard to follow without a dictionary.rn Orthodoxy sweep the Slavic world?

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	3	9	15	N	N	sees weaknesses of social conservatism, but weaker on economic issues	Best point: that 21st-century social conservatism is essentially disconnected from reality.  Specifically- Frank argues that voting on \\"religious values\\"-type social issues (e.g. abortion, homosexuality) is foolish because even when conservatives win elections they don't do anything about these issues.  Frank's view that social conservatism is fraudulent is an exaggeration: its not that social conservatives don't WANT Roe v. Wade overruled, its that they just don't have the votes to get socially conservative judges confirmed as easily as they can get more moderate Republicans confirmed.  But having said that, Frank does have a point: a vote for a conservative has a lower payoff on social issues than on economic issues, because Republican judges are more likely to moderate their views on the former than on the latter (and also because legislation arguably has less influence on \\"values issues\\").<br /><br />Frank also sees that the Democrats may have lost working class voters by emphasizing social liberalism.  Today, a Democrat is more likely to be pro-abortion rights than pro-labor union- arguably a losing stance in the long run because pro-life voters are generally more intense than pro-choice voters.  If elitism means favoring pro-business economics, both parties are (as Frank asserts) elitist.<br /><br />But I don't think much of Frank's economic liberalism (or populism or whatever one calls it).  Frank seems to think that if only Democrats returned to old fashioned Hubert Humphrey style economic liberalism, they would win more elections.  But his type of candidate can't even get through Democratic primaries, let alone general elections - for example, the failures of Dick Gephardt and Dennis Kucinich in 2004, Tom Harkin in 1992, etc.  And in a country that gets more and more white collar every decade, its not clear to me that a political stance tailored to the industrial working class is going to lead to a Democratic majority.<br /><br />Frank also overlooks the perfectly rational reasons middle-income voters have to prefer economic conservatism to economic liberalism.  The last Democratic president to be supported by a Democratic Congress throughout his term was Jimmy Carter- and under Carter, the economy deteriorated.  By contrast, inflation nosedived under Reagan, and unemployment eventually went down as well.  My first vote was for Reagan, but less because of resentment of government or romantic ideas about Adam Smith than because of the cold hard reality that the American economy as a whole was, in many ways, better off in 1984 than in 1980.  And (as Frank himself points out) President Clinton governed as a moderate Republican - yet Clinton presided over the most successful economy in a generation.  And the economy under the Bush Administration, though sluggish, has not quite been bad enough to discredit economic conservatism the way the 1970s economy appeared (at least to Reagan voters) to discredit liberalism.<br /><br />And economic liberalism's cousin, European social democracy, is in bad shape.  Unemployment in some European countries is over 10%, and plunging birth rates mean that much of Europe may die out over the coming century.<br /><br />So if economic liberalism doesn't work and isn't popular, why shouldn't Democrats move to the center on economics?ons middle-income voters have to prefer economic conservatism to economic liberalism.

In fact, intra-Jewish dissension was sometimes far uglier than it is today.  This book discusses one such situation: the relationship between the founders of Hasidism and other Eastern European Jews.<br /><br />In the spring of 1772, a rabbinic court in Vilna, Lithuania (one of Eastern Europe's more influential Jewish communities) ordered that Hasidic books were to be burned near the entrance of the Great Synagogue of Vilna.  Later that year, the Gaon of Vilna (arguably the greatest Torah scholar of his time) and the rabbinical court of Vilna issued an edict ordering Lithuanian Jews \\"to extirpate, to destroy, to outlaw, and to excommunicate\\" the Hasidim (p. 11).<br /><br />In 1781, the Vilna elders issued a second ban, ordering that \\"one may not associate with them or speak with them\\" and that any Hasidim \\"must remove their residence from our community\\" (p. 13).  Numerous other communities excommunicated Hasidim, and banned numerous practices then common among Hasidim (such as wearing white). The Gaon suggested that these bans were inadequate, asserting: \\"If I were in my power I would have dealt with them as the prophet Elijah dealt with the prophets of Baal!\\" [i.e. kill them] (p. 10).  Another town's leadership ordered that \\"All possible measures are to be adopted to put an end to the prayer meetings\\" (p. 21) of Hasidim and that \\"Careful watch is to be maintained that no one should study their literature\\" (Id.)<br /><br />This book seeks to answer the question: why were the Gaon of Vilna and other rabbinic leaders so hostile to the early Hasidim?  To be sure, the rabbinic establishment may have been misinformed, or may have learned about isolated instances of aberrant behavior by Hasidim.  But there were real differences between the Hasidim and their opponents (commonly known as the Mitnagdim, or \\"opponents\\").  To name a few:<br /><br />*Some Hasids treated their rebbes as infallible, or as supernatural prophet-like figures; some Hasidic rebbes financially exploited their followers much as some religious leaders do today.  The Hasids' focus on charismatic leadership was especially upsetting to 18th century Jews, because in recent memory, false Messiahs such as Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank had captivated the imaginations of some Jews.  The Mitnagdim worried that the Hasids' obsesssion with charismatic leadership could lead to another false Messiah movement, if not to actual idolatry.<br /><br />*Some early Hasids deemphasized Torah and Talmudic scholarship in favor not only of deeds, but also in favor of prayer, devotional literature, and mystical literature.  Mitnagdim believed that most Jews should focus on \\"the fundamentals of the Talmud\\" (p. 54)- or to (over)simplify, that Hasids were dumbing down Judaism.<br /><br />*Hasidim emphasized inner states (joy as opposed to melancholy, for example) as opposed to external behavior.  Mitnagdim worried that this emphasis could lead to a lax attitude towards halakha (Jewish law).<br /><br />This book is sympathetic to the Mitnagdic point of view.  But the author points out that the Mitnagdim, despite their rationalism, were hardly modern liberals.  In 18th century Eastern Europe, Jewish communities were self-governing and highly coercive.<br /><br />For example, one visitor to the Vilna Gaon opined (in the author's words) \\"that Rashi [a medieval Torah commentator] did not always expound biblical texts according to their plain meaning, and that the midrashic expositors did not always follow grammatical rules in their Biblical exegesis\\" (p. 197) .  The visitor was not only berated by his host, but was shortly thereafter given the following treatment by the community (in his own words):<br /><br />\\"on account of defaming the sages of old I was condemned to forty strokes . . . I was then led to the threshold of the synagogueand my neck was enclosed within the iron rings attached to the wall, so as thus to expose me to the people, with a piece of paper on my head bearing the words: `This man has been punished for scoffing at the words of our holy teachers' . . . they spat nearly into my face, so that the spittle really flowed in streams.\\" (p. 197).<br /><br />To sum up: the Mitngadim believed that the Hasidic movement had cult-like tendencies; the Hasids believed that the Mitngadim were grim, joyless and oppressive.<br /><br />But there was a happy ending to this dispute: In the 19th century, the Hasids moved towards the Mitnagdic point of view in a variety of ways- most notably by endorsing higher levels of halakhic stringency and a renewed emphasis on Torah scholarship.  As a result, bitter Hasdiic/Mitngadic rivarly is a thing of the past.the threshold of the synagogue and my neck was enclosed within the iron rings attached to the wall, so as thus to expose me to the people, with a piece of paper on my head bearing the words: `This man has been punished for scoffing at the words of our holy teachers' . . . they spat nearly into my face, so that the spittle really flowed in streams.\\" (p. 197).  <br /> <br />To sum up: the Mitngadim believed that the Hasidic movement had cult-like tendencies; the Hasids believed that the Mitngadim were grim, joyless and oppressive. <br /> <br />But there was a happy ending to this dispute: In the 19th century, the Hasids moved towards the Mitnagdic point of view in a variety of ways- most notably by endorsing higher levels of halakhic stringency and a renewed emphasis on Torah scholarship.

The first essay (on sectarian differences during the First Temple era) and the last (on Orthodox/Conservative/Reform disputes) are useful for people with minimal Jewish literacy, less so for others- in part, I suspect, for reasons beyond the authors' control.  Many readers know so much about modern Jewish factions that it is difficult to say anything new, while so little is known about pre-Mishnaic Judaism that even the most knowledgeable scholars are on unsteady ground.<br /><br />I found the middle essays to be more informative- in particular the second essay, which discussed the Karaites, a medieval sect that is almost extinct today.  Before reading this, I knew that the Karaites rejected the Talmud and favored a literal interpretation of the Bible (including, for example, staying in the dark on Shabbat in order to avoid lighting fires).<br /><br />But I was unaware how far the schism between Karaites and mainstream Jews (then known as \\"Rabbanites\\") had gone; the two groups did not intermarry with each other, less because of abstract theological considerations than because of the groups' stark differences over practical law (e.g. different ritual calendars).<br /><br />I also learned that the Karaites evolved away from literalism: for example, although the Torah is vague about the afterlife, Karaite speculation about the afterlife was even more colorful than that of mainstream Judaism.  Karaites were more likely than Rabbanites to believe in eternal damnation for the wicked, and were also more likely to believe that the righteous actually enjoy seeing the wicked suffer.  On ritual matters, however, the Karaites sometimes moved away from literalism towards the rabbinic approach; by the 15th century, Shabbat candle-lighting, once forbidden for Karaites, had become mandatory.  The essay also explains the failure of Karaism, arguing that the Karaites left too little room for non-rational views, and that talmudic Judaism was simply too flexible and too well-entrenched to be easily defeated.<br /><br />The third essay discusses the controversy over Maimonides' works.  Although Maimonides is (as far as I know) almost universally revered today, this was not always the case; in 1232, some French rabbis threatened to excommunicate anyone who studied Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed. Why the controversy?  The author suggests that anti-philosophical agitation in French Jewry mirrored similar disputes within Christianity.  In the 1200s, Christian rationalists began to interpret Scripture allegorically (thus denying some of the miracles at the root of Christianity) and were attacked by the Church.  For example, in 1231, the Pope went so far as to ban the study of some of Aristotle's books. Some Jews similarly worried that rationalism might lead to allegorizing Scripture, which in turn might lead to ritual laxity.<br /><br />The next essay takes us to the 18th century, when the Vilna Gaon declared Hasidism to be a heretical sect, and excommunicated its followers.  The essay notes that by the 1700s, Jews in East Europe were reeling from massacres and false Messiahs. According to Hasidim, rabbinic leadership responded with the \\"bitter medicine\\" of ascetism, sullen solemenity, and superstition.  (I wish the essay had expressed some opinion as to whether this description of East European Judaism was accurate). The early Hasids responded by emphasizing service of the Divine with joy: according to one Hasidic work, \\"God will prefer that I ignore the [strict interpretation of the law] rather than allow my service to him be tainted with melancholy.\\" (p. 131).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the essay on Hasidim, though very informative about the Hasidic point of view, makes little attempt to describe the views of Hasidim's Jewish critics (other than to note that the Hasidic view that the Divine \\"is literally in all things\\" was highly controversial).<br /><br />Another essay focuses onthe Haskalah, an 18th and 19th century movement seeking to alter Jewish education so that Jews could function in secular culture.  The essay notes that the Haskalah took a variety of forms: in Eastern Europe, Haskalah was generally anti-Orthodox, but in Western Europe, the Haskalah was more similar to today's modern Orthodoxy, in the sense of favoring both secular knowledge and observance of Jewish law.ay focuses on the Haskalah, an 18th and 19th century movement seeking to alter Jewish education so that Jews could function in secular culture.

(PS The book primarily is about Afghanistan, NOT about Iraq).<br /><br />But at least it is a description of how the Administration insiders want us to perceive the Afghanistan war, and is slightly more candid than the information fed to the media in 2001.  Because these insiders all worked for President Bush at the time the book was written (and thus had a strong incentive to praise Bush) Bush of course comes across very well.<br /><br />But even so, a few unpleasant truths come out: that before 9/11, terrorism was a low priority of both the Bush and Clinton Administrations, Paul Wolfowitz's obsession with making war in Iraq (which he proposed right after 9/11), Colin Powell's focus on gaining the support of allies rather than on the pros and cons of war itself.<br /><br />And this book reveals one other problem that is perhaps related to America's inability to capture or kill bin Laden: some parts of this book (though not others) suggest that the Administration may have been a bit wishy-washy about whether to mount a general attack on \\"terrorism\\" or to focus on the people who actually attacked the United States.  For example, Rumsfeld is quoted as asserting: \\"We can't let Syria help us with al Qaida and then us feel constrained about pursuing them with respect to their support for other terrorists.\\" (p. 221).  A more analytical book would have asked: what \\"other terrorists\\" was Rumsfeld referring to?  Did the Administration's interest in \\"other terrorists\\" divert resources from bin Laden, or did the Administration quickly become more focused?  Perhaps later books will answer these questions.	2005-06-21

A secular feminist spends time with the women of a small Hasidic sect in Israel, and proclaims that the women are undereducated and subordinated; although the sect does make some effort to educate its likable-but-ignorant housewives about Judaism, their Torah education is far shallower and less theoretical than that of their husbands.<br /><br />But I gave this book 4 stars instead of 2 or 3 because it is surprisingly readable and because a few small surprises lurk here and there:<br /><br />*The shallowness of the sect's adult education seems to be at least partially a response to consumer demand; the women are bored by more theoretical teachers, and prefer instruction in \\"nuts and bolts\\" halacha.  Perhaps the sect's dual standard is a pragmatic necessity: because the women are busier than the men (many of whom are full-time scholars subsidized by the sect or by the Israeli government), they simply do not have time or inclination for as much in-depth learning.<br /><br />*The book discusses the far less studied issue of the relations between the sect and other ultra-Orthodox groups: generally, the boundaries between groups are fairly fuzzy, but a few of the more extreme sects are exceptions to this rule.<br /><br />*There doesn't seem to be a particularly strong correlation between ritual rigidity and tolerance of deviation.  Some of the less rigid sect members are quickest to condemn deviations from their standard of observance, while some of the strictest are less judgmental and more tolerant.	2005-06-21
US	52908596	R1AJ0BYI8R36KV	1564144739	982638569	Two Jews Can Still Be a Mixed Marriage	Books	4	4	5	N	N	mostly common sense, but botches a detail here and there	As other reviews pointed out, most of the advice in this book was common sense- couples should try to accommodate each other's levels of observance where possible, figure out what's most important to them, not argue over basic issues of theological principle, etc.  And I think the basic message of tolerance is a good one.<br /><br />A few bits of the book might be grating to people who are a little more observant (or even a little more knowledgeable).  For example, her chapter on synagogue attendance implies that couples will normally wish to pray together (and perhaps even that they should do so in order to avoid being social lepers).  But this view completely overlooks one major purpose of prayer- not to connect to your spouse, but to connect to God.  It logically follows that there is no reason to be with your spouse in synagogue - and in fact that doing so might be a huge distraction that makes your prayer less fulfilling.  (Orthodox congregations limit this \\"distraction factor\\" by having men and women sit in separate sections of the synagogue- but non-Orthodox or \\"mixed\\" couples can achieve equally wholesome results by going to separate synagogues, or perhaps by sitting in separate parts of the same synagogue).<br /><br />Also, a little historical perspective might have been nice.  The author seemed to think that Jewish \\"mixed marrriages\\" are common only in this generation.  But I recently read an article in Midstream (a Jewish magazine) asserting the opposite (that is, claiming that observant Jews are so walled off from non-observant Jews that such marriages are LESS common than 50 years ago).  I have no idea who is right- but a better book might have utilized not just the experience of the current generation of adults, but of older couples who have lived through decades of theological incompatibility or of their children.	2005-06-19

This book is a very easy read, and thus is not just for scholars.<br /><br />Some of the books quoted by de Lange could have been in the Bible- but by and large, much of the quoted work is not that enthralling, and after reading this book I understand why the Hebrew Sages excluded most of these books.  For example, the book of Judith is about a heroine who stops the army of Nebuchadnezzar and thus saves Israel from the Assyrians- but as anyone familiar with the Book of Kings knows, Nebuchadnezzar (a) was Babylonian and (b) won his war against the Jews.  (Though I do wonder why the Sages excluded the Book of Maccabees, which seems to have been pretty well written, explains the genesis of a Jewish holiday, and shows no obvious signs of falsity).	2005-06-15

But the scarcity of such areas means that whites must pay heavy costs to obtain them- either in money (for close-in and thus desirable upscale areas) or in time (for outer suburbs that require hefty commutes).<br /><br />c) the isolation of the minority poor victimizes the middle class of all races.  Cashin suggests that if the poor were more likely to live near and go to school with the middle class, they might commit fewer crimes and be more easily educable.  (This assertion is, I think, the weakest link in her argument; perhaps it is simply unprovable given the difficulty of separating geographic isolation from a variety of other factors that might cause crime and underachievement).<br /><br />d) the status quo is not the result of market forces, but of government policy: zoning laws that artificially separate economic classes by keeping cheap housing out of wealthy areas, highways that facilitate white flight from cities, and federal housing policy that created public housing ghettoes.<br /><br />Cashin's solution is to spread the poor more evenly throughout American suburbs.  How can this goal be achieved?  Cashin asserts that if the poor lived in more diverse areas and attended schools dominated by the middle class, they would be more educable and act more civilly.  Such class integration can be achieved by substituting inclusionary zoning for exclusionary zoning (that is, mandating that new housing include, rather than excluding, the poor), using housing and school vouchers to enable people to live in middle-class neighborhoods and to attend any public school regardless of residence.<br /><br />One danger of integrationist remedies: they only work if applied throughout a region.  If suburb X integrates and suburb Y refuses to do so, suburb X, like the black middle-class suburbs Cashin discusses, gets a disproportionate share of the region's poor- which means it becomes undesirable to upscale families, which means it goes downhill.  So if only diversity-minded cities or inner-ring suburbs adopt Cashin's remedies, the ultimate result might be just to spread poverty further into the suburbs and thus to create a new round of middle-class flight from integrationist suburbs.reas and attended schools dominated by the middle class, they would be more educable and act more civilly.

Johnson Metro Series)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	interesting data, uneven interpretation	This book (or more accurately, set of books) is a list of essays on what 2000 census data tells us about American cities and suburbs.  The first (and most interesting) volume focuses not just the fate of cities as a whole, but the growth of individual neighborhoods within cities and changes in the ethnic and social composition of various cities and suburbs.  The second is more focused on immigration and housing (telling us, not suprirsingly, that the former was more numerous than before during the 1990s, and the latter became more expensive), but does have some interesting essays on poverty and overcrowding.  A few of the more interesting facts:<br /><br />*80 of America's 100 largest cities actually gained population in the 1990s.  Many of them gained not only singles, but married-couple families: not just sprawling Sun Belt cities that grew through annexation, but even denser, more singles-oriented cities like New York City (11% growth) and Portland (17% growth).<br /><br />*But despite constant media caterwauling about gentrification, most of this growth was due to working-class, usually Latino, immigration rather than to an invasion of upscale whites.  Many allegedly gentrifying cities (e.g. NYC, Chicago) gained population, but lost non-Hispanic whites.  And though poverty rates declined slightly in many cities, most cities still had poverty rates far higher than their suburbs.  For example, Chicago had a 19.6% poverty rate, as opposed to its suburbs' 5.6%.  Even the residents of more prosperous cities like San Francisco and Portland were more likely to be poor than suburbanites; in both places, city poverty was 11-13% and suburban poverty 6-8% (Portland having slightly higher numbers in both categories).<br /><br />*Similarly, cities had fewer higher-income households than their suburbs.  In the 100 largest American cities, only 16.6 percent of households had incomes in the top quintile nationally (that is, top 20 percent)- and that number includes some \\"cities\\" that are really suburbs, such as Plano, Texas, a suburb of Dallas.  Again, even some fairly prosperous cities did not reach the 20 percent mark, such as Portland (16.4%) and Boston (15.0%).  By contrast, suburbs consistently contained a disproportionate share of high income households- in the average metro area, 25.5% of suburban households were in the top 20% of earners nationally.<br /><br />*Poverty was less concentrated than in the 1980s; the number of very poor city census tracts (i.e. 40% poverty rate or below) declined by 21% in the 1990s.<br /><br />*Within cities, varying patterns emerged.  Downtowns gained population in most cities, even some declining ones.  But in many cities, inner-city neighborhoods near downtown lost population while outer-ring neighborhoods near suburbia were more successful (especially in cities with undeveloped land at the fringes, the latter in built-out cities).<br /><br />*In all but the most fast-growing areas, suburban decline is common.  Nationally, about a quarter of suburbs lost population in the 1990s.<br /><br />*As Jane Jacobs pointed out decades ago, density (i.e. lots of residences per acre) and overcrowding (i.e. multiple occupants per room) do not go together.  The fifteen most overcrowded counties in America are low density rural places in heavily Native American and Hispanic areas.  Similarly, Atanta's most immigrant oriented suburb, Chamblee, has an overcrowding rate five times that of Atlanta- that is, five times as many Chamblee residents live more than one to a room, despite the higher levels of social misery in inner-city Atlanta.<br /><br />However, this book could have been more carefully written and/or edited in spots.  For example, one essay claimed that car-dependent cities grew and transit-oriented cities shrunk, asserting that this generalization \\"survives controlling for regions, as emphasized by a growth comparison between nondriving cities (such as San Francisco) and driving cities (such as Los Angeles) within the same region.\\" (Vol. 1 p. 28).  But a table in the very same essay shows that San Francisco grew FASTER than Los Angeles in the 1990s (albeit by the not-very-significant margin of 7.3% to Los Angeles' 6.0%) (Id. at 16).<br /><br />The same essay lists a variety of other factors correlating with growth (e.g. warm weather, high levels of education) but fails to distinguish correlation and causation: that is, it may be that unrelated factors such as municipal annexation of suburban territory (more common in warm-weather, auto-oriented Sun Belt cities) cause such cities to gain population.<br /><br />*Sometimes authors' differing interpretations of Census data are flat-out inexplicable.  One essay asserts that downtown Houston's population grew by 69% (Vol. 1, p. 68) while another asserts that Houston's central business district lost people (Id. at 97).  Some explanation of this type of difference might have been interesting - I assume that one author defined \\"downtown\\" more broadly than another, but I couldn't guess which one.in the very same essay shows that San Francisco grew FASTER than Los Angeles in the 1990s (albeit by the not-very-significant margin of 7.3% to Los Angeles' 6.0%) (Id. at 16).

The book is an anthology of essays, mostly case studies from various cities (including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, San Francisco and New York City).<br /><br />A few of the more interesting assertions:<br /><br />*Martin Luther King was writing about transportation issues before his death; in a posthumously published essay, he wrote that public transit is \\"a valid civil rights issue\\" because the availability of transit \\"determines the accessibility of jobs to the black community\\" (p. 17).<br /><br />*Discriminatory policies not only affect the balance of spending between highways and transit, but also affect public transit policy.  For example, Pittsburgh's planners have given Pittsburgh's white southern suburbs a clean, quiet light rail system, but have given its poorer, blacker East End a louder, more polluting busway system- even though East Enders are more likely to use public transit.<br /><br />*Even poor drivers lose from our auto-oriented status quo.  Families earning less than $14,000 per year after taxes spend 40% of their take home pay on transportation, as opposed to 13% for families earning over $72,000.<br /><br />*In 1935, families spent 10% of their budgets on transportation.  Today, they spend 20% - perhaps explaining why so many people feel financially stressed.<br /><br />*The claim that highways \\"pay for themselves\\" overlooks negative externalities such as the effects of highways on city neighborhoods: poor, carless people get all the air pollution from nearby highways without any of the benefits.<br /><br />However, some essays in the book are not as well done as others.  Some essays contain the sort of left-wing rhetoric that is likely to alienate anyone to the left of Dennis Kucinich, and/or are indifferent to complex trade-offs.  For example, the New York City essay discusses a community's desire to keep traffic off its surface streets (p. 81).  But where traffic is encouraged to move to expressways (even tunneled expressways, the community's preferred remedy) suburban migration, and thus disinvestment from the city, is more convenient and neighborhood merchants might lose business.  By contrast, the San Francisco essay (one of the better essays in the collection) discusses numerous issues that the authors acknowledged to be close calls.y discusses a community's desire to keep traffic off its surface streets (p. 81).

In addition to endorsing traditional Jewish views, Saadia sought to address topics seemingly left up for grabs by the Torah.  Tbe book begins with the most abstract material, and then gets more specific (and perhaps a bit less deep) towards the end.<br /><br />The first two chapters (or \\"treatises\\") address tbe nature of creation.  In the first (and deepest) chapter, Saadia seeks to prove that God created the universe out of nothing.  This chapter was a bit over my head in spots.  One interesting sidelight: Saadia addresses a dozen alternative theories, and implies that the first alternative is the most credible, the second is the second most credible, and that the last is the weakest.  But in my untutored opinion Saadia's order of proceeding is not obviously logical: his top alternative is that God created the universe out of \\"eternal spiritual beings\\" (p. 50) and the allegedly weakest alternatives are \\"skepticism\\" (i.e. that \\"it is proper for man to refraining from believing anything becuase they calim that human reasoning is full of uncertainties\\" (p. 80) and the views \\"of those who feign complete ignorance\\" (p. 82).  But the latter alternative seems to me stronger than the former.  Either 9th-century people viewed the world very differently than I, or Saadia was putting the weaker alternative first in order to strengthen his argument.<br /><br />The second chapter discusses the nature of God- asserting that God is One and has no body.  Interestingly, Saadia rejects the common midrashic view that the various names of God in the Torah refer to different Divine attributes.  Instead, Saadia points out that Scriptures often uses names interchangeably (p. 99). He criticizes Trinitarian Christianity on the ground that if God is not a physical being, he cannot possibly have multiple attributes which differ from each other because \\"anything that harbors distinction within itself is unquestionably a physical being\\" (p. 103).  According to Saadia, God is like truth- something that cannot be perceived by the senses yet nevertheless exists (p. 131).<br /><br />In the third chapter, Saadia discusses the Torah's laws and the reason therefor.  He asserts that some commandments are obviously supported by reason, and the rest exist either because God has \\"imposed upon us a profusion of commandments and prohibitions in order thereby to increase our reward\\" (p. 140) or to teach submissiveness to God (p. 141).  In addition, some of the latter group may have minor rational purposes: for example, the dietary laws discourage idolatry because man is unlikely to \\"worship what has been given to him for food, nor what has been declared unclean for him.\\" (p. 144)  Interestingly, Saadia does not explain why non-Jews were not given such revelations.<br /><br />In this chapter, Saadia also defends the validity of Scripture and related traditions, on the ground that if people did not accept authentic tradition, they could not believe anything beyond what their senses perceived - for example, they could not be certain that a law was in fact issued by the government (p. 156).  Moreover, it is unlikely that a large number of people would be fooled by a false impression (p. 157).  Of course, religious traditions differ from others in a variety of ways: their advanced age, and the existence of conflicting traditions.<br /><br />Most of the last half of the book relates to the afterlife.  Saadia endorses the traditional Jewish view that a messiah will deliver Israel (and will rule over the resurrected Jewish dead).  He also asserts that eventually, all people who have ever lived (including non-Jews) will be judged and sent to paradise or eternal damnation, both of which involve variations of light and fire (pp. 348-50)  This view is based partially on citations to Scripture (many of which seem to be to be out of context- but then again, maybe I am not reading the same translation as Saadia did, and perhaps my translation is not as good) and partially on reason.  Specifically, Saadia reasons that the injustice prevalent in the world can be remedied only by rewards and punishments in the afterlife (pp. 325-26).  Less persuasively, he asserts that punishment should be eternal as a deterrent to evil (p. 344)- an argument that is not particularly persuasive because would-be evildoers (a) have no way of knowing what God's punishments are (especially if they have not read Saadia's book) and (b) may not think they are doing anything punishable.  Moreover, the idea of eternal punishment seems inconsistent with Saadia's view that God disapproves of misconduct \\"only on our account, because of te harm they might inflict upon us.\\" (p. 190)<br /><br />The last chapter is the most practical.  Saadia lists a variety of good things (e.g. prayer, food, sex) and says that the ideal person should balance these needs rather than pursuing one to the exclusion of others.to be out of context- but then again, maybe I am not reading the same translation as Saadia did, and perhaps my translation is not as good) and partially on reason.

Maimonides asserts that each principle is supported by various Torah verses, and asserts that one who rejects these principles \\"leaves the community [of Israel] . . . One is required to hate him and it is proper to despise and destroy him.\\"<br /><br />Other medieval Jewish scholars (most notably, at least for the purposes of this book, Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo) criticized this view, asserted that Judaism rests on a much smaller number of beliefs.<br /><br />Abravenel lists a variety of objections to Maimonides' principles, and responds to those objections.  The first 21 chapters of the book appear to be a defense of Maimonides.<br /><br />But at the end, Abravenel turns around and criticizes Maimonides.  Abravenel agrees that Maimonides' principles are praiseworthy beliefs, but rejects the notion that one Judaism can be limited to thirteen (or three, or six, or twenty) principles.  After all, Abravenel reasons, if the Torah comes from God, why is any one principle more obviously right or necessary than any other?<br /><br />But in his last chapter, Abravenel meets Maimonides halfway.  He agrees that one who rejects resurrection and Divine revelation \\"has no portion in the world to come\\" - but less on logical grounds than because the Mishnah says so.	2005-04-10

But after reading it, I certainly see where some past relationships have gone wrong.<br /><br />And the basic theory does make intuitive sense: Hamburg focuses on physical issues, practical compatibility (day-to-day teamwork) and what he calls \\"wavelength compatibility\\" (that is, broader ways of looking at the world, and similarity of opinions on big issues such as religion).  As he points out, if your prospective mate flunks on all three criteria, further communication and hard work will only make it clearer that he or she is not a good match.<br /><br />My only real quarrel with Hamburg so far is his suggestions about which issues couples must resolve before being married.  For example, he thinks that a couple should decide before marriage whether to have a \\"traditional marriage\\" (i.e. one where the male earns most of the money) or a more egalitarian mrriage. I am not sure that one can know in advance how \\"traditional\\" one's marriage can be; presumably most reasonable couples would move towards a less traditional marriage if the spouses' earning power is roughly equal, but towards a more traditional marriage if one spouse's economic contribution turns out to be minimal.	2005-04-04

For example, in Eastern European the Bar Mitzvah was, according to one immigrant, \\"no ceremony at all\\" - but in America it became a major life-cycle event as early as the 1880s.  And the common custom of listing the names of deceased loved ones on a bronze tablet is almost entirely new, dating from the 1920s.<br /><br />Other rituals declined and then rose from the dead again: Chanukah was neglected in the 19th century; as early as 1884, one rabbi wrote: \\"The customary candles disappear more and more from Jewish homes.\\"  Christmas trees became more common until in the 1920s, savvy Jewish marketers reinvented Chanukah as a large-scale gift-giving holiday.  And as a result, by the late 20th century even some relatively secular households (like mine) ignored Christmas and made a production out of Chanukah.<br /><br />Shabbat observance, though still not as widespread as one might hope, appears to have rebounded slightly from the alleged \\"good old days\\"- in 1950, only 2 percent of American Jews attended a Shabbat service of any kind, a figure that I suspect is even lower than today's status quo.<br /><br />And innovation sometimes came from unlikely quarters: bat mitzvahs began in Conservative, and even Orthodox, synagogues rather than in Reform Judaism (which preferred confirmation).<br /><br />Other attempts at innovation thankfully failed- for example, some synagogues' attempts to water down Shavuot by turning it into a Jewish Mothers' Day.<br /><br />Another interesting feature of this book is that it shows how early American Jews came to differ from other groups.  As early as the 1890s, for example, American Jews had half the infant mortality rate of Italians or Czechs.  Jews were also fussier eaters- a 1930s survey showed that 42% of Jewish 2-5 years olds refused two or more of a group of foods offered, as opposed to 18% of Polish-American children. (Make of that what you will).<br /><br />One moral of the book: the more things change the more they remain the same.  In 1893, Rabbi Maurice Harris of Chicago asked, \\"Can a minority move among a majority without being absorbed by it? . . . our distinctive characteristics are going, one by one; we are becoming more and more like our neighbors.\\"  Words that could be said just as easily in 2004.two or more of a group of foods offered, as opposed to 18% of Polish-American children.

I found a few insights that surprised me:<br /><br />1. Maimonides' attempts to narrow certain passages he must have found uncomfortable, e.g. \\"Be cautious with the government for they do not draw a man near except for their own needs\\" (2:3). He explains that this passage refers only to \\"the ruling authority in former times\\" (i.e. the Roman Empire).<br /><br />2. Which areas he prefers to discuss at length and which he deemphasizes. For example, Maimonides spends pages on the importance of study, citing passages from the Torah to support his view that the Divine Presence is not just with groups of scholars but even with \\"one who sits and engages in the Torah\\", as well as with groups of two, three or more. He also goes out of his way to explain why Torah scholars should work at other occupations rather than being compensated for their services- a view, given the size of a modern synagogue, may seem a bit impractical today. (Maimonides argues that such behavior might lead people to \\"think that the Torah is merely another trade through which a man may earn a livelihood...\\")<br /><br />3. He points out that the \\"multitude\\" of good deeds are more important than their magnitude, because \\"virtues will indeed be attained by repeating the good deeds many times\\". Thus, \\"the recompense for one who redeemed a captive for one hundred dinars, or dealt charitably toward a poor man to the extent of one hundred dinars which was sufficient for his need, is not on a par with the recompense for one who redeemed ten captives, or fulfilled the need of ten poor men, each to the extent of ten dinars.\\"<br /><br />4. His understanding of human imperfection; he discussed not only wise people, but also \\"the unfinished man\\", one \\"who has intellectual virtues and moral virtues\\" which \\"contain disarray and confusion, and are intermingled with deficiency\\" - a description that I think would encompass most human beings.<br /><br />5.

US	52908596	R1PMWKWZTX6S7C	088328023X	280379812	Ramban: The Law of the Eternal Is Perfect (English and Hebrew Edition)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	a look inside the 13th century	On August 4, 1263, a Christian king decided to visit a synagogue in Spain to persuade its membership to convert to Christianity.  After the king left, Moshe ben Nachman (Nachmanides), one of Spain's leading Torah commentators, delived a long talk in response.  This book is as close as we will come to a transcript of that talk.<br /><br />Nachmanides did not organize this talk in any systematic way as far as I could tell.  Instead, he discussed a wide variety of Torah topics, creating a kind of Nachmanides anthology.<br /><br />A few points that grabbed me:<br /><br />1. When discussing the response of Egyptian magicians to the Ten Plagues, Nachmanides writes that Egyptian magicians' inability to duplicate the plague of gnats \\"seemed to be difficult to comprehend until I spoke with craftsmen of demonology\\" (p. 18) and that he learned that \\"masters of the incanations\\" can create small creatures \\"with numerous magic formulas by command of the king of the demons.\\" (Id.)  In attacking Greek philosophical wisdom, he states that Aristotle declared \\"that there are no such things as demons and deeds of sorcery, for the world is subject only to natural law.  But it is universally well known that this is not so.\\" (Id.)  I was surprised to learn that as late as the 13th century, people as sophisticated as Nachmanides still believed in demons!<br /><br />2. Similarly, Nachmanides justified the Jewish prohibition on sex with menstruating women on the ground that according to the Midrash, \\"a child born from a menstruant will be a leper\\" (p. 81)- obviously not a theory supported by modern science.<br /><br />3. Nachmanides frequently discussed (sometimes agreeing with, sometimes disagreeing with) great scholars of recent prior generations, such as Maimonides and Ibn Ezra.  I didn't realize that these commentators were so widely known shortly after their lifetimes.<br /><br />4. Of course, Nachmanides' discourse is full of substantive Torah knowledge as well.  He discusses the differences not just between Jewish and Christian concepts of the Ten Commandments, but also that even gentile scholars are divided as to their meaning, pointing out that \\"Some divide the verse, Thou shalt have no other gods, into two commandments, while the consensus of their paltry scholars is to divide Thou shalt not covet into two.\\"  (p. 36).  Nachmanides (writing 700-odd years before Judge Roy Moore) illustrates the problem with posting the 10 Commandments everywhere: who decides which version to pick?<br /><br />5.  In some ways, Nachmanides is actually more modern than other commentators who are sometimes described as more rationalist and less mystical in orientation. While Maimonides believed that the Earth (being part of Divine creation and thus perfect) would last forever, Nachmanides narrowly interprets scriptural passages supporting that view, and suggests that the Earth can be destroyed like any other Divine creation (p. 60)- a view in keeping with modern science.<br /><br />6. One very interesting part of Nachmanides' talk is his attempt to explain the Golden Calf story in the Torah.  How could people be dumb enough to think of a metal object as a deity?  Nachmanides suggests the following scenario: the Hebrews thought Moses was lost in the mountains, so they created an image that, like Moses, would be a kind of intermediary between them and God. Aaron goes along, and declares \\"a feast to the Eternal\\" to ensure that the Hebrews know they are not actually worshipping the Calf. Most Hebrews continue to think this way even after the calf is built and sacrificed to- but as the situation gets out of hand, a few idiots confuse the calf with the Deity.  This interpretation explains why a few thousand Hebrews are slaughtered in the ensuing chaos, while the rest are punished more subtly- the people who actually worshipped the calf get the most serious punishment, while the people who merely embarrassed themselves by treating the calf as a \\"Moses substitute\\" just geta tongue-lashing.a tongue-lashing.	2005-02-06

At first, Rabbi Shapira thought the Nazi invasion was no different from other persecutions, and suggested that perhaps Jews were being punished for something.  But by 1942, he realized that \\"there has never been anything like [Nazism]\\" (p. 133) and abandoned the \\"punishment for sin\\" view of anti-Semitism.  Instead, he admitted that the Holocaust was essentially incomprehensible.<br /><br />And at the start of the Nazi occupation, Rabbi Shapira urged his followers to trust in Divine intervention and in possible Messianic deliverance - but later on, he dropped this idea as well.<br /><br />This book was interesting not just because of it describes the evolution of Shapira's theology, but also as a description of the Nazi persecution.  It is easy to forget that the Nazis sought not just to destroy our bodies but our souls as well, by doing their best to prevent the free exercise of Judaism.	2005-02-01

But this book explains the roots in Muslim theology of Muslim/Jewish relations (under which non-Muslim monotheists were tolerated as second-class citizens), and shows how large some Jewish communities were.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that in the 15th century, Turkey was so attractive for Jews that Jewish writers wrote about Turkey as glowingly as later writers wrote about America.  For example, Isaac Zarfati, a refugee from Germany, wrote: \\"I proclaim to you that Turkey is a land wherein nothing is lacking, and where, if you will, all shall yet be well with you . . . Here every man may dwell at peace under his own vine and fig tree.  Here you are allowed to wear the most precious garments.  In Christendom, on the contrary, you dare not even venture to clothe your children in red or in blue, according to our taste, without exposing them to the insult of beaten black and blue, or kicked green and red . . . O Israel, wherefore sleepest though? Arise!  And leave this accursed land forever!\\" (p. 136)<br /><br />Similarly, in the 16th century Portuguese refugee Samuel Usque described Turkey as \\"a broad and spacious sea which God opened with the rod of His mercy as He opened the Red Sea at the time of the exodus . .. here the gates of liberty are always open for the observance of Judaism\\" (Id.)<br /><br />But the situation deteriorated in the last several centuries: it is not altogether clear why, and maybe Lewis isn't completely sure himself.  Lewis speculates that Jews lost contact with Europe, and thus (unlike Christians in Islamic lands) no longer had trade connections or language skills to offer to the national economy, and were thus more easily persecuted because of their poverty and uselessness.  But why did the Jews lose touch with the rest of the world? What went wrong? It is not quite clear.<br /><br />A side note: the unfavorable reviews of this book attack Lewis for being too pro-Muslim, while the unfavorable reviews of \\"Semites and Anti-Semites\\" attack him for being insufficiently pro-Muslim and anti-Israel.  If Lewis is getting shot at from both sides, he must be doing something right.of this book attack Lewis for being too pro-Muslim, while the unfavorable reviews of \\"Semites and Anti-Semites\\" attack him for being insufficiently pro-Muslim and anti-Israel.

But if I hadn't read numerous similar books (most notably Joseph Telushkin's book on Jewish values) I would have gotten more out of it, so I would definitely recommend it for people who have not read those books.<br /><br />Basic points were as follows:<br /><br />1.  Classical Judaism generally favored work as opposed to monasticism.<br /><br />2.  Some jobs are socially constructive and thus spiritual in their own right.

How aggressive mass movements such as Communism and Islamic radicalism differ from the would-be lunatic movements in American politics today.  Hoffer points out that a truly vigorous mass movement requires self-sacrifice - but even the most devoted tree-hugger, Bush-worshipper or anti-abortionist is unlikely to want to be blown up for their cause of choice.<br /><br />2. Hoffer foreshadows the collapse of Communism, by suggesting that a dictatorship's most dangerous moment is when it relaxes its restraints.  Communism survived Stalin, but not Gorbachev.  A logical inference: North Korea is probably more stable than China.<br /><br />3. Hoffer's analysis of the difference between conservatives/liberals and radicals/reactionaries.  The conservative and the liberal both revere the present.  The conservative \\"doubts that the present can be bettered\\" while the liberal \\"sees the present as the legitimate offspring of the past and as constantly growing and changing toward an improved future.\\"  By contrast, the \\"radical and the reactionary loathe the present [and] see it as an aberration and the deformity.\\"  The reactionary differs from the radical by seeking to recreate the past, but even this difference may be illusory because the reactionary's \\"image of the past is based less on what it actually was than on what he wants the future to be.\\" Today, the American Right seems dominated by the latter rather than the former, seeking to remake government (if not society) by crushing it with debt.<br /><br />I agree with most of the positive comments.  Certainly, Hoffer's generalities are not universally applicable: but Hoffer himself anticipates these problems, stating that the typical 2-star reviewer \\"is likely to feel that much has been exaggerated and much ignored.  But this is not an authoritative textbook.  It is a book of thoughts, and it does not shy away from half-truths so long as they seem to hint at a new approach and to formulate new questions.\\"<br /><br />The 2-star reviewer wrote that totalitarians \\"subdue and rule through force\\" rather than through belief.  But this analysis begs the question: how do these totalitarians take over in the first place?  Usually on the backs of an army of true believers, who then oppress the apolitical masses.<br /><br />But Hoffer does fail to address the death of mass movements: how did fanatics stop becoming fanatics after (for example) the defeat of Nazis and Japanese ultranationalists in WW 2?int at a new approach and to formulate new questions.\\" <br /> <br />The 2-star reviewer wrote that totalitarians \\"subdue and rule through force\\" rather than through belief.

The hardship that the Great Depression caused for synagogues and other Jewish institutions; I have always taken the financial stability of Jewish institutions for granted, but evidently Jews in the 1930s did not have this luxury.<br /><br />2. That concerns over assimilation are nothing new.  In 1929, almost 80% of NYC Jewish children received no religious training or Hebrew instruction (p. 184).<br /><br />3. Where Jews lived (see p. 82 for table).  I had always known that some once-Jewish neighborhoods have lost most of their Jewish population (mostly notably in the Bronx). But I did not know about similarities between then and now: for example, the Upper West Side, then as now, was heavily Jewish- and ditto for Borough Park (though the latter area was less homogenously Orthodox in the 30s than today).  Other areas were virtually Jew-free in the 30s (Greenwich Village, Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights) and may actually be more Jewish today, as gentrification has brought in Jewish professionals.  Similarly, the Jewish presence in Queens was minimal in the 30s, but is far larger today- I was astonished to learn, for instance, that Forest Hills was less than 10% Jewish in 1932.	2004-12-31

Mystical commentators tend to treat these stories as historical truth even if they seem absurd, while rationalist commentators tend to treat them as fables designed to make a point, and still others seek to split the difference in various ways. 16th-century scholar Azariah de Rossi subjected aggadic stories to historical criticism, and was criticized by mystics and pietists as a result.<br /><br />Segal makes some effort to describe de Rossi's methods and his critics.  However, he does not fully describe the substance of de Rossi's work.  As a result, I found it difficult to understand some of Segal's discussion.  (If Segal presupposes that readers have read de Rossi's work, his technique would be easy to understand.  However, his first chapter is a mini-biography of de Rossi- a fact indicating that Segal assumes otherwise.)<br /><br />But I still learned something from Segal's book- specifically, how far European Judaism had swung towards the anti-rationalist side of the debate, thus making Jews easy prey for delusions such as the Sabbatai Sevi movement of the 17th century.  (Sevi was a false messiah who attracted considerable support).	2004-12-12

Some essays are preaching to the converted- that is, they are unlikely to persuade anybody to the right of Raskin.  But there are some essays I really liked.<br /><br />I especially liked Chapters 5 and 6 (in which Raskin shows how government has impaired democracy by keeping third parties off the ballot and out of debates, and criticizes judicial deference to the two-party duopoly) and Chapter 9 (in which he criticizes attempts to amend the Constitution to prohibit flag-burning, pointing out (a) that an anti-desecration law might actually encourage people to burn flags to get publicity, and (b) that an anti-desceration law that allows nonpolitical destruction of used flags but outlaws flag burning by political extremists is essentially thought control, in that it would prohibit flag burning only by people with political messages to convey).<br /><br />Other chapters are much more touchy-feely.  For example, in Chapter 7, Raskin defends school busing on the grounds that racially integrated schools make society more \\"democratic\\"- but parents hardly feel like part of a democracy if unelected judges are telling their children where to go to school.  Raskin proposes an amendment providing: \\"All children in the United States have a right to receive an equal public education for democratic citizenship.\\" But the uncertainty of the concept of \\"equality\\" would give judges carte blanche to dictate virtually any concievable policy.<br /><br />\\"Democracy\\" is a vague concept; some people see democracy as majority rule, others see democracy as at least partially about liberty or equality.  On issues dealing purely with the former, Raskin's book is excellent.  On issues dealing with possible conflicts between these meanings of democracy, Raskin understandably has more difficulty.	2004-12-06

I think Jews should read it as a historical document, to understand how our ancestors explained Judaism to each other.<br /><br />Halevi begins by dismissing Christianity and Islam in just a few pages, pointing out that despite their alleged noble intentions, \\"vie with each other in committing murders, believing that this is a most pious work and brings them nearer to God.\\" (p. 39) Christian theology is rejected in just a paragraph as illogical (p. 42), while Islam is flawed because \\"as long as it is written in Arabic, a non-Arab . . . cannot perceive its miraculous character.\\" (p. 43) I doubt that these arguments would persuade a Christian or Muslim- but my suspicion is that this book was written entirely for people like me (i.e. Jews predisposed to agree).<br /><br />By contrast, Judaism is true because various miracles (e.g. the relevation at Sinai, the giving of Manna to the Hebrews, the parting of the Red Sea) \\"took place in the presence of great multitudes\\" (id.), unlike the relevations described in other religions.  In other words, if the Torah says X happened in front of thousands of people, the Torah must be correct because our ancestors would not have been persuaded to believe such events (unlike relevation to just one person) if they did not happen. Is Halevi right? I suspect the answer depends on how gullible you think our ancestors were, and how accurately you think a tradition can be handed down.<br /><br />Halevi vigorously defends rabbinic tradition against the literalist Karaite sect, citing the numerous ambiguities in the Torah (pp. 166-68).  In other words, because the Torah is ambiguous, traditional interpretations of the Torah must be correct, or at least necessary to ensure some uniformity of practice.  By contrast, Karaism ensures that \\"in one house [there might be] ten persons with as many different opinions.\\"(p. 177).  (Of course, some might say that this is still the case among Jews despite the decline of Karaism).<br /><br />Halevi goes beyond his pragmatic attack on Karaism, and seems to imply that the whole of Jewish tradition is uninterrupted- and makes some effort to address evidence that seems to contradict this view.  For example, the Book of Nehemiah apparently implies that when rebuilding the Second Temple, Jews were ignorant of the laws of Succot until Ezra informed them of same.  (See Nehemiah 8:14).  Halevi takes on this problem by suggesting that Jews could not possibly have forgotten such things, because they were apparently aware of other laws- in other words, that because our ancestors knew law X, they must have also known law Y (pp. 184-5).  As for the Tanach's apparent suggestion that the people had forgotten Succot, Halevi explains that \\"the whole people gave attention to them [the laws] . . . The erudite were not unacquainted with the details of the law...\\" (p. 186).  Halevi's interpretation would seem to be contradicted by the Tanach's statement that \\"the Israelites had not done so from the day of Joshua son of Nun to that day\\" (Neh. 8:17) - a passage that Halevi (at least according to this translation) seems to avoid. (This is not to say that there are not plausible traditional interpretations of this passage- just that Halevi doesn't completely cover the issue).<br /><br />Halevi vigorously defends the Mishnah against Karaite attacks, stating that its lucidity \\"is so striking that every one who looks at it with genuine scrutiny must be aware that mortal man is incapable of composing such a work without divine assistance\\" (p. 191), and if rabbinic interpretations of the Torah appear not to make sense, \\"they employ secret methods of interpretation which we are unable to discern\\" (p. 193).<br /><br />A few other random thoughts:<br /><br />1.  Halevi explains the various names of God- specifically suggesting that the four-letter Tetragrammaton means \\"I am that I am, the existing one, existing for you wherever you seek [God].\\" (p. 202).<br /><br />2. He defines Divine holiness as \\"the spirtual, which never assumes a corporeal form, and which nothing concrete can possibly resemble.\\" (p. 203).<br /><br />3.

The authors point out:<br /><br />1) that Americans drive more and walk less than residents of other affluent nations<br /><br />2) that Americans have become more sedentary and fatter in recent decades<br /><br />3) that Americans exercise more when they live in more pedestrian-friendly environments, and<br /><br />4) that Americans are unable to walk as much as they would like because most American cities and suburbs are built by highway engineers and government planners to discourage pedestrian traffic; streets are too wide to safely walk, zoning codes mandated densities so low that shops are often not within walking distance of residences, and federal housing regulation has encouraged streets to be disconnected to each other that nearly all journeys require a stop at a high-speed, congested arterial.<br /><br />Because this book was built in 2003, the authors devote relatively little space to the connection between sprawl, lack of exercise and obesity.  In recent years, some studies have begun to document this connection, and I hope that the authors come out with a second edition addressing these issues.	2004-11-09

The diminishing marriage rate and the even more rapidly diminishing birth rate show which way the wind is blowing . . . large numbers of them [women] now approach the business [of marriage] with far greater fastidiousness than their grandmothers.\\"  So as a result, only relatively skilled men are marriageable, and lower-class men go without.  By contrast, in the past \\"even marriage with a fifth-rate man was better than no marriage at all.\\"<br /><br />Mencken also correctly predicted that even after the influx of women into the workplace, women will still lag behind men economically: he writes that \\"it is impossible to imagine a genuinely intelligent human being becoming a competent trial lawyer, or buttonhole worker, or newspaper sub-editor, or piano tuner, or house painter.  Women, to get upon all fours with men in such stupid occupations, will have to commit spiritual suicide, which is much further than they will ever actually go. Thus a shade of their present superiority to men will always remaijn, and with it a shade of their relative inefficiency, so marriage will remain attractive\\".<br /><br />Mencken also predicts loosened sexual mores: \\"With the decay of the ancient concept of women as property there must come inevitability a reconsideration of the whole sex question.\\"<br /><br />And of course all these things have come to pass, both in America and in Europe: well-employed women marry later or not at all and get divorced more quickly, and low-income women have virtually abandoned marriage altogether.<br /><br />Mencken only runs aground when he looks at war and peace.  He correctly predicted World War II (in particular predicting wars between France and Germany, and between Japan and America) but thought that it would be so devastating, and wipe out so many of the world's men, that women would vastly outnumber men,  which in turn would radically modify marriage- perhaps by causing the reinstitution of polygamy.

Rather than reiterating the other reviewers' comments (all of which I agree with) I wanted to mention a few things about the book that grabbed my attention:<br /><br />1.  That complaints about the popularization of kabbalah was as common 350 years ago as it is today.  One rabbi wrote in 1662: \\"now there have appeared presumptuous men who abuse [kabbalah], turning it into a spade with which to feed themselves.  They write books on kabbalistic subjects . . . and even mingle the inventions of their hearts with kabbalistic teachings, until it becomes impossible to distinguish between the words of the kabbalist masters and their own additions.\\" (p. 87).  Take that, Madonna!<br /><br />2. Claims that the Messiah is coming were even more common among Jews in those days as today.  Scholem mentions numerou such instances (usually based on gematria, a kind of Jewish numerology involving turning letters from the Bible into numbers and adding up the numbers to achieve interesting results).  For example, Kabbalist Moses Cordervero wrote: \\"Though not delaying the date of redemption, they [our sins] have hidden it so that its light is invisible until the appointed time.  But none of these things will be later than the year 408 [1648], and some will occur earlier, such as the resurrection [of the dead] in the Holy Land.\\" (p. 88-89)  Instead of getting Messiah, Jews in the Ukraine got massacred in 1648.  After the massacres, other rabbis used gematria to show that the Torah predicted the massacres, and asserting that the massacres were the \\"birth pangs\\" of the Messianic age (p. 92)- a prediction which of course failed to materialize.  For example, one commentator noted that the Hebrew words for \\"the messianic woes\\" equalled 408 (Id.) So when you hear someone assert that Jews' current troubles are the birth pangs of Messianic redemption, just remember that the argument has been made before.<br /><br />3.  The use of gematria to persuade people that Sevi was Messiah.  For example, Sevi claimed that the numerical value of his name was equal to the numerical value of the Hebrew words \\"for the true Messiah\\" and \\"and God moved.\\" (pp. 234-35).<br /><br />4. Who Sabbatai Sevi was: a nice, rabbinically trained Jewish boy who was unfortunately under the spell of manic-depression.  Even before claiming to be the Messiah, Sevi would do bizarre things in his manic phases: for example, celebrating Jewish festivals at the wrong time of year (p. 162).  The Messianic movement may not have been Sevi's idea: Nathan Ashkenazi, a brilliant young rabbi in Gaza, claimed to have had a heavenly vision that Sevi was the Messiah (p. 204-05) and then gradually persuaded Sevi of this \\"fact\\" (id. at 215-20). Scholem believes that Nathan was far more energetic than Sevi, \\"could read people's consciences\\" (p. 268) and was thus able to persuade them of Sevi's status.  And the people persuaded by Nathan wrote other Jews around the globe, causing the Sevi movement to explode.<br /><br />5.  The polarization of the Jewish community over Sevi, which led to shameful behavior by believers and nonbelievers alike. In one of his manic phases, Sevi once smashed the doors of a hostile congregation with an ax on the Sabbath and took over the service (p. 395). Nonbelievers and believers alike asked non-Jewish kings to punish their opponents on trumped-up charges (p. 514). Even \\"nonbelievers\\" conceded that the believers were usually the majority (p. 475).<br /><br />6.  The ability of the masses to experience religious delusions.  For example, when the movement was at its height in Smyrna, Greece, dozens of Jews claimed to have seen Elijah (p. 417) and hundreds of Jews engaged in mass \\"prophecies\\".  During these prophecies, they trembled, swooned, proclaimed that Sevi was messiah- and forgot their words afterwards (p. 419).  False prophecy is real - and the false prophets might not even be aware of their own falsity.<br /><br />7.  The manipulation of Sevi by Turkish authorities, who first arrested him, then sought revenue by charging admission to Jews who sought to visit their Messiah (p. 603), then compelled him to convert to Islam.<br /><br />8.  The apparent abdication of authority by even hostile rabbis.  Turkish rabbis asked their counterparts in Jerusalem (who knew Sevi better than they) to comment on his messianic claims.  The Jerusalem rabbis never answered (p. 613).<br /><br />9.  The occasional presence of good sense even among believers.  When asked about the issue, Sevi's brother Elijah praised Sevi, but added that \\"he was an expert in cloth and linen but not in divinity.\\" (p. 614).<br /><br />10.  The fact that Sevi's apostasy did not immediately eliminate all his support, since a few \\"believers\\" claimed that his conversion to Islam was a trick- an impression nurtured by Sevi himself, who contained to receive Jewish visitors after his apotasy and to study Torah etc.<br /><br />11.  The attempt by anti-Sevi rabbis to cover up the whole affair after Sevi apostasized- for example, rabbis in Venice wrote to other Jewish communities commdanting them \\"to destroy all documents rlating to the movement of 1666 [Sevi's] and to obliterate all testimony of this shameful episode.\\" (pp. 762-63).

Thus, some objective goods exist, because no reasonable person can forego health, education, wisdom, etc.  One fails to act properly when he (1) wants inappropriate things, (2) pursues proper (or at least harmless) goals to the extent that he or she foregoes other proper goals.  This philosophy answers very few real life questions, of course- since most real life difficulties consist of balancing these goals.  For example, should the ideal person focus on one type of wisdom (e.g. religious wisdom) and seek a minimal amount of health and wealth, getting by on a few hours of sleep to maximize his or her spiritual and intellectual firepower?  Or should one strike a more even balance between the material and the intellectual?<br /><br />Adler also has difficulty explaining why and to what extent we should help others.  Certainly, he believes that we are more likely to have wealth, education, wisdom, etc. in a society where others have these things.  But why pay taxes when we could retain our wealth instead?  Adler doesn't adequately confront libertarians.	2004-09-05

(Although it is not clear why Los Angeles Jews adopted similar political views when they seem to have had far less discrimination to contend with).<br /><br />But much of the middle of the book includes a lot of blow-by-blow community history; I'm not sure how interesting this discussion would be for people who didn't live in Miami or Los Angeles.	2004-09-05

This novel is about both: most of the main character's life constituted a chillul hashem.  As a German king's chief financial officer, he taxes the peasants into penury.

But even so I got something out of it - especially at the beginning (where Maimonides attacks simple-minded literalism) and the end (where Maimonides tries to justify the mitzvot).  I'm sure that in a few years when I am a bit more intellectually sophisticated, I will get more out of it.<br /><br />One really interesting part of the book that none of the other reviewers has mentioned so far: Maimonides' explanation of divine intervention in our lives. He asserts, based on Torah, that such Divine intervention affects humans but not animals (Part III, Ch. 17).  Why? Because \\"Divine Providence is connected with Divine intellectual influence, and the same beings which are benefited by the latter so as to become intellectual, and to comprehend things comprehensible to rational beings, are also under the control of Divine Providence.\\" (Id.)  And given that Divine Providence is connected with intellect, it further follows that \\"the greater the share which a person has obtained of this Divine influence ... the greater must also be the effect of Divine Providence upon him.\\"  (Id., Ch. 18).  Thus, \\"the greater the human perfection a person has attained, the greater the benefit he derives from Divine Providence.\\" (Id.)  In other words, if you are Abraham or Moses, you get plenty of divine influence in your life.  For the rest of us, the world takes its natural course.<br /><br />It seems to me that this theory allows us to reconcile Biblical miracles with the day-to-day reality of bad things happening to good people and vice versa: perhaps prophets get individualized reward and punishment in this world, and the rest of us don't.  (Caveat: I am NOT saying that this view is factually correct, or even that Maimonides endorses this view; it is not clear to me how spiritually elevated Maimonides thinks one has to be to receive Divine intervention- whether only Moses, Abraham, etc. get it, or whether ordinary good and intelligent people get it as well, or whether he would draw the line someplace in between).r he would draw the line someplace in between).	2004-09-05

For example, he attacks the idea that \\"Natural is Morally Better\\" by pointing out that nature is morally neutral, and that every medical advance disrupts nature.<br /><br />On the other hand, Halberstam sometimes (as the hostile reviewers point out) fails to explain the reasoning behind his conclusions.  And other times he makes silly generalizations.  For example, he writes that unspecified \\"ethical relativists\\" refuse to condemn other cultures but \\"seem to have no problem praising the moral behavior of other cultures\\" (p. 150).  What \\"ethical relativists\\"? Who is he talking about?  Has Halberstam conducted a survey of self-identified ethical relativists?<br /><br />This book reads like a first draft; I got something out of it, but with a little more editing it could have been significantly improved.	2004-08-29

Books	4	14	15	N	N	not bad, could have been slightly more sophisticated	Blech throws a variety of explanations for the world's apparent injustice at readers (suffering as punishment, suffering as test for spiritual growth, suffering compensated in next world, etc.).  None of them are consistently persuasive, and to invoke them selectively proves too much (in that even though one explanation of evil might be logically falsifiable under certain circumstances, four or five alternate explanations are not logically falsifiable as a group, since there will always be a situation where one of them makes sense).  Blech is quite deferential (maybe too much so) to every explanation he plucks from traditional Jewish sources.<br /><br />Blech does not bother to criticize any explanation of misfortune until he discusses the Holocaust- when he finally comes up with the best answer, which is that Divine inactivity in the face of human evil is incomprehensible.  The best part of the book is his attack on \\"divine punishment\\" explanations of the Holocaust, in which he points out that some Jewish commentators argue that the Holocaust is punishment for Zionism while other equally learned commentators assert that the Holocaust was punishment for inadequate Jewish support of Zionism.<br /><br />I think this point could have been broadened into an attack on such theology generally: that is, if you treat collective suffering as punishment, there is a virtually unlimited number of sins that could justify divine punishment.  Thus, to blame punishment on any specific sin makes no sense.  (This is true for individuals as well; but hopefully most individuals' menus of misconduct are relatively finite).	2004-08-22

In some of these disputations, the Jews were treated somewhat fairly, in others less so.<br /><br />Maccoby describes three separate disputations: one in Paris in 1240, a second in Barcelona in 1263 (perhaps the fairest, and the most notable from the Jewish point of view because of the involvement of Nachmanides, one of the more well-known Jewish scholars of the medieval period), a third in Tortosa in 1413-14.  In addition, he provides more-or-less contemporary summaries of the latter two disputations.<br /><br />After reading Jaccoby's book, I was surprised how sophisticated both sides were by modern standards.  The Christian \\"debaters\\" (often converts from Judaism) were much more sophisticated about Judaism than today's missionary-on-the-street; while the latter focuses solely on a few Biblical passages that he or she alleges shows Jesus to be Messiah, the former focused on Talmud and Midrash as well.<br /><br />Christians took two very different lines: first, that the Talmud was a corruption of Biblical Judaism, and later that the Talmud actually supported Christianity.  As to the latter, Christians relied heavily on Midrashic stories - for example, one which suggested that at the time of the Temple's destruction, the Messiah had already been born.<br /><br />In response to the latter claim, Nachmanides not only attacked the Christian interpretations of the Midrash - but bluntly pointed out that this story is \\"either not true, or has some other interpretation derived from the secrets of the Sages.\\" (p. 110). In other words, such Midrashic stories are fables designed to make a theological point, rather than literal truth.	2004-08-08

I learned a lot from this book, including:<br /><br /> 1. The amazingly small size of medieval Jewish communities. Trent contained 30 Jews in three households; even Rome contained only a couple of thousand Jews at the end of the 15th century.<br /><br /> 2. That ritual murder cases weren't just against Jews. Christian authorities also used ritual murder accusations against heretics and in witchcraft cases.<br /><br /> 3. That ritual murder cases involved judicial proceedings as well as mob justice. In the Trent case, the local government relied on 3 witnesses before arresting Jews: an ex-Jew who claimed to have been told 15 years earlier that Jews used blood in preparing matzos, a Christian woman whose son got lost in a Jewish defendant's shed 14 years earlier, and another Christian woman who heard a boy crying near a Jew's house.  The authorities had no interest in the fact that the Jewish defendants voluntarily came forward with the corpse of the alleged victim.<br /><br /> 3. The heavy use of torture. The Christian authorities recognized that these three witnesses' testimony was not adequate to prove guilt. So they tortured the Jews (mostly using the strappado, for which the victim had his or her hands tied behind his back with a long rope and was then hoisted up in the air by a pulley) until they confessed. After enough pain, the prisoner would confess to anything. Even after the Jews confessed, the authorities continued to torture them in order to ensure that they told roughly identical stories, and to ensure that their stories included certain details that the authorities imagined would be present. By coercing confessions, the strappado had the added advantage of stripping the Jews of the dignity of martyrdom.<br /><br /> 4.

As to the former, Lamm points out the difference between the two names of God referenced in the Shema: one represents the impersonal, universal God as seen in Nature while the other represents God as experienced in History, that is, the God who relates to Israel specifically and who is part of everything. Other interpretations of this phrase include a eschatalogical interpretation (that today God is One to Jews, but at the end of history all humans will see God as One), kabbalistic interpretations (some suggesting that nothing really exists outside God, but that God wills humans to act as if the world was real, others asserting that the Shema is an acknowledgement that awareness of the Creator's unity makes our lives less chaotic).<br /><br /> As to the concept of loving God, Lamm discusses Maimonides' interpretation of this verse (asserting that we learn to love God by contemplating creation and through studying Torah), Samuel David Luzzatto's definition of love as obeying divine commandments, the views of the Maharal (who asserts that we love God by recognizing that we owe our existence to God, and by honoring Torah scholars who study divine precepts), and other commentators' complex analysis of different types of love.	2004-07-25

The Census data bolsters his basic conclusion (that cities prosper if they can annex newly developing areas, but fail otherwise), and contains a variety of other interesting facts.  For example, the data assembled by Rusk shows that there is some evidence of gentrification, as shown by the fact that some cities have narrowed the economic gap between city and suburb.  On the other hand, such gentrification has typically been quite limited; for example, in Chicago, one of America's most improved cities, per capita city income increased from 66% of suburban income in 1990 to a still-anemic 71% of suburban income in 2000.<br />Rusk assembles piles of data to show how &quot;elastic&quot; cities (cities that can annex suburbs) differ from &quot;inelastic&quot; cities- typically the former grow instead of declining, are less segregated, and have better bond ratings.	2004-05-17

I thought his discussion of this issue was valuable for both non-Orthodox and Orthodox Jews (both of whom occasionally mistake the position of one or two rabbis or intellectuals with the \\"Orthodox position\\").<br />I think this book is an excellent guide to the differences among Jews, and would recommend it to anyone mystified by 20th-century Judaism.	2004-05-02

Just to sum up briefly: the modern Orthodox Manhattanites profiled tend to have busy but slightly empty lives, and are trying to fit their new religious commitment into those lives.  Their rabbis tend to focus less on beliefs about Divine existence and desires than on the utilitarian virtues of plugging into the wisdom of a 2000-year-old tradition.  The women in the Lubavitch &quot;sleepaway&quot; camp tend to be younger, suffering from very troubled lives, more focused on Divine will, and looking to make a major change in those lives (not surprisingly- since people with satisfactory jobs are usually going to be unable to take a month off). Their rebbes view Chasidism as these women's personal destiny, rather than as a freely chosen alternative. For those of you who are more familiar with Orthodoxy, the charm of this book lies in offhand points that the book makes in passing: for example, its implication that Orthodox triumphalism (that is, the idea that Orthodoxy is the future of Judaism) was far more rare in the 1980s, and that the Lubavitchers were struggling with the Messianic issue (that is, the issue of whether the Rebbe, may his memory be a blessing, was the Messiah) even then.	2004-03-22

Malbim (a 19th-century East European rabbi) seeks to explain the book of Esther, but his account (or its translation) leaves open a lot of questions.  For example, the book leaves the implication that the Persian King Achashverosh was unaware of the decree against the Jews, yet Mordecai knew and warned Esther about it.  But how could Mordecai have known more than the King?<br />And Malbim seems to suggest that Esther was involuntarily abducted.  If this is so, how could the King and his minions be unaware that Esther was related to Mordecai and thus Jewish (as the book seems to indicate).<br />Also, there's no real effort to compare Malbim's commentary with archaelogical and historical data about the Persian Empire, even though more is known about Cyrus the Great (who Malbim seems to think is the King at issue- he writes that King Achashverosh conquered Babylon, and Cyrus did exactly that) than about other Biblical-age kings.<br />I'm not saying that solutions to these questions don't exist; its just that I was surprised not to see the issues resolved in this book.	2004-03-08

Berkovits discusses numerous examples of our Sages of blessed memory creatively interpreting halacha (Jewish law) in order to meet the needs of the day and the dictates of common decency, with a particular focus on agricultural and marital law.  For example, the Sages gutted levirate marriage (a Biblical law which, if read overly literally, requires childless widows to marry the brother of their dead husband) and modified divorce laws to add protections for women.<br />In his last chapter, he suggests that Israeli halachists think about how to apply halacha in a Jewish state.  For example, total Shabbos observance works in a predominantly Gentile society where Gentiles staff the hospitals, police dept. etc.  But what happens in a mostly Jewish state where the doctors, nurses, police officers etc. are Jewish?  How do we balance Shabbos observance and public needs?  Berkovits doesn't supply the answer but he raises the question.  (Thus, I think this book would be even more interesting for Israeli readers than for Americans like me).<br />I think this book is worth reading for both Orthodox Jews (who can learn from this book that halacha has sometimes changed with the times, and that our Sages were not potted plants mechanically transmitting tradition) and for non-Orthodox Jews (who can learn that Orthodox Jews are smarter than they might think).	2004-03-02

Mittelman analyzes Jewish texts on both sides of the dispute, and suggests that both are relevant.<br />In addition to discussing modern political theorists, Mittelman also discusses classical Jewish commentators' attitudes towards individualism and communitarianism; generally, the Talmud and medieval commentators tend to favor balancing rather than extreme positions on one side or the other.  For example, the sages ask who should pay the most when a city levies taxes for a wall to protect against invaders:  all citizens equally?  the rich?  or the citizens who live nearest the wall (who presumably benefit more than those who live in the core of town?)  The dominant view, according to Mittelman, is &quot;a poor man at the edge of town pays more than a poor man downtown, a rich man at the edge of town pays more than a rich man downtown, but a rich man, regardless of location, will always pay more than a poor man.&quot;  Clearly, our sages of blessed memory were not libertarians.	2004-02-22

The early part of the book was most interesting; Kugel explains that while we think of God as very abstract and very far away, the Bible sometimes shows him suddenly appearing in human form as an angel, going out of its way to blur the distinction between God and other beings.  By contrast, later texts tend to more sharply distinguish God and angels from each other and from beings with bodies.<br />Kugel also explains that while moderns think of man searching for God, the Bible shows God in search of Man (to use R. Heschel's phrase) - often without any indication that the human being contacted has sought such contact.  (Though many Midrashim try to show otherwise, indicating some discontent with the idea of unsought prophecy).<br />As Kugel points out, &quot;As the biblical period goes on, God becomes bigger and more remote (p. 61). . . ungraspably big and far off (p. 63).

Halivni argues that Jews' means of describing Jewish law have swung back and forth over the centuries from \\"apodictic\\" (i.e. law as final conclusion with little explanation) to \\"discursive\\" (law as constant argument, sometimes with no ultimate conclusion at all).  Halivni explains that the first swing of the pendulum came from Second Temple Midrash (some explanation) to the Mishnah (almost no explanation) after the destruction of the Second Temple.  Then came another swing from the Mishnah to the Talmud (which is almost entirely discursive).  And after the Talmud came the medieval codifiers such as Maimonides, who moved back to the apodictic code - though in turn they were followed by commentators on the codes.<br />Halivni also asserts that the discursive strain in Jewish thought was exemplified by medieval Torah commentators which exercised considerable freedom in interpreting the Torah, sometimes in contradiction to settled Jewish law.<br />Halivni's sympathy is clearly with those commentators and with the Talmud; he seems to believe that regardless of whatever practical law governs Jews, Torah should be studied for its own sake.	2004-02-08

In addition, the book covers a wider range of issues than many sprawl related books; instead of being focused on quality of life issues (like most New Urbanist books are) or on environmental issues, Gillham goes into both.

I think the Hertz Chumash and the Conservative Chumash (Etz Hayim) both strike a somewhat better balance between tradition and modern views.<br />But I would like to point out one thing that this book does very well: Plaut goes out of his way to incorporate not just the views of today's commentators, but also views other than the most traditional Jewish views (at one extreme) and his own: for example, he uses 19th and early 20th century commentators more frequently than Etz Hayim, and (unlike Etz Hayim) occasionally takes passages from the Koran to show how the Muslim tradition addresses Torah laws and stories.<br />On balance, I can't say this is my favorite Chumash- but nevertheless I am glad I spent a year using it.	2004-01-12

Because I think that had Steinberg been willing to write on a higher intellectual plane, this book could have been a great book instead of an OK one.  Steinberg keeps asserting that Elisha ben Abuyah (the main character) finds traditional Judaism, and later secularism, intellectually unsatisfying.  But he doesn't really explain WHY Elisha found the alternatives so unsatisfying; to do so probably would have required spending dozens (if not hundreds) of pages on theological arguments, and perhaps Steinberg couldn't find a way to make this kind of discussion boht readable and intellectually worthwhile.	2004-01-12

(And who knows what that might have led to - Nixon/Specter 68 anyone?)  I do, however, think the author is being overly romantic when he suggests that Rizzo could have beaten Ed Rendell in 1991 had he lived.  A white Democrat (especially one as personable as Rendell) usually beats a white Republican in Philadelphia- and though Rizzo had many good qualities, his tax and spend record as mayor suggests that using Frank Rizzo to fix Philadelphia's fiscal crisis would be like using a hammer to destroy a wasp nest- the right tool for the wrong job.	2003-12-10

Prof. Berger seeks to answer this question.<br />Most of the book is spent critiquing traditional arguments for such obedience.  For example, one common argument for following Talmudic law is based on Deut. 17:8-13 (which provides that if a &quot;case is too baffling for you to decide&quot; , Jews should obey &quot;the judge in charge at the time&quot;).  Berger points out that the Talmudic sages are no longer in our time (and thus not necessarily the correct &quot;judges&quot; to follow) and that their authority extended beyond cases (in the sense of controversies between two people) to broad legislation.  And the notion that &quot;Every statement of the Talmud is merely a record of transmitted divine law&quot; (p. 6) overlooks &quot;the evidence of the Talmud itself, which attributed legislative enactments to several Rabbinic leaders.&quot; (Id.)<br />So why, then, do we follow the Rabbis of the first several centuries after the destruction of the Temple?  Because rabbinic authority, in varying degrees, has become central to Jews' way of life - a way of life that &quot;can provide a sense of overall purpose to one's activities; it can create or deeper feelings of community with other Jews; it can offer guidelines for behavior and a relative certitude with respect to moral and other sorts of dilemmas; and it can supply a person with a connection or rootedness in a millenia-long tradition.&quot; (p. 152).  Berger's argument is somewhat analogous to the legal argument for stare decisis (i.e. that a judicial decision or set of such decisions has become so ingrained in the legal system that it should not be overturned even if it was not rightly decided in the first place).<br />Berger points out that rabbinic authority means different things for different communities.  For the most traditional Jews, rabbinic authority means complete obedience to the halachic tradition first put in writing by the rabbis of the Mishna and Talmud.  But even the least traditional Jews defer to rabbinic authority to some extent (otherwise Reform Jews wouldn't follow rabbinically created holidays such as Hanukah and Purim).ns complete obedience to the halachic tradition first put in writing by the rabbis of the Mishna and Talmud.

I need not have worried- this book was livelier than I expected, mainly because it is not just a biography but also to some extent a guide to the early years of American Judaism.  I learned not only how primitive and weak early American Judaism was (for example, until the 1840s congregations were led by prayer leaders rather than ordained rabbis) but also how in other ways there truly is nothing new under the sun.  For example:<br />1. Concerns over &quot;the Vanishing American Jew&quot;-  In 1836 (!) Leeser wrote that &quot;in less than the age of one man the name of Israelite will hardly be known in this land, save as an object of memory&quot;<br />2.  Day school vs. Sunday school- In the 1830s Leeser tried to start a Jewish day school, but the lack of interest was so overwhelming that he closed it down.  So he held his nose and started the first Sunday school.<br />3. Church/state battles- In 1864, a group of Presbyterian ministers endorsed a &quot;Christian nation&quot; amendment to the Constitution because &quot;a Christian nation with an atheistical Constitution is an anomaly.&quot;  Leeser took a strong stand against such nonsense.<br />4. Intracongregational warfare- In contract renewal negotiations, Leeser retained an attorney (something that raises eyebrows even today in synagogues).<br />5.  Reconciling Orthodoxy with America- Readers need only look to the illustrations of the clean-shaven Leeser and his congregants to notice that his Orthodox congregation was &quot;modern&quot; at least a century before modern was cool.	2003-11-23

As a result, this book is likely to persuade only those who already agree with him; I sense that the publishers made him finish this book a bit too quickly.<br />But Dershowitz's dissection of natural law in the second half of the book is a little more persuasive, because he relies on logic rather than on inadequate research.	2003-11-10

The book has more human drama than intellectual enlightenment, and by the time I was done I wondered whether it was an efficient use of my time.

Gordis starts by going on (and on and on) about how if only Jews were different from everyone else they'd assimilate less and survive more - not necessarily a bad point, but one unlikely to change anyone's mind and one which has been made with more verve elsewhere.  People who already agree with him are likely to learn nothing new and the people who don't are likely to say to themselves, \\"So what?\\"<br />But in the second half of this book Gordis goes from blandly asserting Jews should be \\"different\\" in some unspecified way, to explaining how modern Jews can use Jewish tradition to analyze specific issues like abortion - and when he does, this book comes to life (though I wish his treatment of social issues was a bit more detailed; for example, his treatment of capital punishment could be a bit more balanced).<br />And I especially liked his discussion of relations between the Diaspora and Israel; Gordis gives a balanced discussion both of traditional commentators who unequivocally assert that Jews belong in and those of who are more skeptical.	2003-07-07

Halivni writes about his Holocuast experiences, but many others have done the same at greater length.  What I got out of this book was:<br />1.  His discussion of pre-Holocuast shtetl life: its scholarship, its isolation, its sheer backwardness in many areas (for example, when one relative told the author's grandfather that the boy was \\"turning modern\\" because he ate with a fork instead of with his hands, and read secular newspapers).  Unless you eat with your hands and avoid newspapers, you will find it much harder after reading this book to believe that Jews should be bound by every custom of their ancestors.<br />2.  His attempt to describe his own ideological position: more respectful of traditional halakhah than modern Conservatives, more critical of traditional interpretations than some Orthodox commentators.  You can find plenty of books by commentators to Halivni's right, and plenty by commentators to his left, but I would be surprised if you could find any by people who think exactly what he thinks (assuming there are any). As a result, his book is unique or nearly so - and for this reason alone, his book is worth reading and will probably challenge you whatever your views.<br />Another reviewer said that Halivni is not among the \\"first rank\\" of scholars.  (I am not enough of a scholar to intelligently agree or disagree).  But even if this were the case, I would recommend this book.  I've learned quite a bit from people who weren't in the \\"first rank\\" of scholars - many of whom, I suspect, are not of Halivni's rank.	2003-06-23

I thought it would be a history of intra-Jewish discord; instead, the first 2/3 of the book is just a general history of Judaism (useful for the beginner, but no more so than many other books), and the rest is a discussion of Rabin's assassination and the ideological disputes within Israel that led to it.<br />I was disappointed in some other ways:<br />1.  The book's discussion of Israeli politics is out of date.  It ends with Rabin's assassination in 1995.  But at the time I am writing this (early 2003) the Oslo peace process looks to many former doves like a sham, Israel seems more far more united (behind Ariel Sharon) than it has been in decades, and the dispute between Rabin and his enemies is about as relevant to modern events as the 18th-century disputes between Hasidim and their enemies.<br />2.  The book is sometimes a bit sloppy; the most common distortion seems to be Viorst's belief that most Orthodox Jews (or most ultra-Orthodox, or most Hasidim) share the views of a few ideologues.  For example, he cites Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's attacks on Zionism, and asserts that \\"To this day, Hasidim conventionally maintain that Israel is a heresy which exposes Jews to a vengeful God.\\" (p. 173).  This view would be news to Chabad Hasidim, who conventionally are so pro-Israel they make Milton Viorst look like Joel Teitelbaum.	2003-06-23

Specifically:<br />*She thinks private school enrollment is skyrocketing due to conspicious consumption  (p. 86) - an understandable view of most of your friends live in cities where private schooling is common.  But in fact, private school enrollment has stagnated in recent decades because most middle class people prefer to avoid both private school tuition and urban diversity by moving to suburban public schools.  If Schor hung around with more suburbanites maybe she would know this.<br />*Gratuitious liberal corporate bashing.  She asserts that virtually everything is environmentally unfriendly (p. 156), and how Nikes are made in sweatshops and how awful that is - a point which (1) is inconsistent with her message because if Nikes were made by unionized workers making $20 an hour they would cost even more and (2) is a distraction from her main message that a good editor would have cut, since it doesn't add anything and really ticks off readers to the right of Ralph Nader.<br />*She seems to think that status is unrelated to safety (p. 95).  Probably true in Boston; for whatever reason, the crime rates in high-status and low-status suburbs are pretty similar, and the city's crime rate is lower than that of most other American cities.  But in relatively high-crime metro areas like Miami, Atlanta and DC, picking the right neighborhood can be a life and death matter.  Which illustrates another problem with Schor's book: because (like many leftists) she ignores crime except as evidence that our welfare state is too small, she doesn't realize that crime really is a major driver of consumption: to avoid crime, Americans in high crime metros are forced to (1) live a zillion miles out in suburbs, creating lots of auto-related expenses or (2) live in the small number of safe close in areas, which are expensive due to their rarity and intrinsic desirability.<br />*Schor writes: \\"The South has not been known for being a particularly status-oriented area.\\"  (p. 78).  Schor's view of \\"the South\\" must have been formed by Mayberry RFD rather than by reality. If she knew more about, say, Atlanta, she would know that status is as important there as anyplace (especially since the urban South has high crime, and high crime means high housing and commuting costs).<br />This book is a good book - but had it been carefully edited by someone with a radically different background from Schor's (preferably a suburban Sunbelt conservative) it could have been a flawless book.ts) she ignores crime except as evidence that our welfare state is too small, she doesn't realize that crime really is a major driver of consumption: to avoid crime, Americans in high crime metros are forced to (1) live a zillion miles out in suburbs, creating lots of auto-related expenses or (2) live in the small number of safe close in areas, which are expensive due to their rarity and intrinsic desirability.<br />*Schor writes: \\"The South has not been known for being a particularly status-oriented area.\\"  (p. 78).

I counted six Orthodox Jews, three Conservatives, one Reform, and no Reconstructionists.  (And a few people with no real affiliation).<br />2) Among the nonrabbis, I sensed that all the interviewees were either much more observant (e.g. 100% shomer Shabbat, keeping kosher) than I or much less so (attending shul twice a year).<br />3) Generally an easy read: a good book to read if you want to get a sense of the diverse views of modern Jews about various issues, but not a useful source of in depth information or analysis.	2003-06-08

I was not disappointed.  Segal argues that classical, rabbinic Judaism (as enunciated in the Talmud and post-Talmud halacha) did not arise fully formed from Sinai.  Rather, it arose out of the Pharisees, which in turn was just one sect out of many (though probably the most popular sect) until the Second Temple was destroyed in 70.  Segal suggests that the dominance of the Mishnah (a law code written by the Pharisees' intellectual heirs, which was adopted by nearly all Jews) arose not just because it was intellectually compelling but for political reasons: the Romans had an interest in a unified Jewish community governed by one law, the Mishnah, and governed by rabbis who did not expect the Messiah to come any time soon.  Interesting theory, though it doesn't explain why the Mishnah survived Jewish movement away from Israel.	2003-06-08

I started it at 4:30 Shabbos afternoon and was 2/3 done with it five hours later.  And when Rabbi Sacks writes as a rabbi, he does quite well - that is to say, I found his analysis of difficult Torah passages (e.g. the almost-sacrifice of Isaac) quite enlightening.<br />Much of his writing is a historical attempt to show Judaism's contributions to the world and how Judaism differed from paganism; I don't really know enough about paganism to agree or disagree with all of his points.  (I generally find his analysis persuasive, but as a Jew who doesn't have a lot of pagan friends, I'm kind of biased).<br />The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is that because of the recent outbreak of anti-Semitism around the world, it is totally outdated.  Sacks writes that Jews have no reason to be ambivalent about their identity or scared to be Jews, because \\"neither now nor in the foreseeable future can [anti-Semitism] hold center stage in the political arena\\" (p. 221) - words that made sense in the late 1990s when he wrote them.  Yet now a worldwide terrorist army, incited by al-Jazeera and other state-supported media in Islamic states, has announced its plan to destroy all of the world's Jews, and is only a few nuclear weapons away from making substantial \\"progress\\" in that direction.  And Israel is being hammered at by terrorist aggression, and most of the world sympathizes with the terrorists.  If Rabbi Sacks writes a second edition (and I hope he does) it will have to be substantially modified to address these unpleasant realities.	2003-05-26

(The author's general bias is in favor of national health insurance of some sort).  I thought the \\"Jewish essays\\" were more interesting than the rest of the book -- perhaps because I'm more interested in Jewish topics, perhaps because the issues raised in sacred texts are more likely to be relevant in 2003 than the details of Oregon's Medicaid policy.	2003-05-19

She suggests that the Seder plate emphasizes the transformation of nature (e.g. wheat) into culture (e.g. matzoh), just as relevation turned Jews from ordinary homo sapiens into a holy people.  But there was far too little discussion of the Seder and too much discussion of Judaism generally.

Although this book was certainly easy to read, it didn't quite live up to its promise, and here's why: only one side was debating the most important issues.  The Orthodox rabbi (Reinman) was simply a better debater, because rather than being enmeshed in trivia, he consistently focused on the most important theological issues separating Orthodox from Reform, such as the divine authorship (or lack thereof) of the Torah and the divine role in post-Biblical Jewish law.<br />By contrast, the Reform rabbi (Hirsch) gave these issues short shrift, focusing to a much greater extent on the intracacies of Israeli politics and other matters that I (and Reinman) consider relatively trivial.  For example, after Reinman spent six pages trying to debunk the idea that the Torah was written by multiple authors, Hirsch responds in a paragraph or two (p. 245).  Reinman wrote the perfect response to Hirsch's discussion of the obnoxious behavior of some of Israel's Orthodox politicians: \\"I do not know much about what goes on in Israeli politics, nor do I care to find out.  Spare me.\\" ((p. 300).<br />It as almost as if Hirsch and Reinman were trying to prove entirely separate points: while Reinman tries to persuade us that we should all be Orthodox, Hirsch tries to persuade us that some Orthodox Jews don't live up to their ideals and others aren't particularly good citizens.  As one or two other reviewers indicated, someone who read this book with minimal knowledge would certainly be swayed towards the Orthodox point of view, precisely because Reinman focuses on the key theological issues and Hirsch doesn't.<br />Does this mean Reinman is right?  No, only that he was virtually unopposed on some issues.  I dare say that the right opponent could have given Reinman a much more difficult time. (I am not knowledgeable enough to express an opinion as to who \\"the right opponent\\" would be).<br />A side point: on non-theological, non-halachic issues, Reinman's position should not be considered \\"THE Orthodox position.\\"  For example, many Orthodox Jews are far more supportive of Israel and of Zionism than is Reinman (who seems to believe that a somewhat secular Israel is only slightly, if at all, better than no Israel at all)./>A side point: on non-theological, non-halachic issues, Reinman's position should not be considered \\"THE Orthodox position.\\"  For example, many Orthodox Jews are far more supportive of Israel and of Zionism than is Reinman (who seems to believe that a somewhat secular Israel is only slightly, if at all, better than no Israel at all).	2003-02-19

This book is more advanced than &quot;Judaism for Dummies&quot; but hardly as incomprehensible as the works of major philosophers such as Buber.  I would say that to get the most out of it, you should have a fair amount of knowledge of Judaism, but you need not be a full-fledged theologian yourself.<br />2.  Some readers may be dissatisfied with the amount of space Jacobs gives major issues such as revelation and the role of mitzvot; he gives every issue about an equal amount of space, whether they deserve a short chapter or a full book.<br />3.  Jacobs certainly has a point of view - I would say he is a mainstream Conservative, generally endorsing traditional practice to a much greater extent than most Reform Jews, but not necessarily for the same reasons that traditional Jews would endorse.	2003-02-14

Poverty, crime, etc. get short shrift.<br />But I disagree with the commenters who accuse this book of &quot;Beltway bias.&quot;  Many of the things the author discusses (the idea that &quot;no one walks&quot; and obesity, for example) are much, much truer in the rest of America than they are inside the Beltway.	2002-11-27

Instead I got a group of essays about the Atlanta labor market - not necessarily a bad thing, since Atlanta politics has already been discussed to death by other authors (I recommend, for example, the works of Clarence Stone and Larry Keating).  Except for the first three or four essays, most of the essays in Atlanta Paradox are of interest only to labor economists.  Having said that, some of the essays (especially the one on spatial mismatch) are fairly good.  Others are flawed, primarily because they result on surveys of very small groups, and occasionally make conclusions about subgroups based on responses by 5 or 10 people - hardly an appropriate research technique.	2002-11-27

(And triple convergence doesn't even take into account the long-run congestion that results when people move to be near a widened or new expressway, thus causing additional ridership increases).  The only solution is to reduce demand for transportation, by encouraging ride sharing through tolls, fuel tax increases and other unpopular steps.  In short, the most effective ways of reducing congestion are also the least politically popular.	2002-11-21

Not so!  This book is all for sprawl-producing Big Government highway spending; its position is that government is good when it subsidizes migration to suburbia and bad when it doesn't.  Heritage should have disavowed this book and sent its authors either to the road builders association or to some more liberal institution.<br />Moreover, many of the essays in the book are shoddily reasoned and/or self-contradictory (whether due to unclear writing or unclear thought I cannot say).  Just to name a few examples:<br />1. Utt writes: \\"there is little evidence to suggest that federal programs have contributed to or encouraged suburbanization\\" (p. 104) but also writes that various federal programs \\"may very well have worsened the plight of many older central cities by undermining the quality of urban living\\" (p. 102).  If federal programs \\"undermined\\" urban living, they must have driven people into the suburbs.  Ron Utt, meet Ron Utt.<br />2. Utt writes: \\"it was the availability of mass transit that largely facilitated the move to the suburbs throughout the 1950s\\" (p. 100).  Just a paragraph earlier, he points out that as early as 1935, cities were shutting down trolley systems for lack of riders.  So how can nonexistent transit systems create sprawl?  And a page earlier, he suggests that \\"there is little convincing evidence to connect the growth of highways with the growth of the suburbs.\\" But how can transit cause more sprawl than highways, given that highways throughout the 20th century while mass transit shrunk? And if mass transit caused suburban growth, how come there are so many suburbs with no mass transit?<br />3. After spending page after page explaining that Big Brother must build us new roads, Wendell Cox writes: \\"there are indications that the worst traffic congestion may be over.  Future traffic growth may be considerably lower than in the past.\\" (p. 60) It the problem is dwindling, why spend public money curing it? (To be fair, Cox, who has done better work elsewhere, does suggest privatization of roads, but I couldn't find evidence that he opposes government road spending if privatization doesn't happen).<br />Sometimes the essays appear to contradict each other.  John Charles complains that Portland has shortchanged road spending (p. 131-32) but Angela Antonelli asserts that Portland has increased road construction by 108.1% between 1982 and 2000 (p. 150).<br />One or two essays are relatively innocuous, and one or two are not bad (Richard Stroup's essay on the defects of government generally, and Sam Staley's on the problems of zoning).

I especially liked (1) Apisdorf's ability to draw a distinction between the two holidays and what you should get from them: Rosh Hashanah as the forest (i.e. a general overview of life and Jewish theology), Yom Kippur as the trees (i.e. a detailed accounting of one's sins); (2) his brief guide to the prayers for each holiday.  One minor quibble: his concept of what exactly we have to repent for.  He talks about the sort of sins one either commits or abandons completely, but the sort of minor social sins that most non-criminal people commit most often (e.g. gossip) may be more amenable to gradual, marginal improvement.  If you liked this book, I would recommend a couple of others as follow-ups: (1) The Rosh Hashanah Anthology by Phillip Goodman (an older book, probably more accessible in libraries than in bookstores), (2) the Book of Jewish Values by Joseph Telushkin (for those of you who have difficulty remembering our sins over the past year).	2002-09-04

But what struck me as unique about this book is how Sarna compares Psalms and pagan equivalents -- that is, how Jews took the old bottles of pagan concepts and figures of speech, but filled them with the new wine of monotheistic theology.  For example, Sarna points out that Mesopotamian prayers speak of pagan sun gods as resting at the end of the day, and as a runner traversing heaven and earth.  Psalms 19:5-7 similarly describes the sun, but makes it clear that the sun's &quot;running&quot; and &quot;resting&quot; is one of the miracles of God's creation rather than the behavior of an independent sun-god.  Reading Sarna, I could almost imagine the lights going on in Hebrew heads as they thought: &quot;Well, it's all very well and good for my sun-worshipping neighbors to say that the sun runs around the sky -- but who created the sun?&quot;	2002-08-26

Orfield explains that not just core cities are hurt by sprawl.  Older and more racially diverse suburbs are hurt because they lose their most affluent residents to newer suburbs, thus causing them to go into the same death spiral of decline and decay as the core cities nearby.  Newer \\"bedroom community\\" suburbs are hurt because they get hit with all the infastructure demands caused by population growth (e.g. roads, sewers) but don't have enough commerce to finance these improvements.  Orfield adds that although some \\"edge city\\" suburbs (i.e. those with a lot of commerce) appear to be big winners from sprawl, those suburbs (a) are only a tiny minority of American suburbs and (b) suffer from traffic congestion because all those jobs mean drivers clogging their roads and making life miserable for these suburbs' permanent residents.  And Orfield doesn't just spin out theories -- he publishes numerous maps showing the decline not just of older suburbs, but even of some newer ones.<br />The second half of the book (which focuses on solutions) is worthy but far less interesting -- the sort of material that is probably tremendously helpful if you want an introduction to possible reforms, but which is less interesting if you are already familiar with these issues.	2002-07-30

I especially liked Greenberg's chapter on Shabbos (in which he suggests that Shabbos is intended to be a play-acting of an utopian future, just as Passover is a play-acting of the Exodus from Egypt). A minor quibble: Greenberg's discussion of differing streams of Judaism is inconsistent.  Sometimes, he is punctilious in comparing Conservative and Reform views to traditional Judaism; other times, he doesn't bother -- not a problem for the more knowledgeable reader, but perhaps a trap for the unwary.  Also, his apparent view that Zionism has triumphed and that anti-Semitism is not a huge problem is a bit dated -- but one could reasonably say the same about most books written by Jewish intellectuals after 1948 and before Sept. 11.	2002-07-28

Before the Holocuast, the mufti of Jerusalem urged the Nazis to engage in a \\"Holy War\\" against world Jewry, to accomplish the \\"final solution\\" to the Jewish problem everywhere. (p. 147, 1986 edition).  In 1945, 130 Jews were massacred in Libya and 82 more in Aden (p. 205).  In 1964, the state-controlled Egyptian press claimed that John Wilkes Booth was Jewish and \\"armed by the Zionist organization\\" (p. 214).  In the 1970s, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia claimed that Jews practice the ritual murder of Christian and Muslim children (p. 194)<br />These facts disprove the claim of another reviewer that \\"Far from being intent on annihilating the Jews, the Arab world is hostile towards Israel's brutal occupation of the Palestinians.\\"  Before I read Lewis's book, I too thought Arab anti-Semitism must have arisen from the recent Israel-Palestinian wars.  But as the above-quoted examples (and many others cited by Lewis) show, Arabs were massacring Jews, supporting Nazis and fomenting Jew hatred before Israel even was formed in 1948, let alone before Israel took over the \\"occupied terrorities\\" in 1967.<br />Another reviewer complained about the \\"racist\\" Israeli Law of Return.  The Law of Return has nothing to do with race: it allows Jews from around the world to live in Israel -- not just white European Jews, but Jews from the Arab countries (who, according to Lewis at least, comprised a majority of Israelis as of 1986) and black Jews from Ethiopia.	2002-07-21

To give two  examples:<br />One key is language in the opening sentences of a sequence or paragraph.  For example, in the first sentence of a paragraph discussing the law of liberation of slaves (Exodus 21:2), the Torah uses the phrase \\"go out\\" twice.  And in the succeeding verses, the Torah uses the word \\"go out\\" several more times - thus indicating its view that slavery (at least for Hebrews) should be a temporary status, because slaves will eventually \\"go out\\".<br />Another key is the contiguity principle - the idea that Biblical language should be interpreted by reference to nearby language.  For example, Gen. 3:1 describes a snake (the one who offers fruit to Eve) as \\"subtle.\\"  Well, why is he subtle?  Bonchek goes on to say \\"God had said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden\\" -- but in fact, God said not to eat of only one tree, the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  This exaggeration enables the serpent to manipulate Eve into eating of the tree.	2002-07-14

Learning about other countries' policies gave me a bit more of a feel for what works and what doesn't.  For example, by discussing Paris's use of street trees and smaller parks, Kunstler shows how not every park has to look as wild and \\"natural\\" as Central Park.

You will certainly not hurt yourself reading it, but I would consider it more a snack than a meal.<br />This book is very similar to Rabbi Telushkin's book, The Book of Jewish Values, in that it applies timeless Jewish wisdom to the equally timeless day-to-day problems of anger, gossip, etc. that have no doubt afflicted humanity since its origin.  But Telushkin's book is meatier, more intellectual, more willing to grapple with the close calls -- so if you've read and liked Telushkin's book, it won't kill you to skip this one.<br />If you haven't read either book, which should you read (or better yet read first?)  I personally liked Telushkin's book MUCH better, but I think the answer to this question is a matter of taste.  A few thoughts:<br />1) Jungreis's book is shorter (a fast 330 or so pages), maybe a little less complex -- I think it would be a better book for children and teenagers.<br />2) Although both Jungreis and Telushkin are Orthodox Jews, Jungreis is clearly writing much more for an audience of people who are Orthodox (or at least on the way to becoming Orthodox).  By which I mean: Jungreis assumes that the voice of tradition is the voice of G-d, and understandably wants you to agree with her on that ground alone.  Telushkin tends to softpedal such broad theological issues.<br />3) Jungreis' book is much more personal and autobiographical (and she certainly has an amazing life story), Telushkin's much more abstract.<br />4) Jungreis's book is a little more gooey and sentimental, Telushkin's a bit less so.	2002-03-31

Rather, he addresses a much narrower question: leaving aside the question of whether Jesus was a supernatural figure, how consistent are his teachings with the Torah?  Neusner asserts that even if one sees Jesus as a rabbi, his views differ from those of the Torah and of classical Judaism. The major difference: Jesus speaks to the individual, Judaism to the community as a whole.  Jesus says &quot;follow me&quot;, classical Judaism says &quot;follow the Torah&quot;. After reading this book, I understood both Christianity and Judaism a bit better.	2002-02-05

A caveat or two: (1) Schwarz seems to be writing for a distinctly &quot;new agey&quot; audience -- baby boomers, politically ultraliberal, oriented towards mysticism rather than learning.  I suspect that many unaffilated Jews aren't the type of would-be congregant that Schwarz is most interested in.  (2) I don't think Schwarz emphasizes education as much as I would have; certainly, I chose my shul partially because it seemed to have more educational opportunities than smaller ones (e.g. a study session after services on Saturday).	2002-02-05

The difference is that a Chumash is pithier and more clearly written than this book.  When I read the Torah portion every week, I sometimes can't put it down (especially in Genesis).  By contrast, I found it impossible to keep plowing through this learned but dull, dull, dull tome.	2002-02-05

As other reviewers have pointed out, Lazare correctly identifies a variety of government policies that have caused urban decay.  But most of his points have already been made by other commentators (e.g. James Kunstler, Alex Marshall).  Also, Lazare goes off on tangents about things like the life of Henry Ford, labor union policy, etc. which really aren't that relevant to his major point.  Like many leftish urbanists, Lazare seems to think that good urbanism leads to a liberal welfare state -- yet that most urban of industrialized nations, Japan, has a government as small as that of America.	2002-02-05

I am not sure Lewis has much of a grasp of the eternal characteristics of the human heart, but he does a good job of sketching a specific type of person in a specific place and time, kind of like Tom Wolfe today.  Unlike some reviewers, I don't think Lewis is unnecessarily venomous towards Babbitt -- at the end (when Babbitt tells his son to do what he enjoys instead of what his father did) he reveals himself to be somewhat of a mensch.  I also don't think Babbitt is as much of a role model as some other reviewers think; his business ethics are too borderline, his attitude towards First Amendment values too cavalier.  Generally, I liked Lewis more as a teenager than I do now; I think high schools should use his books more.	2002-02-05

Today, as in the 1980s, our politicians are no longer willing to make the tough choices needed to balance the budget.  Rudman's book is a deeply personal story of how he fought against those trends.  Rudman also explains how he got his friend David Souter appointed to the Supreme Court (a story that made me wince, since Souter is a bit more liberal than I).  Rudman's book is not particularly deep and didn't teach me anything about policy; but certainly I learned a bit more about 1980s politics from it, and I wish he was still in the Senate.	2002-02-05

One phrase I liked: \\"a church or synagogue that only admitted saints would be like a hospital that only admitted healthy people.  It would be a more pleasant place and easier to run, but that's not what we're in business for.\\"  Another example: I liked his explanation of the destructive impact of crime (i.e. that it robs victims of their feeling of power and significance) -- but Kushner's argument against the death penalty did not persuade me.  He writes: \\"we don't have to kill criminals to reclaim power over them\\" -- but the primary victim of a murder is unable to reclaim power, because he or she is dead, dead, dead.	2002-02-05

He defines God not as a supernatural force making history, but as the life force creating goodness (more or less) and argues that Jews should remain Jews because they are already within the Jewish tradition, and that this tradition therefore can best educate them on how to behave rightly and form a common culture -- as an acquaintance one said to me (in an entirely different context) \\"you dance with the one that brung you.\\"  I certainly see his point.<br />However, his brusque dismissal of supernatural religion doesn't make as much sense to me in 2002 as it might have made to people half a century ago, when religious fundamentalism seemed to be dying and the liberal optimism of the 19th and early 20th century had not yet been completely crushed by crime at home and totalitarianism abroad.  So to me, Kaplan's theory is more a period piece than a persuasive argument.	2002-02-05

Marshall is a bit more critical of New Urbanism than I: he asserts that pedestrian friendly new suburbs (like Celebration in Florida and Kentlands in Maryland) are basically garden variety auto-oriented suburbs because they have no job base and minimal transit linkage to nearby large cities.  He has a point -- but on the other hand, such places do serve a useful function in showing that new development doesn't have to look just like conventional suburban development.	2002-01-24

For example, today's readers may be a bit baffled by Abraham's occasional attempts to pass off Sarah as his sister.  But Sarna explains that in the ancient Mideast women had the status of a &quot;sister-wife&quot;, superior to other wives.  Similarly, Sarna clarifies the Tower of Babel story, explaining how the Torah makes fun of paganism.  Reading Sarna won't necessarily change your mind about large theological questions; believers will remain believers after reading him, and unbelievers will remain unbelievers.

But having said that, this book is worth reading, both in its description of the Catholic Church's history of anti-Semitism and in its fairmindedness in praising the Church's lapses into sanity (which, if anything, were more common than I had thought before reading the book).  I was also intrigued by Carroll's discussion of Christianity's emphasis on Jesus's gory death, and how that might have warped medieval Christianity.	2002-01-24

But this book explains (with quantitative analysis from numerous regions) that sprawl, like the French Revolution, devours its own children: that older suburbs decline as newer suburbs suck away their elites.  That fact is of course common knowledge in the Rust Belt.  But Lucy and Phillips add another level of detail, explaining how some places have survived the rising tide of sprawl while others go into meltdown.  Suburbs (and city neighborhoods) with historic housing and pedestrian-friendly features have often managed to keep up with the rest of their metro areas, while typical 1950s suburbs are the biggest losers from sprawl because they are stuck with the worst of both worlds: their housing is too small for 21st century tastes, yet they lack the urban amenities that lead to gentrification.	2002-01-24

If you are going to read one book about Atlanta, read Keating's. Keating explains how business worked with the African-American elite to shape Atlanta, and generally is quite critical of the results.  My only quibble: as the editorial reviews indicate, Keating is not happy about how Atlanta turned out.  I wish he had explained whether he thinks a less pro-business city government would have achieved better results.  Certainly, demographically similar cities with more populist, anti-business leaders (such as Marion Barry's Washington) do not have superior public service or less middle-class flight than Atlanta.	2002-01-24

I suspect that Osama bin Laden's plans are very similar to those of the author of this book: disrupt daily life, undermine confidence in the government, kill a few million people, then pick up the pieces and kill everyone else as the country dissolves...  So I think it is important for Americans to read this just as 50 years ago we should have read \\"Mein Kampf.\\"<br />A smaller point: this book implicitly rebuts the Holocaust deniers.  For decades, white supremacists have been claiming that the Holocaust never occurred.  But Pierce (or \\"MacDonald\\" as he calls himself) makes it clear that his problem with Hitler was that the Holocaust didn't go far enough, and that white supremacists really DO want to exterminate Jews, blacks and a lot of other people.<br />Otherwise, I pretty much share the sentiments of other reviewers: I found this book to be evil, terrifying, and fascinating, especially since a pretty large chunk of my family died in the Nazi Holocaust...  I wasn't sure whether to give this book 1 star (because it is so evil) or 5 stars (because it is so important to read) so I split the difference.	2001-10-17

The only reason I don't give this book 5 stars is that a few of Rabbi Telushkin's snippets (no more than half a dozen) skate onto broader issues of social policy that he is not quite an expert in.  For example, he complains that in America every accident becomes a lawsuit -- yet in fact American law generally provides no damages at all for accident victims unless (a) the defendant is negligent or (b) a defective product or unusually hazardous activity (such as blasting) is involved.  (My impression, based on Rabbi Telushkin's writings, is that Jewish law is actually MORE pro-plaintiff in this regard).  And the question of giving to panhandlers involves difficult issues where, as in most of America, the affluent part of the population can avoid the problem by moving to suburbs.  (Telushkin is 100% pro giving to panhandlers; I am on the fence).  But these are minor quibbles: I still recommend this book to . . . well, to all human beings.	2001-09-30

When the average layman thinks of the fall of the Roman Empire, he (or she) thinks of the Rome of the early Caesars: a libertarian, libertine kind of place, full of fun and debauchery.  But Grant convincingly shows that late Rome suffered not from decadence but from puritanism, not from too much liberty but from crushing taxes.  Late Rome was more like Soviet Russia than like America today: a place suffering from too much government in every sphere of life, from Christian intolerance ...to bureaucratic overregulation of the economy.

The problem is this: Grant had abundant source material for his Roman books, so he can give a seemingly accurate description of imperial Rome.  But for most of Israel's history up to about 100 BC or so, there is almost no source material other than the Bible.  Thus, you can't even try to interpret Hebrew history before 100 without intelligently explaining your view on the truth (or lack of same) of the Hebrew Bible (or as Christians call it, the Old Testament).  So to intelligently discuss what might have happened, you have to show some understanding of the theological issue -- and Grant, being a historian and not a theologian, doesn't even try to do so.  Unfortunately, Grant just assumes the truth of one view (the &quot;Documentary Hypothesis&quot; -- i.e., that the Bible was written by a wide variety of people rather than being transmitted by God to Moses and the prophets) rather than arguing the point, so his interpretations are useless to anyone but hardened secularists.  I gave this book two stars instead of one only because Grant does have some interesting tidbits about various minor points (e.g. minor similarities between early Judaism and paganism).	2001-07-15

Because this book took me only an hour or two to read, it is perfect if you don't want to invest a ton of time on this topic. Kaplan and several other contributors attack Christianity's claim that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, not just by criticizing Christians' interpretations of the Hebrew Bible and pointing out the blood-stained record of Christianity, but also by suggesting (in one essay based on Kaplan's reading of the New Testament) that Jesus wasn't even a very nice man.  I am not knowledgeable enough about these matters to fully evaluate the arguments here; all I can say is that to someone who (a) is predisposed to agree and (b) hasn't read much on the subject, that it seemed fairly persuasive.  One fault that I was able to identify: the proofreading and cite-checking for this book was terrible.  At least three times, the authors quote a passage of the New Testament that is totally irrelevant to the proposition they quote it for.  A general note: I would love to see how Christians react to this book, and what flaws (if any) they see that I didn't catch.	2001-06-18

Neusner begins by discussing how Talmudic Judaism arose; he suggests that Talmudic Judaism's emphasis on the Messiah and on the divine transmission of the Oral Torah (i.e. rabbinic tradition beyond the Hebrew Bible) arose as a response to the challenge of Christianity, because these issues were not heavily emphasized in the Mishnah and other works that preceded Christianity's installation as the state religion of the Roman Empire.  He then discusses how rabbinic Judaism was replaced by modern Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Judaism.  (Although Neusner appears to be most sympathetic towards the former, he is quite respectful of all three perspectives).  Neusner explains that all three differ from pre-19th century Judaism in that they address how one can be a citizen of a secular society and a religious Jew as well.  He then discusses secular Jewish movements such as Zionism.  The only thing that troubled me was his complaint near the end that Judaism is too ossified to develop any new &quot;systems&quot;.  It seems to me that the systems he discusses were responses to major crises (e.g. the rise of Christianity, European anti-Semitism).  The only such crisis in this century, the Holocaust, was arguably part of the anti-Semitism addressed by the 19th-century ideology of Zionism.  But after the Holocaust, there have been no comparable crises, so why should there be any major new religious movements?  We should be thankful that we have gone a few decades without any system-creating calamities.<br />Neusner is sometimes quite eloquent.  My favorite quote: &quot;the Jews are a people that never could find a home in the twentieth century.  That, in the aspect of eternity, may prove the highest tribute God will pay to those whom God among humanity first chose.&quot;	2001-06-17

Like a magazine article, it is thankfully a quick read; I finished reading it in five or six hours (about as much as it deserves).<br />On balance, I didn't react as violently (either pro or con) as some other reviewers did.  Generally, the stories were mildly interesting.  I think Friedman tries to be fair-minded, though there are a couple of biases that I think don't make sense outside the nation's most Jewish cities.  Perhaps because he lives in NYC (the nation's most Jewish city), he overestimates the severity of Orthodox/non-Orthodox infighting; for example, he focuses on a bitter Orthodox vs. non-Orthodox zoning dispute in a Cleveland suburb which I subject is almost unprecedented outside the biggest cities, for the simple reason that very few places outside NYC are 80% Jewish (as the suburb in question was).  Also, he has weirdly pessimistic about modern Orthodoxy, virtually predicting its extinction (perhaps because of NYC's huge Hasidic population).  In Atlanta, where I live, modern Orthodoxy seems to be on the proverbial move, other forms of Orthodoxy are barely noticeable to anyone outside the Orthodox community (except for Chabad, which seems to get on OK with everyone) and the various types of Jews go about their business and don't bother each other.	2001-06-10

If the most entertaining and interesting portions of this book had been boiled down into a magazine article, it would have been a cute, amusing 15 minute read.  A few of the stories I liked--her antecdotes about the mikveh gave me a better feel for what that ritual was all about, and I think I understand the Jew/Buddhist relationship a bit better than I did a few days ago.  But I'm not sure it should have been turned into a full book, and she padded it out with bits of silly whining (in the &quot;why won't the rabbi help me marry a gentile&quot; vein) and stories of utterly icky behavior (misc. tattoos, including the very last story).

One caveat: the last 100-200 pages (which focus on the Holocaust and Israel) are essentially a description of Jewish history rather than Jewish ideas, so I thought they belonged in another book.

I especially recommend David Oedel's essay on Macon, where after desegregation the city wrecked its small bus system by investing heavily in suburban areas without bus service.  The result: in a city where 14% of the households (mostly African-Americans) don't have cars, bus service stops running at 6ish.

The basic point of view of this book is: nothing in the Bible is conclusively disproven by modern archaeology.  Therefore, it is more or less true. (Or as one Conservative rabbi I know stated: &quot;the Torah is truth but not precision.&quot;)<br />Sheler's point of view is closer to middle-of-the-road Christianity than to either secularism or fundamentalism (though a look at other reviews suggests he gets more flak from the fundamentalist end of the spectrum--perhaps because atheists really can't be bothered with reading this kind of book).<br />Sheler explains (or maybe I should say &quot;asserts&quot;; I don't have the knowledge to firmly agree or disagree with him) that the Christian Bible has plenty of inconsistencies (though he misses a few--for example, one of the Gospels has a lot more generations between Jesus and David than another), that some of the Gospels were written by people who were a generation or two removed from Christ, and that today's commonly accepted Jewish Bible differs both from the Dead Sea Scrolls and from other earlier versions--facts which would appear to create a lot of difficulty for people who treat every word in the Bible as true.<br />On the other hand, Sheler asserts that these inconsistencies don't rule out the major themes of the Bible: the relevation at Sinai for the Hebrew Bible (aka Old Testament), the Virgin Birth for the Christian Bible (aka New Testament).  In fact, he defends the latter, arguing that the Virgin Birth is such a weird story that it couldn't possibly be invented (ironically, pretty similar to a Orthodox Jewish argument for the Relevation at Sinai).<br />Sheler understandably avoids the differences between Judaism and Christianity; for example, he doesn't discuss the fact that several portions of the Torah urge Jews to keep commandments &quot;forever&quot; which would seem to pretty much rule out Christianity.	2001-04-15

But it is not a book for people just beginning to learn about Judaism (unless they happen to have a Ph.D in philosophy).  The allusions (to other thinkers), the concepts, and even the vocabulary were often over my head and are probably over the head of most people who do not have an enormous background in philosophical matters.  I learned something from it, but not as much as a more learned person would.	2001-04-15

One weakness I saw that Ryan didn't: a very weak understanding of Christianity (and I say this as someone who is pretty ignorant on the subject myself).  Kellemen notices numerous inconsistencies in the New Testament, and resolves to ask some Christians to explain them away.  So far, so good.  But he asks Catholics to explain those inconsistencies, and the Catholics are only too happy to agree with him that yes, the New Testament as written is wrong on some details.  What's wrong with this?  What's wrong is that if you want a defense of Biblical inerrancy, you don't ask Catholics (any more than you would ask Reform Jews to defend the proposition that the Torah is literally the word of God).  Instead, you ask the Christians who really do believe that the New Testament is inerrant: fundamentalists and Baptists (the Christian equivalent of Orthodox Jews, in the sense that they take the Biblical text more seriously than other Christians).  If Kellemen had gotten such people to agree that, yes, the New Testament is wrong on a few points, I would have been more impressed.	2001-03-12

So if you just have a few minutes to check something in the Torah or want to give this week's Torah portion a quick skim, and so you want a Chumash (i.e. Jewish-oriented Five Books of Moses) that doesn't have a lot of commentary, this is a good choice.

So I don't consider this the ideal choice for extended study.	2001-02-18

Not nearly as much analysis as reporting, and not as much discussion of Atlanta's failures (e.g. why do Atlantans drive 34 miles a day?

Rusk shows why community development doesn't work, and also shows why most cities (other than a few immigration hubs like NYC and Sun Belt cities with unlimited annexation powers) simply can't compete with their suburbs without outside help (or at least without a termination of outside hostility, such as highway spending that drags development ever further into the suburbs): if a city has no tax base and poor people who make public services more expensive, it can't compete with the suburbs, efficiency or no efficiency.  Like Cities without Suburbs (also by Rusk), this is a masterpiece.	2001-01-24

After reading this book, I know the answer.  The answer is: there's no consensus.  Certainly Jews don't have the precise picture of Heaven and Hell that some fundamentalists have.  There is (outside the leftward fringes of Reform Judaism) a consensus that there is some sort of afterlife -- but no consensus (even within Orthodox, Conservative or Reform as far as I could tell) as to what that afterlife looks like, except for some vague notion of some sort of reward and punishment in the world to come.	2001-01-24

But I wish Freilich had been a little less optimistic, and focused more on how inadequate such steps sometimes are. For example, Portland and Minneapolis both have variations on urban growth boundaries, and Freilich praises the Minneapolis program.  However, the Minneapolis program has basically been a failure: the Twin Cities keep losing people because the growth boundary includes far more land than the Portland version.  Also, I would have emphasized that sprawl is a result not only of land use but of highway and education policy.	2001-01-24

Women generally want good providers, and Jews are no exceptions.

And it also shows that the status quo isn't just a natural result of the market -- that government &quot;urban renewal&quot; drove blacks out of older neighborhoods into those Jewish neighborhoods, thus spurring Jewish flight.

Buffalo's downtown is a classic example: the Chippewa St. area (dominated by half a dozen little bars and coffeehouses) is relatively vibrant, while the areas near the convention center and stadium are dead, dead, dead.  Similarly, in Cleveland the Warehouse District/Flats area (dominated by small, walkable businesses) are year-round destinations, while the areas surrounding the much-touted stadia and Rock Hall of Fame are utterly deserted after dark except on game days.<br />In response to the reviewer from N.H. who said Jacobs vindicates conservatism: I don't completely agree.  Jacobs' work criticizes liberal reliance on big government housing/urban renewal projects, but is equally critical of big government highway projects that a lot of conservatives seem to like.	2001-01-17

The book is full of interesting little tidbits: for example, &quot;Mose&quot; (meaning &quot;son&quot; or &quot;one who is born&quot; in Egyptian) was commonly a part of ancient Egyptian names, and kings had names like &quot;Thut-mose&quot; (so it makes sense that the egyptians would name a baby &quot;Moses&quot; or some variant thereof).  Basically a work of history rather than theology--that is, it doesn't really purport to address the big questions of who wrote Exodus, etc.  Rather, it shows readers how Exodus made sense to ancient readers familiar with heathen customs.	2001-01-16

(The person who wrote that  they want us all to live in &quot;cramped city neighborhoods&quot; must  have been reading a different book than I read).<br />2) the most common  argument for the status quo is that it is &quot;what people want&quot; and  &quot;what the market wants.&quot;  Duany et. al. show that the status quo  is the result not of too little government, but of too much government  (though some of their remedies are a tiny bit statist for my taste).

For  example, Lerner tries to make sense of Abraham's almost-sacrifice of Isaac  by suggesting that when Abraham heard the voice of God telling him to  sacrifice Isaac, he was merely experiencing a delusion -- but when he  stopped, THAT was the voice of God.  Lerner's discussion of Jewish holidays  is eloquent.<br />When it comes to politics and history (even religious  history) Lerner is on shakier ground, and wrote some things that gave me  pause.  To name a few:<br />1.  Lerner's criticism of Rabbinic Judaism on  issues like homosexuality doesn't fully grapple with the views of his  intellectual adversaries.  Lerner reasons: The rabbinic authorities changed  the plain meaning of the written Torah all the time, therefore we can do  the same today when we deem it ethically appropriate.<br />What Lerner should  be aware of is that some Orthodox Jews think that the rabbinic authorities  themselves spoke with divine authority, because they were repeating an oral  tradition (&quot;the Oral Torah&quot;) which itself (due to a divine  miracle) was passed down unchanged from Mt. Sinai.  It follows that if you  believe the Oral Torah doctrine, the Jewish position on homosexuality and a  whole lot of other things must be written in stone--- or in other words, if  its in the Mishnah and the Talmud (the leading documents of pre-medieval  rabbinic Judaism), God said it.<br />I don't expect Lerner to endorse the Oral  Torah doctrine--but he should explain to his readers why he rejects it,  rather than just pretending it doesn't exist.<br />2.  His discussion of the  Holocaust is tainted by his deemphasis on history.  He talks a lot about  how capitalism and the lack of meaning in Germans' lives created  Hitler--but somehow he overlooks the two most immediate causes, the  Depression and the Versailles Treaty.  Talking about the rise of Hitler  without talking about the Depression and Versailles is like talking about  the American Revolution without mentioning George III and the Stamp  Act.<br />3.  Perhaps because he thought he was writing to an audience of the  leftwardmost 1% of American Jews, Lerner has not come to grips with the  collapse of Communism and Socialism.  He admits that Communism did not  quite work out early in the book, but then he repeatedly refers to Marxism  as somehow a liberation movement (I wonder how high the death toll has to  rise for Lerner to reconsider).  But worst of all, he refers to Mao, the  biggest butcher of them all, &quot;liberating&quot; areas from  &quot;feudalism.&quot;  The idea of Mao liberating anything is just plain  morally obscene.  One might as well refer to Hitler liberating the Germans  (say, from the Treaty of Versailles, which was about as popular with  ordinary Germans as feudalism).<br />This nutsiness arises out of his  hostility to capitalism.  Without much discussion, he routinely equates  capitalism with oppression, and he seems to think some form of global  socialism is necessary to avoid ecological catastrophe.  He doesn't really  argue these points intelligently; my sense is he just kind of assumes them.<br />To sum up: Lerner's book was certainly worth reading, but it would have  been much better had he run it by people whose views were not too close to  his--maybe one who is religiously far to his right and another who is  politically far to his right., the  Depression and the Versailles Treaty.  Talking about the rise of Hitler  without talking about the Depression and Versailles is like talking about  the American Revolution without mentioning George III and the Stamp  Act.<br />3.

Nivola does a good job of this: he lists not only the usual suspects like highways, but also the American tax system  (which encourages consumption at the expense of work and saving, and thus  encourages heavy consumption of gasoline and thus driving, while European  systems tax consumption more heavily) and unfunded mandates that burden  city governments and thus degrade city services.<br />But Nivola is  completely clueless as to why sprawl matters, or why we should care.  The  only anti-sprawl argument he seems to believe is that it contributes to  global warming, probably one of the weaker anti-sprawl arguments (given the  scientific uncertainties about (a) how much global warming exists, (b) how  much global warming has to do with human-generated air pollution, (c) how  much of that pollution is related to driving, and (d) how much of that  driving is related to sprawl).  Nivola barely addresses the social justice  issues surrounding sprawl: he virtually ignores the strongest anti-sprawl  argument, the toll taken on the carless poor and disabled.<br />In fact,  Nivola even defends the social injustices wrought by sprawl, arguing that  municipalities have a right to exclude the poor (even though only Congress  has the power to exclude immigrants).  He inexplicably quotes Plato to  support his view that rich and poor should be segregated into separate  cities, even though Plato actually criticized great inequalities of wealth.	2000-05-25

Judge Posner explains the extent to which Cardozo stood head and shoulders above other jurists in notoriety,  speculates why this is so, shows why Cardozo's reputation as a Supreme  Court justice is dimmer than his reputation as a state judge, and dissects  Cardozo's opinions.  I thought that his discussion of Cardozo's literary  style was especially masterful, as was his explanation of Cardozo's  advantages in obtaining a great reputation.<br />The only part of the book I  found lacking was Posner's discussion of individual cases, which was a bit  less exciting than the rest of the book.  Before reading the book I was not  convinced that the infarmous Palsgraf case deserved its notoriety-- and I  still don't get the Palsgraf mystique that seems to entrance so many other  law professors and lawyers.	2000-04-18

Even Jews sometimes  discriminated against Jews: for example, Jewish-owned brokerage firms might  limit opportunities for Jewish customers.<br />The book is as amusing as it is  horrifying: one of the amusing stories, for example, is of a Jew named  Louis Goldstein who sought to Anglicize his name.  Unfortunately for him,  his petition for a name change came up before -- Judge Louis Goldstein.  (The petition was denied).	2000-03-28

I have been reading the Almanac since I was 13 years old (the 1976 version).<br />However, it is VERY biased in favor of the conservative conventional  wisdom of the day--not so much on the big issues like abortion (where any  intelligent person is fairly well versed on both sides of the issue) but on  the obscure issues where it takes a lot of research to learn both sides of  the argument.<br />One example is the author's treatment of Portland and its  approach to suburban sprawl (p. 1340-41), the sort of issue where it takes  a lot of work to dig up both sides of the issue.  The authors recite a lot  of rubbish about how Portland's policies &quot;guarantee greater traffic  congestion&quot; (a matter of opinion) and &quot;Income disparities are  already growing&quot; (a nationwide trend of course).  What happened?  They  probably read an article in Reason or another environmentalist-bashing  magazine, and lifted it into their book without hearing the other side  of  the argument.	2000-02-28

And if the only thing I knew about this subject was the heart rending examples he digs up, I would believe it.<br />But  Kozol's examples are only a small slice of American reality.  For every  urban school system outspent by its suburban peers, there is another that  does not.  The most extreme example is the Kansas City, Missouri system  which due to a school desegregation order spends twice as much per pupil as  any other Missouri school, with results that have not significantly  improved since the spending spree began.  And nationally, the average urban  school spends about as much per pupil as other schools.  Because Kozol  mostly ignores these facts, his selective description of the most  underfunded schools is misleading.<br />A good book could be written about  American urban schools, but this ain't it.	2000-02-28

I would have liked more footnotes, more elaboration of  key points (e.g. why government-run schools do so badly in urban areas)A.	2000-02-28

I also recommend it as a source guide, because it cites a lot of sources on both sides of the issue.<br />It does have some imperfections: it is very focused on environmental issues, so I wouldn't  pretend that it is the definitive guide on other sprawl related problems  (e.g. social justice issues), though it does address such issues to some  extent.  Also, I think it is a bit more biased towards &quot;big  government&quot; solutions to sprawl than I would be if I were writing a  book on the subject.  But by and large, I recommend it.	2000-02-28

So if you are moving there or for any other reason want a sense of the city's recent history, please, please,  please read this book!<br />It paints a picture of the paradise lost that was  Buffalo in 1950, and shows a bit about how the city reached its current low  level.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it hasn't been  updated!  (Also, the author's judgment of Buffalo's school desregegation  adventure is more favorable than mine would have been, but nevertheless he  is reasonably fair).	2000-02-28

However, this book can tell you a lot about Al Gore even if it doesn't tell you much about global warming. To name a few examples:<br />*Al Gore is NOT the extremist that he was as in the lastelection. Most of his seemingly controversial statements (e.g. about environmental protection being \\"a central organizing principle\\") make sense in context. Gore consistenly emphasizes his support of the Cold War and of the market economy.<br />*Al Gore (or his ghostwriter) IS a pompous pseudo-intellectual. This book was filled with vague, back to nature gibberish about dysfunctional civilizations, oneness with nature, and other concepts with no obvious significance.	1999-06-15
