The most famous and most reliable according to Islamic \\"scholars\\" is the Bukhari collection. Every Muslim knows the quote from Mohammed, who when asked why the Koran gives the testimony of two women the weight of the testimony of one man, answers \\"Women are deficient in intellect.\\"  Mohammed created a world in which man can marry up to four \\"wives,\\" and sexually exploit any slave women the Muslim man has on hand.  Muslim men, under classical Sharia law can divorce a wife for any reason that pleases him at any time and he is authorized by God to beat his wife if necessary to obtain obedience from her.<br />A Muslim wife does not hold the same position as a Christian wife who Christ taught may not be abandoned by divorce except for adultery. Islam does NOT make sacred the pairing of one man with one woman as does Christianity.<br />This is all part of the bedrock of Islam and anyone who tells you different is not being honest. Muslims could in theory change their practice, even their theology, but they will have to invalidate writings that they themselves have held sacred for 1400 years.	2004-02-10

Just recently I took a college course in science taught by a professor who was born in Jordan and was the faculty advisor for the Muslim Student Association.  I was dismayed to find out that the MSA website contained articles arguing in favor of legalizing polygamy.  My professor was very well-spoken and well-mannered and polite but he is serious about polygamy.  Western liberals simply refuse to take Muslims at their word.  Muslims believe in gender apartheid, the inferiority of women, stoning and amputations and a whole host of medieval ideas.  They are serious about them and they are willing to spread Islam by any means necessary.  They publish this in public places on a daily basis.   <br />Ask any person of the Eastern Orthodox faith about dealing with Muslims as neighbors, ask them about the Armenian slaughter that Turkey has never admitted, ask them about the destruction of Christian churches on Cyprus occurring after the 1974 invasion of the Turks<br />In some ways, Spencer, merely collects what is publicly available and puts it all in one place.	2003-12-01

He also omits any discussion of the Koranic privilege granted to Muslim men to marry as many as four wives and to sexually exploit any slaves he may own.  Given the ease of divorce for men and the granting of nearly all post divorce rights to men, men have almost total sexual license, all approved by Islam.  Lastly, slavery is as Koranic as daily prayers.  The movement to ban slavery world wide began with Wilberforce, an English Christian.  This movement was resisted by the Muslim east which permitted legal slavery through 1968 in Saudi Arabia and 1964 in Bahrain.  Outside of Sufism, Muslim religion is one of abject and unthinking obedience to minute rulings on ordinary parts of life, clothing, hair, dress, eating and sleeping and washing customs.	2003-11-23

This is a disgrace in America.  We are keeping our best students out of our best institutions.  As Sowell forcefuly argues, this creates hostility between the races.<br />    I am currently an undergraduate at public urban university. The general student population  of 11,000 is about 25% black. Every student in my University can identify the \\"affirmative action\\" courses.  They are found in the Black Studies department, as well as the Anthropology and Political Science departments. A student need only seek out the \\"radical\\" professors, spout the party line and pass with a B or an A.  By contrast, attend the introductory physics class in my University.  Of the 70 students enrolled in one class, only 3 are black.  If enrollment were proportional, there would be about 17 to 20 black students.  Physics is known as a tough course.  Tests are objective and no one gets a break. I support the idea of increasing minority participation in the sciences, however, they have to show up for the introductory courses.  <br />     We need to provide high quality elementary education to every American child regardless of race, ethnicity ...

These courses, of course, refer to socialism and communisim. <BR>    The latest intellectual affectation is to condemn criticisms of Islam as culturally biased. Pim Fortuyn was labled a rascist for trying to warn the West that Islamic immigrants bring with them misogyny, homophobia and intolerance.  Islam, like socialism, has failed as a political system wherever it has been tried.  Anyone with an education is desperate to escape it in Iran, Bangladesh and similar venues. The Islamic radicals are well in place in the American University system and those questioning the Palestinian methods of advancing their \\"cause.\\" are met with virulent attack as racists.  <BR>     A Muslim student web site supported by my University attacks the Christian view of monogamy as \\"hypocritical\\" and argues for polygamy.

From time to time the soldier slaves revolted and such revolts were put down brutally.  Male slaves were routinely castrated and the children of female slaves were taken from them.  The  slavery system covered most of North Africa, the Middle East, Iran and parts of India under Islamic control.  Due to the Koranic blessing, SAudi Arabis did not outlaw slavery until 1964, nor did Kuwait until 1968.

This slave trade began centuries before the Atlantic trade and continued for centuries after.  Islamic scripture fully embraces the institution of human slavery.

The authors chose a system of circuit diagram conventions that were not clearly explained giving rise to much frustration.  My husband is a graduate electrical engineer and he thought it was too advanced for an introductory text.  I survived the course by buying several other texts on microelectronics and learning from them.  This is a desperate act for a student, I was willing to spend about $200 to get past this text.  It is the worst text that I have ever been forced to use.	2001-01-02

The explanation of electric potential energy, potential difference and voltage was tortured, convoluated and nearly unintelligible.  Our instructor  mercifully supplied his own summary of the topic.  Also miserable, was the  book's presentation of the magnetic torque on a current loop.  The diagrams  were so confusing, I had to throw up my hands. Lastly, but definitely not  the least infuriating, was Serway's use of a term in the middle of the text  without a previous definition or explanation.  He does this with  &quot;focal length&quot; in his section on geometric optics.  I had to buy  alternative physics texts, at some expense, just to get through the  semesters.  Thank goodness the courses, otherwise, interesting and useful,  are over.	2000-05-07
