Bush, An Inside Account	Books	1	24	40	N	N	Bush is the wrong man	and the worst president within living memory.    he took the nation into an unnecessary war with Iraq.  National Intelligence Estimates tell us that this war has only made America less safe because it serves to recruit and train jihadists    his fiscal policies benefit the wealthiest two percent while they balloon the national debt.    he has curtailed environmental protections of air and water.    he favors big business and especially big oil at the expense of the working and middle class, who have to pay interest on his bloated deficit.    he cloaks his sinister agenda under a smarmy, self-congratulatory facade of religion that has nothing to do with the Jesus of the bible.      He did not protect us from 9/11 even though he was briefed that bin Laden intended to attack the US.  The incompetence of John Ashcroft as attorney general reflects the poor judgment of Bush who appointed him.    Bush is the right man to prove the adage that you can fool some of the people all the time.    A useful corrective to this book is Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis by Jimmy Carter.

Rumsfeld and Bush both ignored General Eric Shinseki's prediction that the occupation would require 400,000 men  because many Iraqis would continue to resist.  Shinseki, a Viet Nam vet who left part of his body there, knew low intensity war close up and personal.  Rumsfeld and Bush know Washington  politics.<br /><br />The book, moreover, never acknowledges that the war was unnecessary to begin with.  Even Bush once admitted in a rare moment of candor that there was no connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11;  and National Intelligence Estimates confirm what many experienced generals, admirals and intelligence analysts predicted:  that the US presence in Iraq serves only to recruit and train jihadists.<br /><br />Rumsfeld notoriously provided no occupation plan for Iraq, despite experienced military men's advice.  The consequences of our failed occupation are visible every day on the news.  Rummy has offered his resignation twice, but the incompetent-in-chief Bush hasn't had the good sense to accept it.  No surprise there.<br /><br />We know now that Rumsfeld refused to admit an insurgency was occurring even when it had gone on for over a year.  He told a news conference he rejected the term \\"insurgency.\\"  Rumsfeld felt he must deny events that developed in Iraq that were contrary to his plans and expectations.<br /><br />Another instance of DoD incompetence is reported on 9 June 06 in the Kansas City Star.  The troops in Iraq are not issued sufficient blood coagulants, so that some medics purchase with their own money supplies through civilian channels.  The reason for inadequate issue of coagulants: budgetary.  Rumsfeld is incompetent, but the incompetence also goes to the very top.  Bush'sinsistence on tax cuts for the rich at all costs includes costing our soldiers' lives.<br /><br />A necessary counterweight to this book's cheer leading for Rumsfeld and other incompetents in the administration is Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq by Thomas Ricks. Ralph Peters, Lt Col USA (ret), Wars of Blood and Faith: The Conflicts That Will Shape the 21st Century has a useful article on Rumsfeld that supports my review.	2005-09-11

Real Christians do not    bear false witness by repeatedly lying to the nation that the war in Iraq has somehow made America safer when the 9/11 Commission showed no link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11, something Bush once admitted in a rare moment of candor.    favor the rich over the poor; re Bush's tax cuts that are primarily targeted at the wealthiest 2%, i.e., those who need them least. See the parable of Lazarus and Dives (in some translations, Dives, Latin for rich man, is so translated), what Luke says about attempting to serve both God and money, and Jesus' remark about rich men and camels.           Not surprisingly, Bush's energy bill also rewards rich companies:  energy companies are among the most profitable in the  US. But Bush's principles (i.e., his love of the rich) compel him and like-minded Republicans to include billions of dollars in subsidies to them.      take actions to degrade the quality of air and water; God has made us stewards of the earth. It is our job to take care of nature and in so doing take care of ourselves. Even non-Christians should be able to see that.       make a show out of being religious. Jesus has a word for such people: hypocrites.    Selfishness, lying, failed stewardship, hypocrisy, and greed play no part in bible-based Christianity. They play a big part in Bush's political and personal life.    By their fruits you shall know them.

So one wonders how it is that humanities depts are so well-supplied with political liberals, given that we cannot openly recruit them.  Could it be that people drawn to the humanities are more likely to be liberals rather than right-wing or authoritarian?    The political right in our time are apt to be      opposed to science, and thus to rational inquiry (re the hubbub over evolution, which many right-wingers propose to replace with creationism, now relabeled intelligent design and the refusal of some conservatives to accept the science that proves global warming is happening fast.)      Republican disdain for sexual education in schools results in a far greater rate of teen pregnancies and teen abortions than in countries where contraception is taught. Many in the GOP who oppose abortion also oppose sex education; they prefer not to see that sex education, which they oppose, leads to a much lower rate of abortions, which they also oppose. Seeing correlations that work against their ideology is beyond many conservatives.     opposed to individual choice (re the abortion debate)      favor the rich over the middle class and the poor (re Bush's tax policies)      favor credulity over skeptical inquiry (witness the right's wholesale acceptance of Bush's frequent prevarication that the war in Iraq somehow makes this nation safer.  And this despite the 9/11 Commission's finding that  no connection exists between Saddam Hussein and 9/11, as well as National Intelligence Estimates that show that the war serves to recruit and train jihadists).    Small wonder that those who choose the humanities are not apt to be  Republicans.	2005-08-03

For example, instead of writing the obvious fact that maps were important to the Raj, the reader finds this:  \\"Within that archive, the map occupies a position of privilege.\\"    A few paragraphs later, the reader learns that Kim's becoming a British intelligence agent somehow erases Kim's identity as the little friend of all the world.  Kim is then resurrected as \\"the zombielike R17.\\"  Nothing can be further from the actual depiction of Kim in the novel.   Kim's identity as a British agent remains as vivid as it was before he takes service with the  Raj and his devotion to the lama as intense.  And even at the book's opening Kim unwittingly enforces British dominance in bullying an Indian child.	2005-07-11

Don't expect to find any mention that some of the founding fathers were Deists rather than Christians, for example. Deists believe in God, and respect Jesus as a prophet, but have no interest in him as savior. Franklin and Jefferson are the best known Deists. Jefferson did an edition of the gospels from which he subtracted all miracles because reasonable people in his view know that miracles do not occur.     The authors even argue that the Puritans practiced religious tolerance in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, ignoring the evidence for the systematic persecution of Quakers, who were, at various times during the Puritan regime, fined, jailed, exiled, or executed.  There was no freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, or freedom of religion in the Mass Bay Colony of the Puritans.  But you won't learn that here.    Nor can you expect to find in this book any criticism of the  pro-business agenda of many conservatives.  The authors even suggest that corporations are an unmixed blessing because of the goods and services they provide, and the salaries they pay.  Only a complete pollyanna could believe that.  One would think the authors are completely unaware of the fact that toxic waste sites are a serious problem in many parts of the United States and that the Bush administration has eased controls of air and water pollution.  And don't expect any mention of the arrogance and greed that destroyed the jobs and pensions of Enron employees, to take only one example of corporate malfeasance in recent years.    Some of what is found within the book is true:  Ronald Reagan did aggressively cut taxes, for example, while at the same time increasing defense spending.  Sadly, Mr. Reagan was either so confused or so mendacious that he claimed he would at the same time balance the budget. What the authors neglect to mention is that in so doing, Reaganomics doubled the national debt within eight years ofhis taking office.  His successor, George Bush, continued what he earlier had rightly called voodoo economics--so that by the end of his four years the national debt stood at three times what it had been when Reagan took office.  Instead of these facts, so inconvenient to conservative ideologues, this book wrongly  asserts that  the Laffer curve proved that cutting taxes can raise tax revenues.  Of course the Laffer curve proves  nothing of the kind:  the Laffer curve is a hypothesis that was not borne out by what actually happened between 1980 and 1992.    Lowering taxes ballooned the national deficit. And W Bush continues the folly of Reagan, in fact surpassing Reagan by lowering taxes when the nation is at war. No previous president  had the stupidity to do that.  The rich typically don't send their children to fight; and thanks to Bush they send much less of their money to support his adventure in Iraq.  Like Reagan, W Bush talks about decreasing the national debt while implementing fiscal policies that balloon it.    Before the 2004 election, Dick Cheney asserted that Reagan proved that deficits don't matter---showing once again that for many, conservative no longer means fiscal conservative, nor has it since 1980.    Don't expect to find anything in this book about how the gap between the incomes of rich and poor has seriously widened in the Reagan and W Bush years.  And the percentage of poor Americans has seriously imcreased.  This data is available to readers of the national weekly news magazines or even readers of USA Today---but not to readers of this book.    Not surprisingly, W Bush's  unnecessary war with Iraq is not discredited by exposing his lies about WMDs or his frequently expressed prevarication that this war has somehow made America safer, despite the 9/11 Commission's showing that there was no link between Saddam Hussein and  Sept. 11. Nor does the book discuss the National Intelligence Estimates that show that the US occupation of Iraq servesto recruit and train jihadists, thus decreasing national security.  This is a book that some conservatives will love; other conservatives will be embarrassed by its omissions, distortions, and prevarications.  This is a book for conservatives who prefer to turn their faces from the facts, relying instead on conservative faith which depends only on the evidence of things not seen.	2005-05-30

For example, 58,000 British troops did not die on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, 1 July 1916.  There were about 58,000 British casualties, of whom about 19,000 died. <br />Also, the US Navy did not lead the Army in integration.  In fact, the Army commissioned black officers  well before World War Two, while the Navy commissioned its first black officers in the 1950s.

US	39016128	RIFZMEG6K9ZCR	0451212428	149098667	Tolkien: a Biography	Books	1	12	12	N	N	Michael White's misunderstandings	White frequently attempts to make vivid and interesting things he knows nothing about.  Thus, he describes Tolkien's grueling introductory training in the British army and the intense preparatory training for trench warfare at Etaples as \\"idle time.\\"  He also writes that at Etaples, soldiers had little to worry about aside from mines and snipers.  In fact, Etaples was so far from the front that neither of these endangered the troops there.  White, moreover, describes soldiers greasing their bayonets as they moved in trains toward the fighting.  In fact, the bayonets were oiled.  Some reading of the standard British Great War memoirs by Sassoon and Graves, who served in the trenches, would have kept White from his egregious mistakes.  A useful corrective to White is John Garth, Tolkien and the Great War.<br /><br />See the amazon.canada reviews for further exposure of White's many errors.	2004-01-14
