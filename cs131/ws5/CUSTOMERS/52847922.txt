I'm a 30 year old guy originially from New York City and now in California.  I know nothing about the south, or about the morays of life in a small town, or about the civil rights struggles.  This book does a fabulous job of making me feel like I lived in a small southern town, despite that background.  I felt that I understood the tensions between classes, between races, and the long-standing relationships that permeate small town life.  In that way, the book was ingenious.  I felt that I knew the characters intimately, and could understand what they were thinking and saying.  That's quite a feat, to make a NYC guy feel at home in a small town in Mississippi.  Kudos to the author for that.<br />But.  BUT.  Mixed in with the wonderful language and snapshots of southern life were these - I think - over the top and ineffective attempts at surreal, &quot;out there&quot; moments.  Talking vultures.  Visions of the future in a raindrop sitting on someone's coat.  Talking, thinking parrots who play an active role in the town's life.  It was just too much for me - it felt like a gifted writer was trying very hard to be creative, and inventive, and &quot;on the edge&quot; - but in my view it just took away from the effectiveness and strength of the book's other features.  Don't have a talking vulture speak to me - have one of the wonderful characters do so.  I just can't take this surreal stuff seriously.<br />This book, in general, tells the story of a small town in the heart of Mississippi which is visited by a black kid from Chicago.  Probably because he doesn't understand what his role was supposed to be in a small Miss. town at that time, he whistles at a white woman and is as a result brutally murdered.  This horrible, real event is the anchor - but not the main focus - of this book.  If you ask me, the real focus was on the lives of the people who live in the town.<br />My favorite part of the book - and one I urge you to savor - is the interaction between auntie and uncle, and the scene with uncle at the trial.  These were the two &quot;real&quot; people in the book who really geot to me.  Real, every day love and fear and triumph and adversity.<br />Honestly, unless you like weird stuff - like your plot being told to you by a flying, talking vulture - try something else.  If you want surreal done well, try some of Louis de Bernieres earlier books.  If you want southern lit done well, try Faulkner.- is the interaction between auntie and uncle, and the scene with uncle at the trial.

Do you have one of those friends that always seems to be getting themselves into the strangest situations?  That is just a bit - off?  This book allows us to follow an oafish, irritable, hilarious, charming, clueless man as he makes his way from adventure to adventure, job to job.  Our hero, Iganacious, has an opinion about EVERYTHING - his jobs, the people he meets, his mother, his bloated body.  The normal parts of life - taking a cab, stopping for a bite to eat, shopping - are always fodder for a funny episode with Ignacious.<br />This book is charming.  It is funny.  It is easy to read.  Even though Ignacious is truly a horrible guy - everything he touches seems to lead to problems for other people - you can't help but laugh and enjoy his company.  Whether he is leading factory workers on a strike that ends in nothing more substantial than a broken flower pot, or whether he is crashing and ruining a ladies' auxiliary art show, Ignacious always seems to find the world not quite as he expects it to be.  As each new day starts, you find yourself wondering &quot;what next?&quot;  As you turn the pages, you're never sure what new funny adventure he'll lead you on.  The writing is crisp and fun, and you will immediately tumble into the twisted, convoluted, bizarre, obscene, cracked up world that Ignacious lives in.  You'll even start thinking like he does a bit if you aren't careful.<br />This book is fun - FUN! - and a quick read.  It well deserves the Pulitzer it received.  It's a hidden gem.  Catch it!	2001-09-21

First, it is the story of a heroic man's struggle to do his part to fight the evil that he knew existed in Germany during World War Two.  Second, it is a story of a boy growing into a man, imperfections and all.  Third, it is about the development of one man's soul and sense of purpose.  Finally, it is the story of Germany, of a country as it descends into an abyss.<br />The book is extremely well written.  It introduces us to an &quot;inside&quot; view of Hitler's rise to power and Germany's response to it.  We meet our hero as a boy, and watch as he grows into a man.  We follow him through school, through his search for self and meaning.  The main character is undoubtedly a hero, but not in a story-book sense.  He is - like all of us - not a perfect being.  He has trouble with relationships.  He has fear - great fear.  He has uncertainty.  But that makes his heroism all the more striking.<br />Bonhoffer is from a very wealthy, famous German family.  He is safe - had he sat back and kept quiet, there is little doubt that he would have made it through the war untouched.  Yet, he rises to the occasion. The story is fascinating in its unique perspective - this man, from this very German family, gives us a glimpse of how Germany descended into insanity.  We watch as he struggles with his own doubts, his own feelings of frustration and anger, and as he struggles with doing what is right versus fighting against his own country and government.  It is simply gripping to read.<br />The writing is clear and crisp and filled with meaning.  The story literally flows... you will find yourself unable to put the book down.  Read this book and watch and as an incredible man faces danger and fear, and rises above it.  A great read!	2001-09-14

I have always lived in big cities, but thanks to the wonderful writing by Spragg, this book made me feel like I grew up on a ranch in a small town out west!  The book takes a serious of seemingly independent short stories and weaves together a picture of one boy - one man's - growth from a child to a man.  It makes us grow with him, feel pain and joy with him, experience life with him.  By the end you feel an intricate part of this boy's life, and you long to know more about him.  We follow him as he grows up, does his chores, and learns about life.<br />Read this book- you won't regret it.	2001-08-04

This book quickly makes the reader feel a part of the characters' lives.  It quickly introduces us into the lives of a variety of seemingly unrelated people from a small town - a school teacher, a pair of lonely bachelor farmers, a scared, pregnant teen.  Even though I've always lived in large cities, I immediately felt that I understood this town, these people.  I couldn't wait to keep reading to find out what happens.  And, in the end, the stories of all these lives come together in a warm, heart-filling way.<br />This book is beautiful.  Read it.	2001-08-04

More specifically, it is about a few horrible weeks of fighting and retreating.  It is *not* a story or novel, really, but almost like an after action report.  The book contains the author's feelings and some of what he saw, but you get the distinct sense while reading this book that he wrote it as a record of what he saw and did, and as an homage to his friends who never made it out of Russia, but not as an attempt to write a story.  The author never really tries tying the events into a broader context or explaining the full experiences he had on the Eastern front; it is just a snap shot of a limited time frame, and only limited snapshots even within that time frame.<br />This book is not a blow by blow recitation of combat.  While the author is clearly involved in a number of intense fights, both before and during the period covered in the book, we never really hear about it.  It's almost as if he is trying NOT to make this a book about combat.  If there is an engagement we hear of the troops forming up for it, a sentence or two about the fight, and then more pages about the aftermath - the wounds, the dead.<br />The most insightful and remarkable aspects of this book to me are:  1) the ability of the author to show us the horrors of war; 2) the brutality on both sides; and 3) how horrible the Nazis were even to their allies.  I take each in turn.<br />1)  This book makes very clear how much human suffering war brings with it.  Through its dry, almost camera-like recitation of horror after horror (friends freezing to death in front of him, morter shells cutting people in two) we can almost imagine what it must be like to be walking through a combat zone strewn with bodies and wounded men and animals.  We also see how war turns honorable, good men into self-interested beings centered only on survival.  The author, for example, is clearly a brave, honorable, educated man and officer.  We watch as his pride in being an officer and an Italian soldier slowly gives way to self-survival.  We also watch as this man with deep loyalty to his unit and his friends gives way (as we all would, I'm sure) to self-interest.  Fascinating.<br />2)  Suffice it to say that the book makes clear how brutal all sides were in this war:  Soviets and Nazis alike commit brutal, heartless acts.<br />3)  The savagery and callousness of the Nazis towards their allies is stunning.  While paying homage to the combat skills of the Nazis, the author shows clearly how the Nazies treated the Italians serving and dying in their cause only slightly better than their hated enemy the Soviets.  For example, we read of a time when, during the retreat, the Nazis held up thousands of Italians, subjecting them to withering small arms and artillery fire from the Russians for hours, in order to clear mud off of German trucks.  We see how Nazis failed to share food, information or shelter with their &quot;allies.&quot;  We see Germans shooting at wounded Italians (their allies, remember!) who dared to try and get a ride on a German vehicle.<br />This book is somewhat dry, somewhat repetititious, but worth a read for those wanting a sense of what the winter retreat was like for an Italian soldier serving in WW2's horribly grueling East Front.xample, is clearly a brave, honorable, educated man and officer.

The book focuses on a man who is self-centered, seemingly oblivious to the pain and discomfort he causes others, and deeply flawed.  At the same time, his deep love for his daughter is moving, as is his recognition of his own weaknesses.<br />Coetzee does a wonderful job of taking us deep into the dark underbelly of South Africa.  He also helps us dissect one man - professor, father, divorcee - who lives there.  The book is a very quick read despite its heavy subject matter.  Don't read this book expecting to be uplifted.  Indeed, I'm not sure just what part of the book to feel most dispirited about - the main character's inability to improve himself, the situation his daughter finds herself in (but it's her own fault!  how could she make so many poor choices?!?!) or the state of South Africa (at least as portrayed in the novel).<br />And yet - despite my deep reservations about almost all the characters in the book (there are no good guys here, really) - I couldn't stop reading, and I felt very strongly about the characters.  There is a skill, a craft in making a reader despise a character so much.  And this makes me believe that the book has succeeded, for what more can we ask of a book than to make us feel?	2001-04-05

It takes a character of little note in the Bible - Dinah - and imagines what her life would have been like.  It is an imaginative book in a number of ways.  First, it is a great story.  It traces Dinah's life from before she was born until her death.  I got very involved in her life and was anxious to follow her through her journey.  Second, it takes the bare-bones recitation of the events in her life and the life of her family and weaves them into a tale.  The book does what few others have tried to do - present the world of biblical times through the eyes of a woman.  If you are super-sensitive about the Bible, you may not want to read this book.  Some of the great characters of the Bible - Jacob, Isaac, Rebecca, Levi - come out looking less like the heros we know and more like, well, human beings.<br />An easy, enjoyable read.  Ultimately, this is the story of a woman.  We learn with her, grow with her, mourn with her, and miss her when she leaves us.	2001-04-03

Michael Waldman is my idea of a great writer of political books.  He's a guy who was definitely on the inside, but he doesn't spend the whole book aggrandising himself or justifying everything he did.  Waldman does a great job of showing what it was like to work for Clinton the man, Clinton the president, Clinton the political strategist.  As opposed to books written by others who worked in the White House during the Clinton years (Stephenopolis, Gergen, Morris), you don't get a sense that Waldman is writing for any other reason than to objectively report what he saw and did while working for the President.<br />There is nothing shocking or new in this book, really, but it does a great job of showing the dichotomy that existed in the White House during the scandals.  Waldman was a policy, not a political, guy.  Even in the heart of the scandals - indeed, on the most important days of that whole mess - Waldman recounts how he and other policy guys just worked on policy issues (the budget, fast track, education) as if nothing else was going on.  On the day Clinton is impeached, Waldman and the President were working on a speech together.  Amazing!<br />This book is excellent for many reasons.  First, it is a great inside look at how speeches and policies were constructed in the Clinton White House.  Second, Waldman was there for the entire presidency (except for the very end), so his observations on how the President (and the White House staff) changed over the years are insightful and fascinating.  I really enjoyed watching/reading as he and the other young aides went from, well, young aides to senior White House Staffers.  Third, this book did more to help me understand Clinton the man than almost any other I read, precisely because it didn't TRY to explain who Clinton the man is.  Rather, Waldman just shows us what Clinton did, said, and how he acted during his presidency without trying to over analyze it or draw conclusions.  In this way, we get to see Clinton unfiltered.<br />For political junkies looking for a good book on how policies are formed and shaped in a modern White House, this is a great book.  For lovers of Clinton, this is a must-read.  For those looking for chest pumping, look elsewhere.  Waldman wrote a great book.  Well worth a read.filtered.<br />For political junkies looking for a good book on how policies are formed and shaped in a modern White House, this is a great book.

He writes as if he is singing, or writing poetry; on almost every page, there is a gem of a sentence which is just food for thought for hours.  For example:  &quot;Then the feeling moves on.  It does not collapse; it is not whisked away.  It simply moves on, like  a train that stops at a small country station, stands for a while, and then continues out of sight.&quot;  Or:  &quot;If they both survive long enough, if they stay together, they will watch each other fade.&quot;  Wonderful.<br />You do not need to know Virginia's Woolf generally, or her novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; in particular, to appeciate this book.  I've been assured, however, that reading Mrs. Dalloway only enhances the experience.  There are multiple parallels between the two books.  This book examines -as did &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; - one day in the life of three characters.  Each one's day, as it unfolds before us, could easily be its own short story.  Cunningham's genius, however, is the way in which he ties together the three individuals into one novel.  Watch for the Hitchcock-like ending.  I don't want to say what it is (it would be like telling the end of a movie to someone about to enter the theater) but read the last chapter carefully.  If you want to discuss the ending, or what the Hitchcock piece is, drop me an e-mail.  (I missed it the first time around until someone pointed it out to me).<br />All in all, this novel examines, in strikingly beautiful language - love, and life, and fear, and insecurity, and sanity, and marriage, and parenthood, and relationships.  There is something in this deeply textured novel for everyone.  It follows three women at three different times - the 1930s, the 1950s, and modern day - as they seek to understand their lives, their futures, and themselves.  The manner in which these women react to life is truly extraordinary.en react to life is truly extraordinary.	2001-03-06

I found this book - as always - beautifully written but a bit heavy on religion.  Let me explain before you boo me off the stage, Coelho lovers!  Usually, I find his thoughts on God and religion to be beautifully written but also subtly drafted.  For example, in his masterpiece &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, God and fate and religion were infused throughout the story, but subtly so.  Here, the religion is very in your face.  I found it bearable but a bit much, a bit unnecessary.  Coelho is such a gifted writer that he doesn't NEED to be so blunt with religion and god.  That said, this novel - as his others - is well constructed, a quick read and one in which we quickly become involved in the main characters lives.  I found myself rooting heartily for the two main actors.  The ending was something of a surprise, but as always left me on the edge of my seat with my mouth open and my mind racing.  The book does what any good book should - leave you with the belief that you have read an excellent story, as well as give you many things to think about and relate to your own life.  &quot;By the River ...&quot; is well worth a read, and Coelho continues to inspire with his almost non-stop beautiful prose.  Each page contains at least one gem which I underline, think about, come back to, chew on, and then think about some more.  A great read - if it was by anyone else I'd give it a 5; I give it a comparative 4 only in relation to his other books.  While this one is great, his others are even greater.	2001-02-16

Then imagine that the entire world you've found for yourself comes crashing down, a piece at a time.  This book does a wonderful job of exploring how one woman deals with loss, betrayal, and monumental life changes.  The author writes well, and does an excellent job of making you care for the characters in the book.  She begins by introducing us to this marriage, this relationship between two people.  We then follow along with the woman as she discovers, piece by piece, the secrets that underlayed this relationship and life she had built around it.  The novel uses beautiful prose to explore relationships, how those relationships change over time, and how people who share a home can sometimes not really know each other at all.

Often, the books examining this topic are clearly ideological (for example, Schippers horribly written, self-serving &quot;Sell Out&quot;).  Baker does a great job of providing insight on the various stages of the events that made up this time in our nation's history.  He does this by having almost unparalled access to the thoughts and conversations of the major players.  For example, what better way to know what various Senators were thinking during the trial than to examine journals and notes belonging to those Senators?  Due to his excellent reputation for veracity and fairness, Baker was given access to such sources (e.g., Senator Collins' impeachment diary) and to conversations normally kept private from reporters/researchers.  If you are a student of history, of Clinton, or of Congress, this book is a must read.  Personally, I've read most of the impeachment books, and this is the best.  What is most amazing is the insight into the way the events actually unfolded; the public gets to see (often for the first time) how very differently things could have gone if only one person had done something, or said something, differently.  For example, had DeLay decided not to wage his &quot;let's impeach&quot; crusade; had several moderate republicans been approached differently, had Clinton (at several points) shown actual contrition, impeachment and/or a trial may have never occurred.  Great book!	2001-02-05

It starts from day one - &quot;what happened?!??!&quot; - and takes you to the end stage - moving on to the next love.  It provides basic, common sense advice (we all know that in these times we sometimes lack that common sense!), poems, stories, and basic companionship.  It acts as a friend, a guide, a helpful companion.  You can sit down, read the portion applicable to you at that time, and then come back to the rest later.  For example, if you are at the grieving stage, read that section, digest its advice, absorb the poems, and then, when you are ready, read on - to the next stage.  The guide is constructed to lead you through the stages of grieving and moving on.  Reading ahead can be helpful - so you know where you are heading - as is reading back, so that you can see how far you've come!  And, if you aren't normally a poetry fan, don't worry!  These are poems which are easy to read, funny, deep, and non-threatening, all at the same time.  Get this book - you won't regret it!	2001-02-02

I picked up this book at a difficult time in my life, right after the loss of a loved one.  I was amazed at the depth of the book.  I actually felt as if the author and I were having a conversation.  He wrote about what I was feeling, and thinking, and wondering.  It's a quick read, with a simple story, but the simple story has many different levels.  This is one of those books that will mean different things to those at different points in their life.  To some, it will be a nice story.  To others, it will be a roadmap for getting through a difficult time in life.  I say this especially to those confused about why bad things happen in life, or why our dreams sometimes seem so far from being realized:  get a good cup of coffee, sit down and read this book. You will not be sorry.  To those simply looking for a good read - don't pass this by!  And to those who feel as if life is perfect - read this and realize how perfect life really is.	2001-01-29

This involves a fundamental betrayal; when the President or First Lady told Mr. Stephanopoulos their thoughts, fears, and hopes, it was not meant to be shared with the world.  So, shame on him for revealing what was surely meant to be private material.  That being said, this is a good glimpse into the Clinton White House.  Ignore the self-serving platitudes, take his view of his role with a grain of salt (for example, in his book David Gergen paints a much different picture of Stephanopoulos, one not nearly as flattering), and enjoy some interesting gossip.  For that's what this is.  But, to someone like myself who loves politics and history, this is GOOD gossip.	2000-10-31

It examines campaign finance in the real world, with highly detailed  and researched insights into how one modern election was approached by  candidates and those with money.  it has some fascinating inside scoops and  details that washington-insiders and those who follow politics closely will  love.  For example, it examines the role of gingrich and other republicans  during the budget debates and government shut-down, providing details I've  never heard before (and I read the Wash. Post each day and review articles  and books on this subject often.<br />Bottom line:  if you want a good look  into how money really corrupts our politicians, and a glimpse into how much  power the interest groups have, read this book.	2000-09-05

Well, this is the fourth book by Dunnett that I've read (the three earlier  books in the Lymond series being the others).  Quite simply, Dunnett gets  better with each book!  Her style continually reminds me of Dumas.  History, adventure, great characters - all mix together to form a gripping  story.  I couldn't put it down last night as I finished it.  Most  impressive to me is the way she is &quot;realistic&quot; (within, of  course, the fictional world she created).  By that, I mean that her  characters, good and evil, make tough choices.  Good sometimes doesn't  triumph completely, bad people sometimes come out on top, and loyal friends  sometimes pay the price for our heros adventures.  This is no fairy tale.  A few times, I was actually shocked by the story as it progressed  (especially at the end of this book).  All in all, a great read if you like  historical/fictional mixes.  I especially enjoyed being introduced to a  world I knew nothing about (ancient Turkey and its empire).	2000-08-23

Dorothy Dunnett continues to impress me.  I'm a big fan of Dumas and his trilogies.  Dunnett comes darn close to his writing.  Her books are engrossing, weave a great story, and draw me in more each time I read another book.  This is the third in the Lymond Chronicles series.  It is  very well written.  I enjoy how the story stands on its own but also weaves  into the first two books.  If you have the time, read the entire series  from start to finish.  I'm looking forward to reading the next one!  I also  can't wait to get into her House of Niccolo series.  This book, and series,  is well worth a read!	2000-03-14

I really enjoyed most of this book, but found that the somewhat gratuitous and constant mentions of sex were unnecessary and detracted from the otherwise wonderful story.  The author has a skill for writing and the  constant recourse to sex was just distracting and at times absolutely  vulgar.  I really liked the idea of the book, however, and felt very  intimately connected with the main characters.  Well done but could have  been a bit better.	1999-12-13

Ambrose brings history alive and makes one truly appreciate the sacrifices and difficulties faced on the DDay beaches.  I recently visited the beaches in Normandy and, while I found them impressive, didn't get too much out of  it.  I wish that I had read this book before I went and had been carrying  it while on the sand.  Great mixture of personal stories and overall  picture of the battle.  My favorite book by him yet.	1999-11-17

I have to be honest - I expected more.  It was usually very well written and a good story, but at times too needlessly detailed.  The  descriptions of Paris were, I found, a bit much.  Overall, though, a  wonderful story written by a gifted author. It also helped that I've been  to Paris and the square in front of Notre Dame so much - it allowed me to  see the events happening in my mind even more than usual.	1999-11-17

Easy to read, filled with facts and minutia yet never dull.  My grandfather landed on the Normandy beaches - not with the paratroopers but &quot;regular&quot; army - and this book helps me to  understand, if only a little bit, what his war must have been like.

I really enjoyed it, so I decided to try this book, the second in the Lymond Chronicles.  Now I'm hooked, and plan to read the entire series.  Dunnett is truly a modern-day  Dumas.  If you liked the Three Muscateers series - which I did - you'll be  hooked.	1999-10-03

The Man in the Iron Mask is a fitting finale to a wonderful series of books (which begins with the Three Muscateers).  Action, romance, adventure... it's all here!  If you enjoyed this book, don't fail to read  the Three Muscateers and Twenty Years After... the same type of action with  the same stars (earlier in their careers/lives).	1998-12-04

I have never  been in combat but O'Brien makes me feel as if I have.  He's powerful,  genuine, and makes you feel.  This book is a very quick read.  I saw Tim  O'Brien at a book reading in Washington, DC recently, and he brought the  book even further to life.	1998-10-26

Rushdie seems to try a bit too hard at times to write literature.  He does have some wonderful moments, though, and some very memorable phrases and use of words in the book.  By the end of the book I was anxious to find out what happened but also ready for it to end.	1998-06-30

Unfortunately, as others have noted, the veracity of the book has been called into question.  I also found the book a bit preachy and reptitive.  Yeah, yeah, we KNOW - the president and the others in the administration are forgetting the bottom half of society.  Enough already!  But, a good and quick read that people looking for an inside look into DC will enjoy.	1998-04-19

I live there, I work there, I am immersed in the Washington scene.  Maybe that's why I wasn't crazed about the book.  It was good, and well written, but not what I expected.  The prose flows moderately well, but at times became a bit too into itself.  I was a bit surprised at the end, however, to see that I was excited to read about what happened to the characters.  I hadn't known that I cared that much.  A decent read, but nothing to go crazy about.	1998-04-06

I was surprised by the ending - it hit me a bit hard.  It was realistic in a way that we often don't expect our stories to be anymore.  The author does a good job of painting a picture of the town this book is set in - especially considering the brevity of the book.  Well done and worth the quick read.	1998-01-18

It picks up 20 years after the end of the Three Muscateers and follows the characters through new adventures.  The Oxford edition features good endnotes that help explain the historical references.  You'll enjoy this if you liked Dumas' earlier work.	1998-01-10
