Hardly any mention of Freddy at all. <br /> <br />Finally, a little more than halfway through, one of the geeks claims she was gangraped by the wrestling team and talks the other geek girls into breaking into the old boiler room to find Freddy's glove--\\"half dream, half reality\\"--and use it to revive his \\"dream seed\\" and make him kill the rapists. <br /> <br />Tell me when this starts sounding like Nightmare On Elm Street. <br /> <br />After Freddy claims his first two victims, the other geek girls find out that there was no rape, and in fact the girl in question is a sociopath who has loved Freddy since she was seven years old and he killed her abusive parents (how she witnessed this, they never explain). So it's up to them to stop Freddy before he kills the rest of the innocent wrestling team. <br /> <br />But of course Freddy doesn't play by any rules, and goes after the entire school. <br /> <br />At once, when nutso-girl floods the school with a sleep gas that lets Freddy commit mass slaughter on a scale even Jason hardly contemplates (final death toll: 461).	2005-09-16
US	49407961	R2TZQ7OEXJEGDK	0451454537	956464735	Grunts	Books	2	17	27	N	N	Nothing is worse than a good concept with bad execution. (spoilers)	The basic concept is \\"generic orcs working for generic dark powers raid a dimension-travelling dragon's cave and find a horde of 21st century weapons.\\" That could have been played marvellously. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the execution is botched. Horribly. <br /> <br />For starters, when they take the weapons, the orcs are all affected by the \\"Dragon's Curse\\" that makes them assume the personality of US Marines. Reading through about 500 pages of practically nothing but stereotypical marine talk and attitudes, with only slight hints of orcishness, is not my idea of a good read, or at least not for a fantasy novel (if this was, say, Tom Clancy I wouldn't complain). This almost seems like the author wanted to write a military novel but couldn't sell it, so she slapped on a few fantasy elements to help the sale. <br /> <br />Not only do they HAVE 21st century weapons, but they soon start MAKING 21st century weapons. With Tolkien-esque technology, and they are specifically mentioned as being non-magical. Umm... <br /> <br />The orcs are survivors of the Last Battle of Light and Dark, on the side of Dark obviously, but have no problem selling their new super-weapons to the victorious members of the armies of the Light. Nor do the armies of the Light have any problem BUYING these new weapons of megadeath from the forces of the Dark. <br /> <br />Speaking of Light, the \\"good guys\\" aren't particularly good. I'm not talking about one or two minor flaws, or even anti-heroes. I'm talking about the forces of Light not really having a problem with the orcs eating living men, elves, dwarves and halflings during their sales meetings. Mind you, the forces of Light consist OF men, elves, dwarves, and halflings. <br /> <br />On the topic of halflings, they're definitely the most grating characters in the book. The lead orc falls in love with one, with no lead-in, after two pages and marries her in twenty (this does not stop him from continuing to eat other halflings alive). This halfling, by the way, is a duchess but whenever she gets bored she runs an S&M whorehouse. Her sons, meanwhile, are two sociopathic murderers-thieves-conmen who gleefully slaughter whole families to make just a few coins. We're supposed to root for them, by the way. <br /> <br />If the forces of petty evil are annoying, the forces of Grand Evil (symbolized in the orcs' master, the nameless necromancer, and HIS master, the Dark Lord) are the really interesting characters in the book. So of course we don't see much of them. <br /> <br />Oh, and in the third part of the book, the entire world is invaded by intelligent, weapon-using versions of the xenomorphs from Aliens. I am not making this up.	2005-08-31

She also is in love with someone other than her boyfriend, who she doesn't care much for nowadays but doesn't have the heart to break up with. Fortunately for her, the decision is made much easier when she learns he has joined with a race of ancient demons. <br /> <br />Ah yes, the demons. The one intriguing idea this book had was that it's not just a Holy Grail, it's an Unholy Grail as well, needed by both demons and humanity for different and irreconcilable reasons. Unfortunately, we find most of this out in a long, boring passage of exposition told to a character who already knows this (and the speaker KNOWS he knows it). <br /> <br />Probably the most interesting character is Cardinal di Stefano, the Pope's right hand man. He's neither truly hero nor villain; while his role, that of allowing the demons the break they need to try and recover the Grail, would normally be given to a villain, and di Stefano himself isn't the nicest guy in the world, he is a good guy and doesn't do anything horribly wrong. He sort of reminded me of Professor Snape. <br /> <br />But di Stefano is not enough for me to recommend this piece of 1982 tripe. Stay firmly away.	2005-06-12
US	49407961	R2RG6520N88GXO	0843932481	246124193	Saurian	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A masterpiece of late 80's horror.	William Schoell seems to be very prevalent in the horror genre, and he seems to be an underappreciated maestro of it; a Stephen King without the massive fanbase. <br /> <br />Saurian may be his magnum opus, in which he takes a few ideas King began to develop in IT and reworks them in his own unique fashion. Someone must confront as an adult the horror they barely survived as a child, a shapeshifting disguised horror. <br /> <br />But there all similarities end, as the title creature, the Saurian, operates on a less metaphysical level than Pennywise, King's demented clown-demon. The Saurian is, by and large, content to restrict his rampages to the here and now. And where Pennywise often taunts and antagonizes his prey, the Saurian affords no such mercy, no such chances a quick-witted hero can exploit. Anything that defies him, he simply destroys. But that does not mean he is a mindless beast. Far, far from it. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this, and everything else of Schoell's, as I've never read a bad book of his yet.	2005-06-06
US	49407961	R37AF0C4ZWAEAG	0843927569	434939141	Pagoda	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A nice spine-tingler that will keep you guessing.	First off, let me get all misconceptions out of the way.  Despite what the masterpiece of a cover would lead you to believe, at no point does a dragon come crawling out of the pagoda.  Sorry about that.<br /><br />Still, PAGODA by R. Karl Largent is quite a well-done piece of '80s horror.  The title object is actually a pagoda in miniature, brought from Burma over to America that conceals the \\"ultimates,\\" mystical masterpieces of Zeygo the great alchemist/philosopher.  However, the ultimates must be removed only by first solving the riddle of the pagoda correctly; doing so incorrectly will bring down a dark curse.<br /><br />This is almost a collection of short stories, tied together by the mysterious pagoda and the equally mysterious Loo Song, sent by his religious order in Burma to America to find the pagoda and bring it back.<br /><br />We follow the pagoda as it changes hands, bringing disaster on almost everyone who owns it.  The first five stories (after a quick prologue) are \\"cautionary tales,\\" the kind of things that could easily be modified a bit and be used for a show like TALES FROM THE CRYPT.  The sixth and final story reveals the truth behind Loo Song, his religion of Mantau, the even more mysterious Master who heads the religion, and all the secrets behind the pagoda itself.<br /><br />The stories vary a bit.  The prologue and first story are well done, and the second is perhaps the best in the whole book.  The third, though, is the weakest, and the fourth is only a little better.  The fifth is a spectacular return to form, a truly chilling tale; and the sixth story that ties up all the loose ends is also marvellously well done, with twist after twist that will leave you reeling.<br /><br />This is definitely an uneven book, but in the end I have to definitely approve this piece of 1989 horror.  Definitely recommended.	2005-05-25
US	49407961	R16VYDFMKUGG6S	0743435575	730632235	Conrad's Time Machine	Books	1	2	3	N	N	There is no one named Conrad in this book. (spoilers)	The cover shows a man at a complex battle station facing off against dinosaurs AND a future-city with spaceships. Neither of these are in the book.  <br /> <br />Even though this book was written by a man, there seemed to be a large misandrystic (?) streak. After the first quarter or so, women did practically everything, with a hidden subtext that they did it better than most any of the men could.  <br /> <br />The main character marries one of these uberfrauen named Barbara. Why, I don't know. She's good in the sack, but due to some of the plot devices he has access to literally thousands of woman who are eager to get him in the sack. Barbara is a stuck-up prig who keeps thousands and thousands of secrets from him.  <br /> <br />Continuing with the \\"men and their feelings aren't important,\\" at one point the main character is raped by three women. Literally raped, he's tied up, handcuffed, ball gag in his mouth, and they have their way with him. But it's OK:  <br /> <br />\\"I don't think that the women involved deserved twenty years in jail apiece for their crimes, which is what would have happened to three men back in the States, if they had done to a woman what these three did to me.\\" <br /> <br />Why not?! Rape is rape, no matter who the victim is and who the rapists are.  <br /> <br />Oh, and the rape was actually part of the surprise bachelor party organized by the main character's best friend. With friends like that...  <br /> <br />The end of the book just happens with no climax or resolution and more questions left asked then answered.  Nowhere in the book does it mention being part of a series and I didn't even know it was until I came to this site.	2005-03-21

It was obviously written from an early draft.  However, it's still worth reading.<br />And the recreations of the first two films are also nice, as well.<br />One nice touch is that all three made a major running theme of Freddy's dependence on fear, which was largely left out in the final film of Part 3 and not touched on again until 2003's Freddy vs. Jason.<br />Recommended for slasher fans or movie novelization fans.	2004-04-24

He has many credits under his belt, but perhaps his most appreciated works are his cosmic epics, where the fate of the universe (if not more) hangs in the balance.<br />In INFINITY ABYSS, the tale centers around his greatest creation, Thanos, who used to be a villainous nihilist but has &quot;mellowed&quot; of late.  Odd semi-doppelgangers of Thanos are trying to destroy the universe, and only the original can stop them.  But he cannot do it alone-- he will need the help of Adam Warlock, Pip The Troll, Moondragon, Gamora, Dr. Strange, Captain Genis Mar-Vell, and a certain friendly neighborhood Spider-Man...<br />Some Starlin fans found this miniseries disappointing, but I enjoyed it.  Neither his writing nor his art have weakened over time.  He effortlessly blends high-stakes cosmic battles with humor.<br />Highly recommended for all Thanos fans; mildly recommended for just fans of Marvel Comics in general.	2003-06-12
US	49407961	R8W43INZYQV2F	B00005VQAD	542310711	Crisis!	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Could have been great... *mild spoilers*	But, alas, CRISIS! by James Gunn suffers from several flaws that prevent it from reaching the masterpiece status it could have had.<br />The idea of a time-traveller who tries to save the world from crisis after crisis, but in doing so loses his memory over and over again, is certainly interesting.  It's an eternal cycle that's almost heartbreaking; at any time Bill Johnson could simply give up, but instead he chooses to remain the doomed amnesiac savior, never to be known or rewarded for all his efforts, never to even see the future he left to save.<br />Unfortunately, it's very easy to tell that this book is simply a reprinting of linked short stories.  If this had been a true novel, it could have been great.  The episodic feel rather hurts it, I believe.<br />What also hurts it is the misleading back cover, which gives the impression that the entire space-time continuum is at stake.  It is not.<br />Most of the female characters, it seems, simply exist to be attracted to Bill Johnson; this is fine for one or two, but during the fifth story, it's simply ludicrous.<br />Also, the final story seems rushed.  There wasn't a proper conclusion.  The reappearance of a character from an earlier story actually made me laugh at how corny it was.<br />The stories themselves are a bit unbalanced; the first was great.  The second was good, with a letdown of an ending.  The third is unquestionably the best, but the fourth gives it a run for its money.  The fifth and sixth stories, though, are rather bad.<br />I should also note that this book has one of the coolest front covers I've ever seen:  as a giant skeletal snake unhinges its jaws to swallow the Earth, a dove appears surrounded by white light.<br />Overall, I'd say that CRISIS! is worth picking up if you can find it for the same price I did:  two dollars.	2003-06-04

He almost effortlessly jumps back and forth between 1958 and 1985, tying the two disparate time periods together.  He weaves an excellent tale of seven friends banding together to fight a shape-changing monster from beyond space...<br />...for the most part.<br />So why ISN'T it excellent?<br />1) The two characters that seem to get the most 'page-time,' Bill and Beverly, are very irritating.  Hardly a chapter goes by without us hearing what a great leader Bill is (though we hardly ever see proof of it) or how wonderfully beautiful Beverly is.  After a while, it gets annoying, and you wish IT would just go ahead and eat them.<br />2) At one part near the end of the book, there is 'a certain scene.'  I don't want to mention it specifically, but you'll know it when you come to it.  It is pretty much utterly pointless.<br />3) Also at the end, it is revealed that our heroes must do something else aside from destroy IT.  This new plot thread was practically brought up out of nowhere and then discarded soon after, meriting only a brief reference.  It's as if Mr. King suddenly decided to add a reason to make their actions all the more necessary.<br />4) Right at the end (notice where most of the problems crop up?), he uses my all-time least favorite literary device.  Again, you'll know it when you read it.<br />But don't let this stop you.  Buy this book, read it, and enjoy it.  Just be prepared for a disappointment in the last hundred pages or so.	2003-05-29

Ever since Roger Stern introduced the villainous Hobgoblin in the early 1980's, his true identity has been a mystery to Spider-Man and readers, and even other writers.  After he left, another writer took a guess and &quot;revealed&quot; his identity.  Only problem is, he was 100% wrong.  Now, 15 years after the Hobgoblin's introduction, Roger Stern is back, with three masterfully written issues.  His purpose?  To reveal the one, true Hobgoblin's identity once and for all!<br />To anyone who read the original Hobgoblin stories by Stern, you know that they read as good as the best mystery novel, only serialized and with superheroes.  Here, Stern brings back all the old suspects and supporting cast, and successfully recreates the feeling.  Ron Frenz also does some magnificent art, making &quot;Hobby&quot; seem quite creepy.<br />Fortunately, you don't need to have read the original stories in order to understand and like this one, but you do have to have done so in order to fully appreciate it.  So I give this 4.5 stars if you haven't read the old stories, and 5 if you have.	2002-10-08

A few of the reviewers below slam &quot;Dinotopia Lost&quot; by Alan Dean Foster because they claim that the language is too difficult for children.  But in doing so, they forget to look at its merits as, simply, a book.<br />This is an excellent novel that I, a college junior at time of writing, have read and reread numerous times.  I personally feel that Foster managed to develop the characters of the Denisons to a level that even James Gurney, Dinotopia's creator, was unable to.  He infuses the new characters with much three-dimensionality as well, especially the wild and wily pirate captain Brognar Blackstrap and his intellectual first mate, Priester Smiggens.  And Tarqua, a character who shows up near the end of the book, is such a delight that if I tell you more about him I'll ruin some of the book's best moments.<br />Please, don't judge this as a &quot;children's book.&quot;  Judge it as a full-fledged novel, like I did.	2002-09-13

This novelization of the hit movie &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; is done fairly well.  For the main part he recreates the film mostly accurately (though I believe he misspells Winston's last name).  He also adds some extra info, such as a nicely done scene at the very end that expands on one of the shots in the end credits.<br />It is, however, a bit short and simplistic.  Mr. Naha should have consulted the movie novelizations by George Gipe (the best I have ever read), but as it stands, this is certainly a passable job.	2002-09-12

I'm not an Apple fan, but the book looked amusing and I love things from the 80's.<br />Authors David A. and Marianne L. Gardner do a nice job of explaining many computer commands to someone with no experience, especially all the 1980's text commands.  They often use cartoons to illustrate their point, featuring themselves, Quentin the bug, and an unnamed, humanoid furry creature with tennis shoes.<br />Unfortunately, the last few chapters of the book, as well as the appendices, are too mired in technical information, and the amusing cartoons have become sparce.  Still, I can safely recommend &quot;Apple BASIC Made Easy&quot; to Apple fans, 80's fans, and collectors of old books.  Others may want to stay away.	2002-09-05

He handles the rest of the main characters excellent as well.<br />Allston does a superb job writing the Yuuzhan Vong.  By introducing a new relationship, between Tsavong Lah and his father, he's made the Warmaster even more three-dimensional.  The human traitor Viqi Shesh remains just as despicable.<br />If I had one complaint, it would be that the 'Goddess' plan seems a bit contrived, as if he whipped it up just so Jaina would have extra leverage to get away with everything she does.

Steve L. Kent has woven one heck of a tapestry here.  \\"The Ultimate History of Video Games\\" is easily the most informative book I've ever read on the subject of electronic entertainment.<br />One of the things I enjoyed the most is that for the most part, Kent does not take sides; they are only a few heroes and even less villains.  The only people who are portrayed as evil are those who would censor video games at the cost of the First Amendment.<br />This book is for everyone, rather you're writing a thesis on the subject or are simply (like me) a lifelong fan of video games.<br />Highly recommended!	2002-04-01
US	49407961	RJWKERP1UAUI0	1563897504	841852739	Crisis On Infinite Earths	Books	3	23	28	N	N	Not without its good points...but not without its bad.	...CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS was DC's 1985/1986 attempt to clean house, to condense the numerous characters scattered across many (though not actually infinite) alternate realities into one main universe. This attempt can only be judged a failure, seeing as how they attempted it again in 1992 (with the abysmal ZERO HOUR) and now seem to have simply given up (as some of the supposedly destroyed universes have been seen again).<br />But what of the story's own merits and flaws?<br />On the positive side, this twelve issue series contains some spectacular art by George Perez. Some of the new characters are interesting, especially Pariah. The Anti-Monitor is certainly a powerful villain, and seeing so many comic book superstars in one story is a bit of a guilty pleasure.<br />On the negative side, however, Marv Wolfman is forced to use huge chunks of expository dialogue that will seem cumbersome even to comic book fans who have read such clunky dialogue hundreds of times before. Also, Wolfman doesn't explain many of the events in other comics (e.g., the Flash in the future) that have an effect on this story. As a result of this, combined with the huge number of characters whose names aren't given, CRISIS is not the easiest book for 'casual' comic fans to pick up and understand. There are a few plot holes as well, to be sure.<br />Now time for a couple of personal gripes. I own this in the hardcover collection, because at the time DC said that that was the only form this story would ever be collected in, and like a gullible fool I believed them. Then they come out with this thing, 66% cheaper than what I paid. Lesson: Don't trust DC.<br />Also, this story ruined many good characters. For example, Captain Marvel, the Marvel Family, and all the other Fawcett characters simply haven't been the same since they were forced to occupy the same universe as everyone else. On the upside, though, this story led to the Giffen/Dematteis era of the Justice League, which contain some of the funniest comics I've ever read.<br />Bottom line-- Big-time DC collectors and George Perez fans will want to buy this. Casual readers should steer clear until they've educated themselves a bit on DC. To see how this kind of thing can be done right, I recommend Marvel's \\"Avengers Forever\\" by Kurt Busiek and Carlos Pacheco.	2002-01-24
US	49407961	R9M37OXPYNF44	0446527130	118908960	Envy	Books	2	4	8	N	N	Interesting villains can't save a bland heroine or plot.	NOTE--this review goes heavy on the spoilers.  If you haven't read ENVY yet, read this review at your own risk.<br />***<br />This was my first Sandra Brown novel, a Christmas present.  And yes, I'm already done.  I read quite fast.<br />I have to say that I found our main protagonist, Maris Matherly-Reed, to be quite two-dimensional.  Whenever one of the villains did something, I tried to guess what her reaction would be, and I was always right.  This should not be so in a mystery novel.  She was also too perfect, capable of doing no wrong.  I like my heroes and heroines flawed.<br />And the plot of the book is terribly worn out.  &quot;Guy that wants revenge is softened by beautiful woman?&quot;  No offense, Ms. Brown, but it has been done.  Furthermore, she seems to change the plot halfway through.  Originally it seems as if Parker's whole intent is to get revenge on Maris, but later his target changes to Noah.<br />Still, this novel was not without its good points--its villains and/or supporting characters.  My favorite kind of characters are the cunning, scheming kind, and watching Daniel, Noah, and Parker all struggle to out-scheme one another was pure delight.  In the end, Nadia was a bit more three-dimensional then she'd seemed.  And Mike Strother simply stole the book.<br />Final summary--If you're a Sandra Brown fan and don't have this, you may as well buy it.  If not, rent it from the library and give it a read, but you probably won't be checking it out again anytime soon.	2001-12-27
US	49407961	R382NOVXHB34JZ	0440160936	87776471	Murders on the Half Skull	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A wonderful collection of crime stories.	This collection, published by Dell, certainly has its ups and downs, but the ups are so good they manage to outweigh the downs.<br />After a short, amusing introduction by &quot;Alfie&quot; himself, we start off with a bang.  &quot;One November Night,&quot; by Jack Webb, is one of the best of the book.  It's a story about what happens to accountant Lyle Beckwith on his way home from work.  <br />Sadly, it's followed by &quot;The Already Dead,&quot; by C.B. Gilford.  This is a confusing, haphazard story about a kind of celebrity murder.  <br />After that comes Jack Ritchie's &quot;#8.&quot;  This story about a serial killer is only four pages, but it will stick in your mind long after some of the others have faded away.<br />Henry Slesar's &quot;The Day Of The Execution&quot; is an interesting psychological drama that is worth an enjoyable first read, but doesn't beg to be read anymore afterwards.<br />&quot;Who Has Been Sitting In My Chair?&quot; is a long and quite boring 'mystery' by Helen Nielsen.  The reason for the special denotation of 'mystery' is that I was never interested enough to care about who the villain was.<br />&quot;The Vapor Clue,&quot; by James Holding, Jr., is a quick little detective story about an early-morning murder.  It's probably the most non-descript of the bunch, but that doesn't mean it's bad.<br />Murray Wolf's &quot;Wetback&quot; is a tale of murder and romance among Hispanics.  Like &quot;Execution,&quot; it's a good first read but not a good reread.<br />&quot;Murder Between Friends&quot; is a quite amusing tale, by Nedra Tyre, of two old ladies who plan to kill their landlord.<br />&quot;Good For The Soul&quot; by Lawrence Block falls in the same category as &quot;Execution&quot; and &quot;Wetback.&quot;  'Nuff said.<br />&quot;Ace In The Hole,&quot; by Elijah Ellis, is definitely one of the best stories of the book and could be THE best.  This is a real mystery, with wit and suspense to spare as we see a newspaper reporter try toacquit himself of murder.<br />Following the strong story is another one, &quot;Bad Noose&quot; by Arthur Porges.  A handicapped man tries to kill his brother-in-law with a quite unusual weapon.<br />Edwin P. Hicks's &quot;The Eyes Of A Cop&quot; is much like &quot;Vapor&quot;--an enjoyable, non-descript detective story.<br />&quot;Cheers,&quot; by Richard Deming, is a very VERY funny story about two very VERY incompetent hitmen.<br />The book ends on a flourish with two strong humor stories--first &quot;Cheers,&quot; and then &quot;Crime Doesn't Pay--Enough&quot; by Ed Lacy.  It's about a contest winner who turns to crime.  A real hoot.<br />Despite some dull stories, I still highly recommend this little paperback.  It's very cheap and the good stories, of which there are many, are VERY good stories indeed.	2001-11-16

I was only 5 or 6 when I first got this book (now I'm 18), but a few of the stories in this collection by C.B. Colby still send a shiver down my spine.  The one I found most effective was the next-to-last one, &quot;The Whistle.&quot;  Not only did it take place in my state of South Carolina, but the source of the title sound was never identified or revealed.  In short, it could have been ANYTHING, and to a young reader (such as myself when I first read it), that's the worst kind of fear there is.  This is a good book to read to &quot;young-un's&quot; on Halloween, or anytime of the year you want to give them a good scare.  I also recommend it for adults.	2001-11-01

But while that book has the feel of an action film, this is more like a true epic (think &quot;The Godfather&quot;).<br />King creates a superb cast of characters. Will you root for the good guys such as Stu Redman and Nick Andros? Yes, but you can't help but like most of the 'villains.' Lloyd Henreid, Harold Lauder and all the rest turn out to be surprisingly sympathetic characters. They aren't really bad, just a little. The only one you really hate is the dark man Randall Flagg.  And you hate him not just for the misery he causes the heroes, but the way he takes the 'villains'--any of whom could have turned good--and made sure to keep them on the dark side.<br />Some people call this novel too long, and for them it may indeed be. But I am a super-fast reader. This book may take many people weeks, but I was able to finish it in the space of a single day. That attests to not only my reading ability, but also to King's writing ability. The 'journey home' sequence from Las Vegas--featuring Stu Redman and Tom Cullen--in particular kept me hooked.<br />THE STAND didn't scare me; but no book has since I was 9. However, it did grip me to my seat.<br />Highest possible recommendation!	2001-10-29
US	49407961	RXVUPGRKK7NJG	0312863586	821153252	Dracula	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Very excellent book with only a few minor flaws.	*Note-contains spoilers*<br />&quot;Dracula,&quot; the only book for which Bram Stoker is really famous, is very good.  The use of multiple points of view enhanced the suspense, and the protagonists (my favorite was Dr. Seward) were all written well, as well as Dracula himself.  And the first few chapters, beginning with Jonathan Harker's train arriving late, up to Harker attempting his escape from Castle Dracula, are some of the scariest passages in all of literature (especially the night-ride over the Borgo Pass, with the blue flame and the wolves).  The climax is also very excellent, from the heroes' race to destroy all the earth-boxes to the final confronation with the Count himself.<br />However, the novel bogs down a bit in the middle, during the &quot;Lucy Westenra&quot; section.  In fact, all of the flaws of the novel occur during this section.  Lucy herself is so bland and boring you find yourself wishing Dracula would go ahead and just kill her now.  And everyone else blathering on about how perfect and pure she is gets quite irritating.  Thankfully, once she is truly dead, the novel picks right back up.<br />Overall--highly recommended!	2001-08-03
US	49407961	R4CCS8LBRCDWL	0380760614	237064004	Gremlins 2: The New Batch	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Very faithful novelization of the hilarious movie.	David Bischoff's novelization of \\"Gremlins 2 The New Batch\\" is quite good, disappointing only in its length, or rather, lack thereof. I personally thought it should have been longer; it's a shame they were unable to get the marvellous George Gipe to do this book (I believe that he passed away), for he turned in TWO excellent novelization jobs-- on the original GREMLINS, plus BACK TO THE FUTURE.<br />But since, for whatever reason, death or otherwise, Gipe was unavailable, Bischoff steps up to the plate. And though perhaps not a grand slam, this one still goes out of the park.<br />Bischoff includes plenty of his own satire, while still staying true to the film (and also the first novel).<br />The best moment comes as Dr. Catheter repents. In the original theatrical version, here the \\"film breaks\\" and the Gremlins supposedly mess around with the projector; in the video release, the \\"tape messes up\\" and the Gremlins infiltrate the VCR. I had found myself wondering what Bischoff would do.<br />He lives up to those moments and creates an even funnier one. Mr. Glasses (aka \\"Brain Gremlin,\\" voiced in the movie by Tony Randall) flies to Los Angeles, ties up none other than \\"Mr. David Bischoff\\" and takes over the keyboard himself for a couple of pages, talking about how the Gremlins will revolutionize politics. At this point, Bischoff frees himself. Mr. Glasses decides it's time to relinquish the keyboard and so flies right back to the Clamp Center. I nearly died laughing.<br />Hilarious!	2001-08-03

As he did in BTTF, here he takes us *inside* the characters, where he reveals more of their background, secrets, and ambitions.  In particular, the origins of the Gremlins and the conversations between Gizmo and Stripe were excellent additions.<br />The only flaw is the same one that haunted the novelization of BTTF--it seems that Gipe was not given the final draft of the screenplay to work with.  In the book, Mr. Futterman dies.  In the actual movie, however, he was only seriously injured; the filmmakers apparently decided to spare him at the last moment.  But this is a minor flaw that does not detract too much.<br />Recommended for GREMLINS fans, and anyone who wants to see how movie novelizations should be done!	2001-06-17

Taking place years before I was even born, this novel contains one of King's best protagonists, the aptly-named Everyman John Smith.  John has suffered two accidents, one as a young boy, the other as a young man.  As a result, he gains various psychic powers.  However, he is also sent into a coma that lasts four and a half years.  As John struggles to readjust, he tutors a young man, helps to capture a serial killer, and tries to stop a madman from achieving high political office--which would doom the world.<br />This is magnificent, moving book, about the tragic story of a young man who spun &quot;00.&quot;<br />Highly recommended!	2001-06-17

Ms. Shahar manages to both do justice to established characters, such as the X-Men and Mr. Sinister, while bringing life to new creations, such as the wonderful &quot;Ohio Mutant Conspiracy.&quot;  The only flaw I could find was the Wolverine-like woman; it seemed to detract from the rest of the work.  Otherwise, highly recommended for Marvel Comics fans.	2001-05-30

Even without SQUADRON SUPREME, his excellent runs on CAPTAIN AMERICA and QUASAR speak for themselves.

It was one of the first books by Mr. King that I had read.  I loved it.<br />Now that I've had the chance to read much more of his work, what do I think of it now?<br />It's still great.<br />This is one of his best cast of characters assembled here.  Alan Pangborn, Norris Ridgewick, Henry Payton, Ace Merrill...everyone is very real-seeming and three-dimensional.<br />But as is often the case in good fiction, the villain steals the show.  Leland Gaunt will entrance the reader as much as he did the people of Castle Rock, while simultaneously making you loathe him utterly.<br />This is interesting, because most of King's villains are able to evoke *some* sympathy for the reader; Randall Flagg, IT, and Tak are just a few examples.  So what's the difference?  Why are those three--among others--capable of being rooted for while Leland Gaunt receives only boos?<br />Randall Flagg, IT, and Tak only want to kill you, and they have semi-indentifiable motives.  Gaunt, however, simply wants to be entertained by the carnage and chaos.  He'll steal your soul and sow havoc in the same way that you or I would turn on the TV.  He'll manipulate whole towns simply for his amusement.  Thus it is that King does an excellent job of portraying him as a demon who deserves nothing more than absolute destruction.  Overall--still great!	2001-05-28

Being a casual King fan, I picked up this volume to help me understand his work.  It revealed to me many things I did not know.  I have read &quot;Insomnia,&quot; and I had become aware that it was intimately associated with the DARK TOWER series (which I haven't read) and &quot;IT&quot; (which I have).<br />And I was aware that quite a few of King's books all came to a head in &quot;Needful Things,&quot; which references &quot;The Library Policemen.&quot;<br />But I wasn't aware that all the books cross-pollinated like this, nor that the DARK TOWER series was the linchpin of King's entire library of work.

(Although I found one they missed--one of the doctors in &quot;FIRESTARTER&quot; shares a name with Patrick Hockstetter, a boy from &quot;IT.&quot;)<br />Now I will definitely pick up more of King's books, and eagerly await the promised final battle novel.

She's the favorite character of many readers, but to me she's always been a bit irritating (except in SOUL MUSIC).  ...
