After all these years George Lincoln Rockwell still remains one of the most interesting figures to appear on the white nationalist scene. Son of a famous in his day vaudeville performer, went to an ivy league school, flew missions in ww2 and Korea, married to the daughter of the Icelandic ambassador to the United States, a talented artist and cartoonist, the list goes on and on. Rockwell really is someone who could have been a success at almost anything he chose to in life and is not the typical maladjusted freak that often gravitates toward white nationalism in its various forms.<br /><br />Schmaltz has written a very fair and unbiased account of Rockwell and his \\"stormtroopers\\", who were a menage of brawlers, ex-cons and misfits along with some genuinly talented individuals. Rockwell in many ways was like a great pro wrestling heel with his agitation techniques, he inflamed crowds beyond the boiling point to out and out brawling riots many a time, but he also often won over initially hostile crowds using his sense of humor, (Rockwell was a VERY funny guy!) He was also the first public figure in the white nationalist scene to reject and ridicule the right wing, he was the first to draw alliances with black radicals (he had meetings with Malcolm X and was a guest speaker at NOI rallies a few times) so he was and actually still is a man years ahead of his time in many ways. The life of Rockwell is covered in this book from childhood to his assassination at the hands of one of his most dedicated followers in a very fair, unbiased, and fascinating account of the life and times of GLR.	2005-09-09

This is a biography of Donald Goines, who wrote a lot of sleazy ghetto fiction books. The only book of his that I have read is Dopefiend, which is good, but is also one of the most depressing books I have ever read. But anyway about Low Road, its not that its bad but this is very incomplete. I really didn't feel like I knew that much about Goines except he was a junkie, he was a convict, he was a criminal, he was murdered. There is a lot of filler in this book too where the author goes into general history of the times that Goines lived. I'd only recomend this to people who are really into Goines. If you only have a casual interest in Goines this book really isn't worth your time.	2005-09-08

Worth its weight in gold just for the two chapters on Scandinavian wolf lore, and the idea that the viking berserkers were werewolves/shapeshifters. But besides that there is plenty of folklore on werewolves/shapeshifting in eastern Europe, France, and various other places in Europe. Also historical documentation of medieval serial killers who were alleged to be werewolves is recounted, as well as Baring-Goulds own encounters with local werewolf legends that had people in fear to go in the woods alone in various locales in France that he visited. The only fault I see with this book is that even though for a book written when it was it really covers a lot of bases the vast amount of Celtic shapeshifting/werewolf lore that exists is not included. Regardless this book still remains a timeless classic work.	2005-09-08

Not exactly my idea of revolution. I think of Duke as being sincere on one level, and a con man on another level. All in all a very conflicted individual.<br /><br />But anyway the book itself, some of the biographical stuff is very self aggrandizing, the historical stuff is good and Duke makes valid points, he beats you over the head with \\"statistics\\" a bit much for my tastes though.

This is of interest because it gives some insite into Mansons life since he has been in prison. Also included are transcripts of Mansons commentary during his various court and parole hearings over the years. This book is not perfect, the author at various times bends over backwards to paint Manson as being \\"spookier\\" than he really is, at one point implying that the reason for a near drowning accident and being attacked by an inmate were the result of a \\"voodoo doll\\" curse put on him by Manson! But flaws aside this is a very interesting look at Mansons life in the California prison system and contains the previously mentioned court/parole transcripts so it is a must read if you have an interest in Charles Manson.	2005-05-07

McCalden does a great job of pointing out many of the group neurosis that afflict this mixed race desert tribe of weirdos from a psychohistorical viewpoint.<br /><br />McCalden documents many of the traits that make the Jew the Jew. Included are profiles of Jewish communists Trotsky (real name Bronstien) and Marx (real name Levy), pointing out how screwed up and hypocritical they were in their personal life and also how they knew absolutely nothing about what the life of the \\"worker\\" was really like, and in fact disdained and made money by exploiting working people during their lives in just the same way as the worst of the capitalists.<br /><br />He also profiles the Jew Freud, who more or less projected Jewish and his own personal neurosis and perversions onto the whole of the human race. McCalden shows what a scam psychotherapy as well as the other \\"alternative\\" therapies are. Strangely enough Jews themselves are disproportionatly conned out of their money by these \\"therapies\\", even falling for something called \\"ethnotherapy\\" which includes settings where Jews are to repeat the words \\"I am A Jew\\" in front of each other over and over and over and over again for minutes on end. Excuse me, I must go laugh now.<br /><br />McCalden also goes into the Jews strange obsession with all things fecal, with the many sexual insecurities that plague the jewish male, the Jewish emasculation circumsision ritual, the many wacky ramblings of the Jewish Talmud, the Jewish obsession with having to be in control of everything for fear if they are not they will be \\"holocausted\\", as well as some of the strange accounts of \\"holocaust\\" survivors, even fusing two of the Jews favorite topics in many of them, the \\"holocaust\\" and fecal matter.<br /><br />This book is out of print and very hard to find but can be found online here and its only 40 pages so you can print it off without killing your printer and add it to your library.

Good stuff on the utter insanity of the Christian idea of loving ones enemies and turning the other cheek, as well as accepting a deity outside your own culture as your own.

Tolkien, and "The Lord of the Rings"	Books	5	20	27	N	Y	The Real Middle Earth	First of all this book talks relativly little about Tolkien or any of his books. What it does is try to capture the \\"magic\\" of the places and time periods that Tolkien drew inspiration from for his work, namely post Roman to pre Norman Great Britain, and to a slightly lesser extent Scandinavian and Icelandic society and culture from the same time periods using historical sources, so called \\"myth\\", namely the pagan beliefs of the Celts, Norse and Anglo-Saxons and other assorted folk beliefs and tales.<br /><br />From what I can gather from reading this book the author seems like he has a similar belief that I have always had that Tolkien on one level was conciously trying to help to write a missing part of our (assuming you are of anglo-celtic-norse ancestry) heritage due to our own ancestors poor job of writng down and recording their own history, and in part to the fact that much of what is known of our pre christian history was written by outsiders to the culture, or people with a biased political agenda, and above all Christian church hierarchy who were more or less under orders to discredit our whole culture as of being of the Jewish satan and to force this demonic alien Jew Yahweh/Jesus god upon our people. Even though Tolkien himself was a devout Catholic, I believe he was conciously trying to \\"fill in the blanks\\" in a sense, even though the inspiration and the imagination of the Hobbit/LOTR came from his subconcious ancestral memory as well as the written sources of the time that we have.<br /><br />So enough of my pschoanalyzing, on to the book itself. Bates goes into most everything that was \\"magic\\" about those times and is very entertaining in doing so talking about the warrior culture, the concept of wyrd and destiny, shapeshifting, the pre christian gods and how the people related to them, how people related to nature, animals, the forest, the land, the use of spells and magic, dwarves and elves, whether you take these things as real or imaginary superstitions they were 100% real to the people of those times.<br /><br />This is a great book for anybody who wants to look into the \\"magic\\" of those times or for anybody who wants to get a better understanding of where Tolkien got his ideas, both on the concious and subconcious levels.itions they were 100% real to the people of those times.<br /><br />This is a great book for anybody who wants to look into the \\"magic\\" of those times or for anybody who wants to get a better understanding of where Tolkien got his ideas, both on the concious and subconcious levels.	2004-07-09

One of the Ethiopians dies. A chain of events occurs where opportunistic &quot;activists&quot; somehow find a way to sue Tom Metzger, even though he lived in Southern California and I believe had never even spoken to anyone involved with the fight that resulted in the Ethiopians death, win the lawsuit and take everything he worked his whole life for. The whole crux of the lawsuit was Metzger was responsible because an associate of his had given the Portland skinheads some of Metzgers literature!<br />Langer does a good job of showing the skinhead scene for what it is, mainly people in their early 20's and teens who came from dysfunctional families going through a &quot;stage&quot; they will soon grow out of, having more to do with fashion, socializing and being part of a &quot;scene&quot; than anything else, lacking any real focus in their idealology, and with a few exceptions the worst thing they are really doing is petty street violence, ie, getting getting drunk and getting in fights, not unlike a lot of frat boys I might add. Which like another reviewer mentioned is pretty lightweight when compared to what so called minority youth gangs are involved in.<br />The author is very fair and sympathetic in her portrayal of Metzger. Even if you despise his ideas on race and politics its hard not to like him on the personal level from reading this book, reminding me almost of retired old men that hang out in a small town barbershops telling jokes and talking about politics.<br />Her portrayal of the &quot;activist&quot; Morris Dees is less flattering as he comes off as a sleazy opportunistic egotistical sort who exploited this whole situation for his own personal gain. Dees organization the Southern Poverty Law Center takes in millions every year, while the family of the slain Ethiopian, who Dees represented, has recieved very little in the way of compensation even though the multi-million dollar lawsuit was won by Dees.zation the Southern Poverty Law Center takes in millions every year, while the family of the slain Ethiopian, who Dees represented, has recieved very little in the way of compensation even though the multi-million dollar lawsuit was won by Dees.	2004-06-02

This book requires less salt than anything I've read pertaining to the \\"Manson family\\" to date.<br />The author paints a very sympathetic picture of Fromme. I think the angle he is getting at is Manson was able to influence Fromme because she was looking for a Father figure type because her dad was emotionally abusive, neglectful and he strongly implies that Squeaky was sexually abused by him. (which Fromme has denied is true) He also does a lot to show and explain the environmental/ecological activism and theories of the \\"Manson family\\", which I found interesting and a lot more well grounded than Bugliosi's screwy \\"helter skelter\\" theory. The environmental issues were the main focus and obsession of the \\"Manson family\\", not \\"helter skelter\\" in my own personal opinion.<br />I'm giving this book 4 stars, I'm leaning toward giving it 5 but some the stuff on her trial for attempted murder on former President Gerald Ford drags a little, although some of Frommes wacky courtroom behaviour during the trial is amusing. I personally do not believe she had any intention on shooting Ford either, she was just was trying to draw attention to the environmental issues she was obsessed with.	2004-06-02

Also provides a look at the legal system of Iceland during this time period, (you could more or less legally kill someone as long as you had the money to compensate their family) and an account of the Icelanders gradual conversion to christianity.	2004-02-15

Even though he was greatly influenced by English/Celtic/Norse lore, in my opinion the Hobbit/L.O.T.R books are the greatest works of creative fiction ever written.	2004-02-15

Saga mostly concentrating on an elite band of Viking warriors known as the JomsVikings. Packed with blood and gore from beginning to end, even human sacrifices to gain favor from the Gods in battle!	2004-02-15

Chronicles the early years of the Outlaws MC, the pics in this book are amazing. The bridge being ridden across in the photo \\"Crossing the Ohio River\\" which is considered by many to be the greatest motorcycle photograph ever is about a five minute ride from where I once lived. Every time I rode across that bridge I thought about that pic. The Bikeriders is one of the few, if not the only, non-sensationalized books having to do with outlaw motorcycle clubs.	2004-02-15
US	27194645	R2PD7XAK5JEAYR	0246132981	723044359	The Ultimate Evil	Books	5	6	9	N	N	The Ultimate Evil	Book that lays out the theory that the Son of Sam murders were not the act of a lone nut but were in fact the work of several people who were involved in an organized cult. After reading this I am convinced that Berkowitz did not act alone, and that the Son of Sam murders were ritual murders by an occult group, possibly a highly organized one and that the powers that be were aware of this and did their best to cover this up. I do however think that Terry pushes some of his theories beyond the realm of reality, like linking the zodiac killer, Charles Manson, The Process Church of the Final Judgement to the murders and linking a murder that was obviously a drug related hit to the people that did the Son of Sam killings.	2004-02-15

Beatniks, hippies, Sonny Barger and the Hells Angels, the Black Panthers, the S.L.A, riots and civil unrest, SF evolving from hippie mecca to homosexual mecca, multitudes of nutty political and religious groups, and way too much other lunacy for me to list. Even today in spite of the yuppification of the area you can still feel the ghosts of the past in the air. On top of all that there was the Zodiac Killer who would taunt the police with encrypted messages with occult symbology that he demanded be put on the front page of the newspaper. After all his taunting and arrogance the Zodiac was never caught. Some have questioned this books research and conclusions but its an interesting account of the murders and investigation that will make you paranoid of every odd sound you hear around the house at night while your reading it.	2004-02-15

Venture back to a time when a mans honor and abilty to live by a warriors code was more important than any temporary comforts or instant gratification, or for that matter his life. Also I loved that along with the modern English on the opposite page was the same text in old English.	2004-02-15

Book still held the same magic for me after all these years when I read it again recently.	2004-02-15

Great easy to read info and history on the Celtic Warrior from the 300 BC-AD 100 time period and the illustrations are flat out amazing. Highly recomended for anybody interested in the Celts as well as reenactors and SCA types!	2004-02-15

The yankees being predominently of English stock were industrious, money grubbing, uptight dullards and the people of the south having more people of Celtic ancestry were a tempermental, emotional lot who would rather spend their days screwing their women and running through the woods with their hound dogs than working their fingers to the bone from sun up till sun down. Being a southerner of celtic ancestry maybe I should have gotten offended by some of the stereotypes laid out in this book but I found it interesting and entertaining instead.	2004-02-15

Lots of inter tribal conflict between celtic clans, conflict between norse raiders and settlers and local Irish celts, religious conflict between christian and celtic and norse pagan beliefs, conflict in Boru's life. If you have any interest in anything about Celts, Vikings, or fantasy type stuff you will most likely be really into this book.	2004-02-15

A compilation of the first three issues of the underground zine Answer Me! put out by Jim Goad and his now deceased wife Debbie. Interviews with subjects as diverse as Iceberg Slim, David Duke, Anton Lavey and Timothy Leary. Articles like the 100 most spectacular suicides, (which is at times quite hilariously written) going undercover at AA and NA meetings, serial killer profiles, (also made me laugh out loud) among lots of other interesting and diverse topics. The highlight for me though was the misanthropic, hateful rants dished out by the Goads. Further proving my theory that righteous hatred is a beautiful thing.	2004-02-15

Well think again. This is an almost all post pagan epic and they are as bloodthirsty in this one as they are in any. Lots of inter family killings for the right to have domain over the Orkney Isles, lots of raiding, lots political skullduggery, everything you know and love about these Viking sagas.	2004-02-15
