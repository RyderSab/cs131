The book paints a detailed picture of the clandestine agency starting just after the Second World War and moving forward in time.  I particularly enjoyed the interlacing of historically acurate events with thrilling fictonal adventure.<br />If you miss the days of the good Cold War spy stories, pick (or, since it has 892 pages, heft) this book up.  On par with the works of Le Carre, Richard Condon or Ludlum.	2002-08-05

A whaling ship in the 1800's in the middle of the Pacific is struck and sunk by a Sperm Whale in a matter of minutes.  While this in itself is astonishing, the fact that the survivors spent months trying to get to land in boats that were basically row boats, with little food and water,  is practically beyond belief.  I found I had to constantly remind myself that this was a true story<br />Philbrick tells the story well.  He conducted extensive research that makes the facts and details come to life.  For example, not only does he tell you that all they had on board was hardtack, but also how it was made, and how much would be required to sustain a sailor.  All of the facts are meticulously researched, and there are extensive notes and references at the end of the book.<br />I could not put it down. Great reading, and an even better true story.  The incident that inspire Melville to write Moby Dick.	2001-06-16

MFK Fisher is a delight to read, and this book speaks of her personal experience in France.  The book tells about the adventures of a dog that is in command, and how they come to know, watch and love this canine manager.<br />This is a great story to read as an adult, and especially wonderful to share with children.  As someone who lived abroad as a child, I would highly recommend it for anyone moving, or visiting a foreign country (especially France), as it tells of the adventures that one can find everywhere on the road. the adventures that one can find everywhere on the road.	2001-06-12

The woman is a former socialite is left to fend for herself a small rural North Carolina homestead when her father dies.  The story focuses on the immense effort required by each to live, and in the case of the veteran, to return home.  It also tells the romantic tale of the love between the two.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It moved at a relatively fast pace, and told a warm, tender and at some point quite painful story of the pain of war and the strength of love.  I was not sure what to expect when I first ordered it, but the premise seemed interesting.  My interest paid off in a heartwarming story, and some of the most literate writing produced in recent years.	2001-06-10

Stone has meticulously researched Van Gogh's life through letters the painter had written.  He then uses fiction to fill in the blank spaces, and add dialogue.  <br />What makes this book so powerful is that it adds new life to the Van Gogh masterpieces that most of us have seen.  The Potato Eaters for example is a masterpiece, but this book details the life of those who appear on the canvas, and Vincent's interaction with them.<br />This book is truly a masterpiece of writing about one of the great creators of masterpieces.

It is a wonderful exploration of the islands of Hawaii, and how it became a great melting pot of different cultures.  Along the way we, see how it was originally settled by people from Bora-Bora, changed by missionaries, worked by Japanese and Chinese, and ruled by the sugar trade.  <br />Michner is  a story teller, extraordinaire, and one must constantly remind oneself that this is only fiction.  The character are so real that we want to believe that this is really the story of what happened on the island.  However, if you know the islands, it is easy to see that there is truth buried in the fiction.  This book is for anyone whohas ever visited the islands, is planning to, or dreaming to.  It is filled with lush prose that paints an interesting fictional picture of Hawaii.	2001-05-28

While I love books about France and the French people, I feel that Rosenblum missed his mark.  While his writing was good, it lacked passion, and was quite self-indulgent.  <br />His travels take us on a culinary tour de France, but he seems detached and seems somewhat of a French cooking snob.  If you don't know the names of the famous 3 Star Chef's and restaurants he takes his readers to, you feel a bit like an outsider looking in through the window.  While there are some interesting side trips, like a visit to a truffle market, and an escargot farm, these are basically stories from a reporter's notebook.  He is constantly trying to get the answer to the question about the changing role of food in France.  The answer: like everything else, it is changing...and it is remaining the same.  <br />With so many good books about France and cuisine, I would put this one down low on my list.  Try - Paris To The Moon by Adam Gopnick; French Impressions: The Adventures of an American Family by John Littell; or Ruth Reichl's Tender on The Bone, or just about anything by M.F.K. Fischer.	2001-05-28

While both books are autobiographical, the first focused more on the humor and tenderness of the events in her life (and of course the food), and this one seems to focus more on her life (and the food).<br />If this is your first Reichl exploration, stop...click over to &quot;other books by this author,&quot; and order a copy of &quot;Tender on The Bone.&quot;  If you are a Reichl fan, this is a decent read, but wait for the paperback.	2001-05-15

If you enjoy cold-war thrillers, Robert Harris has figured out how to bring them back to life in this post cold-war era.  This book has an outstanding plot tied to a secret notebook that was supposedly stolen from Stalin on the day that he died.  From the moment we learn of this missing notebook (on about page 2) through to the last page, Harris takes us on a wild ride from Moscow through the Northern reaches of what used to be know as The Soviet Union.  The story never slows.<br />Harris is a masterful fiction writer.  He uses words that paint pictures so vivid that we feel we are with the characters.  He weaves historical facts into a wonderful tale that had me reading every free minute over the course of three days.

Many people talk about someday hiking the trail, or doing it over a period of time. Bryson, with little experience or expertise heads out and actually does it.  He takes along a slightly delinquent, sidekick, Katz whose only qualification for the hike is that he knows Bryson.  Together they lead us on a delightful walk.  A walk that brings to mind what would happen if the Marx Brothers and Three Stooges hiked the trail together.<br />Bryson pokes fun at much of what he finds along the trail, but he writes about it with a humor and wit that will have you laughing out loud.  I have read some of the other reviews, especially those by AT aficionados.  While Bryson may not be their idea of the dedicated Appalachian Trail fanatic, their reviews read as if they need to hike less and get a sense of humor.  This book is witty and written with clarity that is rare today.  If you need a few hours of enjoyment, walk the trail with Bryson, you will not be disappointed.	2001-03-11

He writes with wit and clarity, and I sometimes find it hard to contain my laughter.  \\"In A Sunburned Country\\" is well written, and Bryson obviously spent an extensive amount of time traveling through the country, but it lacked something for me in terms of depth.<br />Perhaps it is because the other places he has written about are countries or areas where he has extensive understanding of the culture and colloquialisms that he is less of a tourist and more of a commentator.  In this book, while he does play the role of commentator, he is also a tourist. <br />If you have not read Bryson before, start with \\"Notes From A Small Island,\\" or \\"A Walk In The Woods.\\" Both of these books in my opinion are better examples of his wonderful style.  If you have read Bryson before and enjoy his writing, you will probably enjoy this book, but will also be anxiously awaiting his next and hoping it is as good as his earlier books.	2001-02-20

I have read most of what he has written, and I found this to be one of the more enjoyable and accessible books.  What makes this a powerful book is that it takes his theoretical concept (Multiple Intelligence), and explores it from the perspective of renowned individuals who creatively exhibited a specific intelligence style.<br />Gardner's theories are groundbreaking and this book is a great introduction, but also don't miss his seminal work in this area (Multiple Intelligence).  I have had two children that have participated in multiple intelligence programs in school, and the results of those programs have been outstanding.  I truly believe that if the concept that his work explored were deployed throughout our educational institutions that we would have many more \\"learners\\" as opposed to students.<br />As the author of Aha! - 10 Ways To Free Your Creative Spirit and Find Your Great Ideas, I was deeply influenced by Gardner's work.

I guess in a way, although certainly the stories are much different, the richness of the experience is something that I hand in common with the author that made this book wonderfully rich to me.  However, his ability to tell the stories with such wit and quality writing will make it a treasure to anyone who picks it up.<br />One chapter, The Great Mayonnaise War was so funny I had to stop reading it on an airplane so that my laughing did not disturb others.

I loved the title and cover photo on this book, and had great hopes for the book since the writer had reported from Paris for The International Herald Tribune for many years.  While the book is well written, I felt that many of the essays failed to connect with the French spirit and joie de vivre.  I found some of the writing to be dry and the book slow.  Each story was originally an article in the paper, and while they might have worked reading them with the morning coffee, they did not work for me as a collection.<br />The book title would lead you to believe that the book is about France, some of the stories take place in other countries and I could not figure out how they ended up in the book.   Additionally the last section of the book focuses on a group of European filmmakers that would have worked well as a Filmography, but for my money did not belong in a book of this title.<br />Don't get me wrong, there are some interesting and well-written pieces in this book, but you have to trundle through pages that I feel are slow and dated to get to them.  If you have not read much about France, I recommend Adam Gopnick's \\"Paris to The Moon,\\" John Littell's \\"French Impressions,\\" or for a humorous perspective any of Peter Mayle's \\"Provence\\" works.

I received this book as a gift, and at first glance thought a book by a food critic sounded dull.  Was I wrong.  This book is filled with great,laugh-out-loud stories that show how this excellent writer developed her love of fine food.  <br />The writer leads from her early deplorable culinary experiences concocted by her mother - &quot;the queen of mould,&quot; to rich descriptions of a dinner in Greece where we can almost taste the food through her descriptive prose.  <br />Feast your way through this book.  You won't be dissapointed.	2001-01-08

This book reveals many hidden secrets on Maui that even the seasoned visitor will find it of value.  <br />Over the course of our visits to the Island, we have had an opportunity to take part in a large number of activities with many of the different companies that serve the tourist trade on Maui.  Doughty and Friedman's evaluation of the different activities and their providers is fair and accurate.  They give accurate, and often funny evaluation of restaurants and locations (my favorite being the Mexican restaurant about which they state &quot;...we now know what hospital food must taste like in Mexico.&quot;  <br />You often wonder if travel writers are paid off to say what they do about mediocre activities and hotels.  These writes call it like it is.  My only regret is that they have revealed many of the places that took us years to find (and are relatively hidden), meaning that they will probably be more crowded in the future. If you want to avoid tour rip-off's and enjoy your time while on The Valley Isle, make sure you add this book to your luggage.	2001-01-08

The book has an interesting, but not too believable plot, with some unusual twists and turns.  Unless you are a hard-core Ludlum fan, save this for beach-reading next summer when you can pick up a paperback copy for seven or eight bucks.	2001-01-07

For me, the great plot and vivid writing were missing.  This was a bland and  slow-moving story.  If you must read it -- wait for the paperback.  It is  not worth the price of the hardcover.	1999-07-09

Wolfe rambled around and took me on a herky-jerky ride through interesting sub-plots that ended nowhere.  He could have told the story in 360 pages and left out the 300 pages of  repetitive character descriptions.<br />I loved his earlier work.  This one I  could have left off my summer list.  <br />The ending stunk!  I put the book  down and said is this it?  This author wasted my time.	1999-07-09
