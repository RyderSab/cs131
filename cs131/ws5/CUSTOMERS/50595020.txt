If you already have a wireless network, you will still find a great collection of solutions for adding whole-house audio and video to your wireless network, security enhancements, and even a step by step guide for building your own neighborhood \\"hotspot.\\" <br /> <br />Like the Neil Randall's previous book, PC Magazine Windows XP Solutuions, this one is packed with practical, hands-on guidance, written in an easy to understand and follow style.  The Author never talks over your head, but doesn't insult your intelligence either.  The book is rich with photos, computer screen captures, and diagrams, and the Authors have made generous use of sidebars and notes. <br /> <br />Chapter 8 Security Tips and Tricks had some enhancements that I was not already using (including a cool honeypot solution), and I thought that Chapter 14 Setting Up an Entertainment Network had a lot to offer.   <br /> <br />The book also has some chapters in its last part on wireless solutions for mobile, and office which build and expand on information in the previous chapters. However, these are a bit thin, and probably things most network admins already know.   <br /> <br />The real value in this book is its great guidance for building, extending and expanding a home network with wireless technologies. But, it is still appropriate for those of us who have a wireless network and are looking to enhance security, add new features, and troubleshoot problems. <br /> <br />Recommended.	2004-12-03

Russ Caslis - the guy behind those cool mods you have seen online like the Millennium Falcon and Aircraft Carrier mods (both included in the book, by the way) has written an excellent guide that is broken into 2 main parts.  Part I is called Basic Training, and covers all the skills you need to mod your case -cooling systems, cable management, windows, blowholes, soldiering, even working with acrylic, and a brief guide to overclocking. <br /> <br />Part II has 9 complete mods with step by step instructions. Looks like there is also a website with the book that has color photos for all the projects and other stuff - [...] <br /> <br />This is the most complete book I have seen for learning casemodding skills, and highly recommended for anyone who has seen a cool mod on the web and wondered, \\"how'd they do that?\\"	2004-11-19

To some, hacking is a dark art of exploitation.  To others it might be something that is actually called reverse engineering.  In this book, a hack, or hacking refers to what \\"hacking\\" started out as - discovering a cool shortcut or workaround, an neat trick, a new use, or an undiscovered tool or accessory.  As the author mentions in the Introduction, not all hacks have to be about technology, or even high-tech which I think threw off one of the reviewers of this book.  Never hacked a TV antenna with aluminum foil for better reception, or fixed something with duct tape?    Having said that, there are some pretty great hacks in this book. For instance there is good coverage of battery replacement (save yourself that Apple service fee,)using iPod with Outlook (a bit tricky,) install Linux on the iPod (you cant get hackier than that,) move playlists around machines with XML, AppleScripting with iTunes, and others.    The book is not super hard core, but is accessible to everyone, which I think is the point.  Those who are expecting detailed schematics, or instructions on disassembly (why would you do that?) will be disappointed.  Honestly, there is not really all that much you can \\"hack\\" into an iPod - it's a pretty closed system.  But, the author has done a great job of finding the edges, and the fringes of iPod hacking, and the book is a great resource for iPod users, getting everything into one place.      Hacking iPod + iTunes absolutely ranks up there with the other iPod books on the market, and covers things a lot of them don't - making it truly unique.    Recommended.	2004-08-19

The word &quot;hacking&quot; in the title refers to all the tweaks, modifications, optimizations, and customizations covered in the book. <br />  <br /> If you are a Windows XP user who already knows the basics, this book is the perfect source for making your Windows XP install your own. Steve Sinchak does a great job of guiding even first time &quot;hackers&quot; into the world of system customization.  <br />  <br /> Contents at a Glance: <br />  <br /> Part I: Customizing Your System <br />  <br /> Chapter 1: Customizing the Look of the Startup <br /> Chapter 2: Customizing User Navigation <br /> Chapter 3: Hacking the Desktop <br /> Chapter 4: Customizing the Appearance of the Windows Interface <br /> Chapter 5: Hacking Windows Explorer <br /> Chapter 6: Exploring Other Windows Enhancements <br />  <br /> Part II: Increasing Your System's Performance <br />  <br /> Chapter 7: Analyzing Your System <br /> Chapter 8: Speeding Up the System Boot <br /> Chapter 9: Making Your Computer Load Faster <br /> Chapter 10: Making Your Computer More Responsive <br /> Chapter 11: Speeding Up Your Computer <br />  <br /> Part III: Securing Your System <br />  <br /> Chapter 12: Protecting Your Computer from Intruders <br /> Chapter 13: Fighting Spam, Spyware, and Viruses <br /> Chapter 14: Protecting Your Privacy <br />  <br /> The first 6 chapters are about fiddling with the user interface and some pretty cool eye candy. You'll find out how to change the system bootscreen, building a custom Welcome/login interface, an easy way to recompile explorer.exe to change START button text (with the book it's not as hard as is sounds,) build virtual desktops, create custom themes, and hack Windows Explorer. <br />  <br /> Part II was the most interesting to me, and in my opinion is the best part of the book. If you are looking to squeeze every possible ounce of speed from your XP machine, here you will find answers. First you will get a snapshot of your system's current speed situation using some great benchmarking and analysis tools. <br />  <br /> Next,this book guides you through shaving time off the boot process by hacking the boot.ini file, tweaking BIOS settings, turning off services you dont need (complete with great explainations of what each one does, and a couple of suggested configurations for maximum boot speed,)and maximizing boot file location on the hard disk. <br />  <br /> Once the boot is complete, the book shows you how to make XP load faster by adjusting startup programs, making registry hacks to filesystem settings, and even network IP settings for faster load times. <br />  <br /> And when XP is up and running you'll get a look at how the prefetcher works, registry hacks to tweak its performance, boost Intel CPU performance, tune the paging file, optimize Internet connections for maximum speed, and boost the speed of your home network browsing. <br />  <br /> The book wraps up with some great tricks for securing your XP install, dealing with Viruses and Spyware, and protectig your privacy. <br />  <br /> This title does include a CD, and I generally write those off as a little gimmicky. But in this case, it adds tremendous value to the book. Not only does it come with 45 hacking tools and toys, most importantly it includes .reg files for registry hacks, and many of them have &quot;undo&quot; files if you want to revert to the old settings. Simply double clicking on these .reg files makes the registry hacks automatic, and keeps you from having to trudge through the Win XP registry. <br />  <br /> If you are a Windows XP beginner, this book is not for you. This is a great guide for Windows XP power users - those who know the basics, and are not afraid to dive in and do some under the hood work on their system. Recommended. <br />  <br />	2004-08-03

I know a lot of reader's are not, and I'll agree that he is probably not even in my Top 10.  But, nevertheless, he does write entertaining stories.<br />I dont get too hung up on the inaccuracies of geography, language, or history.  It is fiction afterall, and in most cases, I dont even notice, because I let myself get into the story.  <br />Angels &amp; Demons is a case where you just gotta go with it.  Yes, there are &quot;yeah right&quot; moments in the plot, and no its not better than Da Vinci Code.  But it is an engaging read, and Brown certainly keeps you interested.<br />Recommended.	2004-07-09

She needs help with basic things like uninstalling programs, and defragging her hard drive from time to time.  Most of her problems are the result of cute cursors and a \\"free screensaver\\" fetish, but I digress.<br />Unfortunately, most of the contents of this book are common sense to the majority of Windows users - delete old files, keep your inbox clean, use the built-in defragger from time to time, dont forget to back up your files - you get the idea.  If you are relatively new to Windows, or if the idea of general computer maintenance is something that you are not familiar with, then Degunking Windows will offer you some very basic guidelines to keeping your system relatively clean.<br />If you already know the basics, you might benefit from the few chapters that cover some intermediate topics such as keeping the registry clean with some shareware tools, some cursory tips on preventing spam and the like.  But if you are looking for coverage of topics like removing and preventing spyware, this book's 3 paragraphs on the subject wont help much.<br />Other chapters in the book seem a bit out of place, such as the security chapter.  Dont get me wrong - getting Windows secured is a nightmare at best, and impossible depending on who you ask, but the security tips in the book dont really do anyting towards the title's goal of \\"degunking.\\"<br />Beyond the very basic, this title does not provide much in the way of improving speed and performance of your Windows system.	2004-07-09

Both wired and wireless networking is covered (in their own chapters,) and it offers good advice on selecting equipment, as well as complete step by step instructions for setting up the network, installing computers and other machines (like TiVo, Media Servers, networked DVD players and more,) sharing internet access, printers, all the configuration and troubleshooting - everything you need to get up and running with a home network.<br />But for me, the thing that really sets this book off from other home networking books is the Home Networking Cookbook section. This part provides instructions and setup for a dozen different network configurations ranging from the basic LAN with router, to separate modem and router locations, to expanded wired LAN with wireless access points, secure remote access configurations and more. This alone was worth the price of the book as in each configuration it outlines the equipment needed, the network layout, configuration and setup.<br />If you are new to home networking, this book is perfect for you and will get you up and running in no time.  If you are a bit more experienced, you will still find the troubleshooting and configuration sections useful, and for me the Cookbook section was the quickest and easiest way to set up a variety of configurations.	2004-07-08

In fact, the introduction, and back cover indicate that you will build 3 complete websites in the book, so its obvious that you can't just jump around and hope to keep everything straight.  (I don't do web development that way, either.)<br />What I do want to point out about this book, is Imar Spaanjaars - one of the 3 authors on the book, who is absolutely amazing.  I subscribe to the book's support forum at p2p.wrox.com, and Imar never fails to answer a dreamweaver question, or provide a solution - even when it does not involve the book.

Well, it did show me how to boost my signal - for up to 20 miles!  Ok, seriously, long distance wi-fi is one of the 15 projects in this book, but my solution was actually in building the high-gain antenna project in chapter 4, which did indeed solve my reception problems.<br />The book is very well written, and has plenty of photos to guide you along the way.

Perhaps that reviewer hasn't read the book closely enough. In chapter 2 (beginning on page 57) the author explains in great detail how to enable backdoor mode for the newer TiVos by modifying the disk directly. That lets anyone running any version of the TiVo software (including 4.0 and 4.01) access backdoor mode.  Furthermore, there aren't any backdoors specific to 4.0 or 4.01, except the Free Space Indicator code which the book does cover (on page 53.)<br />And the hacks in the book WILL work on Series 2 - once you get access to it.

Always looking for a something cool to tinker with, I found my perfect match in Linux Toys.  <br />My first project this past weekend was to jump to chapter 10 and build the &quot;Digital Receptionist.&quot;  Using an unused PC (PII 300, 4GB, 128MB) and an old modem I was able to build the project, and I now get my phone messages from home answered by the machine and emailed to me at work - how cool is that?<br />There are 12 more projects in the book, and I will probably do the digital video recorder next.<br />I am not a complete Linux newbie - I have a RH 9 box on my home network, but I am no expert either.  However, this is Chris Negus, the same guy that writes the Red Hat Linux Bible (great way to get the CD distro) so I found it very easy to read, and not at all intimidating.<br />If you have an old PC in the closet, or just like to play with Linux, get this book - it's a blast.	2003-10-17

Having read, and not liked, 2 other books on the subject, I can tell you that this one was worth the wait.<br />This book is not simply a collection of tips and tricks, nor is it an essay on the various things you can do if you want to go and download this or that software.  It is a very easy to understand, hand-on guide that actually walks you through this stuff step by step.<br />The CD that comes with it is a beautiful thing - something that was lacking in some of the other books.  It has the hacks on it, and all you do it put it in your PC and restart, and it boots into Linux.  Then you just follow along with the book.<br />This weekend, I was able to install a second hard drive, and added 140 hours of recording time.  But most importantly - I didnt ruin my TiVo.<br />Now, I am not a complete techno-newbie, I have upgraded a video card and installed a CD burner here and there, but I am completely new to this hacking thing. This book made it less imtimidating to try, and it went a lot smoother than I thought. Even though I am just getting started, I am hooked already.<br />If you have any interest in this hacking TiVo thing at all, get this book.	2003-10-13

It was a great trip down memory lane, and is actually to blame for my current MAME addiction.<br />I guess I just got a little lost in Japan (read it and you will know what I mean.)<br />Still, a very entertaining book, and one I recommend.	2003-10-09

I bought the last 2 versions of Leo Laporte's TechTV book (I even have the one where they misspelled &quot;Almanac&quot; on the cover!) and have been a big fan.  But, I have been reading PC Magazine longer than I have Leo's books, and when I discovered this little gem I was very excited.<br />The PC Magazine Technology Almanac is jam-packed with tips, tricks, and insider information that I can actually use.  And I know I am supposed to read it a day at a time, but I find I am already up to March of next year!<br />And the best part is that is comes with a free subscription to the magazine, so I was able to renew for free!  How can you loose?<br />If you, like me, have been buying Leo's book, take a look at this one from PC Magazine.  It is absolutely the better of the 2, and is full of stuff you can really use.<br />Sorry Leo, but I switched!	2003-10-08
US	50595020	RTCRBCMFWWZRD	1592001114	376624437	Hacking the TiVo	Books	2	82	89	N	N	Leaves you asking more questions than when you started	Im a big TiVo fan, and was really excited when I started hearing about the whole hacking thing, and was looking forward to the 3 books coming out (this one, the TiVo Hacks book, and the upcoming Hacking TiVo book - which I cant wait to get my hands on.)<br />When I went through this one I was usually left with more questions than answers.  The author is a hardcore UNIX guy, and he, unfortunately, expects that you are too. Im certainly not a newbie, but I am not a UNIX administrator either.<br />Many times he gets ahead of himself, and describes a hack that involves doing something he hasnt covered yet, which was really frustrating - having to flip back and forth to try to figure it all out.<br />It is also a little out of date, or just wrong about certain hardware hacks like the TurboNet card for instance, and I was very disappointed that some of the stuff that is supposed to be on the CD isnt there.  Having all the software in one place and being able to install it on your TiVo easily is what is really what a good TiVo Cd is about.  There are some places on the internet that sell TiVo boot CDs that are better than the one that comes with this book in my opinion.<br />Ill keep looking for the best TiVo hacking book - so should you.	2003-09-25

I was, however disappointed when I actually got my hands on it.<br />This book touts 100 \\"hacks\\" but once you get into it, you will discover that many of these \\"hacks\\" are really just steps - instructions if you will, and that many of them rely on other \\"hacks.\\"  For instance, the steps involved in removing the cover from your TiVo (a few screws) counts as a \\"hack.\\"  There are several more like this.<br />The book seems to have been forced into the O'Reilly Hacks format, and probably would have been better were it freed up a bit.  <br />The description says its 288 pages, but in fact it really only has 239 pages of what they are calling \\"hacks\\" and with 100 hacks in the book, you can see that there is on average less than 2.5 pages of coverage per \\"hack.\\"  I'm not saying that each \\"hack\\" is only 2.5 pages, many are larger, but I think you can see that the coverage is light.  I was very disappointed that many of the \\"hacks\\" were no more than a single page telling me to download and install a piece of code from the web.<br />The writing style is fine, but I did get the feeling the author might not be extremely knowledgable in the TiVo space.  There were several places where he had the opportunity to mention some of the real \\"gotchas\\" when working with TiVo drives and the like, but came up short.  With all the contributors, I wonder if he acted a bit more as editor than author.  <br />So, if you are looking for something with a little more meat to it, look elsewhere.	2003-09-16

Many of the articles I read and online sites recommended XML Spy to jump start XML development.<br />I actually came to Amazon.com to buy XML Spy, but decided on the book, which came with a 90 day version of the software (the download from Xmlspy.com is only 30 days.)<br />I was very pleased with the author's style - clear and easy to understand, and combined with the Spy IDE I have already created my first XML-based web app.<br />This turned out to be the perfect combination for me.	2003-02-25

If you have heard about blogs in the popular media, or have happened upon other people's blogs, this book is a great way to get started doing your own.<br />Admittedly, the authors might take this blogging stuff a bit too seriously.  But they explained how the tools work, how to get started, and how to get beyond the basics.  I was able to create a new blog, get it hosted, and added a comment system.  I plan to tackle templates next.<br />If you are looking for a short, easy, hands-on read for the nuts and bolts of blogging, this one does the trick.	2002-10-02

But time and time again, I find myself going back to this book to remind myslef of something I forgot, or a tip or trick to make things easier.<br />This particular version - MX, has a lot of changes from version 4, and that was where this particular book really made a difference for me, as all the new features are called out with a special icon so I could pick them up quickly.<br />Since the book 'starts at the beginning' I could see where this would be a good book for beginnnig web designers or even developers who might want to use DW as their new editor of choice for PHP, ASP or the like.<br />Thanks Joe.	2002-10-02

This one was much clearer, and made more sense.  I found the examples to be very good, even though I can now write ASPs that do the same  thing in less space.  Showing the long way around is often a great learning  tool so that you understand everything - I guess it worked.	1999-12-07
