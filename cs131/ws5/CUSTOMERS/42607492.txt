Rall has pretty in-depth knowledge of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and other neighboring countries, their customs, languages and other things. <br /> <br />Afghanistan is basically like any other country - rapists in the middle of the street, 15 year olds standing on roof tops with guns, bombs dropping from the sky, horribly hot or cold weather, panhandlers, kill anyone you feel like there is no law, Middle Ages lifestyle.. you know the normal :) (as you can tell i'm being sarcastic about Afghanistan being normal) <br /> <br />Actually I was really surprised about how Afghanistan was described. Our media, which I followed non-stop from October 2001 and on, described everything very differently. \\"Everything is wonderful\\" or \\"Great progress is being made\\" they said. I don't understand how some journalists can actually go to Afghanistan, see what is going on and still not do critical reporting. <br /> <br />Rall's experiences ranged from: possibly being killed, to not knowing who to trust. In Afghanistan - Taliban fighters getting a shave and turn into Northern Alliance members. Pornography, alcohol and opium are rampant. It is chaos and a mess. People are walking around and they step on a land mine and they are blown to smithereens.  If you want to get anywhere you have to pay starving and dirt poor Afghans a ton of money for help and transportation.  A British BBC reporter's skin gets ripped!! From some maniac Taliban members. <br /> <br />After all this death and despair, you may be wondering what solution Rall comes up with. Well it is neither the left or right solution - it is basically to leave Afghanistan and let them take care of themselves. After the Soviet invasion, Northern Alliance feuds, Taliban and U.S. bombings, maybe Rall has a good point.   <br /> <br />Even after his near death experiences, horrible rashes and other problems, Rall says in the beginning of his book: my friends said don't go to Afghanistan and I answered by saying \\"there are millions of people who live there everyday, i'm only going to be there for a couple of weeks. Please think about them when you read this book.\\"	2005-05-28

Bush	Books	5	76	92	N	N	America at its best	After the results of the 2004 Presidential election were made clear, a student from USC started a website [...] The book is a collection of pictures from that website. <br /> <br />Ted Rall (author and political cartoonist) wrote a forward for this book. People from all over the U.S. wrote how they felt and took pictures of themselves holding signs. Some signs were very creative. I would say these are not only some of America's best people, these are also some of the best Democrats. The people in this book are in the long haul and will always work for better education, healthcare and human rights issues. <br /> <br />If you are non-American, I recommend taking a look at this book so you can see a much better alternative to the sorry \\"elected\\" officials who represent this country.	2005-05-01

He also makes fun of Clinton, Limbaugh and a few others. <br /> <br />More than the politicians though, I blame the American people because most people simply do not pay attention. Recently a survey was given to people who voted in the 2004 Presidential election and 70% of Americans couldn't even name one bill that Congress has passed since January. 70% - and that is the people who voted in the last election, 79 million citizens over the age of 18 didn't even vote. That just gives you a feel for the level of political apathy in this country. <br /> <br />Here is some information from the book: <br /> <br />- The real cause of breast cancer can be linked to harmful chemicals which are dumped by companies. <br />- Our taxdollars subsidize products being advertised to Japan, or outsourcing jobs to Puerto Rico! <br />- Basically our media is propoganda for corporations. <br /> <br />This is a entertaining book and Hightower makes it easy for people to understand government policy. I would recommend \\"Thieves in High Places\\" over this book though because it is more current :0) Also you can visit [...] if you would like too see some current news or things he is working on. <br /> <br />	2005-04-28

It is very easy to follow, it is not boring and you get some good historical facts.  I read this book as a balance to my own beliefs (I'm very sympathetic towards Muslims).  <br /> <br />I think Manji mainly wrote this book for Muslims to open up the dialogue about women's rights, human rights and gays.  <br /> <br />Manji starts of with her childhood. Manji questions various aspects of Muslim culture and she wonders why she has to do certain things and why she \\"just can't\\" do certain things.  She talks about places she has worked and various speaking events she has done and arguments she has had with various Muslim scholars and others. Basically Manji has a lot of appreciation for our spectacular freedoms in the western world. Manji talks about a trip she makes to Israel, she also criticizes various Muslim countries and their customs. I think Manji's mission is noble and the dialogue does need to be opened - for every religion. Every religion has problems. I think it is always better if a person who actually follows the religion criticizes it - like Manji is doing. It is irritating when someone who does not even follow the religion starts criticizing it - which is done to Muslims all the time. <br /> <br />I'm not Muslim but I have a lot of sympathy with Muslims and I disagree with some of Manji's opinions - she does leave out stuff about how Muslims have gotten the raw end of the deal (the U.S. backed CIA coup in 1953 which overthrew the freely elected Iranian President Mossaddeq or Iran Air Flight 655 that was shot down off the coast of Iran by the U.S. accidently which killed over 200 people which the U.S. has not apologized for, or the fact that the U.S. gave BOTH Iran and Iraq weapons while they were fighting in the 80s) However, this is a dissent book, so Manji is showing us a certain viewpoint. If I enjoyed this book, I think anyone can, especially Muslims. If you are Muslim, you should read this book and then engage Manji in meaningful/progressive debate. <br /> <br />I applaud Manji for speaking out.	2005-04-10

This book was written in 2002. It documents his life: during the Vietnam war, after the war, and during his terms as Senator, also his 2000 bid for the Presidency. McCain offers a lot of introspect into his life and his decisions. I sometimes get upset when I see the decisions Senators and other politicians make but after reading this book I see that there are so many different types of people and special interests that politicians have to please. They are constantly walking on a thin line.    McCain's father and grandfather were both members of the military. His ancestors also fought in the civil war. McCain's family has a rich history. After reading this book, I can see McCain has a deep love for this country. I liked how McCain takes accountability for his decisions and tries his best to be honest.    I liked McCain's feelings about how he feels poor people fought in the Vietnam war while rich privileged kids got to stay home safe.  McCain feels that this country belongs to the poor people - because they have fought all of our wars.      I'm by no stretch a Republican (I am conservative though), however, if McCain was President right now - I would feel this country has an honest, patriotic American as the President. This is an inspiring book and is also well written.	2005-03-05
US	42607492	R2GFON6WT0XSYQ	1576753018	331881073	Confessions of an Economic Hit Man	Books	5	29	34	N	N	Everything makes sense now...	Guys, if you have time to just read one book, this is the one. If you read this book, I guarantee, you will be able to answer these questions:    - Why we are at war with Iraq  - Why people in other countries don't like us  - Why we have and still do support dictators   - Globalization  - Our foreign policy  - Why the problems inside our country are going to take much more effort to solve than simply voting for a candidate to be President    This book is about a man who wanted to make money, feel prestige and travel all over the world. Him and his company purposely would make exaggerated economic forecasts to make poor countries indebted to us. Basically, once these countries signed onto our projects, they would have to keep paying us back and they wouldn't be able to spend that money on their own people so those people would get poorer and poorer.  If we later needed favors from these countries or needed their military space, they would have to give it to us.  The author says that there are many people like this in many American companies who hold prestigious titles but what they do is wrong. Of course, in our country if you make a lot of money, you are thought of as \\"successful\\", if you don't question the morals and ethics of companies and our countries dealings - you are rewarded.    If you are not sure if you want to buy the book, you can read an excerpt at this website: [...] or go to [...] to find out about the author. Or you can read it from the library or the bookstore.    Here are some important parts of the book:    1.  Did you ever wonder why we went to war with Vietnam? Why was communism so bad? - Because we can't do business in a country that has communism (unbelievable!!) (And if communism was so bad, why does China hold up our U.S. economy now? That is pretty hypocritical isn't it?)    2.  The highly popular, democratically elected Iranian President, Mohammad Mossadegh was overthrown by our CIA. The reason for this was that BP (British Petroleum) wanted to exploit Iran's oil and sought the help of the U.S. President Mossadegh would not allow the British and Americans to exploit Iran's oil and nationalized all of the oil.  So an American CIA operative went into Iran and won over people through payoffs and threats - which in turn led to street riots and violent demonstrations that gave the impression that President Mossadegh was not popular. In the end Mossadegh went down.  (Again, for all our talk of democracy, we certainly don't let it happen in other countries)    3.  In retaliation for U.S. aid to Israel, Saudi Arabia imposed an oil embargo on the U.S. The embargo did not last long but Wall Street, our government and corporations decided that never again would they tolerate an oil embargo. Immediately our government made Saudi Arabia an ally and offered all sorts of technical support, military training, etc. (Even though the women there can vote or drive and one person is (still) beheaded every week for a \\"crime\\" like drinking alcohol)  Guys, Idi Amin, this brutal dictator from Uganda who ordered the killing of 200,000 civilians was exiled from Uganda in 1979 and he lived happily in Saudi Arabia until he died in 2003. The White House protested slightly but not too much because, hey, we don't want to make the Saudi monarch angry.    How does this relate to Iraq? Well Saddam played our game throughout the 80s. So when he gassed the Kurds, Shiites and Iranians (with weapons we gave him) we didn't mind as long as he was generous with Iraq's oil.  Then he crossed the line when he invaded Kuwait so we put sanctions on the people of his country. We tried to persuade him, hey just give us your oil and we'll leave you alone. But he didn't want to play our game anymore - so out he goes. Pretty scary, huh? If he shared his oil, he would still be in power.    Finally, here's a good quote from the book:    \\"Stop being so greedy and so selfish. Realize that there is more to the world than your big houses and fancy stores.People are starving and you worry about oil for your cars. Babies are dying of thirst and you search the fashion magazines for the latest styles. Nations like ours are drowning in poverty, but your people don't even hear our cries for help. You shut your ears to the voices of those who try to tell you these things. You label them radicals or Communists. You must open your hearts to the poor and downtrodden, instead of driving them further into poverty and servitude. There's not much time left. If you don't change, you're doomed.\\"    After 9/11, if we really wanted to prevent another terrorist atrocity, here's what we should have done:    1.Caught Bin Laden  2.Created forms of mass transportation and reduced our dependency on oil as if our life depends on it - because it does.  3. Given our foreign policy a massive overhaul    And please, before you call people from developing countries \\"backwards\\", read this (this happened to me): I was in a developing country and this boy who was severely disabled and could barely walk was selling pencils for one rupee (a couple of pennies) each. I gave him some money but told him he doesn't have to give me the pencil. Then I went on my way. About a mile later when I stopped, the boy was running after me (or more like wobbling as fast as he could). He told me that he wasn't going to just take the money like that, and he gave me a pencil.  This boy could barely walk and he was about 14 years old.	2005-02-23

When I read books like the excellent \\"Citizens of the Empire\\" I feel hope that yes, there are people who look at others (different races and religions) as humans and not as some strange people which we must step on. <br /> <br />Jensen gives some answers to the blind \\"patriotism\\" that has taken over our country. Things like \\"America is the greatest\\" and \\"Support our Troops\\" are used to frame debates and anyone who dissents is labeled as \\"anti-American\\" - whatever that means.  <br /> <br />Jensen tries to appeal to basic human senses of empathy and humanity. He talks about the reality of war - cluster bombing and other types of indiscriminate bombing which lead to death, destruction and despair.  Remember guys, each time an innocent person dies in Iraq, Afghanistan, or wherever we attack/have attacked - we are killing that person. You, me - our tax dollars are used to buy weapons to kill those people. <br /> <br />The conclusion that the author reaches at the end of this book is this: If you truly want peace, join the anti-war movement. To people who actually research U.S. history and our destructive foreign policy, this seems like common sense. But for others who actually think that it is ok to invade nations and kill innocent people - Jensen's words won't make sense. Perhaps in the future when America is not the superpower of the world - which is going to happen within 20 years, naysayers of Jensen and blind patriots will finally realize reality.	2005-02-11

The first few pages are tough reads if you aren't use to being challenged to think, but I got use to it.  I was actually able to read the whole book and I really enjoyed it.   <br /> <br />Chomsky goes over how for the last 50 years; America has gone into other countries for its own selfish interests.  Americans were/are either brainwashed by history textbooks or simply didn't/don't care because of video games and TV to notice any of this stuff.  After reading this book, you won't look at the \\"news\\" as anything but a bunch of ignorant nonsense that is promoting one untrue way of thinking.  Chomsky has gone to India, Turkey, Cuba, Israel - almost all of the countries he talks about and he has seen first hand what goes on in this countries. He also collaborates with various people in different countries to swap news clippings.  What I'm trying to say is - if you want to know what is going on, you don't have to go to 100 different sources, Dr. Chomsky has done all of the homework and it is right here.  Also - believe it or not, Chomsky was able to weave in some funny parts so you get some good laughs. <br /> <br />Here are some parts I highlighted from the book which I thought were really good: <br /> <br />On the war on drugs: The current things we are doing are not working, prevention and treatment are much more effective. Why don't we spend our money on this?  Also land that we poison in Colombia (so drugs won't be able to grow) to \\"save ourselves\\" from drugs causes children to die or suffer from sickness and injury. <br /> <br />After pleading guilty to misdemeanor counts in the Iran-contra affair, Abrams received a Christmas Eve pardon from President Bush I in 1992, and was appointed by Bush II to lead the National Security Council's office for Near East and North African affairs -the senior director job that oversees Arab-Israeli relations and U.S. efforts to promote peace in the troubled region.  (Hmm, I wonder why we can't seem to fix anything over there...) <br /> <br />Saddam did have weapons - but we gave them to him! And when he gassed the Kurds in the 80s (a monstrous thing indeed) we supported him. <br /> <br />I just can't go over everything but hopefully you understand what I am saying.  Please remember, when he criticizes this country or any other one, he is criticizing the government, not the people. Also, we can't blame everything on Bush. We, the American people did not and are not doing enough to stop the Iraqi war. So do whatever you can because our tax dollars are being used to kill innocent people. When someone pointed this out to me (this simple fact that most Americans are oblivious to), I had trouble sleeping at night.  So remember, if you think this war is worth fighting, please go fight it or send your children. If this war is not important enough for your children to die for, it is not important enough for anyone's children to die - even if they are a different color or religion then you.	2005-01-31

This book is written by Bill Jabanoski who has heroically went all over the world, from Central America, to Beirut, Africa and beyond to uncover important stories of our destructive foreign policy. <br /> <br />What is interesting is that in Central America (when we were funding the Contras in Nicaragua and the death squads in El Salvador who killed thousands of innocent people) Jabanoski writes everything he sees, yet only 25% of the information - the sugar coated \\"we are the good guys\\" news is sent back. <br /> <br />Here are some tidbits from the book, which I highlighted, which I think are very important: <br /> <br />1. 5,000 kids die everyday in Africa, mostly from preventable diseases such as malaria. We would only have to increase pennies for every hundred dollars of our money to provide those kids with medicine.  However, I suppose, providing kids with medicines isn't \\"as cool as\\" throwing bombs on people and shooting at them non-discriminately as we are doing in Iraq. <br /> <br />2.  When Jabanoski gets into the second part of the book, which is about Iraq, he not only blames politicians, the media and greedy corporations, he gives the American people a well-deserved chiding. While we sit here in our SUVs or worry about our kids, we couldn't care less that there are kids of a different skin color who follow a different religion dying in Iraq. Or the fact that their sewer system is messed up and they barely have any electricity. <br /> <br />3.  \\"Some people don't thing about other people as one of theirs or one of ours. They only see people, just like themselves. <br /> <br />4. Americans need the strongest army in the world, because we have, individually, become the weakest willed people I know of.   <br /> <br />5.  This is from an Iraqi interpreter Bill meets: <br /> <br />\\"But now we have reduced ourselves to a realm ruled by the self-serving rich, such as the Saudis, or self-serving fanatics, all of whom use the Koran like a weapon to keep the common people from thinking any further than what the Mullahs tell them to think, just as your country has falled into the hands of the same type of people, only, from what I read, they do not waive the Bible in front of your people so much as they do your flag. <br /> <br />Again, this is from the same interpreter, Ahmed: <br /> <br />\\" When the Eleven-September attacks were made on your nation two years ago, we Shiites, we cried for your people. Most of the world cried for your people. Tell me, who cries for my people now? Even though there are most likely ten times more of them killed by your armies than died in the Eleven-September attacks? Does anyone in your country even care about this?  <br /> <br />Read this book if you haven't already. Second - DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Innocent Iraqis and soldiers are being killed or injured while we are sitting here. For the self-serving ones who couldn't care less - think of it like this, the Iraq war has increased the number of terrorists ten-fold; normal Joes or Ahmeds have turned into terrorists like anybody would if they saw their families die. So try to stop this war, if not for anyone else's sake, for your own.	2005-01-23

After 9/11, unfortunately her and her daughter's lives were turned inside out with our \\"accurate\\" media capturing the story of how one of her daughters \\"escaped\\" from New York a few days before 9/11. When in fact she had actually graduated from Columbia University and left to her home in Switzerland in June. <br /> <br />Carmen Bin Laden is the daughter of a Swiss man and Persian women. This gives her special insight into two different worlds. In addition, she visited and lived in America for a few years while her husband was studying at USC in California.  Bin Laden starts this story out simply enough with how she meets Yeslam.  They fall in love and get married. Yeslam desperately wants to live in Saudi Arabia after he graduates so they live there. When they get there, Carmen is hesitant, but her husband seems accommodating.  After this, Carmen goes into detail about Saudi life, tradition, rituals, etc. This is all very fascinating.  (Princess by Jean Sassoon is also a remarkable book of an actual Princess's life in Saudi Arabia).   <br /> <br />Carmen tries desperately to make her life as \\"American\\" as she can. She remodels her home, invites Europeans, Americans and other diplomats on Thursdays, has a tennis court made, etc.  What I really like is the fierce love that she has for her daughters and the devotion and respect she has (had) for Yeslam.  All of these things coupled with Carmen's creative ability to try and transform Saudi Arabia into a more welcoming place make her life in Saudi Arabia bearable. <br /> <br />Of course, this book is not vivid or exceptionally written like some books are. But that's ok, this book is easy to understand, clear and concise. In my opinion, Carmen Bin Laden is intelligent (she understands different cultures and religions), brave (she writes this book to make her daughter's lives better), and devoted. I thank her for writing this book and giving an insight to us about life in Saudi Arabia. <br />	2004-12-21

Bush	Books	5	9	13	N	N	Prophetic and Devastating	I just bought this book because I thought it would have some funny Texas Bushisms. However, this book was written by Paul Begala (cohost of CNNs Crossfire) about why Bush should not be elected as President in 2000.  This insightful book gives details on how Texas's surplus was pandered, a 125 year ban on concealed weapons was overturned (people are even allowed to bring weapons into churches!!) and public school funding was cut, tax cuts to the rich were given and many other things happened where the people of Texas suffered and rich people get very happy.  Begala predicted all these same catastrophic events would happen if Bush was elected President.  Now it takes guts to have all these assumptions of Bush before he became President in 2000 and Begala did.  But what is even more devastating is that every single thing that Begala thought would happen - did! <br /> <br />I wish this was just a horror novel, but unfortunately, it is all non-fiction.	2004-12-19

Reel Bad Arabs is a thick book with a good introduction into what land Arabs are from, their religion (being Arab and Muslim are two different and distinct things - Arabs can be Christian, Jewish, Muslim, etc.), and movies from the early 1900s to the present that show Arabs in an awful way.  My only critique for this book and in general is that more needs to be done to promote tolerance towards Arabs, Muslims and Palestinians. Usually people who have stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims are not intelligent enough to read a book, something more needs to be done. Not only are Arabs shown in a bad way in movies, it is the same thing on TV, newspapers, magazines, etc.  Mr. Shaheen should also detail how Muslim people are always dehumanized in the media - we literally can't hear Islam without terrorist, fundamentalist or something along with it.  Covering all of that stuff from 1900s to present would have taken forever though.	2004-12-17

I believe with this book Ms. Williams is trying to give us enough statistics and information so that if we previously don't care or not aware of what is going on in the world, we can spur to action after reading this book. I certainly hope people do this!    This book is about the inequalities that go on everyday in the world.  From - slavery to the flesh trade to war, etc. This book has lots of information and has websites and links on the end of the book which help the reader understand how they can help make a difference. The purpose of this book is to find the root cause of our problem so that we can make the world a better place so we don't have to put a club in our car, live in the suburbs and own 10 handguns.  At the end of this book, there are great resources on the web that we can go to to make a difference.    As Paul states in his great review, most Americans don't know or understand these things because of the protective shell we live in. One solution that I can think of to help with that is to please go visit other countries - developing countries. Contrary to what you hear and watch in the media, 99% of people in developing countries (even Middle Eastern countries) welcome Americans with open arms. Also, read \\"Confessions of an Economic Hitman\\". That is a great book to go with this one.	2004-12-15

In this book, there is some writing from Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi and other politicians.  There are ideas given on how people can be politically active in their community.  With the great websites and ideas offered, you can't go wrong! The only thing I would add is more ideas, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of ideas in here, it's just that - with more ideas there will be more of a chance a person will actually do something. Also, people don't get involved in political change (even for their benefit) because our lifestyle is just made like that - just eat, sleep and work, don't worry about where your taxes are being used. So maybe Moveon could instead of started the book with a bang so people come to attention to make a change.	2004-12-15

Random Threats from an Unarmed American	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Wow, a must read	Having read and seen most of Moore's work, I didn't think there was much more I could learn.  I was surprised though - this book is really good.  Even though this book was written in 1996 and revised in 1997, it is just as relevant today!    First, unlike most non-fiction books, this book is written in an easy to read, funny, entertaining and informative way.  There are chapters on downsizing in our country, information on private prisons, people who try to make us hate each other instead of solving the problems that affect us all, Hillary Clinton, the blurring line between Republicans and Democrats, etc. The chapter on \\"Let's Pick a New Enemy\\" is genius.  It's prophetic of what we are going though today with the war on terror.  If you're a Bush fan, don't worry, only one thing is written about Bush and it's actually a compliment (that's right, a compliment)!    Another thing that is mentioned in the book is corporate welfare. I didn't even know that it existed until I read this book. It is a very interesting question that Moore asks - why are we so mad if a person who is hungry needs social welfare but we couldn't care less if taxpayers have to pay three times that amount for a company to promote (as an example) chicken nuggets to Singapore?    Read this book, inform yourself, make a change and have fun!	2004-12-15

He attacks - Republicans, Democrats (wobblycrats), the media and corporations.   The cool thing is that he also gives us hope - many times in history people have been told to \\"shut up\\" even when they are protesting something that is WRONG like child labor, safety hazards at work, etc.  It has not been politicians who made these things better - it has been people like you and me who stood up for what was right. <br /> <br />Here's a statistic that really stuck with me: <br /> <br />- In the last 6 years, Congress has given themselves a raise of $5,000 4 times but they \\"haven't gotten around to\\" increasing the federal minimum wage - it has been stuck at $5.15 for a few years now.   <br /> <br />Great book for learning about hidden evils in our system which effect you and me. Oh I just remembered something else he talks about - clean air on airplanes. Regulation says that 50% air on airplanes can be clean and 50% is recycled (this means nasty air which people burped and did other things in).  Frequent travelers were complaining about this because not only did they get light headed, dizziness and headaches - its just plain nasty.  So the government airline regulation guy listened - to corporations - he sent a recommendation that we should get 25% clean air and 75% dirty air. <br /> <br />So if for nothing else - get involved in grassroots so when you travel you can have some clean air!	2004-12-07

First a royal family was killed, then the Baathist party toppled the government, Saddam Hussein came into power, there was the Iraq-Iran war, the crippling sanctions (imposed by the U.S.), and now the Iraq invasion. <br /> <br />Mayada Al-Askari is a granddaughter of a famous Arab, who is thought of as \\"the father of modern Arab\\" - Sati Al-Husri.  In fact, most of Mayada's family was either diplomats or had connections throughout the Arab world.   <br /> <br />This book is about how under Saddam Hussein's brutal regime, there was a secret police that would arrest any Iraqi who said anything bad about Saddam Hussein or in most cases - did nothing illegal at all.  The ways the people are tortured by the secret police is barbaric.  It's hard to imagine human beings would do that to other human beings.  This book details Mayada's stay in Baladiyat prison with other \\"shadow women\\".  In between, this book also weaves in great stories about Iraq's history and Mayada's family.   <br /> <br />For some good reading on Saddam Hussein and the hardships of the sanctions- Out of the Ashes: The Resurrection of Saddam Hussein is good or going to the United Nations website and searching about Iraq sanctions.  For other great books by Jean Sassoon - any book in the Princess trilogy is wonderful.	2004-11-29

Reader: The Hideous Truth About America's Ugliest Conservatives ("I Hate" Series, The)	Books	4	28	65	N	N	Cool	This book is a collection from newspapers, magazines, other books and some author commentary.  This book goes over conservative \\"pundit's\\" viewpoints and does fact checking on them. I thought this book would be written by the author as a story in a funny way (like Michael Moore's books or Al Franken's).  Instead though, the author goes into detail about the people who make up conservative \\"pundit's\\" fan base.  Some myths are debunked and facts are checked.     Hopefully a time will come when we can have some real news instead of one-sided media propaganda i.e. Fox News Channel.  It would also be nice to take racists - Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage, hate & fear mongers - BushCO, Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity and perverts- Bill O'Reilly of the air and mainstream.    How hypocritical of people to say: \\"the titles mean, it says hate\\".  I guess when those people listen to Savage and Limbaugh use slurs against gays, Muslims, Native Americans, women, etc. they think that is different, it is not \\"hate\\".	2004-11-27

I had heard of Mr. Nader in 2000 and did not do much research on him, his name came up this year also so I decided to buy this book a couple of weeks ago to see what he is all about. <br /> <br />I was blown away. This guy is an actual \\"public servant\\" in the sense of the word.  He fought with GE to make cars safer which saved numerous lives, he founded 100 civic organizations (to help out the American people), and he devoted/devotes his life to help Americans. <br /> <br />Have you ever wondered or felt frustrated that no matter how much money you make, it is not enough or you just don't feel peace? Well this is a great book for you. This book will inspire you about how to make America an excellent place.   <br /> <br />Think of Erin Brokovich and how she helped out people who were being abused by PG&E, Nader is the same type of person, except he has helped thousands or even millions of people. <br /> <br />Does anybody feel like our senators, congressman, president, etc. are our employees? Probably not, you probably feel like you are their employees even though you pay their tax dollars and elect them to represent you to act in their interests. Wouldn't it be nice to elect people who actually care and listen to you - make you their number one priority? - I really get that kind of feeling from Mr. Nader. <br /> <br />- Finally a quote from the book - you may think you won't make a difference but each of us is like a few drops of water and if all the water combines it makes a great river. <br />	2004-11-07

I really liked this book and laughed out loud more than a few times. I recommend this book if you have an open mind, want to be informed and want to read something that is entertaining.	2004-11-02

You can borrow this book from the library, a friend or just read it in the bookstore.  I would say this book shows America at its best. <br /> <br />***** out of ***** <br />	2004-10-29
US	42607492	R3KYS5M6581N6R	1401300464	106131311	Pledged: The Secret Life of Sororities	Books	5	8	13	N	N	Lots of Information	Pledged follows four girls, three who belong to one sorority and one that belongs to another sorority, over the course of one year.  Basically, if you would like to learn about sororities or would like to read an entertaining true story about 4 girls, this is a good book.  This book talks about the various sorority and fraternity events including rushing, pledging, Greek Olympics and many other things.  In addition, this book talks about sex, drugs, community service, cliques, sororities at the national level, and Greek houses that are either White, Black, Latin or multicultural. <br /> <br />I would say that this book mostly discusses sorority life as it pertains to the South. In the south (part of America) the sorority or fraternity a person gets accepted to, is an important part in the course of their life. <br /> <br />I like how the book deals with cliques, racism, hazing and many other important topics. I was surprised at how sororities and fraternities at the national and University level go to lengths to ward off bad publicity when instead, they should be  dealing with the problems and helping these kids.  Over all, this book is an entertaining read.   <br />	2004-10-29
US	42607492	R2NQSTDINQEKYZ	074325337X	760100886	House of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties	Books	5	33	34	N	N	Think your government is secretive?	This book will shock you! The average American works, takes care of their kids and likes to enjoy some free time. The government realizes that we don't have enough time to question everything, so we trust the government.  What does the government do? They take your tax dollars to do all sorts of unethical things, which we as Americans would never approve of if we knew.  This is a well-researched book, which talks about the Iran-Iraq war, how the Bush family got their wealth and connections, the Saudi royal family, the Bin Laden family, 9/11 and Mid-East relations. This book has a lot of facts, people and information - it is probably good to read the book twice to absorb everything.     Some appalling facts:    - Our CIA hired Saddam Hussein when he was 22 to be an assassin.    - We gave Iran and Iraq weapons of mass destruction to use on each other    - George Bush senior, during his Vice Presidency, was went to the Middle East during the 1980s as a CIA operative to give Iraq weapons of mass destruction and the media showed the meeting as \\"moving the peace process forward\\".     - Saddam killed thousands of Iranians and Kurds and we turned a blind eye to it - as long as he was willing to help us out.    The author did a good job of writing a well-researched, compelling book.  I highly recommend this book, you will learn a lot.	2004-10-09

I raced through the book in two days.  Princess Sultana's Circle goes more into situations, which Sultana tries to fix such as freeing a harem of women or saving her niece from a forced marriage to a disgusting older man. Princess Sultana finally emerges victorious in her struggle to help out somebody.  In this book they also go over the holy month of Ramadan, camping in the desert, and shopping in New York.   <br /> <br />The author does such a great job of making everything in this book so real and colorful that you feel like you are there. I would recommend any of the Princess books.  I would suggest that it is always fun to start reading from the beginning of the trilogy because you get a good feel for all the characters.  Great book!     <br />	2004-10-03

This book gave a riveting account of a princess's life in Saudi Arabia. A lot of this book is sad and depressing but there are some hopeful moments.   Personally, my favorite book of the trilogy is the second one - Princess Sultana's Daughters.  But I would recommend reading this one first so you know the story and situation.    When I started reading this book I could not put it down. If you are fascinated with Saudi culture, women's rights or the lifestyle of the Saudi royal family, this is a great read.	2004-09-29

After having read the first book in the Princess trilogy, I was eagerly waiting for this book. Princess Sultana's Daughter's exceeded my expectations. This book was extremely well written and I felt like I was watching everything unfold in front of me.  Some parts of this book are uplifting, others are really funny, and some parts are sad.  On the whole, I thought it was wonderful how this book talked about Saudi life and the Muslim religion. I would recommend this book if you desire to learn about Saudi Arabia or their customs and are looking for an entertaining read.	2004-09-26

Books	5	9	14	N	N	Wonderful	This great book talks about environmental, political and social concerns facing America and the world. Mr. Moore describes how we can make America a better place for everyone - women, the poor, minorities, etc. He doesn't stop there, he also tells us about situations that are happening all over the world which we should be concerned about. Personally, I thought the most moving section in the book was where we discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and even offers to go there and promote non-violence in the region.    Mr. Moore takes a hilarious but eye-opening approach to help us understand the problems of the world. I strongly recommend at least reading once.	2004-09-06

There is a chapter on questions Moore has for President Bush, how we can stop terrorism, Horatio Alger must die, etc. This is a very eye-opening, informative and laugh out lout funny book.  If you like President Bush, please read it anyway, don't read the Bush bashing stuff - just go to the how to stop terrorism section - it is phenomenal!	2004-09-06
