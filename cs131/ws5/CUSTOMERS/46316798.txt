But it's funny in this British, sophisticated, sublime way. Over the top, yet understated. Honey O'Hare has to be the most outrageous mean girl ever. I just love Calypso.

I didn't guess the killer until the very end (in fact, I was sure it was everyone but the real killer -- still nothing can beat the ending of this author's NOWHERE TO RUN.)<br />You'll be fascinated by Newport, Rhode Island too.  Unbelievable history woven into this.	2004-07-19

I find myself thinking about the ideas here all the time and USING them. They're profound but also simple -- just straight forward, ethical answers.  The Ancient Greeks really did seem to have figured out so much way back when.  We've just mussed it all up.  A wonderful book.  Thank you.	2003-04-28

I read this book because my client translated it from the original Spanish into the English.  It struck me that no one else is talking about the amazing culture of immigrants -- the unique issues they face, the fascinating economics of immigration, and the fact that how we deal with the flow of immigrants -- particularly from Mexico and Central and South America -- will have a profound impact on our country in the years to come.<br />Very illuminating.	2002-01-26
