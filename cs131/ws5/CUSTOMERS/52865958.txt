US	52865958	R25SX25LMR5C60	0684803852	90910415	Brat Farrar	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A moral dilemma	Eight years after young Patrick Ashby's disappearance and presumed suicide, a young man presents himself to the Ashby family lawyers as the long-lost heir--just in time to reclaim the family estate from his slightly younger twin brother Simon on their approaching 21st birthday. He knows intimate details of Patrick's childhood and passes all of the tests devised by the lawyers to reveal an imposter. (The family's dental records in London were apparently destroyed during the war.)  Could it be?  Has the prodigal son returned home?  In a word, no.<br />That's not a spoiler, mind you.  You'll learn as much on the back-cover blurb, and chapter 3 reveals the imposter in no uncertain terms as Brat Farrar, a foundling who grew up in an orphanage and spent much of his teen years exploring the American West.  By the end of chapter 4, it doesn't take a whole lot of pondering to figure out 90% of what's really going on.  It's just a matter of following along to see how it all plays out.<br />I know that sounds boring, but it's rather an enjoyable read.  You can look at it as being slow-moving, or as having a leisurely pace. If you take the latter attitude, I think you'll have a better appreciation of the manner in which Tey examines Brat's moral struggles and unfolds the layers of mystery surrounding the Ashby family.<br />**Adapted from a Skullduggery review**	2002-07-25

And this title does make good use of the word. The story is set in Hawaii, and the protagonist, Val Lyon, is a private investigator who does indeed encounter her fair share (and then some) of pilikia in a day's work.<br />This particular pilikia begins when a lawyer from a prominent island family hires Val to find the adolescent son of his client, who is being jailed for contempt for failing to produce the boy during a messy custody battle. The mother claims that her ex-husband has abused the boy and that, although she sent him away for his safety, she doesn't know exactly who has him or where he is. Fortunately (or unfortunately) for Val, the mother lets slip the name Harriet, and the hunt is on. Before long, Val finds herself entangled in much more than the search for the missing child. For one thing, people start getting killed, and Val is almost one of them. Then she discovers that the family of the lawyer who hired her has a lot of connections (none of them very pleasant) to the case at hand. It doesn't help any that she also starts falling for her lawyer client.<br />This is some deep pilikia that Val has to wade out of, but she does so admirably, even if she becomes terribly wounded in the process. One of the most striking things about this book is Val's character, which is complex and intriguing and very realistic. If I didn't know Mark personally, I'd swear he was a woman writing under a male pseudonym, because he has a clear understanding of female characters. The male characters are good, too, but sometimes they seem a little limited by the roles they have to play in the story.<br />The story line is another of the book's strengths. It is suspenseful and manages to be complex without descending into the sort of confusion that happens when authors just dump cartloads of red herrings wherever they can. Just a tiny bit of what may be a spoiler, however: if you have any more than a passing interest in genetics, you will probably be a few steps ahead of Val once the clues start turning up. That doesn't detract from this great tropical thrill ride, though, and I look forward to reading more of Val's adventures. Before long, I suspect pilikia will be Val's middle name, not just her occupation.<br />**Adapted from a Skullduggery review**cartloads of red herrings wherever they can.

The plot was actually extremely straightforward, which might explain why the book is considerably shorter than your average spy thriller.  The few plot twists were telegraphed far in advance, and the supposedly character-driven intrigue fell flat.<br />The editing was especially weak, with lots of typos, confusing punctuation, and misused words.

The novel is narrated by Paris Minton, a black bookstore owner in 1954 Watts.  Minton is not a troublemaker and has a hard time understanding why his friend, war hero Fearless Jones, always seems to attract trouble.  When trouble--in the person of Elana Love--arrives quite uninvited in Minton's own bookstore, though, understanding begins to dawn.<br />No sooner has Love walked into Minton's life than he is brutally assaulted by her pursuer, then seduced, robbed, and abandoned by Miss Love herself.  When Minton returns to his bookstore the next day, he finds it a pile of ash and rubble.  Not knowing where else to turn, he finally relents and bails his friend Fearless out of jail.  That's when the action really heats up.<br />The plot is far too complex for me to try to boil down into a few short paragraphs, and that is one thing I love about Mosley's books.  There is so much coming from all directions that there is no sense of a scenario manufactured for tidy wrap-up by page 300.  The characters are also so well developed that you can imagine them going about their off-page lives even when Paris isn't around to tell us about it.<br />As Paris and Fearless try to unravel the mess, it entangles them in the lives of a Jewish immigrant family, a chase after the spoils of war, a variety of fraudulent schemes, and a violent power struggle within a mysterious religious organization--the one Elana Love was looking for when she found Paris by mistake.  They do manage to sort things out eventually, and that in itself is a fascinating adventure.  Just as exciting, however, are the lessons in loyalty and betrayal.<br />(adapted from a &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)	2001-08-10
US	52865958	RSCMEAGQF6LI5	0451196902	241092179	The Case of Cabin 13 (John Darnell Mysteries)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Warning: Pseudo-spoiler ahead!	Maybe it's because author Sam McCarver is, as his cover blurb puts it, &quot;a lifelong mystery and history buff,&quot; but I think I was hoping for a fresh, accurate angle on what had been turned into a slickly commercial blockbuster.  Whatever I was hoping for, I don't think I got it.  <br />The case of the title refers to a series of mysterious suicides in first-class cabin 13 of different White Star Lines ships.  As the maiden voyage of the supervessel Titanic approaches in 1912, nervous White Star executives approach famous paranormal debunker Professor John Darnell in an effort to dispel rumors of a White Star curse.  This brings me to my first complaint: Considering the suspicious circumstances of the &quot;suicides,&quot; I think--even in 1912--that most people would have been quicker to suspect a human murderer than a ghostly one.  It's not like these were tightly constructed locked-room puzzles in the John Dickson Carr tradition.<br />In order to catch the culprit, Darnell agrees to occupy Titanic's cabin 13.  This should make things interesting, right?  Unfortunately, my second (and overwhelming) complaint is that anything actually having to do with solving the mystery is almost boring.  Darnell lives and works almost entirely in his head, so any scenes that could be called &quot;action&quot; are few and far between, and they usually involve Darnell's Chinese manservant being attacked.  The bulk of what Darnell does in this book falls into two categories: falling in love with shipmate Penny Winters, and berating himself for falling in love with Penny Winters, who just might be a murderess, even though the author makes it very clear to the reader that Penny is not a murderess, so it's really okay if he falls in love with her, thus robbing the reader of any sense of suspense regarding Penny Winters and making the reader scream, &quot;Just boink her already!!&quot;<br />I don't want to mislead you into thinking that I hated this book.  It was actually quitepleasant.  It seems to me, though, that the book's flaws are the result of conflicting desires.  McCarver obviously wanted to include a great degree of historical detail in his story.  I'm certainly not qualified to comment on its accuracy, so I took it all at face value.  But McCarver had a difficult time weaving it into the story, and I think that may be partially due to a desire (or perhaps external pressure?) to tell a story in blockbuster style.  This brings me to my third complaint, which is that I felt I was continually being pulled out of McCarver's straightforward little mystery and plunked down in the middle of a less inspired version of Cameron's sweeping saga.  Had McCarver spent more time developing his unique story before interjecting the known historical elements, I think it would have been a much more satisfying read.  It's still worthwhile, though, and does provide a slightly different perspective on the famous tragedy at sea.<br />(adapted from a &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)	2001-08-10
US	52865958	R51U51KCRKWRQ	1587152525	366979977	Tequila Sunrise	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Truth in Advertising	The subtitle, &quot;Bullets, Booze and Broads,&quot; is a highly accurate summation of this short story collection.  There is certainly no mistaking this book for a cozy tea party at the vicarage.  In all honesty, I'm much more a cozy fan than a hardboiled fan, and the more graphic sex scenes pushed my &quot;too much information&quot; button. Bracken tells a good story, though, and there is no denying that Nathaniel Rose has a distinctive voice.<br />All of the stories are set in St. Louis, and as someone who visits St. Louis maybe once every few years, I enjoyed Rose's tour of some of those sites not on the typical tourist itinerary. The city's unique personality comes through very subtly yet effectively, seeming to make the setting a character of its own.<br />I was particularly impressed with the plot lines, both within each story and in the progression of stories.  Bracken's plot twists are fresh and innovative where so many hardboiled stories fall back on the tried and true devices.  Bracken even seems to poke fun at some of those hardboiled conventions, like when Rose describes how he and his secretary are caught by surprise when a client actually shows up completely unannounced.  The character development as Rose proceeds from &quot;Partners&quot; (first published in 1988) through four stories from the 1995 collection Even Roses Bleed, to the final two stories written for this anthology, also indicate Bracken's concentration on craft.  And despite my cozy leanings, I couldn't help but admire Bracken's willingness to shed just about anybody's blood in order to keep the plot coherent.<br />If you like your fiction brief and noir (and maybe even if you don't) I think you'll find Tequila Sunrise an intoxicating treat.<br />(adapted from a &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)	2001-07-29

Much more personal than her regular mystery stories, these exude '20s style and mysticism.  The first half of the book seems devoted to young people and adventure, with a great deal of attention to the recurring motif of the car representing freedom and the jewels imbuing their wearers with special traits.  <br />In the second half, Christie delves deeper and deeper into the occult, going from Atlantis theories to reincarnation to &quot;the gift&quot; to metamorphosis to the ghostly sobbing of dead children.  Even as I reject the pushiness of the occult aspects of these stories, I am thoroughly entertained by Christie's writing style.  Her dialogue is simply enchanting, and even though I recognize the flaws in this collection, I find myself often drawn to re-reading it to escape into a whole different world.	2001-05-13

I think Paretsky did an excellent job of drawing me into VI's world, which is rich with unique characters.  VI comes across as individualistic and principled, and I like how Paretsky resisted clich temptation on several counts: the complex issue of chemical responsibility is not wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of the book, and there is no &quot;obligatory sex scene.&quot;  Not that sex scenes don't have their places, but I just hate it when I'm reading along and I can almost hear the agent say, &quot;Okay, author, you need to steam this up a bit right here if you want to sell this book.&quot;  In this story, VI is all business, which is a delightful change of pace.	2001-05-13

Just as an example: In 1987, when this book came out, School of the Ozarks had not yet changed its name to College of the Ozarks, and it is located south of Branson, *not* in the town of Ozark, which is some distance *north* of Branson.

I am a fan of this series, but I have to admit that its first installment was a bit weak.  Had I read this one before the series had built up some momentum, I probably wouldn't have bothered to move on to B is for Burglar.  Many of the plot points had a contrived feel to them, and Kinsey often acted out of character.  I think those moments were also the result of attempts at plot manipulation that just didn't work out too well.<br />The thing is, though, that the series as a whole is quite good, and it's just a shame that its beginning is less than spectacular.  That's why I always recommend that new Grafton readers start off with G is for Gumshoe and then go back to the start of the series once they know what treats they are in for later.	2001-05-13

Revenge of the Gypsy Queen may be Kris's first book, but the lady is no newcomer to the mystery scene.  Her extensive short mystery fiction résumé includes two Derringer Awards, one of which was for &quot;L.A. Justice.&quot;  That is where sleuth wannabe Tracy Eaton debuted, and Tracy's fans were soon clamoring for a full-length novel.  Kris Neri was kind enough to oblige.<br />Tracy Eaton is the daughter of Hollywood celebrities, wife of straight-laced lawyer Drew Eaton, and a mystery writer who yearns for the cloak-and-dagger adventures her fictional sleuth enjoys.  Revenge of the Gypsy Queen finds Tracy in New York City for the upcoming wedding of Drew's sister Marisa, and before long Tracy is living out her detective fantasy.  The reasons, however, are unfortunate: Marisa has been kidnapped.  A wealthy developer and a mobster have both taken an unusual interest in the restaurant Marisa and her fiancé Tony run.  Drew's black sheep Uncle Philly is in town, behaving suspiciously, and under investigation by the NYPD's Special Frauds Squad.  And Drew and the rest of his family seem to be trying to keep secrets from Tracy.  The Eaton family, in fact, seems content to try to meet the kidnapper's bizarre demand-the sale of the restaurant The Gypsy Princess-without any police involvement, so it falls to Tracy to be the &quot;sensible one&quot; for a change and get to the bottom of the mystery.<br />Of course, Tracy's definition of &quot;sensible&quot; is a bit wide of the mark.  All the more fun for the readers who follow her as she crawls beneath cars, tails suspects, dodges various instruments of death and destruction, beards VIPs in their dens, and delves into the family secrets.  Neri has created in Tracy a lovable writer-turned-sleuth who takes all the horrible clichés that implies and pummels them into submission with her unique sense of humor.  <br />The story's resolution is also fresh.  The grand finale, which requires the talents of a supermodel and a smallarmy of-well, I can't tell you what without spoiling all the fun-is only the beginning of the end.  True to the book's title, Neri spins a tale of revenge that leads Tracy into the dilemma of weighing the value of the absolute truth against justice.  Fortunately, Tracy has the resilience to grow from the experience without losing her impetuous spirit.  And that means I'll be reading Tracy's next adventure, Dem Bones' Revenge, as soon as possible.  <br />(adapted from a &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)	2001-04-13

This is, however, only the second such anthology I have actually read, so I cannot comment on the consistency of quality from anthology to anthology.  I can only say that the quality in this collection was extremely uneven.<br />I have never been a fan of Amanda Cross or H.R.F. Keating, so I wasn't surprised that I didn't much care for their contributions.  But I am a huge Ed Hoch fan, so the pedestrian &quot;V-2&quot; was something of a disappointment.  &quot;Venus Rising&quot; by Nevada Barr held promise, but it suffered from too many internal inconsistencies.  I'd never read anything by Mary Daheim, and thanks to the aptly titled &quot;Just So Much Garbage,&quot; I am sure I will never seek out her work.<br />Many of the stories fall in the &quot;fair to middlin'&quot; category.  &quot;Jack and Jill, R.I.P.&quot; by Jonathan Gash was an interesting study but didn't really take the reader anywhere.  Alanna Knight's &quot;The Deadly Glen&quot; was strong on atmosphere but weak on technical details and credibility.  Janet Laurence's &quot;Time Share&quot; would have been a great story if it had played fair with the clues.  &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; by Sister Carol Anne O'Marie was just a little bit too predictable to be satisfying.  And while &quot;The Golden Rounds&quot; by Susan Holtzer was entertaining, I wouldn't have picked it as an Agatha nominee.   If anything in this book deserved an Agatha nod, it was Miriam Grace Monfredo's &quot;Buffalo Gals, Won't You Come Out Tonight.&quot;  That historical gem has put Monfredo's novels on my must-read list.  &quot;Just Stunning&quot; by Abigail Padgett and Douglas Dennis was a very solid entry, and I really enjoyed Susan Kenney's &quot;Aunt Agatha Leaving.&quot;<br />While I found a number of disappointments in this collection, I was glad of the opportunity toread all of the stories.  I always think it interesting to notice the differences between the short form and the novel from authors who publish predominantly in one area or the other.  And when it comes to making out your bookstore shopping list, you can't beat an anthology for a quick sampling of unfamiliar authors.  For my Derringer nominations, though, I look to venues less concerned with serving such a wide mainstream audience.	2001-04-13

Every now and then a little summary of what the sleuth knows so far is nice, but every time a new character came on the scene, they rehashed every little detail without moving the plot along.<br />There was a good bit of courtroom legerdemain near the end, but for the most part I could see the twists coming.  One of them I figured out even though Gardner rather unfairly withheld the garden hose clue until he sprang the twist.<br />But it's worth reading this book just for the entertainment of Mason tearing apart the prosecution witnesses' testimony.  I have always felt that there is something reassuring in the constancy of courtroom drama.  While so much of this book (copyright 1960, I believe) is extremely dated, the legal bickering is only missing some references to DNA evidence to seem perfectly normal to the modern reader.	2001-01-31

The SMSU library's collection was not created with fiction readers in mind.

The &quot;frame&quot; of the recuperating police detective researching, with the aid of his hospital visitors, the documentation of the allegedly murderous king does not have enough character of its own to sustain a few hundred pages of rather dry, repetitious examination of history texts.  And it does get repetitious, though I'll allow that the repetition was sometimes necessary to get the confusing assortment of nobility straight.  (And this is considering that the book had two genealogy charts in the front, both of which had been annotated in pencil by some kind soul who recognized their vagueness.)<br />I thought Tey made a number of interesting points, both regarding the reputation of Richard III and the concept of intellectual integrity as it relates to the study of history.  But I didn't need to be repeatedly bonked on the head with said points.<br />I would not recommend this book for anybody seeking a light tale of mystery fiction.

Before too long, it seems like everybody Car knows is concerned one way or another with this 500 pounds, and Car is having the worst time figuring out who is trying to restore his reputation and finances, and who is trying to frame him for crimes varying from forgery to smuggling.<br />This is a wonderfully detailed story with a weblike plot that snares the reader quickly and won't let go.  I highly recommend it to any fan of Golden Age mysteries.	2000-12-01

The charming Bunchy makes several interesting discoveries while making the rounds of &quot;the London season,&quot; but is quite unfortunately murdered before he can and Alleyn can piece together the whole story.<br />As usual, Marsh places her clues very fairly but subtly.  The backdrop of the debutante parties gives an interesting behind the scenes glimpse of 1930s London society, and if you like your mysteries peopled with lots of peers, this book is for you.	2000-12-01

And I only live 30 miles away.  The characters were broadly painted charicatures of &quot;country music folk,&quot; and Buckstaff failed to capture any true sense of place in her descriptions.  Even though her protagonist eventually comes to grudging terms with her Ozarks heritage, the reader doesn't get any feel for what makes Branson so uniquely compelling.<br />Oh yeah, this is a murder mystery, too.  In a shallow, jumbled, afterthought kind of way.  To be fair, it wasn't simply horrible.  Not as bad as I thought it was going to be, at any rate.  But the plot was lacking in drive and suspense, with seemingly random curves (none would qualify as twists, in my opinion).  And that bit with the violin bow would have been silly had it not been so unnecessary as to be offensive.  Actually, this could have been a pretty good read had the author been more in tune with the sensibilities of the traditional mystery reader.  As it is, however, it reads like a half-hearted cross-over attempt by somebody who heard that mysteries are selling well.	2000-11-25

Maron transports you to small-town North Carolina and introduces you around to some of the best developed characters in mystery fiction.  Deborah Knott is definitely a good one to know, and it is interesting to watch her as she handles her personal and  internal conflicts with style and wit.<br />In this beginning of the Deborah Knott series, a local teen seeks answers about her mother's death years ago, and Deborah has to delve into history that some locals would much prefer remain buried.  It makes for an intriguing puzzle, and Maron places the clues fairly.  Maron also treats the reader to an examination of small-town dynamics that affect not only Knott's political race to become a judge, but could put a new face on her personal and family relationships as well.	2000-11-25

Lily and Robert are barely scraping by in their stuffy, two-room apartment, so a mysterious bequest from their great-uncle Horatio leaves them little alternative but to accept the ten-year grace and favor arrangement in rural Voorburg-on-Hudson.<br />The Brewster siblings are just settling into their new home, a neglected mansion with a spectacular view of the Hudson River, when they learn that Uncle Horatio died under suspicious circumstances-and that their scheming cousin Claude is trying to implicate them so that he can gain control of Uncle Horatio's estate.  What else can Lily and Robert do but solve the mystery of their uncle's death?<br />The premise is intriguing, the period atmosphere well-done, and the characters charming.  But the mystery proves to be, well, a little on the boring side.  Just a few well-put questions would have cleared the matter up right away, so it's frustrating to watch the pair follow up on obvious red herrings while you know perfectly well who the villain is.  Taken as a whole, however, Anything Goes is a pleasant cozy, and I am willing to read further in the series on the strength of just the characters and Churchill's style.<br />(adapted from a &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)	2000-10-21

Gilman's charming spy is back, this time in a book that is more of a sequel than another series entry.  Even if you don't normally read series books in order like I do, I strongly suggest you meet Kadi and friends in MRS POLLIFAX PURSUED before reading this one.  Now our beloved Emily Pollifax is traveling to Kadi's home turf, Ubangiba, to untangle a web of political intrigue with her usual clever style.<br />There was a noticeable lack of CIA presence in this book that made me wonder if Emily had made a copmlete break from the agency, but then I noticed INNOCENT TOURIST and UNVEILED both come after this one and seem to involve the CIA again.  I found the clues a little easier to spot in this book than in earlier stories, but it was great fun putting them together for a satisfying conclusion.  All in all, another great Mrs. Pollifax adventure.	2000-10-01

Even if the story line is a collection of flashbacks in different styles, the writing style itself is straightforward enough to move the book along.  I would have liked a bit more attention to the murder plot, though.  I loved the detail about the flea markets and the antiques, but at times it felt like Ruryk was more interested in writing a book about flea markets than she was in writing a murder mystery.  But there were some great characterizations, and I liked the parallels of the losses the characters had experienced throughout their lives.	2000-10-01

There is no doubt in my mind that JK Rowling has created a classic.  The detail is phenomenal, and even when she borrows from the established fantasy world, she adds inspired touches and makes old ideas her very own.  Rowling obviously understands instinctively how a 12-year-old child thinks and what his worries are, and she addresses this beautifully in her creation of Harry, his friends, and his enemies.  I found myself wishing I had had Harry Potter when I was 12.<br />I think what I liked best, though, was that I didn't get the feeling that Rowling set out to write a book for 12-year-olds.  She doesn't talk down to her audience at all, and that gives the book universal appeal.  You don't have to be a kid to appreciate the conflicts Harry encounters.  In fact, Rowling seems to be pointing out that kids and adults aren't really all that different, even in the problems we face on a daily basis.	2000-09-23

I don't think Paretsky had quite fashioned her own  mold for the genre yet, so there are a few clich&eacute; elements in the book, but  everything else is a highly original treat.  Lots of great little twists  throughout--not just plot twists, but different ways of looking at things.  With V.I. Warshawski, Paretsky has created a heroine who is intelligent,  engaging, and not afraid to shake things up. I haven't read much early V.I.  yet, but I intend to, so I can get to know this woman from the beginning.	2000-09-16

I was a little disappointed not to see Simon and Deborah in  this book, and I didn't see the deeply layered themes that I normally find  in George's books.

I live in the Ozarks myself (albeit a ways north of the border from Ms.  Hess), so I can vouch for the fact that yes, people like the inhabitants of  Maggody, Arkansas, do really exist.  But it was a bit painful to see so  many of them concentrated in one spot.  Maybe it's just wishful thinking,  but I hope Hess wasn't going for total realism in this book.  (But if I  have to wonder, I suppose it's a moot point.)<br />So, some of it was just a  tad too far over the top to be comfortable.  But the puzzle was done well,  and I did enjoy it a great deal, in spite of myself.	2000-08-29

The major plot twists were too  obvious--without their purpose being very clear, which is quite a feat  indeed.  And I'd have to go back and read some of Elliot Roosevelt's other  books to make sure, but I'd swear he's plagiarized himself in a few spots.   Those club scenes sounded *awfully* familiar.	2000-08-29

It also made Lynley seem  a lot more human.  The puzzles were pretty good, too.  But it was difficult  to get into the search for the killer of a couple of prime jerks, and that  made the story on the whole a bit flat.  That's why I just can't give it 4  stars.  But if you like the series already and plan to read more, this one  is a must.	2000-08-29

It is easy to see the world through Gen's eyes as she struggles to  determine who are her friends and who are her enemies in a land torn by  war.  <br />Gilman does very well with the mystical elements, fitting them in  so that they mesh with the world she describes to us and seem no less real  than the rest of the story.	2000-08-26

It also  takes a very long, hard look at the relationships--familial and  romantic--that all women experience in their lives and how they can be so  forceful--for good or ill.  Yes, this book is difficult (emotionally) to  read, because we readers can stand on the sidelines and shout advice, but  the characters don't hear us any more than the real people who come through  our lives and break our hearts by following destructive paths.  In the end,  the characters have to deal with the consequences of how they've lived  their lives.  The good news is that for some, it's not too late to turn a  new corner.  In that respect, this book is a story of hope and redemption.	2000-08-06

However, there must be better books out there.  For one thing, this one (2nd edition) spends an awful lot of time on strategy for  the pencil-and-paper version of the GRE.  I don't know of any place in the  US that doesn't offer the computer-adaptive version, and it's my  understanding that the vast majority of US test sites will not *let* you  take the pencil-and-paper version.  Let's hope the book's 3rd edition takes  that into account and gives more strategy info on the computer-adaptive  test.<br />Then there were all those typos.  Big ole honkin' errors  everywhere.  So the practice tests were almost worthless.  They were also  arranged in such a manner that I had to use three bookmarks to refer back  and forth after each section.  Very annoying, and the book's squat shape  wouldn't let the pages stay open by themselves, so I always had to use a  hand or a knee or something to anchor them down.<br />Where the book does give  useful information, it doesn't give enough.  There was a little section  (about a page) on math formulas, which was nice, but what I really needed  was a page or two of those little math &quot;tricks&quot;--those shortcuts  you learn in high school and promptly forget until the next time you take a  math class (which is a looooong time for some of us).<br />I would have given  this book one star, but a) it was better than nothing, and b) there *is* a  3rd edition out, so maybe there's hope.	2000-07-30
US	52865958	ROP0PICQYP6JD	0380788209	754593119	Death Brims Over (Brenda Midnight Mysteries)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A very pleasant surprise	I admit it - after reading the back cover, I was expecting this to be just another forgettable, gimmicky, amateurish foray into mystery fiction.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Wilson's distinct style comes through right  away, and she gives milliner Brenda Midnight an excellent voice that makes  her fun to get to know as she discovers strengths she never knew she  possessed.  <br />Brenda Midnight owns Midnight Millinery - the Greenwich  Village hat shop from which she took her name - and the book opens with  Brenda working diligently on the bridal veil for the high-profile,  high-profit wedding her dress designer friend Carla won the contract on.   This brief intro takes us right into the mystery action as a woman dressed  from head to toe in hot pink bursts into the shop, pulls a gun on Brenda,  and demands all of the hats for the wedding party.  Once Brenda gets over  the initial shock of being robbed, she tries to consult Carla on a plan of  action for salvaging the wedding, which is just a few days away, only to  discover that Carla has been freshly murdered.<br />To make matters worse, if  you can imagine that, Carla bled all over the bridal gown, and the police  eschew Brenda's Lady in Pink connection to follow up on bogus accusations  that Carla was a prostitute with drug connections.  Brenda must now deal  with an irate bride and her mother, the ruin of her reputation in the  fashion industry, and the loss of her close friend whose name is being  dragged through very muddy headlines.  Unable to concentrate on her fall  line of hats, Brenda turns to her ex-boyfriend Johnny, who isn't a  detective but played one on TV once, for help finding the Lady in Pink and  restoring Carla's reputation.<br />What ensues is madness.  Brenda  impersonates a legal temp in search of a connection between the bride and  the Lady in Pink and falls for the law firm's computer consultant, who may  or may not be involved in Carla's murder.  Brenda's computer nerd friend  hacksinto the law firm's personnel files, teams up with Carla's artist  neighbor to turn Brenda's shop into a desktop publishing studio, and tries  to get Brenda and Johnny back together.  Johnny, researching his next cop  role, buddies up with the investigating officers and, with his agent's  help, gets them back on track and locates a connection to an infamous hit  man named Snake.  (I don't want to spoil it for you by revealing any  details, but Snake's non-hostage scene had me laughing out loud.)  Also in  the mix are an obnoxious yuppie intent on procuring Carla's condo, a  secretary intent on blackmailing her boss for a trip to Europe, a  philandering art gallery owner, a tiny canine bundle of energy named  Jackhammer, a box of hand-sewn silk ties, an estate collection of medieval  textiles, an Internet romance, and a dispute over an ugly shag  rug.<br />Wilson deftly combines serious reflection on death and crime with  fun potshots at the conventions of the modern mystery novel.  The  characters are quirky and full of surprises, adding texture without being  annoying, and Greenwich Village itself lends character to the book's  events.  The pacing was excellent, and I thoroughly enjoyed Wilson's witty  use of the language.  I hope the rest of the series is as good as this  one.<br />(adapted from a &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)	2000-07-28

She is spending the summer in her tiny Virginia hometown in order to coordinate three - count 'em, three - weddings.  And two of them - her brother's and  her mother's - are to feature peacocks, of all things.  No peacocks for her  best friend, but Meg does have to talk her out of costuming everybody -  guests included - in medieval garb.  At least there's the hunk minding his  mother's dress shop while she recuperates in Florida.  No, wait, all the  other bridesmaids have tried and quickly determined that Michael is  gay.<br />Michael, a drama professor, does prove to be charming company,  however, as he assists Meg in averting triple nuptial fiascoes.  Some  things are simply beyond their control, though.  Like her mother's fiancé's  former sister-in-law making a nuisance of herself and getting killed.  And  her brother's fiancée's insistence on gigantic hoop skirts.  And her father  narrowly escaping electrocution.  And amorous oafs like Barry (her best  friend's fiancé's brother) and Scotty.  Not to mention half of one bridal  party eating poisoned salsa.  And two - count 'em, two - bomb scares.<br />Of  course it helps that Meg's kinfolk are not your run-of-the-mill family.   From her nephew who has a pet duck, to her doctor father who still takes  care of his ex-wife's house and garden (and, now, peacocks), there is just  no telling what might happen next.  So Meg is not surprised when her father  embroils her and Michael in the investigation, and the body count starts  rising.  I don't want to ruin the fun for you, so I'll just promise that  this book is highly eventful and extremely well paced.  Some of the  romantic plotting may be a bit predictable, but its farcical nature implies  that it's meant to be somewhat transparent to counter the twists in the  murder plot line.<br />Andrews is to be commended for marrying (if you'll  pardon the pun) a murder mystery and a screwball comedy to form adelightful union.  In the end, I cast my Agatha vote for Kris Neri's  Revenge of the Gypsy Queen, but it was a tough decision, and this is truly  a winner of a book.	2000-07-28

Her &quot;sleuth&quot; was just another  stock Truman character: naive young woman spends several years in an  intelligence organization before discovering that power plays and mind  games are afoot, then resigns in a disillusioned huff.

Maybe part of it is that the major plot device, probably on the literary cutting edge in the  late '80s, is a bit anticlimactic to  my jaded turn-of-the-millennium  mindset.<br />Still, if you like the series, this is a worthwhile read that  introduces the unlikely detective duo well.	2000-07-23

The protagonist is an engaging young girl who is a complex mixture of intelligence,  sophistication, strength of character, sensitivity, and vulnerability.  In  a sense, this is more of a rite of passage story than it is a mystery  story.<br />The prose is richly written, describing landscapes, people, and  character interactions with an other-worldliness that haunts the reader.   If you are looking for something more character-driven than the usual  whodunit, and you can live with some ambiguity, I think you'll enjoy this  book.	2000-07-23

Craft...art...design...no simple mystery story, this.  The most telling  proof of the artistic framework of this book is the manner in which the  sleuth himself is enmeshed in the plot...but I can't give that away now,  can I?  So you'll just have to read it and appreciate it for yourself.	2000-07-23

I really expected a much tighter  mystery, or at least more compelling writing.  This novel read more like  something tossed together to meet a deadline or satisfy a nagging  publisher.  I would actually give this book 2 1/2 stars, not three.	2000-07-04

The cop had his moments, but on the whole the characters were not very well drawn, and the manner in which they interrelated were slapdash.  Maybe it was just typical of the disco era in which this book was written, but I  thought the dialogue was atrocious.  The puzzle was not all that  compelling, and the author's political overtones seemed both simplistic and  schizophrenic.<br />Final verdict: a poor attempt at mystery fiction.	2000-07-04

Some of the segues from scene to scene were interesting in an  almost cinematic way, and I appreciated how it enhanced the story line.<br />I  thought, however, that some of the clues should have clicked together in  Coffin's mind long before they did, instead of being saved for a somewhat  rushed wrap-up at the novel's end.  Other than that, my only complaints are  Butler's indulgence in confusing head-hopping and annoying comma-spliced  sentences.	2000-07-04

I hit on the solution quite early on in the book, but I still don't feel  that the author did her best in setting it up as plausible.

This is the series debut of Cat Caliban, a Cincinnati grandmother who decides to liven up her widowhood by becoming a private eye.  To assert her  independence, Cat purchases a small apartment complex in a questionable  neighborhood and, in the process of signing on two new tenants, stumbles  upon a corpse.<br />The deceased is a homeless woman known only as Betty Bags,  and while the authorities allow that it's odd for Betty to have been lured  away from her home turf into Cat's vacant apartment to be stabbed with her  own knife, they aren't all that motivated to give the matter their full  attention.  Cat is at once outraged by their callous dismissal of the  woman's life and death and eager to get in some investigative practice, so  she jumps right in.  She enlists the aid of her three tenants, her cats,  and a retarded youngster, and before long she is on the trail of Betty's  killer.<br />Cat quickly learns that Betty was no ordinary bag lady.  She was  once a silent film actress, so Cat finds herself tracing Betty's fall from  stardom to her final days as an activist for homeless rights.  It seems all  sorts of people could have wanted Betty dead.  Was it the lawyer who  carried a torch for the Betty he remembered as his high school sweetheart?   The sheik who plied starlet Betty with extravagant gifts?  The daughter  Betty gave up for adoption but included in her will?  The real estate mogul  trying to rid his vacant properties of activist Betty and her squatter  friends?  Or somebody else entirely?  To confuse matters even more, Betty's  best friend winds up dead as well, and Cat must determine what secret she  died to protect.<br />Cat's investigations are quite educational and  entertaining, but I wish Cat didn't use such foul language all the time.   It's not that I fear for my virgin ears, but Cat's constant cursing rings  false, like Borton wasn't secure in Cat's uniqueness and felt a colorful  vocabulary would add &quot;character.&quot;  Cat and her allies are an  enjoyable crew, though, and I trust Borton will develop their true  characters as the series unfolds.<br />(adapted from a  &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)	2000-04-20

The character developments are done well, particularly Alma's as she discovers that she has become one of those spoiled rich girls she despises so much and struggles to salvage the tatters of her integrity.<br />The book is more of a trial drama than a murder mystery, but that in conjunction with the colorful characters and the mountain backdrop would make the story a fine movie.	2000-03-27

The theme of Molly returning to her childhood home and dealing with all the people she couldn't stand in high  school gave the story a dark tone that was at odds with the feeling that I  was supposed to be laughing.  It also seemed that O'Kane couldn't decide  whether to make charicatures of the old high school stereotypes or delve  beneath the surface, so when she did try for a deeper examination, the  character interactions seemed unrealistic.<br />The mystery itself, though,  was quite solid and shows promise for the series.	2000-03-18
US	52865958	R16KGQY5WBTBZO	0446403644	213240611	Actor	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Hilarious!	PI Stanley Hastings is called by an old college buddy to fill in for an actor who died right before opening night of ARMS AND THE MAN in a tiny New England town.  The stage manager promptly gets himself murdered, and  Stanley has to help Chief Bob (an amateur actor himself) find the killer.   The search is a comically depressing examination of backstage life and  midlife crisis that leaves the reader amazed at Stanley's emotional  resilience.<br />The amount of theatrical detail Hall included was impressive,  and I enjoyed his use of internal dialogue, which ranks right up there with  Lawrence Block's.  And it's the rare mystery author who can sneak a Pinter  joke into the dialogue like Hall does.  I did find Stanley's hang-up on the  spelling of the word &quot;actor&quot; mildly distracting, but it would  take an awful lot more than that to detract from the fun of this book.	2000-03-18

Christine Bennett delves into the mystery surrounding the Yom Kippur beating death of her Jewish friend, Mr.  Herskovitz.  Suspecting there is more to the case than an unscrupulous  slumlord trying to get rid of a holdout tenant, Christine traces Mr.  Herskovitz's life back to his days as a newcomer to America.  What she  discovers is a well-educated, controversial man whose passions ran deep --  and inspired in others emotions that spanned the decades and might have  gotten him killed.<br />This could have degenerated into a gimmicky throwaway  mystery, but Harris made it a solid novel with good characters.  I do,  however, take issue with that magic phone number Christine's travel agent  friend called to find an important clue.  As a former travel agent, I can  assure you that there is no such thing.  Before she could even *ask* for  that information, she'd need to know the airline, the IATA number of the  agency issuing the tickets, and most likely the PNR for the itinerary...in  which case she'd have the information she was asking for, which would  certainly arouse the suspicions of any airline agent she consulted.	2000-03-18

But what was the point of the &quot;dead&quot; rabbit?  Why *was* Angel so upset?  Do we really need to be reminded every other paragraph that Zack turns Charlie on against her  better judgment?  And I guess my biggest gripe is that there seemed to be  very little actual detection...the murderer confessed before Charlie and  co. figured it out.  <br />Still, overall, I liked it.

It did tend towards exposition in spots, but I can forgive that for the sake of learning some history.  The  juxtaposition of headstrong, educated Lady Appleton in this vivid setting  made for a highly entertaining read.<br />Some of the foreshadowing was a bit  blatant, and I thought the villain was pretty obvious.  (Hint: In Chapter  4, pay attention to what is so carefully *not* revealed about the  murderer.)  But I had a great time following along, and the ending had some  unexpected little twists.  I look forward to more of Susanna's adventures.	2000-03-17

The landscape is a bit different (no oil wells in Harrison County, MO), but every page evoked some memory of  summers and holidays spent on my grandparents' 440 acres.  The reminiscence  factor was so great that I almost forgot that there was a mystery to be  solved. <br />Looking back, I pegged the murderer almost as soon as the  character was introduced.  I don't normally get such a strong intuitive  feel for a character, and there wasn't anything in the writing that blared,  &quot;This is a bad, bad person!&quot;  So I was a little surprised when  clues started popping up to support my hunch, but it made for a smooth  read.<br />The other characters were well drawn, also, but I wish Sandstrom,  writing from Nikky's point of view, hadn't felt the need to make fun of the  local speech patterns.  It made an otherwise sympathetic character seem  smallminded and petty.  I was also a little disappointed that Sam started  off the book in military CID stationed in Germany for what amounted to no  real good reason.  I'd like to see Sam and Nikky return to military life in  a future book.	2000-02-29

I personally have a slight preference for Thorndyke because he has more conscious  respect for logic and the scientific method and is a warmer person.<br />In  this tale, Dr. Thorndyke, who is primarily employed as a medical expert  witness, is asked to mount the defense for a young man accused of the theft  of diamonds from his uncle's safe.  The evidence against Mr. Reuben  Hornby--his bloody thumbprint inside the safe--is so compelling that even  his own solicitor is convinced of his guilt.  Thorndyke, however, is  equally confident that the thumbprint is a forgery and, with the assistance  of Dr. Jervis and Thorndyke's resourceful servant Polton, sets out to prove  it.  He makes quick progress, too, because he soon finds himself the target  of several cleverly engineered assassination attempts.<br />While I was quite  certain early in the book as to who was responsible for the theft, I liked  how Freeman made the point that it is one matter to know who did or did not  do a thing, but it is yet another matter entirley to prove your knowledge  in a court that is not only not ready to believe you but is governed by  policies in direct conflict with your methods.<br />Dr. Jervis played an  interesting role in the case, at once keeping the reader apprised of key  facts and insights and distancing the reader from Thorndyke's speculations.   He also had an internal conflict regarding his interest in the lovely Miss  Gibson that provided even more confusion for the reader.  Freeman did an  admirable job of making me wonder till the very end about Miss Gibson's  level of involvement in the crime.<br />I had sought this book out after  enjoying one of Freeman's short stories, and I was not disappointed.   Freeman introduces interesting characters and an intriguing puzzle against  the backdrop of turn-of-the-century London to great effect.I'd think any  fan of Sherlock Holmes would be delighted to discover Dr.  Thorndyke.<br />(adapted from a &quot;Skullduggery&quot; review)	2000-02-16

There were several annoying loose threads that were never properly addressed, and much of the character  interaction just left me scratching my head.  Normal people, even normal  people who find themselves embroiled in murder investigations, just don't  act like that.  Or if they do in that part of the country, I don't think  I'll be planning any visits there. The whole town was just too precious,  and I have a hard time feeling pain for a woman who constantly complains  about how hard it is to raise two children when 1) they're pretty good  kids, 2) she doesn't have to work outside the home, and 3) her husband,  whom she frequently neglects in order to flirt with the local lawman,  brings home a handsome salary that can easily resolve the vast majority of  minor family problems.	2000-01-21

I am pleased that I did not pay for this book, and  I'm sorely tempted to discontinue reading the series  altogether.<br />Actually, I am concerned about Braun's health.  This book  felt to me like she didn't have the energy to do anything more than slap  together a few disjointed Qwill observations on rural life.  There isn't  even a coherent mystery to follow in this book, and it contains the biggest  plot hole I've ever seen: the sleuth decides to just chalk the whole thing  up to UFOs.<br />This book can be enjoyed by only Ms. Braun's most die-hard  fans, and I am sorry to say I no longer count myself among them.	2000-01-14

So we readers have to suffer while she discovers  that the government and the military are not composed entirely of a bunch  of really nice, honest people who are looking out for her best interests,  and along the way we are treated to all manner of trivia culled straight  from the Pentagon tour.  Then, even though she doesn't name it, Truman  dredges up the MK-ULTRA bit one more freakin' time and expects it to cover  any plot holes she may have left lying about.  She seems to go to so much  trouble to set up the two main plot threads, and then she just kind of  slaps them together and expects them to make sense.  And, as usual, the  character interactions are forced and boring.<br />Still, it was better than  MURDER IN THE FBI, in which I didn't even find any of the characters  interesting, let alone likable.	2000-01-13

Her characterizations are simply awful, like she just  didn't pay any attention when she was reading REBECCA.  I would be  interested in reading a *true* sequel...one that shows how the DeWinters'  relationship grew and progressed after they left Manderley.

Du Maurier's lush narrative transports you into the strange world of Manderley and the new Mrs. DeWinter.
