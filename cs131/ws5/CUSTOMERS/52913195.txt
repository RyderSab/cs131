And some sex scenes are very nauseatting.    On the plus side we will get a list of 100 greatest rock-n-roll songs in the end.	2005-08-23

I also liked its matter of fact presentation of the events.    But the truly amazing part is the \\"Keystone Cops\\" aspect of the whole affair. CIA and FBI joint task force identified Ames after the first real check of the financial status of possible sources, but it took 10 years of humiliating failures for this pretty routine investigation to get started.    And after that initial success the team of top flight FBI agents experienced one snafu after another trying to catch Ames and his Russian handlers red-handed and finally gave it up.	2005-08-21

But some parts of the story are moving really slow <br /> <br />And yes, there is one more amusement: a far right-wing Congressman from Massachusetts winning his next term by a landslide. Considering the fact that recently I read about a Republican Senator from Delaware (D.Brown Deception Point) and a conservative governor of Minnesota (J.Sandford Hidden Prey) it seems like there is really a ground swell there. <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

It has a very good narrative and the mystery is OK and it is not stupid, but this is all about virtues. On the other side it is a very sad story, it pays too much attention to kinky sex and the ending is too long.	2005-04-22

The \\"detective work\\" is very good. And it is informative. A really good movie could be made out of this material.    The problems are relatively minor: it does not seem like such a good idea for a man under a watchful eye to constantly call his former partner and I do not see any crime in being a colorless investment banker. But this is a pretty minor stuff.	2005-03-27
US	52913195	RCHNQSECPASAE	0671027387	315416156	Deception Point	Books	2	10	13	N	N	pathetic	The intrigue itself is OK. But, but it has a feeling of being written by a high school science freak, everything beyond science and the action itself is just that - pathetic. Among other things the author has no idea how adults talk and how they behave under pressure.<br /><br />Among other pearls of wisdom, one may learn from this book that the brightest Harvard graduate specializing in political science has no idea about campaign finance law, that an intelligence officer knows no means of conveying sensitive information over open line, that the limit on soft money is $2000, that the Secret Service does not guard presidential candidates, that any secure room could be penetrated through a broom closet in the toilet etc.<br /><br />And on top on all of that we have an evil Republican Senator from Delaware (of all places) fighting a good well-liked Democrat, however, the help from the extraterrestrial life (and no less than that) is the only hope for this well-liked Democrat to be re-elected.<br /><br />The ending is simply super-pathetic.	2005-03-21

The story is very good and by the end one would realize that pieces do fit perfectly well. While one would not expect from a thriller to be authentic, but it is actually pretty authentic and gives a pretty good sense of the place. It is hard to believe it but the author even invented an original swearing in Russian style. Naturally, there are some minor problems but, who does not have them?	2005-03-15

Mr. Sandford really improved with age: all the recent entries (Hidden Prey, Mortal Prey and Certain Prey) are way better than the rest.    This \\"prey\\" definitely deserves 4 stars. First, villains are \\"pretty normal criminals\\" not traditional monsters, this is really nice for a change. Second, there are several side-plots, which add to the mystery. Third, there are quite a few very good and very interesting characters.	2005-01-18

But, practically everybody acts stupid and there is a feeling that the most of the figures are simply cut out from the cardboard. And the biggest problem is that I found some parts of Holocaust-related line very offensive to the memory of my great grandfather and others who were killed.	2004-12-30

Do not get me wrong, Sandford is his usual moronic self: bad guys are on rampage; the body count is going up by an hour; the police, the FBI, the Russian SVR, and Lukas himself all are watching helplessly; on top of all of this we learn that there is a \\"conservative\\" governor in Minnesota, but it is clearly one of the best in the \\"prey\\" series.	2004-09-21

US	52913195	RYGLANFMXR4NL	0425192938	919064525	Pattern Recognition (Blue Ant)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	wow	I am generally hard to please, but I was very satisfied with this book. It is not an action thriller, but it has a very reasonable intrigue, while the intrigue is developing at a slow pace it keeps you interested and the action line is not something incredibly stupid, characters are well developed and believable, there are no idiotic sex scenes, the action takes reader to well described exotic places, it is not boring etc etc etc. In other words it is a pretty entertaining read for an adult reader.    There were a couple of things that annoyed me at the beginning. First, overall volvo-liberal environment, but I would admit that it is pretty natural for people working on the creative side of branding/advertising/market development to be volvo-liberals. Second, I was suspicious about male writer describing inner workings of a woman's soul, but it came out OK, too.    Overall, I would say it is well worth money I spent on this book.	2004-04-17

The chief protagonist is a despicable human being (a communist eagerly participated in the killing of millions who started to think about all things human only when his turn to be wasted did come close), there are noticeable stretches and then there is some apparent weakness in research.    At the same time there is some depth in this story, which is not so easy to describe, e.g. somehow I was inspired to take out a Mosing-Nagant rifle I own and just hold it my hands thinking about peoples fate in WWII.	2002-12-01

Turn off pages are ones describing personal relationships in FSU (apparently Clancy does not know anything about it) they simply should be skipped  because they did not add anything to the action either.    Just an example  of getting things wrong. One of the most ridiculous passages is related to  Ryan seening a skating ring as the only place where mid 80's moskovites  could have fun. Fun at the time was behind the dark windows of Moscow appartmets and it has all three necessary parts: booze, sex  and excitment  of playing with the danger of violating numerous Stalin's period laws which were still on the books and some of them were even enforced from time to time.	2000-02-28
