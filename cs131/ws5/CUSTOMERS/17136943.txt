I loved this book! The best part was the description of the Apostrophe Protection Society. I'm also driven crazy when I see an apostrophe used to denote the plural rather than the possessive, and that happens so often (e.g., CD's instead of CDs).<br /><br />I also lament the excessive use of emoticons, adverbs or exclamation marks, although sometimes, I get a kick out of telling my nephew, \\"ur up 2 late tonite ;).\\"  However, I'm not likely to add \\"LOL\\" to any of my work-related letters or to forget the conventional rules of English in my job.<br /><br />Shoots was a great way to learn more about proper punctuation in a way that didn't feel like homework.<br /><br />Sigrid Mac<br /><br />PS For some reason, I accidentally hit the three-star button when I reviewed this and now I can't erase that, but I think it's a five star book.	2005-10-14

Shockingly, Sarah's DNA was discovered on Robert Pickton's farm, yet that evidence was not sufficient for the police to charge him with her murder.<br /><br />A professional writer, Maggie goes back in time to give us a detailed portrait of Sarah's earlier years.  A child of mixed racial descent, Sarah was adopted into a Caucasian family; she was taunted at school and mocked for her ethnicity.  Although the family adored Sarah and vice versa, this devotion was not enough to surpass the pain from the racist insults that Sarah received.  She became a troubled teenager, feeling that she did not belong anywhere.  Sarah began to run away, and eventually felt more comfortable in group homes and in her own low-rent apartment than she did with her family.<br /><br />Maggie traces Sarah's journey into drugs and prostitution.  She also analyzes different factors that have decreased the safety of sex trade work.  According to Maggie, between 1960 and 1974, only one prostitute was the victim of a violent death in British Columbia.  From 1975 to 1980, the number increased to a total of three women.  It started rising in the 90s, resulting in 24 dead sex trade workers in B.C. before the maniacal actions of Robert Pickton.<br /><br />This is an important book.  Not only do we get to know Sarah de Vries as a person, rather than a faceless, drug addicted prostitute, but we also get a sense of how terribly wrong it is for our hypocritical society to push sex trade workers into the deepest and darkest corners of the city where they will inevitably be easy prey for perverts and malevolent men.  Policymakers as well as the general public should take heed.  Sex trade workers, who are often only teenagers, need our protection.<br /><br />Missing Sarah makes a strong argument for the decriminalization of drugs since many prostitutes cannot leave the job because they need to work to feed their habit.  It also advocates the legalization of the sex trade. I support both of these positions.  All acts between consenting adults should be legal, especially when doing so gives sex trade workers a safe physical location.  That way they don't have to solicit on corners and get into cars with strangers who may beat, rob, rape or kill them.<br /><br />Robert Pickton is currently behind bars but there's a dangerous serial murderer stalking prostitutes in Edmonton.

The book started out strong and I really liked the four characters who were mesmerized by the life and death of rural poet, Mary Swann.  Scholarly Sarah, Frederick the editor, and Jimroy, the cynical biographer were all well developed and interesting, except for Rose, the librarian, who I felt was very much of a stereotype.<br /><br />Swann was an unabashed critique of academic pretensions and in that respect, it succeeded.  It did not succeed as a mystery because I did not like the way that Shields changed voices towards the end of the book.  She wrote the final conclusion of the book as a screenplay, which seemed farcical and ridiculous.  I think that Shields could have made her point more effectively by writing the entire book in the third person -- many academics and people in the publishing field will play loose and fast with the truth when they don't like the information that they discover about their object of fascination. How true that is!<br /><br />Having said that, even a disappointing book by Shields is a great read since she was a literary genius.<br /><br />I was deeply saddened by her death, which put an end to a unique and distinct writing career.<br /><br />Sigrid Macdonald<br /><br />Author of D'Amour Road	2005-09-24

I'm listening to it on tape cassette and I like the sound of Gladwell's voice.  That's important for audio books.<br /><br />It's well-researched, well-presented and offers some really interesting observations about the declining crime rate in New York City and the rise of Hush Puppies. It was interesting to hear how trends took off and how the show Sesame Street started a \\"literacy epdiemic.\\"<br /><br />While I'm at it, I'd like to upgrade my review of Gladwell's last book, Blink, and confess to my own suggestibility.  I liked Blink!  I went on to Amazon to give Blink a good review but then I started reading the reviews by other posters.  It made me worry that perhaps my own take on the book had been misguided, so I ended up giving Blink a mediocre review -- partly because of the influence of other posts and also because I was still left wondering how to determine which situations could be sized up intuitively and which were subject to more bias.  At any rate, I was influenced by what other people had written, so this time around, I didn't read any of the other reviews before I posted!

Much of it is plain old common sense.  Trust your intuition.  Your first instinct is often correct.  But there are times that we can't trust our initial impressions because of inherent biases and Gladwell discusses these instances.  Sometimes it's hard to get past the barrier of physical looks, race, age, etc. for us to make a sound decision.<br /><br />I do take issue with the idea that speed dating is just as effective as any other kind of dating.  If that's the case, we certainly are falling in love based on some very superficial reactions!  Speed dating seems crazy to me unless we want to find out whether or not we have an attraction or chemistry with another person.  But how could we have any idea of what a person is really like or how we will click with them after talking to them for four minutes in a stressful situation?<br /><br />The book was interesting, illuminating and well-written; however, it was redundant.  Gladwell continued to make the same point throughout the book and to hammer it home with various examples.  Also, at the end, I was confused about whether or not I really could trust my intuition because of all of the different variables that come into play in certain situations.

The suspense was riveting and I could not wait to jump from chapter to chapter to find out what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Not only was this book an excellent thriller, but it had depth and emotional substance.  The characters were well-developed, except for the father-in-law, and I really grew to identify with the main character, Marc.<br /><br />Moreover, it took place in New Jersey and I grew up in Jersey!  I spent half of my time hanging out in Ridgewood, one of the towns that Coben mentions, and I was even hospitalized at Valley Hospital where Marc, the plastic surgeon, worked.  I loved all of the descriptions of Paramus and Route 4 because they made me nostalgic.<br /><br />BUT there were way too many plot twists that seemed contrived and confusing.  After a while, I just wanted some resolution!  Lastly, I found the ending to be improbable.

Over the years, certain members of the Mangano family have received a great deal of publicity, starting with the fatal rivalry between the notorious Vincent Mangano and his underboss, Albert Anastasia, and moving on to the more current sensational incarcerations of John Gotti and his son.  Less attention has been paid to other members of the Mangano clan -- now known as the Gambino family.<br /><br />In a chilling debut novel, renowned writer and television producer, Duke Vincent, details a feud between the Mangano and the Luciano family, which took place during the summer of 1950 -- just one year before Mangano \\"mysteriously\\" disappeared and his brother Philip was murdered before Anastasia assumed power.<br /><br />We can literally feel the heat and humidity of the 90° plus Fahrenheit summer in the tenement apartment in Hell's Kitchen where 18 year old Vinny Vesta resides with his parents.  Vinny is the leader of a street gang called The Icemen. He's fearless, clever and oh so calm and composed, making him seem more like an adult than a teenager.  Vinny strikes up a poignant friendship with a scholarly, sickly Jewish boy by the name of Sidney Butcher.  Sidney encourages Vinny to spend his summer days in the library studying art, politics and literature.  Ultimately, Sidney will act as Vinny's salvation, helping him to see the world in a broader perspective, thus making him want to leave behind a life of crime.<br /><br />Vincent does an excellent job of re-creating a period in American history.  Clearly, a great deal of time and research went into this book.  He has an eye for detail and the book moves along quickly since it's action-packed. We visit the Copacabana to hear Tony Bennett and Jerry Vale; we take the A train down to Harlem to catch Duke Ellington; and we root for Yogi Berra and Joe DiMaggio even though Vinny decides to skip the game!<br /><br />Lest anyone think that Mafia Summer is simply historical fiction, we must remember that according to the TV show American Justice and the Senate Hearings from the late 1980s, La Cosa Nostra maintains a stranglehold on the Teamsters, the Laborers Union, the Hotel and Restaurant Association, and the International Longshoreman's Association.

She starts with the complicated relationship with her sick and depressed mother to whom she dedicates the book, and moves on to the equally challenging relationship with strong, silent, stoical Henry Fonda.<br /><br />Jane's quest for her father's approval dominates much of her life as does her desire to please her three husbands.  She talks about her mother's suicide and her own struggle with bulimia as candidly as if she were telling the story to a best friend.  At the end, we feel that we know Jane and we can see a bit of ourselves in her tale.<br /><br />We haven't all experienced such terrible tragedy in childhood nor have most of us acquired the status and influence that Fonda has.  However, at heart she is just another woman who suffered from low self-esteem and the need to define herself through men, which is what many women learn from the culture.<br /><br />My Life So Far is a walk down memory lane.  Although Jane is older than me, she details the history of America along with her own, and that prompts vivid recollections of events such as JFK's assassination and the racial integration of schools and hotels.<br /><br />Listening to her descriptions of her acting career, her passionate involvement in the Vietnam War and the time that she spent counseling young women on body image and contraception was fascinating.  (One of the funniest lines in the book was when Jane's first husband was talking about the war and Jane was thinking to herself, \\"Where is Vietnam?\\")  Her reconciliation of Christianity with feminism was also interesting.<br /><br />With this great book, Jane Fonda has finally come home.

The Dirty Girls Social Club is a unique, funny, insightful novel about the lives of six different Latina women following their graduation from college.  In the spirit of The Group by Mary McCarthy or Ya-Ya Sisterhood by Rebecca Wells, Valdes-Rodriguez does a wonderful job of introducing us to \\"las sucias,\\" the dirty girls.  They're irreverent, and smart in business but not so lucky in love.<br /><br />The book explores interesting themes like how we can be extremely intimate with one another and yet withhold very personal details from our best friends.<br /><br />At times the novel seemed to bang us over the head with the message that discrimination is still alive and well for those who did not have the privilege of being born Caucasian in America.  And I definitely agree with some of the other posters that this book would have been more readable if it had focused on four young women rather than six; it was difficult to keep  each of the characters straight.

I really loved this book and found it to be candid, well-researched and informative.  I had just finished watching a video called, &quot;Trudeau: The Man, The Myth, the Movie,&quot; which I liked until I realized how many errors it contained.  That video declared that James Cross died in the FLQ crisis!  A quick Google search for Cross shows that the man is still alive.  Fortunately, Sauerwein got his facts straight.<br />Although I was born in Canada, I grew up in New Jersey and spent 30 years there.  I have since moved back to Ontario, so I'm a bit of a hybrid in that I'm part Canadian and part American.  But I'm enough of an American that I didn't follow all of the FLQ details that closely at the time, so I found both the book and the video to be quite suspenseful because I couldn't remember how the story ended!<br />Trudeau was brilliant, charismatic, controversial and stubborn.  He was courageous and had his own unique and epic vision for Canada.  He also came to power during a period when the country faced one crisis after another in terms of Qu&eacute;bec, OPEC, and economics.  Trudeau had some very tough decisions to make -- I would never have wanted to trade places with him in the FLQ hostage situation.  Makes me think of Jimmy Carter's unpopularity that resulted directly from his passive approach to the Iranian hostage taking.  Carter adopted that style because he wanted to save the hostages but it cost him the election, and as a result the United States swerved to the right with Reagonomics.<br />At any rate, I would highly recommend this very well-written book.  There were many occasions where the author could have chosen to sensationalize certain details about Pierre or Margaret Trudeau but he tastefully refused to do that.  Kudos!<br />My only complaint would be that a number of times, the word focused was spelled as &quot;focussed.&quot;  A French editor, perhaps :-)	2005-06-28

At first glance, I really liked it because it reviewed all of the basic economics that we should have learned back in grade school, but some of us didn't!  I was rubbing my palms with excitement thinking of all of the different ways that I could save money until I put it down on paper and saw how difficult it would be to implement Bach's suggestions.<br /><br />Firstly, I concede that there are several areas where I could cut back financially, however, I'm not sure that I want to make the sacrifice right now.  Give up hi-speed?  Go back to the dark ages of dial-up where it takes me 20 minutes to send an attachment?  Forsake caller ID when it saves so much time from my day not have to pick up calls from telemarketers or my friends who might want to chat for a half-hour when I'm in the middle of doing something else?  Stop going to movies renting DVDs, or playing minigolf?  Well, OK, I can cut back on those activities but eliminating them would certainly affect my quality of life.<br /><br />Most of what Bach said was extremely sound -- save more, spend less and make wiser investments.  But this will work more effectively for someone who is regularly employed as opposed to a part-time worker or someone who works contractually. (Forget about those on unemployment and disability!  It would also be really hard to follow for minimum-wage workers and people who are barely making ends meet.)<br /><br />Lastly, I don't know anyone who is making 10% on their returns unless they're involved in risky investments.  I'm in Canada and most of the safer investments are yielding 2% - 2.5%.  It's pretty hard to get rich that way especially when all of that money from your RRSP will be taxed when you take it out.<br /><br />My criticisms notwithstanding, I did enjoy this book.  I will certainly think twice about all of my purchases from now on and question the idea of renting property versus owning.<br /><br />Sigrid Macdonald.  Author of D'Amour Road.ur Road.	2005-06-27

The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini is one of the most moving, powerful books that I've read in years. It is the story about two young boys growing up in Afghanistan, drawn together by proximity yet separated by class and ethnicity.<br /><br />The book is narrated by Amir, who reflects back in time to his relationship with his father's servant's son, Hassan. Amir and Hassan grow up together in the cozy, bustling city of Kabul before the Soviet takeover. One is rich and the other is poor. One is Sunni and the other is Sh'ia. All they have in common is their age and the fact that they are both motherless boys. Amir makes a serious and tragic decision at the age of 12 that will haunt him for the rest of his life. As Amir loses his innocence and respect for himself, so does Afghanistan collapse under rule by the Russians, and later by tyranny from the Taliban.<br /><br />The Kite Runner is a beautiful, poignant, dramatic coming-of-age story that is about friendship, loyalty, betrayal, forgiveness and ultimately, redemption. It explores the complicated relationships that the Sunnis have with the Hazaras, and the even more tangled connection between fathers and sons.<br /><br />Usually, I don't understand how books make it to the top of the bestseller list, but this wonderful novel deserves its current rank as #8 on Amazon.com.<br /><br />Sigrid Macdonald.

Some forms of depression are biochemical and some are reactive.  Either way, it is never the fault of depressed individuals if they feel low or have trouble coping.  Likewise, there is no reason for anyone who suffers from depression to feel inadequate, embarrassed or ashamed, but our culture often makes people feel that way.<br /><br />Sharon Matthies bravely discusses her own struggle with depression in Eagle Born to Fly. She takes us through her difficult childhood, and into the pains of adolescence and adulthood until she reached the point where she felt that she did not wish to live any longer.  In an eloquent style, Sharon describes how her belief in God, her psychologist, and certain special people in her life helped her to pull herself out of a black hole, and create a new philosophy for dealing with life.<br /><br />Eagle Born to Fly is a candid and illuminating look at a mental health problem that is shared by millions of people around the world.  It is a captivating read because Sharon is a particularly intelligent and talented writer.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who suffers from moderate to severe depression.  I'm sure that it would be of help to those who have mild mood swings as well because ultimately, recovery is all about self-acceptance and the conviction that there is always something for us to continue living for.<br /><br />Sigrid Macdonald, author of  D'Amour Road	2005-06-19

I was eager to get Charlotte Simmons but now I can't make myself plow through it.<br /><br />It's hopelessly wordy and Wolfe relies on ridiculous stereotypes of whites, blacks, jocks, and little innocent girls.<br /><br />I'm NO prude but I found the language quite crude - his attempt, no doubt, to recreate a \\"locker room atmosphere.\\"<br /><br />As other posters have said, he got the era wrong. Just because he can quote certain rappers doesn't mean he understood the music scene in college. A college guy telling a girl she looked like Brittany Spears? Please. A 7th grader might say that but not any college guy I know.  And there is way more to university than drinking and sex (Poor little naive Charlotte being shocked by the language, dress and co-ed bathrooms! She seemed totaly implausible as a character.)<br /><br />Oy! Wolfe's attention to detail is magnificent. Ordinarily, he's a powerful storyteller. Needless to say, Wolfe is capable of something *so* much better than this.<br /><br />Sigrid Mac	2005-03-10

I am about 4/5ths of the way through it and I don't know if I can make myself finish it.<br /><br />Let me start with everything that I liked about the book.  The author is clearly brilliant and literary.  I loved her writing style, her way with words, and her command of the English language.  Her characterizations were excellent and quite descriptive.  And I liked the concept.  So why does it feel as though I'm studying for a physics exam while I'm plowing through the end of this book?<br /><br />Many parts of the book are just plain old boring.  The story could easily have been condensed into a much shorter novel.  I also find Susie's affect to be really strange and not credible.  Some other posters here have described her as being wistful at times or matter-of-fact.  To me, she seemed to have no affect at all until more than halfway through the book.<br /><br />I have just reached certain scenes which seem highly implausible and I am tired of reading the book.  I belong to a book club and have been forcing myself for months to read one book after another that I have not liked.  A part of me is rebelling against that now and shouting, \\"Why finish it if you don't have to?\\"<br /><br />Well, being the type A personality that I am, I will probably finish it :-) And I do want to know what happens in the end, but this will not be a book that I will recommend to other people to read.  That's sad because the author is immensely talented and was brave enough to take on two very serious subjects -- murder and the afterlife. If only she had made her dialogue sharper, added more depth, cut the book by at least 50 --100 pages, I might have really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />Sigrid Mac	2005-03-02

I found that it proposed a strict set of gender-based rules to follow, which seemed extremely sexist.  These three male authors were well-intentioned and intelligent (although I didn't appreciate them reminding me constantly that they were \\"professional men,\\" as if to imply that some redneck, beer guzzling lowlife from the trailer park might not have the same expectations for women!)<br /><br />To be fair, Brad, Chris, and Rich are bright guys who were being honest and trying to give women the best advice possible, so that we can eliminate the wrong men from our lives, and cultivate the right ones.  My problem with their advice is that they want women to accept men just the way they are even if that means that women have to play Barbie to get their Ken.<br /><br />To recap some of the tips in this book, women are told not to ask a man out for a first date, not to use profanity initially, not to get too heavy or intense in terms of discussing politics or disagreeing with a man, or confiding one's life history, not to sleep with a man too soon, and not to call him that frequently.  Women are also not expected to pay for the dates, although it's considered polite and generous if women offer to pay for a taxi or a round of drinks by the second or third date.<br /><br />How does this advice differ from what mothers told their daughters 50 years ago?  Oh, okay -- it's permissible to sleep with a guy somewhere around the fifth date. DUH!!!<br /><br />The whole concept of being someone other than who you are in order to \\"capture\\" a man, who will invariably discover that you are another person three months later, is so revolting. Now, I'm not prone to sleeping with a total stranger, using a steady stream of expletives with someone that I don't know, or telling a brand new person that there is mental illness in my family.  However, I need to be myself!  I don't want to catch or capture anything, especially a person.  I like to envision men just the way I view females -- I don't want to \\"get\\" one.  I want to find and be with a guy who likes me for myself.<br /><br />However, the very worst part of this book is that I suspect that most of what they said is true!@!  That's what makes it depressing.  Earlier this month, I read He's Just Not That Into You.  I was prepared to hate that book BUT I loved it!  Liz and Greg were so funny that it helped to cushion the hard truths.  They were also more homey or earthy -- I'm not sure what it was but I found it easier to relate to them than to these three guys, possibly because Liz and Greg did not repeatedly remind me of their professional status.<br /><br />Having said that, Liz and Greg made wild generalizations, which Rich, Chris and Brad did not make.  The latter acknowledged all kinds of different reasons why a man may not contact a woman after their first date or meeting, why he may bail at some point in the relationship or fail to commit.  To Liz and Greg, there was only one explanation -- he just wasn't into you.  Like Liz and Greg, these three guys truly cared about helping women to find the right mate.  Their heart is in the right place.<br /><br />After reading these two books, I've decided not to read any more self-help books about the sexes!  Ideally, I would like to be myself and to treat the men in my life exactly the same way that I treat the women.  But realistically, I realize that by doing so I may alienate some good guys.  It's a hard judgment call to make.  I don't understand why men can accept the fact that women sit on the Supreme Court, operate in hospitals, and fly airplanes but those same competent and ambitious gals are not supposed to ask a man out on a date!  Sad commentary.<br /><br />Sigrid Macew females -- I don't want to \\"get\\" one.

I thought it was hysterically funny and that the advice was right on target.  Sure, it was repetitive but I think that's because often women need to hear the same message over and over again in different forms.  That's because we do keep making excuses for men and we always think that our own unique set of circumstances makes us exempt -- certainly, I do.<br /><br />My problem with the book was that it was very black-and-white and it made huge generalizations.  Not every guy is supremely confident and capable of banging a woman's door down.  Nor is every man extremely romantic.  Some men need very direct encouragement from women before they'll ask them out.  Some guys still give their wives dishwashers or new microwaves for Christmas; they're practical not selfish or cruel.<br /><br />There could be a hundred reasons why a guy doesn't call a girl back after a date, and it isn't always because he \\"just isn't into her.\\"  However, the end result of a man not calling back is that the woman has no relationship!  That was the way that I interpreted most of the book.  Instead of saying \\"he's just not that into you,\\" I translated most of that to mean, \\"this guy is not going to be able to give you what you want.\\"<br /><br />One big issue that I have with the whole dating scene is the question of whether or not a woman should call a man to ask him out.  I've been involved in the women's movement all of my life.  I've always disregarded gender roles and done whatever I wanted to do.  When I deal with men and I'm not sure about my actions, I always ask myself: \\"what would I do if this were my girlfriend?\\"  Then I proceed as though the man is just like any other member of the human race as opposed to some distinct and alien entity.<br /><br />Theoretically, I believe that women definitely have the right to ask men out, to call them up, or to proposition them sexually.  BUT in REALITY, we are penalized for doing this.  Yes, it's 2005 but according to the way a lot of guys think, it's still 1952, except that men are happy that we have had a sexual revolution.  Makes life a lot easier for them, doesn't it?  I resent that double standard.  For many years, I said to myself: If that's the way many guys think, I will hold out and wait for a guy who doesn't hold those beliefs.<br /><br />Well, I've been waiting a long time! And as long as I have to live in the real world, I've decided to follow some of the advice in this book about letting man initiate in the beginning of the relationship.  I'm not into games and part of me thinks it's really stupid to do that, but a larger part of me says that if some man is interested in me, it can't be that difficult for him to pick up the phone and call me.  Seriously, how hard can that be?<br /><br />This book is a very funny read but it deals with a topic that can be painful for people who have had unsatisfying relationships.  I was never a huge fan of Sex and the City -- mainly because I couldn't relate to women who bought $700 shoes!  -- but I think there are some real pearls of wisdom in this book, if you can read in between the lines and get beyond the generalizations.<br /><br />Sigrid Macway a lot of guys think, it's still 1952, except that men are happy that we have had a sexual revolution.

Immediately, I cared about the plight of Wang Lung, and admired his fierce determination to survive famine and overcome poverty. Buck has created a character who rises to the challenge of certain moral isses, but fails at others.<br /><br />Wang Lung's attachment to the land is moving; he recogizes that only by owning land can he be safe from starvation. He is also a proud man who needs to work and craves self-sufficiency.<br /><br />The role of women as slaves and concubines is portrayed with great empathy. Our hearts break when the women are mistreated or disappointed by the men of the culture, which is common.<br /><br />This is a book that I will recommend to everyone I know, including my book club. It covers the cycle of life from youth to old age, the clash between rich and poor, and the ongoing strife between the genders - a timeless gem of a read.<br /><br />Sigrid Mac	2005-02-12

I struggled through the first 100 pages, finding it dull and disjointed, but once I finally got into it, I loved it.<br /><br />It was an incredibly moving love story, and the fantasy/sci-fi aspect was unique and different.  I liked one particular line that went something like: absence is a form of presence.  Claire's lifelong longing for Henry was poignant and I loved the way that the two of them got to meet each other at different ages.  I would love to have known my partner when he was five years old or 25 years old.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't understand was -- SPOILER AHEAD -- why Henry died.  What killed him?  And how was he able to come back from the dead?<br /><br />None of the time travel books or movies ever allow the individual to go back and change the past, and this book was no different.  I wish one of them would let a person do that without adverse consequences.  Henry did manage to change the future, which was interesting.<br /><br />This book was innovative, well-crafted and had two wonderful main characters.  Aside from some repetition and slow moments in the beginning, I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />Sigrid Mac	2005-02-11

Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)<br /><br />The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.
