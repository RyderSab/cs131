Also, Mazzone defends his coaching philosophies which include the practice of throwing in between starts, getting the pitcher's input on how long he stays in the game, his aversion to the \\"wild card\\" format and emphasis on pitch location rather than raw power. Of course, the good coach in him refuses to dwell on the Braves' postseason failures but instead celebrates the team's successes.<br /><br />Having said that, I would have liked him to make the book just a little bit longer by rating the current aces (Randy Johnson, Bartolo Colon) and sluggers (Barry Bonds, David Ortiz) and of course another chapter on the post-Maddux, Glavine era would have made the book perfect.<br /><br />Even if pundits scoff at his team's postseason failures, I do believe real baseball enthusiasts including opposing players and coaches have a healthy respect for his and Cox's ability to mold a staff and in effect a team.	2005-10-14

Clark - founder of Silicon Graphics, Netscape and Healtheon.    Unlike other tech moguls, Jim Clark is more innovator than businessman as he never sticks around quite long enough to reap the results of his foresight. Though his startups have made him a very rich man, it is the businessman who ends up running the company that has always reaped more (Wozniak vis-a-vis Jobs, Allen vis-a-vis Gates).    In retrospect Clark's attempt to induce an inflection point onto the old economy was a good one no matter how short lived. To this day, marketing people have always had their way with engineers. In reality, engineering genius may not always scale well in the market economy.    As always, Lewis' free flowing narrative is very successful in painting quite a complete picture not only of Clark but of the New Economy as well. This author has the knack for providing the reader insights not only on the subject itself but extends it to a far broader social context. Indeed, any subject that perks up this author's interests may it be baseball or Wall Street has always been a worthwhile read.	2005-09-27

Discussions on this book center around a car's \\"stressed members\\" namely the monocoque, engine and gearbox. Also mentioned is the design of the fuel tank which I find particularly interesting in light of BAR's \\"disqualification\\" from the 2005 San Marino Grand Prix for essentially using the same design as described here.     The reader also gets to differentiate between a pull rod vs a push rod suspension, twin keel vs single keel, oversteer vs understeer. Quite interesting also are Matchett's insights into the tire war.    My only beef with this book is that for a technical introduction to Formula One, it should contain more schematic drawings so that a reader who is not a mechanical engineer can readily grasp it without going through secondary sources. The context in which this book unfolds i.e. in an airport lounge among a group of stranded passengers seems out of place and sometimes gets in the way of the technical detail.    Little shortcomings notwithstanding, this has proven to be quite a good technical introduction to Formula One and inevitably makes the reader look beyond the drivers and pay closer attention to their steeds which are the real works of art.	2005-09-16

Quite interesting are Greenspan's (and not the authors') take on the 1997 Asian financial crisis and reforming Social Security, quite relevant considering W.'s desire to overhaul the system.  <br /> <br />If the Internet has not gone mainstream, this could have been a very good book, however, Greenspan's testimonies can be readily accessible in [...] - and a reasonably astute reader can easily do the analysis and place it in the context of what happened thereafter which is exactly what the authors did. It could have been better if the book concentrated on the inner workings of the Fed. Some anecdotes inside Fed meetings could have gone a long way. <br /> <br />The book also has problems with the light treatment it gives to its subject. Case in point - though it mentions that Greenspan looks at key indices and meets with the Fed governors before coming up with his testimony, it never comes around to explaining how he does it in detail. <br /> <br />Overall, the \\"Greenspan Effect\\" may be a good introductory primer on the Fed but its lack of focus and detail plunges it to the ranks of all those futile attempts to explain every nuance of Greenspan's pronouncements and ending up where they started.	2005-08-22

Interspersed with these narratives is the life of Ali from his Golden Glove Days to the revocation of his license for refusing the draft. <br /> <br />What makes this book unique from all the other Ali biographies out there is that the writer was quite of a boxer himself, a former light heavyweight champion in fact. From this vantage point, he gives us a glimpse of the boxer's psyche - particularly interesting is his anatomy of the knockout punch. Whereas other biographies speak about Ali in reverential tones, Torres puts Ali to task for his bad game plan in the first Frazier fight and his penchant for playing with his opponent. <br /> <br />Indeed, Torres acquits himself well as a boxing writer. I wish he could have deferred writing this book for a few years so that the \\"Rumble in the Jungle\\" and the next two Frazier fights would be included.	2005-07-29

Bugliosi is a master of detail as he builds the case brick by brick such as the rope used to tie Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring, the bloodwork on the victims [not  as easy as they show it in CSI, mind you] and the .22 handgun used as the murder weapon. Still, he had different challenges when the case reached trial from Manson and his followers' courtroom theatrics to establishing motive which proved to be very bizarre.  <br /> <br />Aside from providing details of the case, Bugliosi also provides the history of the Manson group, speculates on other murders the group may have committed and draws the societal repercussions of the murders. Updates are also provided on the people involved in the case (Charles Manson, Sadie, Linda Kasabian, Tex etc...). All credit to the author for giving fair treatment to Manson and his cohorts despite the crime's vile nature. <br /> <br />Indeed, the writing style and attention to detail makes this the definitive work on the Manson murders.	2005-07-19

Jackson the writer and basketball scholar comes to the fore in this book as he frets about the relevance of the 3-second rule as applied to today's big men, the officiating of Shaq, Duncan's ability to save fouls and the influx of high school kids to the NBA.  <br /> <br />Interesting locker room tidbits include the extensively reported bathroom meeting between Jackson and the remaining threepeat members (Kobe, Fish, Fox, Shaq and Devean), Kobe and Malone's shouting match after practice and even some from the old Chicago dynasty which involved Jordan crying at a team meeting. <br /> <br />At the end of the book, the writer, obviously smarting from that Finals defeat, labors to explain what transpired and was very reluctant to accept that the Pistons' were indeed the better team that series. But I believe the point where the Lakers were doomed was when <br />Phil found himself longing for his days with Dennis Rodman on the Bulls' team. <br /> <br />A very good read and stacks up the points for writer Phil but the jury is out on what it will do to the career of coach Phil.	2005-07-19

This book however is different.  <br /> <br />Though the book traces the same plotlines, it reveals far more important backgrounds of each character such as how Dukoo became Sidious' apprentice, how General Grievous earned his \\"Jedi Killer\\" reputation and even how Obi-wan's lightsaber fighting style became the perfect foil for Grievous.  <br /> <br />Also given extensive treatment in the book are major plot points which should have been further developed in the movie such as the seduction of Anakin Skywalker, the identity of Darth Plagueis' apprentice, Padme's involvement in the attempt to curtail Palpatine's power and the reason Yoda left the final battle with Palpatine.  <br /> <br />All in all, the book fills all the gaps in the movie's plot lines to the point that I could even say that the movie was based on the book. A well spun dark tale indeed by Matthew Stover.	2005-06-23

Though much research has been done through interviews of people each of which provide a unique perspective on Ali, it could have helped if Hauser could have interviewed more of Ali's detractors to provide a more well-rounded picture of the icon. The last part of the book pulls out all the stops and proceeds to venerate Ali to the detriment of painting a multi-dimensional picture of the 20th century's greatest athlete.     An educational read but could have used a more unbiased treatment.	2005-06-05

Clinton's recall of past friends/acquaintances is quite photographic - it seems he already knew that he would become important enough to publish his own memoir and needed to remember names. <br /> <br />Quite interesting is his evolving campaign strategies that took him from attorney general to Arkansas governor and eventually to President. In this field, Clinton has no peer. In fact, he frets more about his political mistakes like the car plate tax that cost him reelection as a governor, than his personal failings(the Lewinsky affair was treated more as a political failing than a personal one). Much vitrole is of course reserved for Ken Starr - the independent prosecutor whose appointment he approved to his deep regret.  <br /> <br />All in all, the book is saved by its subject as it tends to drone towards the end. The reader has to labor just to get a few morsels of information but it's worth the effort. His insights on his successor proved to be prescient. Also pertinent are his thoughts on \\"Black Hawk Down\\" in Mogandishu, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Bush vs Gore.  <br /> <br />In the end, people would want to know what the first Baby Boomer president thinks and stays with him till the end of his story.	2005-05-17

Interspersed with the narrative are interesting backgrounders on each main character of the Yankee team - Steinbrenner, Torre, Jeter, O'Neill, Brosius, Rivera, Girardi and Knoblauch.     The Yankees that Olney describes in this book are a team with shared experiences from Torre's and Stottlemyre's battles with cancer to the loss of a parent for some team members. Particularly poignant was when Paul O'Neill returned to the locker room after the 1999 Series clinching game and realized that he could no longer call his father as he before Game 3. Shortly after, the door opened and in came Clemens, followed by Brosius and Sojo, all who have already lost their fathers comforting him.     In the center of the book is the Yankee's indefatigable owner George Steinbrenner who'll stop at nothing to build a World Series Champion. From that fateful loss at the hands of the D'backs, he relied less on less on the judgment of his executives resulting in a team of All-Stars which relied less and less of that team dynamic to win games but fell short of championships.     Though Olney may not have been aware of it, he has no doubt provided quite a convincing argument not only why Rivera blew the save in Game 7 that day but also why Rivera and ultimately the Yankees blew a 3-0 lead in the 2004 ALCS against the hated Red Sox.	2005-03-26

As a side note, he reveals that a learning disability has actually compelled him to develop quite a photographic memory which has served him in good stead. <br /> <br />Though much has been written about the cases in this book, it helps to know what the lawyer (more often than not in the winning side) thinks as he was involved in it. Quite interesting are Boies' thoughts on the aftermath of the US vs Microsoft case as well as Bush vs Gore of which he devotes 3 chapters.  <br /> <br />The writing style is free flowing and he takes great pains to explain lawyerese terms like \\"MFN clause\\" to the lay reader. There is none of the self-patronizing tone common in most autobiographies as he discusses matter of factly how he solved the legal problems of his client. One gets the sense upon reading this book that Boies would have never found himself defending O.J. as he not only defends his client but sees to it that justice is served. <br /> <br />Though the book is quite a compelling read in its current form, I believe that some cases should have merited a full chapter rather than a few paragraphs in the afterword such as Lloyds of London vs the WTC leaseholder Larry Silverstein. All in all, I wished he would have made the book longer! <br />	2005-03-12

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A Frank Assessment of the Bush Administration	In a strikingly chilling narrative culled from around 19,000 documents and interviews, Suskind removes the American media-issued rose colored glasses and paints quite an unflattering image of the Bush administration. <br /> <br />The book takes through different high level meetings as if we're perched on former Treasury Secretary O'Neill's shoulders as they discuss the direction of both America's domestic and foreign policy. From there, the reader gets an idea as to how the current administration really decides on critical issues where ideology constantly triumphs time and again over rational thought. In those meetings at least that O'Neill attended, only the how's are discussed to achieve the goal. Apparently, the decision making is done in higher level meetings in which O'Neill is never invited.  <br /> <br />Suskind's story is quite convincing as it doesn't resort to absurd Bush-Saudi family connections but instead provides cold, hard facts. Furthermore, the primary source is from the Republican Party itself who may even have voted for W. in 2004! One only has to see the events unfold today to be convinced that these are the results of the policies discussed in those meetings - the much ballyhooed American withdrawal from the Kyoto Treaty, tax cuts, the Iraq War and now privatization of Social Security.  <br /> <br />Suskind's Bush is surprisingly not the rambunctious type as described in other books but is mysteriously detached, aloof, almost Manchurian. Makes you wonder who is pulling this President's strings.	2005-01-20

Feinstein's book chronicles the 1998 PGA Tour Season highlighting the Majors which are the Masters, the US Open, the British Open and the PGA.  <br /> <br />This book avoids becoming the run-of-the-mill 1998 PGA Tour Season review by providing us with information on the Major tournaments we cannot get in magazines [tidbits on the US Open \\"unfair\\" hole locations, champions' locker rooms(Masters), payment for trophy replicas etc...] <br /> <br />Interesting backgrounders on major protagonists such as Mark O'Meara, Fred Couples, Vijay Singh, Tom Watson etc are provided as well as stories of golfers at the lower rung of the pecking order whose names we may never see again in the entry list. <br /> <br />In short, this book tells us of life in the PGA Tour in the context of the 1998 season. I'm reading this in 2004 and still found it to be quite a good read. <br /> <br />And oh, Colin Montgomerie does have a sense of humor.	2005-01-17

What makes King's writing particularly effective is that he tells tales of common people(like you and me) experiencing extraordinary things. When you put this book down, you can't help but wonder if the same thing will happen to you. I also have the sense that these stories were written for the sheer joy of writing regardless if it makes the author a quick buck.	2004-12-03

Sandra Burton who was with Ninoy during that flight provides us with first hand accounts of Ninoy's assassination, the failed coup that brought about People Power as well as Cory Aquino's presidency. <br /> <br />More significant in this book was Burton's own take as history was unfolding. Particularly poignant is her analysis of the Filipino psyche. I came across these lines which described squabbling within the opposition ranks after the Aquino assassination in p. 314. <br /> <br />\\"Both sides (Aquino and Laurel) knew unity was essential if they were hope to beat Marcos, yet neither could overcome its own prejudices or rise above its petty interests to compromise.

Krugel paints a Jordan looking for that one last shot, that one last roll of the dice no matter how many times over he has beaten the house.<br />I really loved this book for it gave us an in depth look of Jordan at his lowest point - from there you could begin to grasp how he won all those championships. The book also explains why there was a comeback attempt and why it ultimately failed. As proof, the author compares Jordan's best performance as a Bull compared to Jordan's best performance as a Wizard.<br />In the end, it was Jordan's body that let him down but not his indomitable will. Though there were times when he could hold his own against a new generation led by Kobe, Pierce and Iverson, he failed miserably when measured against the standard to which all other future basketball players will be measured - his former incarnation.	2004-06-07

Matchett also quashes notions about Benetton having a 1st and 2nd driver - all cars are created equal from the chassis to its minutest parts.<br />I was disappointed with the exposition as the author seem unable to decide whether the book is about his career path or an analysis of a Grand Prix event.

The content of this book do not delve on racing analysis but on the suitcase life of a mechanic, the middle of night repairs to get a car ready plus many, many more. Contains many interesting anecdotes that are unseen in news reports like when a driver requests the brake pedal to be moved a little bit closer to him, and the mechanic moves it back a fraction. Driver says, 'Er no, too far back just a bit' then the mechanic moves it back to its original position and driver says, 'Yes, that's perfect, just there!' Author also describes his immense gratitude to the McLaren team mechanics who helped him out during the pit lane fire in the German Prix.<br />There's also something on the fuel rig tampering charge the author defends Benetton's position in this issue. I find the author's take on cheating quite convincing - that no one in Formula One intentionally cheats for fear of being disqualified from the competition altogether.<br />However, I would have wanted Matchett's opinion on the Damon Hill-M. Schumacher Adelaide collision which effectively decided the 1994 Driver's Championship as he merely glossed it over.<br />Interesting read nonetheless and a must for every Formula One Fan.	2004-01-01

The exposition is quite short, majority of the book is devoted to a glossary of heuristic terms which prove very helpful. Polya uses common problems in high school geometry to demonstrate his point which make it easily understandable.<br />I'm glad I have discovered an excellent book on problem solving which would prove indispensable in my programming career. Other programming books mainly demonstrate features of an OS or a computer language but this book goes into the heart of the computer science which is problem solving.	2003-12-31

Of course we all know how it ended for Ferrari in 1998 and 1999. <br />Book contains interesting anecdotes about Irvine intentionally blocking Schumacher in Silverstone'98 which ultimately caused his title-ending injury and Schumacher telling Mercedes boss Norbert Haug that he didn't mind Hakkinen winning in 1999 for obvious reasons. <br />Have to give credit to James Allen for giving an unbiased view on Schumacher as I've always known him to be biased against arguably the greatest f1 driver of all time.	2003-10-24
US	49268248	RJFIH1U8SHBT6	0393323528	601624284	Next: The Future Just Happened	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Changing of the Guard	Talks about the dramatic changes brought about by the Internet in a world where adults are supposed to rule. Anecdotes range from a kid whose instincts in playing the stock market prove to be better than experienced stock brokers to a teenager whose legal advice prove more useful in the people's eyes compared to the members of the Bar. All these are possible as they compete in the ultimate playing field called the Internet.     Author then progresses from the Internet to the concept of change in general and closes with Bill Joy's article on Wired magazine titled, \\"Why the Future Doesn't Need Us\\" outlining the software guru's fear of change. In the end CHANGE of which the Internet is just one form is the ultimate leveller in any playing field.     Excellent writing indeed.	2003-10-24

Adroit maneuvering was done with the help of his lawyer Sandy and lawyer-girlfriend Eva.<br />As the story progresses one gets the feeling that Grisham has stacked the cards too much on the heroes' side for Lanigan has every move by his pursuers anticipated and promptly parried.<br />The story is good but I would place it at a lower rung to his other novels (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Brethren).	2003-10-04

This book chronicles the different life stories of the prominent personalities of the F1 paddock - Bernie Ecclestone, Max Mosley, Frank Williams, Ron Dennis as well as some of the old members like Enzo Ferrari, Walker, Cooper and Chapman. Also chronicles the rise of Paul Stoddart, the owner of the Minardi Team. <br />Instead of delving on the inner workings of the Piranha Club, the author opts to present a collection of biographies of the more prominent members of the Club. There are some anecdotes on the inner workings interwoven between the life stories of the team principals(e.g. Schumacher's transfer from Jordan to Benetton, poaching of Minardi's chief engineer by Toyota, Frank Williams closeness with Ron Dennis) but they are few and far between. <br />If the author could have made these inner workings of the club as the main thesis of the book then it could have been a far worthwhile read.	2003-09-20
US	49268248	R13T1B3PNED4B9	0061032425	325593509	The Family	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A Family Tragedy	Tells the story of quite an unconventional family - the Pope's and all the sacrifices each member has to go through to do the \\"will of God\\" (Warning: You may be appalled upon reading what these sacrifices really are, one wonders how these events were allowed to happen in the Holy See). As with most Puzo novels, it has the puppeteer (Rodrigo Borgia aka Pope Alexander) that holds all the strings. <br />I give this book 4 stars because I can sense a deviation in writing style at the end owed to the fact that Carol Gino concluded this novel as requested by the dying Mario Puzo.	2003-09-11

Couldn't find a more entertaining technical book while truly being enlightened on the world of cryptography. I can't wait to read this author's book on Fermat's Last Theorem.	2003-08-18
