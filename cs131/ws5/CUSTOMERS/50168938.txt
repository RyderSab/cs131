Now that I've read it, it seems to me it's the good-old-boys network supporting one of their own.  It realy is nothing more than a potboiler.  So much of the story is disjointed - you are jarred going from one scene to another - where is the transition or even the rationale?  No character is real - they merely behave how you would think they should.  There is no real development and no poetry in the writing.  It really seems like a non-fiction writer said &quot;now I must write that novel.&quot;  Too bad really good books by completely unknown writers don't get the big write-up from the Times.  My book club prefers to read books they have &quot;heard about&quot; rather than try a new author who really has talent.  So much for promoting new good writers rather than ensuring that the inner circle keeps earning their money so they can stick around and support their buddies.  Corrupt that this book gets the big splash.	2004-06-20

As someone else said - unlike the raver who said it wasn't an autobiography and shouldn't be written as if it were - it really is the internal state of a man's mind. I disagree about the term &quot;elderly&quot; in yet another review - aging yes but elderly no.  I found him very human despite his occupation and felt badly when he couldn't have what he ultimately wanted.  I found the writing very gentle and lovely considering Signor Fafalla's job.  As a parallel I was reading Sarah Dunant's Mapping the Edge at the same time.  As both main characters are trying to get away from someone else, albeit in different ways, sometimes I would expect to find Edmund in the other book as well.  It was becoming a surreal experience.  I actually recommend it.	2004-06-17

It's also hard to believe that there really was a great meeting-of-the-mind relationship between Abby and Bobby in that after his having been away for so long in the Navy their communciation skills seem to be reduced to the bed.  I had to stop reading this book which is rare.  For me a novel with two authors rings warning bells.  And unfortunately this was no exception.  Really hack work that makes one wonder why it got past some editor's slush pile.  I'd have given it no stars if I could have done.	2004-04-28

This is what I felt was lacking in the Theroux.  With Struass you wonder if the title story came first and then the enrichments followed or whether the shorter stories were the burgeoning ideas that came together in the larger.  No matter.  It was all so skillfully done.  Despite the act that the subject was a little tender for me having lost a loved one recently, Strauss's creative skills kept me involved with her ideas and never allowed me to stray into my own grieving ones.  Despite the subject matter - a great read.	2004-04-16

I have to agree wholeheartedly with Theresa who penned the &quot;Dull&quot; review.  This has nothing whatsoever to maintain your interest. To me it's even worse than the Artemisia book which couldn't hold a candle to Lapierre's one about the same artist. Why do I get the distinct feeling that this was intended for a Young Adult audience?  So many paragraphs merely one-sentence long, so much &quot;made-up&quot; dialog.  I went about 28 pages longer than Theresa but put this into the &quot;Life is Too Short&quot; category.  My husband was shocked when I told him I had chucked it. Also like Theresa, I try to finish books but this one had absolutely no redeeming qualities.  Vreeland - unfortunately - for me is a one-book author.  I'll not try another of hers.  From Great to OK to Bad.  Terrible progression.	2004-03-19

For me, they are not - in general you understand - as satisfying as a novel.  Too hasty and short if they are good, too unfulfilling and short if they are not.  This is a slightly different case for me.<br />The theme of the title story is sort of retold in a different framework in a second one.  Neither to me are satisfying. With the Palazzo story I get the feeling that it SHOULD HAVE BEEN a novel but that there really was only a limited story to tell.  Sex without conversation gets dull even for an author.  The \\"readalike\\" seemed to be another way to try and draw out the same story.  Neither worked for me.<br />The stories that are grouped together under the \\"Judas\\" theme posed an even more difficult issue for me.  They seemed like doodles.  By that I mean - Theroux wanted the characters in them to do something but couldn't settle on one thing. So he tried in different ways, and lacking the ability to develop them (they really aren't interesting people) gave us all the attempts in this short story collection.  To me they were barebones, or sketches if you will, of an idea.<br />Recently I saw a drawing show of Parmagianino's work at the Frick Museum in NYC.  There were many sheets of what my friend calls \\"doodles\\" which is how he defines sketches and studies for \\"real\\" drawings or paintings.  I asked myself why I loved looking at the art studies but resented reading what I thought were literary studies.  I think the reason is that an artist's thought process is interesting for comparison to what he finally achieves.  A writer's studies are not interesting in the same way unless there is a final definitive version.<br />Also, the artist - Parmagianino for example - never expected his studies (doodles) to be seen.  In contrast, Theroux has assembled his and published them as a final product.  <br />This is not satisfying to me.  But I'm sure I am in the minority.  Moral:  I should stick to novels.	2004-03-08

This is the weakest of Chevalier's novels.  Yes it's a fast read (the faster the read the less style and substance?) - and yes it talks about the tapestries and tapestry making - but it really did have a lot of unnecessary soft-core porn.  Actually of all the Vermeer books that came out at the time of Girl with Pearl Earring I really thought Girl in Hyacinth Blue the best of the lot.  But even her second book was VERY LACKING.  Once these authors make it big with one book - why do they have to grind them out?  Why do they begin to aim for the lowest common denominator instead of striving toward excellence. Or are they all really just one-book writers?	2004-02-12

Amazing also that when you compare the two books - Family issues beginning in the 50s and continuing to the present - that Meloy manages to convey the same feelings and insights in far fewer pages.  And I might add with more sensitivity - at least for me.  So Franzen better come off his high horse there's competition on the horizon.	2003-12-20

I just want to talk about style, which only some have done.  The Reader's Notes and Author's Comments are indeed charming and as one reviewer said in these pages - it took a while to get the rhythm (every book has its own, this one has two) but once you do - you miss when things happen in the narrative and there are no notes.  The other thing I loved is the sentence structure that at times mirrors actual sentences from Alcott.  It shows the mastery of the author despite &quot;Shlockbuster&quot;'s comments.  Glad to hear Weber teaches at Yale.  Gives me hope for the future of novel writing.	2003-10-30

I found it interesting to see how Carolina and David handled their emotions and their lives.

Hard to believe that a book that truly makes you feel the pain of its protagonists can be so sweet.  The structure is nothing short of brilliant with the constant juxtaposing of a chapter where you meet and get to know the participants of Sean's Thanksgiving gathering with one prophesizing their(sometimes)sorrowful fates.  A real tour de force that hopefully will be read by many.	2002-04-16

For a better written depiction of Artemisia try Alexandra Lapierre.  And no characterization of Galileo can top Sobel.  It seems as if Vreeland was writing to make a deadline or fulfill a contract for that critical second book.  It's not written from the heart.	2002-03-26

I loved the part about &quot;La Choisir du Roi&quot; and the &quot;Chocolate Chaud.&quot;  It was very endearing and it made me dream of Paris.  The only thing that disturbed me was the absence of Martha until the part about the baby.  Wasn't she there all the time?

Instead of keeping you on  the edge of your seat Saylor keeps you asleep in your seat. In no manner  can he (in the case of this book) be compared with Caleb Carr. All too  often during the development of his plot does he take off on lengthy  detours that totally destroy whatever tension or suspense that he is trying  to develop i.e. the Female Clerks Bill. The book finally gets moving at the  beginning of Part III on page 225. O. Henry's position as a protaganist is  minimal. The conclusion is predictable as Saylor pretty much broadcasts it  throughout the book. All in all a tedious and boring book.	2000-08-08

As  a librarian and as a person who holds a Masters of Fine Arts degree, I  found the synthesis of art and literature extremely moving.

Although I finished it, the story began to lose me (I'll try and do this without giving anything away) when Beatrice  responds as she does to Warrren.  Nothing given to us about his character  up to that point would seem to cause her doubts.  Not to mention that what  finally happens between them seems to evolve not out of the normal flow of  their lives but more in the way of an author's attempt to write a potential  movie.  It had so many possibilities in the beginning but dwindled, at  least for me, to hokey contrivances.	2000-02-16
