You could call Mallory a nonfiction fiction because it represented reality in a form of illusion, an imaginary biography, but based on a true story. Though he dedicated this piece of work to his friend Vic Mallory who is a Californian private eye in a critical acclaimed work of fiction. It's rather an adventure that represents the missing Mallory. In the book, someone was portraying the characters of Mallory including his voice, names, personalities, attitudes, records and data, in fact the person must have known or read about Mallory in the past and decided to act in his wise. You will be surprised to find out at the tail end of this thriller material that Mallory never existed because his face was never seen but he was hopping around in reality but he never existed. You will need to concentrate and follow the storyline to catch this magic I am talking about. Somebody was playing two roles, he will appear as his real self and again he will suddenly resurface this time, as Mallory but his face remained unrevealed. Just try and give it a digestive knowledge. Chase was as cunning as the famous Machiavellian by doing this job. He picks on someone and writes his story but using the name of somebody else that he intends to dedicate it to, its as red hot as Sharon stone in \\"Basic instinct\\" what a misdemeanor indeed; maybe that was why he was assassinated in 1985 for writing about a guy. He remains the best crime thrillers of all time. He has great talents for work of art with a basic instinct for criminal ideology.

The first time I picked up the book, I knew I wasn't going to put it down until I close it's last pages considering Doris Lessing's back-cover note, it really gave me all the extra-ordinary intellectual energy I needed to boost me read the book twice and over again. I feel great reading it. It was like skating on thin ice, yet a foresight into the pains of felony and hatred, the need to be loved and cared.<br />From the shattering sounds of broken glasses to the odor of the old drugstore and the chemistry laboratory, Vicky who is Sybil's memory trace during her blackouts began to recall all her lost episodes from childhood at Willow corner through adolescence in Philadelphia. \\"Sybil\\", the Biography of Sybil Isabel Dorsett by Flora Rheta Schreiber is a psychological masterpiece that will eventually make the reader take a closer look at the person next to him/her considering the astonishment discovery of this intriguing and fascinating true-life-story of a woman possessed with sixteen separate and distinct personalities. The book unveils the evil associated with child abuse & neglect. It also condemns the horrific ordeal of nursing emotions within as a naïve person. Infact it is Reality beyond the limits of perception in the research of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD).<br />Sybil, who through the scourge of a schizophrenic inflicted mother went through certain odd torments, disassociated herself by splitting into sixteen separate and distinct personalities while coping with the anguish of fear and anger in order to protect and defend herself through disintegration when the real self could no longer bear the pains of neglect and abuse coupled with a fundamentalist father who was less concerned about the emotions and feelings of his daughter. In her struggle for survival and recovery, Flora Rheta introduced Dr. Cornelia Wilbur a psychoanalyst to Sybil. She diagnosed her and indeed befriends all the other selves after hypnotizing them with the aim of merging them into a single self. Another intriguing aspect of this book is that two out of the sixteen personalities were male features thereby lengthening the therapy. <br />The insight objective part of this story is that it is helpful to all both as a psychologist and as a person because it reveals a lot of damages done mentally, emotionally, physically and psychologically in child abuse/neglect, moreso it unravels the building of a defensive wall within some emotional struggles in a naïve person as a means of survival. I hereby recommend the book \\"SYBIL\\" as a must read for all who crave and quest for intellectual knowledge in child psychology and juvenile delinquency.<br />Infact if I could ever narrate a book with all pleasure, it will be `Sybil' and if I could ever re-reader a book over and over again with all interest, it must be \\"Sybil\\". I love the story though a painful experience but I just can't let it go. Her case was a misdemeanor of neglect and the need to be loved and cared for. The Real Sybil died in 1998 after successfully becoming whole. She has proved change to be a dynamic fact and time to be there for us no matter how long it takes to heal a wound. It's one of the best books on earth. Thanks goodness I read the book.
