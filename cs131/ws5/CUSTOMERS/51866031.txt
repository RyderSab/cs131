In investigating why Linda Haldeman only wrote three novels, I came upon an obituary dated in the early 80's.  I can only guess that this is the sad reason for the lack of any new writings.  Do yourself a favor, read all three.  You will love them, they are wonderful.	2005-08-12

The biography is not well written, which I generally expect from a English professor (too self-involved.} Beside the mediocre writing, the proofing is terrible, as is the editing--if there was any--leaving mistakes and errors galore.<br />If the reader is interested in Zelda and her descent into madness and what happened after Scott died, chose another book.

I read these books the first time they came out.  I had to special order The Darkest Road because my bookstore never got it in.  From the first I found these books to be beautifully written, perhaps only a woman can understand the tortured beauty of Jennifer or the sacrifices Kim made to become a seer.  To say that any of Kay's characters lack depth is to show yourself not well read or a bigot of some kind.  I am an English teacher and every year I recommend these books to my students.  Those who read them, come to me to thank me every time.  I think these three books are more emotionally satisfying and adult than Tolkien.  I read them at least once a year, myself. All of Kay's books are lovely and I await them anxiously.  But, The Summer Tree trilogy is Kay's best and most satisfying work!!!!!	2001-05-05

When Amazon opened its web-doors, it was one of the first out of print books I ordered.<br />This is a story of an English girl  who must come to grips with the strange and twisted past of her ancient  family.  This mystery centers around a doll named Dido who seems to exert  supernatural control over its owner.  A truly delicious and delightful  book.	2000-05-05

I am transported everytime I read it (and read it and read it.)  There is much room for a sequel. I have asked Ms. Dean what happened in the  next seven years?  Who were the two dearer?  And what about Robin and  Janet's room mate, much mention was made of Robin finally finding the one  who understood him?  Are Janet's baby and Thomas the next intended  sacrifices?  She says she is thinking about it, but it's not in the works  yet.  In the meantime, try Juniper, Gentian and Rosemary.	1999-08-24
