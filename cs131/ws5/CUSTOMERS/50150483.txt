I recently saw the author on a \\"Larry King Live\\"  televised interview where she held her own with four theologians including Deepak Chopkra.  Her perspective on intuition and  awareness made sense.  In this book she  further explains the value of being \\"in sync with the universe.\\"<br /><br />  You may not agree with her perspective nor her psychic readings adventures.  I didn't. Yet Ms. Margolis'  book opens a doorway to possibilities, and the inherent power within each of us to understand and navigate the currents of life more smoothly.  This is a very interesting perspective,  worth the read.<br /><br />  Ms. Margolis writes  \\"life is a school, and we are here to learn lessons as co-workers with Spirit.\\"  If that concept seems  plausible to you,  ---- after you finish reading this book,  take a look at  \\"Many Lives, Many Masters\\" by Brian Weiss,  \\"Journey of Souls,\\" by Michael Newton, and Harold Klemp's \\"The Language of Soul\\" and \\"How To Survive Spiritually in Our Times.\\"	2005-04-23

For example, \\"Complain all you like about the raw deal you have gotten in life, but don't expect those complaints to get you anywhere,\\" - and -  \\"Even if you have to fake it, show some faith in yourself,\\" - or-  \\"Don't expect competence and hard work alone to get you the recognition or rewards you deserve.. for any organization, government, private business, educational or other, is essentially a social body that rewards those fully engaged in the game.

He emphasizes  the value of who you are is how people identify you.

A shallow, egotistical, superficial, handsome TV journalist loses his hand in a freak accident while at the Circus, covering a story.  This event, a major turning point,  opens the door for emotional growth, a change for the better, not only in  the journalist but also in the people who come into his life as a result.

He received an Academy Award in 1999, for the best adapted screenplay of his &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;.  &quot;The Fourth Hand&quot; capably demonstrates that people who seem incapable of change ----  can indeed change.

Kinney, this passionate musician is described as &quot; an honest man -  never cruel, never angry - but he could make you nervous because you never knew what he was going to say.  I hear in his music and his tone his warmth and his humanity.  When he played it wasn't an analytical thing; it was emotional, from his heart.  He was eccentric, not like many of us, but he gave his love freely and we, most of us, cannot imagine what he went through.  He wanted to go out roaring, and he did.&quot; After you finish this collection about  a gifted and troubled artist, try reading, &quot;Shipmates&quot; by Lorraine Seeley, and &quot;Red Willow's Quest&quot;, by Heidi Skarie.

Did you know that Bing Crosby started out as a Law Student, or that he &quot;bombed&quot; at the New York Paramount Theatre in his first appearances there with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra, or that Hollywood glued his ears back because they were too &quot;big&quot; on screen,  or that he credits Louie Armstrong for heightening his awareness of phrasing a song and scatting?  Gary Giddens has researched interviews and archives to bring the beauty of &quot;Bing&quot;, to our attention again in this book.  Photographs are included and reveal this multi-talented, multi-faceted, gifted entertainer, singer and movie star.  He was suave, swinging,  affable, an acknowledged &quot;nice&quot; guy.  Much more that just an echo in the valley, he was a pioneering jazz vocalist capable of delivering and commanding every kind of music: spiritual songs, blues, western ballads, Irish lullabies.  Remember those delightful &quot;On the Road&quot; films with Dorothy Lamour and Bob Hope?  While you are reading this book,  listen to Bing's  CD's;  especially,  &quot;Bing Crosby- His Legendary Years 1931-1957&quot;. He is just too marvelous for words, and according to author Gary Giddins, dramatized pop and played a central role in American cultural history.	2001-04-22

Fed up with a sense of no voice in political issues, and hearing so many other folks express the same sentiments of &quot;big money&quot; barriers existing between people and the officials elected to represent them, Granny Haddock  decided to campaign for financial reform by taking her show on the road in her own way-- &quot;walking across America&quot;.  Her book is an engrossing collection of her experiences as she walked across deserts,- through Native American Villages- and when confronted with snow- took off her sneakers, put on skis and skied one hundred miles across West Virginia. This is determination, focused purpose and love of life at its best.  What an example!  Reminiscient of those Charles Coralt driving through the heartland of America stories, or Garrison Keillor's Lake Woe-be-gone essays,  Granny Haddock's pilgrimage touches and informs you. After reading her book, it will be difficult to whine about anything ever again without getting involved and making an effort to do something about it.  Inspirational!	2001-04-21

One that captures the feelings, the tension, the imagery, the pace, the challenge, the passion, the splendor, the quest for survival in days gone by, and makes the reader feel that they are right there in the moment with the characters.  The saga of a lovely indian maiden maturing into the role of medicine woman of her tribe is fascinating.  My great grandmother was of the Cherokee tribe.  She served her people similarly with her knowledge of plants, herbs, and  natures healing secrets.  Someday I will write her story.  But for now I savor Ms. Skarie's representation of life in the early 1800's.  She mentions in her foreword someone experiencing a past life as a Native American woman.  Maybe Shirley MacClaine is on to something!  Past lives? Dreams?  Reincarnation?  Is it possible that we have all lived before?  If so that would mean we are all on a great spiritual or mystical adventure.  But, back to this book.  Accompanied by her dog, Wind-Chaser and a warrior, Red Willow triumphs over opposition, adversity and danger.  Life then was alternately harsh, cruel and beautiful.  The book attempts to accurately portray the past, using the language and biting terms of that era.  Some passages are painfully honest, but that was 1800.  Compare it to today's society, and see how far we have come in our efforts  as a nation, as people, as individuals who respect and do not intentionally harm each other.

Young children are capable of learning facts if you break them down to their level,  authors Van Ausdale and Feagin write, and the sooner  this open and honest dialogue occurs,  the better little children can develop a strong sense of fairness.  Age 3 is not too young to introduce basics- things children visualize and can touch like skin color, eye shape and hair texture.  Waiting for middle school is too late, so the burden of teaching differences in a positive way falls to parents.  The authors emphasize if diversity, tolerance and fighting bigotry are taught at home with parents imparting their values there will be no room for misunderstanding when children begin to interact with others.  Much of the data presented comes from studies made at several multiethic child-care centers where children had little interaction with people of other ethnic groups, and probably had not been taught about race.  Their revealed misconceptions and attitudes were often disconcerting.  This book offers a comprehensive look at America today, the issue of race, and how to help our children better understand and cope with the reality of racism before the &quot;hurtful confrontation&quot;.  Interested readers, not only parents and teachers, will learn a lot from this book.  It is a step in a positive direction.	2001-02-02

After a while we start wondering also, as we view life through Susanna Kaysen's eyes, her unbalanced ward-mates and experience the inside machinations of a psychiatric ward. What is illusion? what is reality?  The book is bizarre, yet engrossing.  Yes, there is a strong resemblance to &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.&quot;  After you finish reading this book, look at the &quot;Girl Interrupted&quot; film version  starring Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie and Whoopie Goldberg.  It is an equally powerful and entertaining representation of this young gifted, warped girl finding her true self and coming of age during 18 months in a hospital.	2001-01-12

George Forman continues to impress me with his never ending ability to survive.  This man is never down for the count.  His life experience thus far seems to be, &quot; It ain't over til it's over&quot;.  His autobiography  re-tells the exciting brutal saga of his journey from the hungry angry &quot;tiger&quot;, a brawler, to a fighting machine, a champion boxer. His wins, his defeats, his pain, his agony, his forced retirement from the ring- -( &quot;they&quot;- the judges,  just didn't want him anymore,) -- to successful sales and marketing  entrepreneur, unfold in graphic detail.  The photographs are superb.  The man with that wonderful smile just kept re-inventing himself.  Like Phoenix rising from the ashes, George Foreman found the beautiful quality within himself and manifested a new life.  We meet his family, wife and children and empathize with the pure positive power of love. and the spiritual side of this gentleman boxer.  By the way,  I saw that fight, and the judges were wrong.  But for their mean-spirited short-sightness, greed, and need to control the boxing world, George Foreman might still be astounding us in the ring.  But on the other hand,  I might not be cooking wonderful tasting food on my George Foreman Grill and learning new nuances about cooking from George's cookbook, nor laughing hilariously at George's skillful articulate handling of Bill O'Reilly on his own spin-zone, &quot;The O'Reilly Factor&quot; televised show,  nor appreciating how George  truly nutures and sets the pace for his children, nor marveling at how the maturation process can  indeed transform an  individual. He is still the Winner and Champion, in my book.  A role model who understands the value of being the example to those he loves.  Don't take my word for it-  read his books, get to know this man,  and get the grill, which comes in a variety of sizes.  Yes,  George Forman thought of everything.

You may or may not agree with the stated assertions, but you will  find them interesting.  For example, - philanthropy should be linked with justice which creates standards for wise giving; those responsible for their own misfortune should be sent to the end of the receiving donations line.

She overcomes fear,  in spite of the tragic circumstances of her birth; and learns how to trust in her beliefs and her unique gift of using the eyes of love.  It's not the &quot;Carrie&quot; psychic repeat, nor the &quot;Dorothy and her little dog Toto too vs the wicked witch&quot; scenario.  Although there are some creative references to magic for you &quot;Harry Potter- series &quot; fans.  &quot;Starbright and the Dream Eater&quot;  is a fine adventure story, and a  fascinating way to consider facing the challenges of life.  I liked this book.  It is the fictional complement to &quot;Don't Sweat the Small Stuff- for Teens&quot; by Dr. Richard Carlson.

Author Sarah Bradford unveils the saga of this modern &quot;Guinevere&quot; in beautiful glossy photos and simplistic prose.  Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was a refined, tough lady who clung tenaciously to life following the death of her husband.  Surviving the loss of a loved one is a horrendous experience.  Living under the glaring intrusive  scrutiny of the press, and an inquisitive adoring  public, and in the &quot;rarified, stifling&quot; air of the Kennedy clan, and the political arena of action makes the recently televised &quot;Survivor&quot; series look like a date with popcorn and cotton candy.  Familarity with the challenges Jackie faced makes reading this book even more enjoyable, since  we already know the outcome, there is no tension or skimming of pages to get to the end of the book to see how the author resolves the &quot;plot&quot;.  Ms. Bradford has given us a fascinating look at a lady who survived- simply survived-- &quot;Camelot&quot;, and went on with her life -- to Greece with Ari Onassis, and then back to the USA. alone.  This &quot;Guinevere&quot; did not &quot;hie thee to a nunnery&quot;, as in medieval days,  but stepped fully into life and lived it on her own courageous  terms.  Those who appreciate history, drama, and tales of strong women will like this book.  I did.

Not moving up the corporate ladder as quickly as you think you should?  Was your brilliant idea or presention rejected?  Were you overlooked for a promotion?  Why?  This book attempts to answer these questions.  Author, Paul Stoltz has identified three types of people in the workplace, and how they react to setbacks.  First there are quitters who are bitter and avoid change; secondly, campers who settle into comfort zones, and thirdly, climbers who are relentless in the pursuit of their goals.  He emphasizes that &quot;climbers&quot;  are the achievers.  The book is is filled with self assessment charts and maps for strategies.  But the key, it seems is perserverance not paranoia; focused effort not whining; and  setting realistic goals, then taking action.  Employers and employees will welcome this &quot;window&quot; into how to succeed in the business world.  Oh yes,  this author writes about work-related stress.

It is clever insightful, humorous.  The author, Roger Rosenblatt describes his approach as &quot;like the ten commandments, but without the moral base&quot;.  He offers a list of 56 &quot;don'ts&quot;.  Take a look at rule 41 which is meant for people who are at least 50 years old, who work for people younger- much younger- than themselves.  The rule says, &quot; NO THEY DON'T- AND SO WHAT?&quot;  It means  younger bosses do not remember how good you are at what you do; don't realize how very special you are, nor how gifted nor how distinguished.  No, they don't-- and so what?  Another crisp zinger is rule 2.  NOBODY IS THINKING ABOUT YOU.  Translation please?  They are thinking about themselves, just like you.  And here's one more.  Rule 6.  YES YOU DID.  Translation?  If you have the slightest question as to whether or not you are responsible for a wrongdoing, you are.  As soon as you think, &quot;I really didn't do it&quot;-- you did.  The author calls this book a survival manual of sorts.  A final tip offered is , &quot;Let bad enough alone&quot;,  that is, remember the value of keeping your mouth shut.  Don't try to explain yourself in the throes of a scandal.  It's an easy book to read.  When you finish it,  glance at &quot;Don't Sweat The Small Stuff for Teens&quot; by Dr. Richard Carlson.  It has something for everyone, not just for teens,  who grow up to be those younger bosses with whom you over age 50 readers must contend.  Two very likeable books for readers of all ages.	2000-11-24

The book title indicates &quot;for teens&quot;, but anyone could benefit from some of the author's suggestions.  For example, when someone is talking, avoid the words, &quot;I know.&quot;; or &quot;dare to show enthusiam.  Be a volunteer in your community-- find something that you really enjoy doing and do it! - Don't infect your friends with negative thoughts if you're in a low mood.-- Instead of making unkind, caustic comments, stay away from those close to you until you feel better; that way, you don't have to feel guilty, make apologies or re-ignite your stress worrying  about any inappropriate hurtful words you might have used --Try some meditation or contemplation or yoga exercises to be more relaxed.&quot;  Richard Carlson's hypothesis is-  if you don't get stressed out about the small things, then dealing with more complex issues becomes easier.  The book offers advice without lecturing and the topics are brief.  One could read a few pages daily.  Highly recommended reading. Quite inspirational, and not just for teens.

I first saw this gentleman on the &quot;O'Reilly Factor&quot; chatting with Bill O'Reilly about the climate in America and the pursuit of the American Dream for all americans.  His poise, presence and the manner with which he responded to questions from his host impressed me.  His book is equally impressive and candid.  He writes from the depths of his own experiences and sweeps us along into the painful long-standing unresolved issues of today:  &quot;families without fathers&quot;, &quot;the on-going victim consciousness&quot;, &quot;the welfare system that perpetuates dependency, malaise, apathy, defeatism, expectation of entitlement- generation after generation, after generation.&quot;  His focus is on black americans; those who are still struggling, as well as those who have achieved success.  &quot;From Rage to Responsibility&quot; is the saga of one man's tranformation from anger to acceptance and responsibility for his own actions, the ripples he &quot;creates in others&quot;,  and his belief in his own natural innate ability to achieve success.  It is about recognizing one's own self-worth rather than succumbing to the negative binding seductive rhetoric of others. Self-value, self- wisdom or self-realization some might call it.  Tapping into the natural knowledge and beauty that is within you, and drawing on it to survive.  What is refreshing about this book is that it does not promote rebellion nor anarchy not hate, nor angry explosions, but offers loving solutions to complex issues.  The power of love as the panacea for political and social issues?  Nothing new about the concept, but who applies it?  Maybe more &quot;movers and shakers&quot; will-- after reading this penetrating book.  In the words of Bill O'Reilly, &quot;I certainly respect you, Reverend Peterson, and the work you are doing.&quot;  Read the book-  wake up, and listen to another voice, make up your own mind about the quality of your life!	2000-10-24

He writes,  &quot;I'm a captain of industry myself, though my craft is more like a rowboat than an ocean liner.

I like to work in my garden and have often felt the soothing touch of soil on my fingertips as I placed my plants in the earth, watering them with care; observing the gentle breeze in the air, the sunlight and chirping of nearby birds.  So peaceful, so tranquil, a reminder of the beauty and perpetual order of nature.  In this book, gardeners talk abut the spiritual and healing aspects of gardening.  Some mention how working in the garden offers solace in times of grief and provides lessons about the seasons, the cyclical nature of life.  Ms Goldman writes &quot;Gardening evokes these deeper feelings. It helps people see that there is another area to life where you can nurture yourself.&quot;  Step away from the hectic pressure of your daily life, when you can-- relieve the stress, plant something in your garden.  It's exercise, its nice, its comforting.  Did you know that petunias can perk you up?  And wasn't there a sacred song with a lyric, &quot; One is nearer God's heart in a garden- than any where else on earth?&quot;  No wonder home gardening is so beneficial in so many ways for so many people.

Dynamic, terse, over flowing with facts,  Larry Elder invites debate.  Among the issues, the &quot;things you can't say in America&quot;, that he dares to explore are racism, drugs, the glass ceiling,politics and the destructive media.  If you read this book, you're in for a very different perspective.  Underneath the searing glass of this authors microscope are  Orrin Hatch,  Ted Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson, Gloria Allred, Dick Morris, The Los Angeles Times, Spider-Man Comics, Johnnie Cochran, O.J.

Akin to Lao Tzu's, &quot;The Way of Life&quot;, and Galil  Gibran's, &quot;The Prophet&quot;. and Paul Twitchell's, &quot;Stranger By  The River&quot;, this book may inspire you to open  your own inner doorway  to God. It is a profound and loving treatise.  Earn your spiritual wings  everyday?  Always another step in spiritual unfoldment?  Are you ready to  face yourself and master your spiritual destiny?  Then this is the book for  you.	2000-09-09

While working for a forest protection agency as part of a fire-fighting  crew, the author fell through a wall of branches and found himself  teetering on the end of a log as it jutted out over the edge of a cliff.  Some thirty feet below are jagged boulders. Pitching forward and falling,  he is saved by the firm hand of an unseen loving presence that pushes him  back to safety and solid ground.  So begins the first of six miracles  experienced by James Davis.  He calls thems gifts intended to open a  different window to heaven.  The book details a natural progression of  insights drawn from his personal experiences, dreams, and synchronicities  of a mysterious key which keeps appearing at various intervals in his path.  The Egyptian Rosetta Stone is a historical key which unlocked writings of  a lost civilization.  Mr Davis' &quot;Rosetta Stone of God&quot; similarly  unlocks  &quot;treasures from the vaults of heaven&quot; by reminding us of  our own gifts.  The book is a call to spiritual adventure, a nudge to be  more alert and aware of the synchroncities, turning points and miracles in  our own lives.  If you like reading &quot; Celestine Prophecy&quot;, or  books by Deepak Chopkra,  James Van Praagh, Dr. Michael Weiss, Joan Grant,  or Dr Michael Newton, you will appreciate this author's work.  Mr Davis  invites readers to document your own personal experiences: keep daily  notes- a living travelog of your life, including the discoveries that are  special to just you.  I like this book.  It is clear, timely, and  highlights alternative choices,  options for facing todays current  challenges and issues.  Highly recommended for those seriously interested  in  spiritual knowledge and spiritual adventure.	2000-09-09

How often have you thought, &quot;I wish I hadn't said or done that?&quot;  as the person you are talking to closes up and makes a hasty retreat.  This  book heightens ones awareness of &quot;toxic traits&quot;- how we turn  people off and conversely &quot;magic pills&quot; - ways or styles or  qualities that will win points with everyone.  Sure it is common sense, and  there is really no new turf or ground explored, yet it never hurts to take  a closer look at ones self.  Highly recommended reading for recent  graduates, young professionals eager to make a good impression on the job,  or for anyone.  The authors call it &quot;Impression Management&quot;.  I  like it.  Here's a few of Ms Dimitrius' and Mr Mazzarella's &quot;magic  pills&quot;; eye contact, a smile, a good handshake and greeting, posture  and ehthusiam.  Their &quot;Toxic traits&quot; turning people off are :  gossip, pettiness, sarcasm, cursing and bad hygiene.	2000-09-08

Deepak Chopra has undertaken a mighty task- to make the invisible  &quot;visible&quot; and the unknowable, &quot;knowable.&quot;  Sages and  scholars expend tremendous amounts of energy trying to explain God.  This  author does it simply and clearly.  I have watched his many televised  lectures and appearances.  He writes with the same confidence and ease;  offering us the process of knowing God through personal experiences,  dreams, visions and daily miracles.  Reading his account of how the human  anatomy corresponds to laws of physics, and his description of our  spiritual essence as enlightened souls, is inspiring.

I like  this book. After I finished reading it, the words, the rhythm remained in  my mind resonating like a Mozart Sonata.

Isabel Allende's grasp of history and her infusion of it  in this story far exceeds her previous writings.  Sometimes the  detail and  multiple perspectives and viewpoints of characters get in the way of plot  continuity for the reader, but over-all this book is a passionate  masterpiece.	2000-07-01

I usually avoid war novels.  I do not enjoy re-visiting the past terrain of man's inhumanity to man, however  SHIPMATES is a healing journey not only for the people in the book but for the reader as well.  Vivid imagery  and beautifully crafted words lift us from the agony of remembrance to the  soaring heights of redemption, and ecstatic joy. As Lewis Seeley is  released from his own pain and guilt, so is the reader.  I experienced  gratitude for the cessation of Lewis' tormenting nightmares.  SHIPMATES is  an engrossing, magnificient tribute to all who have served in battle, and  is an enlightening documentation of the challenges they face before, during  and after a war.	2000-03-17

Humans learning more about helping themselves cope with life, through their contact with animals.  My two favorite stories  are Mixa, a dog who taught her mistress about trust,  unconditional love and respect; and  two tiny birds providing examples of  compassion and committment.  After reading the book,  I was inspired to  step outside my house and be more alert as I move among natures creatures.  The birds, the bees, the chameleons, the turtles, may be my special Angel  Animal friends waiting in place to help me.  Highly recommended.  Read it,  you won't ever again be oblivious to an animal.  I found this book to be an  ideal gift for my family and friends.	2000-03-12
