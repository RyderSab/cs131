After getting through a very thick accent the author has, along with many mispronounciations and grammatical blips, I decided to investigate this book in hard copy. If you go to any Christian bookstore and look at selections under, 'Charismatic' or 'Charismatic Interest', one will find a gazillion books on miracles, visions, NDE's, new revelations, and the like. Ms. Baxter has added on to Holy Scripture, and this is strictly verboten. I understand the author is 'ordained' in some church. That in itself is unscriptural, as the Sciptures do not permit the 'ordination' of women. A lot of the content falls in line with the holiness code of the Cleveland, Tennessee, Church of God, from which she hails. You can find books like this in the 'New Age' bookstores, as they cater to dreams and visions and new revelations as well.  I find Baxter's book to be a book of heresy and fantasy. I think she needs to lay off the spicy food before she retires for the evening. Also, a good dose of orthodox Theology courses will do no little good. One might as well give approval to the visions of Our Lady of Fatima. Those 3 children, in 1917, were allegedly shown a vision of Hell. So what's the difference between them and this??? Again, doesn't the Gospel tell us in the story of the rich man and Lazarus, that even if someone came back from the grave totell us about hell, some folks wouldn't believe? Let's concentrate on the words, 'even if...'Of course, this will not be a popular review, as I do not endorse extra-Biblical so-called revelations. No-one, including the author, has ever been to Hell and come back to talk about it. Want descriptions of Hell?  Run the word in your Biblical concordance. And stay out of it!!!!!	2005-09-20

It is wildly popular in the prisons, where cults flourish and multiply like bedbugs. It is a first-class book of rank heresy and deception. It is the nature of people to be attracted by the off-beat, and new 'revelations' and occultic dreck, shying away from the traditional God-breathed Scripture.  Many people have been deceived by this garbage, and continue to be so. Save your money and get something solid rather than visions and pure conjecture.	2005-09-20

I find them riveting, vivid, and can usually finish them in one sitting. However, I am finding the 'hip-hop novel' becoming increasingly boring. The plot varies little: much explicit sex, murder, mayhem, using/selling drugs, greed and materialism to the max, and the usual twists and turns of gangsta life. Unfortunately, it is becoming quite clear that if one reads one 'hip-hop novel', one has read them all. I feel that Thomas has a lot to offer and has a talent for writing. i would hope that he would broaden his genre; to limit one's self to one topic can become stultifying at the least. The book is good. It holds your attention. One can feel one's self right in the mix. But,the topic is becoming old, IMHO.	2005-08-11

Crosby (Library of Religious Biography (LRB))	Books	5	26	28	N	N	The Protestant Saint	People in the latter nineteenth century and early twentieth century(and those today who know of her) considered Fanny Crosby to have been one of the greatest persons who ever lived. They very well may have been right. This tiny (4'9\\") woman, blinded shortly after birth, wrote over 10,000 gospel hymns, many of which survive today, such as, 'Near the Cross', 'Blessed Assurance', 'To God be the Glory' and others(see the Cyber Hymnal for a partial listing). Having lived her life in poverty for the most part, she wrote her timeless hymns for the masses to enjoy. Fanny knew and conversed with the greats of her era: Presidents Lincoln, Van Buren, Polk, and Cleveland; Gen. Winfield Scott, Henry Clay, Dwight L. Moody, Ira Sankey, Eliza Edmunds Hewitt, Horace Greeley, and many others. She had a troubled marriage, where she and her legally-blind spouse were separated for many years. She was truly the servant of all, and was sought out by the high and low for counsel and prayer. Active for many years on New York City's rescue mission circuit, she was a speaker for whom crowds would line up around a city block and wait for hours to hear. An active member of the International Order of The King's Daughters and Sons, she also aided the city of Bridgeport(CT)with their missions on skid row. I would urge anyone to read this wonderful biography of a chosen soul who taught the world many lessons, chiefest among them that, no matter one's disability in life, one can truly excel. Get yourself a copy of this book and enter a more gentle, humble, and pious age where the things of God were held in major importance by persons in all stations of life.	2005-08-10

This new replacement I consider most undesirable. First of all, it is about 3 inches thick, weighs the proverbial ton, and is hard to carry. It is almost 2400 pages in length, and is only available in hardback. Even though my Church accepts the Apocrypha, I do not, and do not feel it belongs in the Bible.  This Bible is an excellent tool for the syncretistic crowd, as the notes pretty well toe that line. There is a lot of useless information, and many things that are standard fare in study Bibles are missing here. The print is good-sized, and fairly dark. I wouldn't buy it again, as I prefer my bonded leather edition of the Zondervan product, which is more devotional in tone. I would suggest to the Renovare people that they trim this Bible down in size(thickness-wise); make an edition without the Apocrypha for those who do not wish it(perhaps put it in the ESV or HCSB ); eliminate some unnecessary flotsam and jetsam which no-one will probably read, anyway. There are also some very questionable interpretations placed in the annotations. Since I have not read these in-depth reviews as yet, i shall not make an in-depth judgement.	2005-05-26

I give this one a '3' star recommendation due to the fact that it represents only one Bible therein---the NASB. The other half contains The Message by Eugene Peterson, which some people purport to be a Bible. It is not a Bible. It is a book of Bible stories by Eugene Peterson. Why people are so fascinated by this book continually amazes me. As far as the NASBU is concerned, it is a literal and readable translation of the Scriptures that is word-for-word accurate. I would recommend that you save yourself some money and just buy yourself a New American Standard Bible that has all the amenities. rather than settle for this edition.	2005-03-30

It is, unfortunately, now being quoted everywhere one goes, and in books, sermons, etc. I have read that the author himself, Peterson, is somewhat distressed that people are taking it as an actual Bible translation. I think it wise to heed the author's distress. Make a wise choice of a formal equivalent Bible translation in modern English, such as  NASB, ESV, HCSB. There you will be getting the Scriptures themselves.	2005-03-30

Other than that, the award-winning NIVSB notes are incorporated here. IMHO, I don't think the centre-column references are as numerous as in the NIV edition. I think Zondervan was more than fair to produce Bibles in NIV, KJV, and NAS with the same comparable notes. Regarding the translation itself, this is the 1995 NAS Update in the Study Bible. Many people think that this is the same as the original. Actually, the NAS has been revised umpteen(my word) times(check the dates inside the title page), the latest being 1995. It is still very much considered a Formal Equivalence translation; however, most people do not realise that, with the elimination of conjunctives and other changes, the 'Update' has moved towards Dynamic Equivalence. The 1977 edition is much more literal. Also, the Update uses 'inclusive language' in about 85 places, which is something else that most people do not know. This is a good study Bible. Use it and benefit from it.	2005-03-28

This is the third edition of the OASB,this one edited by Michael Coogan. The genuine leather edition is well made by Oxford Press, and is Smyth-sewn as compared with most American-made products, which are glue-bound 'junque.' The second edition, which is my preference, has notes by the renowned Bruce M. Metzger, and are somewhat more conservative. I must state that if your theology is fundamental, or evangelical, you will not enjoy either the translation nor the notes. This is a Bible for mainline denominations, who are the ones to whom this translation appeals. It uses inclusive language more than any other English translation, other than the TNIV. It also is more Dynamic Equivalence than the original RSV.In my opinion, the true successor of the RSV is the ESV(English Standard Version). This NOASB third edition notes are even more liberal than the second edition's. If your theology and attitude towards the Scriptures coincides with mainline Protestant denominations and their theologies, then you will like this well-made Study Bible. If you are a traditional Christian, be it Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Traditional Anglican, LCMS, WELS, or of the many evangelical and fundamental churches, forget this one!	2005-03-28

I still have it. I then bought the 10th anniversary edition in 1995, and the next edition from about 1998, and now the latest 2002 update of the notes. I also have the British edition of the 1985 edition, from Hodder and Stoughton, which in binding quality, puts any and every American edition to shame. It's a great study Bible, conservative in tone. In-text charts, diagrams, and maps. The whole 9-yards. My problem is somewhat with the New International Version itself. I have never completely trusted it. I have studied the issue for over 10 years, delving into the Greek, and read myriads of books on the subject, as well as many articles from translators and reviewers, including Bruce M. Metzger, who, surprisingly stated that, the NIV translators played 'fast and loose' with the text! And Metzger was the editor of the NRSV, hardly a conservative translation!! The translators of the NIV sought for 'more than a word-for-word-translation,' and that's what we are dealing with here. In the past 5 years, Zondervan and IBS have been pushing the idea that the NIV is a 'balanced' translation, somewhere in-between Literal And Dynamic Equivalence. There are some lousy translations, such as, 'capstone' (instead of 'cornerstone' throughout the Pauline epistles; as well as 'sinful nature' for 'flesh.') Fortunately, the notes of the NIV Study Bible are now available within Zondervan's NASB Study Bible, and their KJV Study Bible. So, you have the choice, now. Traditionally, belief in the veracity of Scripture extends to the very words. Study the translation issue from both sides. Then, make a wise choice.	2005-03-02

It is an excellent Bible for reading and study. I find it ironic that the same folks who are clamouring for the ESV and how wonderful it is, would probably have set a torch to the RSV when it first appeared in 1952. The ESV is, of course, in the tradition of the Authorised Version, and one can still hear the echoes of the old KJB. It is my hope that the ESV---or  the HCSB---will replace the NIV, and the horrendous TNIV, which has just now appeared as the completed Bible. Be aware that most Crossway leather Bibles, (excepting the Deluxe Reference Bible in Genuine Leather, which is smyth-sewn) are of extremely poor quality---glue bound, and the bindings will very easily split. The British Version(Harper Collins) appears to be of better quality.	2005-02-02

The genuine leather Bible, as Moody Press told me years ago, is bound by the folks who are the binders for the Sultan of Brunei.

With extensive quotes from the Koran, you will see that Islam never was, is not now, and will not ever be, a peaceful religion...despite what our politically-correct politicians and media try to tell us.Although I originally read this book right after it was first published, nothing certainly has changed in Islam. All this information and more under one cover.

I am thankful, also, that Cambridge produces the black-letter edition along with the red-letter edition for those who desire it. The ancient manuscripts never had 'words of Christ in red' and it is an innovation from the late nineteenth century which I find distracting. The Concord has a great font, and the Dictionary and Concordance are outstanding. This is a wonderful Bible to own and cherish. It will undoubtedly last a lifetime and is worth every penny spent.

Could it be she was considered intractable and was thrown out of this unnamed Community, and now has a \\"beef\\" with the entire Roman Church? At any rate, the book is well researched, and typically expounds the usual Fundamentalist attitudes towards the Roman Church. If one is a raging anti-Catholic, you will find all of your stereotypes met, and can say to yourself, \\"I knew it all along.\\" For Roman Catholics, it may cause you to think and do some research on your own beliefs, and that of your Church.

The author's status and education as a 'former Roman Catholic' is unspecified, and therefore, suspect. The author has killed every English translation of the Bible since 1870 with nasty invective, whether deserved or not. Naturally, he makes bogeymen out of Westcott and Hort, who were certainly NOT raging liberals, occultists, or any other such KJO-nonsense. We are righteously told to accept only, and I mean ONLY, a 400 year-old Bible revision in Elizabethan English, whose very translators recommended that one use other versions.(What about the worth of Bibles PRIOR to 1611?) Admittedly, the King James Bible is a very good literal translation, and very precise in its translation. But, let us be real, here: There are over 800 words which are archaic, some having meanings that are totally different in the 21st century than they were 400 years ago, as well as some appalling syntax which can be next-door-to-impossible to wade through. In my humble opinion, the King James Bible is like the 1928 Episcopal Book of Common Prayer: it needs to be updated. There is nothing 'wrong' with the KJV; it is certainly not a heretical translation, and for the knowledge of Greek manuscripts that the translators possessed in 1611, it is a very faithful translation. Fortunately, we live in 21st century America, and we are blessed to be able to read and use any version of God's Word that we so choose.And hopefully, people will choose wisely which particular version they use. The problem is when certain folks come along and say that ALL of the modern translations are heretical and are not the Word of God; that only the KJV is 'the' Bible; that everything else is 'Brand X.' These 'translation wars' remind me very much of traditionalist Roman Catholics who state that only the Latin Tridentine Mass is valid; the 'Novus Ordo' Mass of 1970 beingtotally invalid and heretical. The KJV has been updated in such worthy successors as the New King James Version, and Green's Modern King James Version,'now termed the 'King James 3. 'Final Authority' is vested in the Hebrew and Greek manuscripts, as well as in properly translated copies. Thumbs down on this book. It is narrow-minded and theologically untenable.	2004-07-27

The NIVSB is one of the best selling study Bibles in the world today, and these Lutheran notes only enhance it. I especially like the emphasis on the Eucharistic teachings of the Lutheran Church. Of course, there is some backlash from Lutherans on the NIV text; a lot of them are now using the ESV. Of course, the only orthodox Lutheran bodies today are the Missouri and Wisconsin Synods which do not purport to \\"ordain\\" women, and hold to the infallibility of the Scriptures(may their tribe increase!!!!), and some of the smallish Scandinavian groups.

That of course, is debatable.<BR>The Bible itself comes in navy or black bonded leather, with Nelson's unpleasant habit of installing ribbon markers that barely extend beyond the bottom of the page. I guess they feel it would cost them an arm and a leg to make the ribbon marker longer. The Bible is glue-bound, so it is not going to last you a particularly long time. The spine also tends to cave in. So, if it is quality you want in a New King James Bible, this is not it. Check out the Scofields done by Oxford.	2004-03-30

However, in my opinion, Nelson Bibles are typically of very poor quality and durability---the Bibles are glue-bound instead of being sewn, and their life expectancy is limited. Again, in my opinion, snap-flap Bibles are a nuisance, with the flap hanging in your way as you handle the Bible when open. If you must have this edition, try it without the snap-flap.	2004-01-07

They were Smyth-sewn/whipstitched, and would last for years. Unfortunately,except for their \\"Signature Series\\" Bibles, which are priced at $99 and more, Nelson (and Crossway) Bibles, in my opinion, are the most inferior on todays market. They are all glue-bound, and have a limited life-expectancy. This is a prime example of it. The New King James translation is an excellent translation. Unfortunately, it is Nelson's house translation, and they charge unreal royalties to any other publishing house who wishes to use it.<br />If you wish to have a decently made, quality NKJV, seek out the offerings from Broadman/Holman. They will last.	2004-01-07

Greatly augmenting the original Scofield, it comes loaded with in-text maps, charts, and addenda, it is an extremely valuable Study Bible. Oxford has put in a lot of general helps that former Scofields lacked. The Leather bound editions are well made by Oxford, and are Smyth-sewn, which is hard to find in these days of mass production and glue-bound (cheap) Bibles. Unfortunately, the black letter edition(words of Christ NOT in red) has been withdrawn, and the only available type is the red-letter, which, in this case, is in an annoying fire-engine red. Despite what some folks very erroneously state, the text of the New King James Version is translated from the exact same sources as the King James Bible of 1611. Not ONE verse is omitted, and in many, many places is a better translation than the old KJV. Archaic language is updated.The ONLY argument anyone can have with this Bible is that it is not the \\"old\\" King James. No other argument is valid.Keep in mind that as of now (mid 2006), all Oxford Bibles are made with thumb indexing, which most people hate, but that doesn't stop the wheels of big business.This is the best-made study Bible available in the NKJV.	2003-10-07

Unfortunately, this 'look' is a long-winded and intricate apologia for the sect's own Bible translation, whose New Testament is doctored to fit their particular heresies. The Old Testament, however, is mediocre, with appalling grammar and syntax. But, no repectable Bible translator worth his salt would endorse the New Testament, and they have stated such.

This is, of course, a book directed towards women, as they are the main buyers of books on relationships. The book starts out well enough, but before long, we find the newly dating couple in bed, sharing sexual intimacies which are described in a semi-graphic way. I believe it behooves author Long to look at current figures on sexually transmitted diseases, rates of illegitimacy, and emotional problems that seem to rear their ugly heads when dating couples are encouraged to indulge in premarital sex, better known as, 'fornication.' Unfortunately, Mr. Long fully embraces this hedonistic concept. The 'fornication lifestyle' is so prevalent today and destroyed so many lives. In the rear of the book, the author displays his talent at poetry, which is begun well enough with some very sensitive offerings; before long, the mood is shattered as we are again back into smut which quickly debases one's elevated thoughts and moods. The author writes very well, but I certainly cannot endorse a book which propounds sexual libertinism. (...)	2003-05-06

As I was basically brought up on the RSV, it hasn't been much of a switch to move into the ESV, as there is only a 7% difference between the 1971 RSV and the ESV. I think it to be more readable than the NASBU. This may very well become the \\"standard\\" English Bible for these days. However, the physical Bible is a mess. The quality of Bibles coming out of Crossway is much less than desirable. The font is WAY too small and narrow. The excellent centre-column references are tiny. The leather binding is perfect(glue)bound and inferior. I also have the British(anglicised)genuine leather edition from Harper-Collins. Their Classic Reference Bible is minus the book intros. Their cover is extremely tacky, with large gold lettering of \\"Holy Bible\\" on the cover, and below it a round, gold \\"ESV\\" seal. The Anglicized edition has a sewn binding. But, the ESV is worth having. I anxiously await the Study Bible, which will, please God, originate from another bindery.	2003-03-24

I thought it was tedious, and a general nuisance, and wound up returning every copy I ever bought, to try it, and try it again, wanting to like it. My final opinion was that it should have been allowed to go out of print years ago. Some swear by it, and consider one's library lacking if one does not possess it. I just have one question: WHY???? What is so great about the Amplified Bible? The prob here is that when it 'amplifies' a word or a phrase, one must make one's own choice on the particular word---whether or not one has a background in Greek. Then, some will go off on a wrong interpretation. It is still a very difficult read. It's an accurate translation, though, and formal equivalence. If you must have an Amplified, which seems to have a 'cult' following, then by all means get one. It is still a knock-down drag-out to read.	2003-03-20

The Revised Standard Version has made a 50th Anniversary bow, with Oxford University Press' edition. The Cowhide edition is slim and flexible, with a good font, and appears to be Smyth-sewn. This is the RSV with the 1971 revision of the New Testament. It is a text Bible, with no maps---the only drawback to the Bible. I happily used the RSV for years---except for a handful of places, an excellent formal-equivalence translation.<BR>I'm glad to see it accessible and back again. It should never have been withdrawn; it is vastly to be preferred to its inclusive-language successor, the NRSV.	2003-03-20

This one is the updated Full Life Study Bible, for Pentecostal/Charismatic Christians. It comes in hardback, as well as Bonded and Top Grain leathers in the inevitable colours of Black, Burgundy, and Navy. The print appears inferior to the font used on the Full Life. This print is lighter and somewhat smaller. The Top-Grain edition feels cheap and poorly-made, which is the curse of mass production. The study notes have been somewhat revised and updated, as well as some of the topics. Unfortunately, the poorly-exegeted pages on \\"wine,\\" remain. Other than that, the annotations are well-developed and adequately explain the text. There are helpful charts and in-text maps that are of great benefit.The Life in the Spirit Bible also comes in the King James Version, if you are in to 17th-century English. To sum it up, if you're charismatic or Pentecostal, you may derive benefit from this study Bible. If you're looking for quality---look elsewhere.	2003-03-20

The In-Touch Ministries edition of the NASBU is a gorgeous, one-of-a-kind Bible, with buttery-soft calfskin leather in your choice of navy blue, burgundy, or black. Now, this leather is not the same as the leather used on Cambridge Bibles, which is thick and grainy, with a unique smell all its own. This is like the leather on a soft shoe---smooth and pliable. The Bible is smyth-sewn, and has quality French paper.  Unfortunately, all the Bible has is text and concordance with coloured maps in the back, and wide margins. No helps whatsoever.  I would even hesitate before I marked up the Bible, that's how beautiful it is. However, if all you want is a pretty cover, buy it. Otherwise, forget it. Other NASBU reference or study Bibles in genuine or top-grain leather are available at lesser cost. So, save yourself a few bucks and get yourself something that has more information.	2003-03-12

In the first offering by Thomas Long,the author gives a good look and feel for urban life and culture, positive and negative, but spoils it with his sexual references, which do little to improve the work, but brings it down to simply becoming base. The author shows great promise and talent, but to reach a wider, or general audience, if that is his desire, his praises of, and memorials of such controversial figures and race-based cults  such as the Nation of Islam, Five Percenters,  Elijah Muhammad, Khalid, and \\"Allah\\", will leave the author in the backwater of writers. Again, I would advise him to avoid the sexual references, but turn his eyes on to the many things of beauty and inspiration in the culture that greatly outweigh the negative.	2002-10-01

The author here goes into little known facts about the King James Version of the Bible that need to be brought out, proving that it just did not drop from Heaven in 1611, and all Christians before that date were in darkness and ignorance, and everything since is worthless and a travesty. People need to realize that their tunnel-visioned &quot;worship&quot; of the KJV and rejection of honest, good, formal equivalence translations is splitting churches wide apart and making those not informed confused and causing them to doubt the Word of God written. Even the KJV translators called the poorest and weakest translations the Word of God. This small book will help people understand, and hopefully, open some minds that are terribly narrow or closed. If it succeeds in doing that, it has achieved its purpose.	2002-09-13

Books	4	4	7	N	N	Scholarly, and Informed	James White's KJ Only Controversy has been on the market for approximately seven years. Since it appeared, some major translations have appeared on the market, so the book is somewhat outdated. Mr. White is a proponent of the Modern Critical Text. He does discuss the history of the King James Only position, whose proponents can become alarmingly uncharitable, to say the least. However, he makes all proponents of the King James Version/Textus Receptus appear as uninformed dolts. I would recommend the book as it gives a readable look at a very important subject. Remember that such persons as Gail A. Riplinger and Peter Ruckman are the 'lunatic fringe' of the KJVO movement. There are more less shrill voices who exert a more moderating influence. I prefer the ESV, myself. But, all Christians of the evangelical/fundamental persuasion should read this book.	2002-07-19

However, it is based on the Textus Receptus, as are the King James, New King James, Modern King James, King James 2000, and King James 21.Most scholars of today do not feel that these texts are the most ancient or the most accurate. This is also the effort of one man, and not a committee, so his theological leanings appear somewhat in the text. The print is large, and dark. The drawback is that the Bible is extremely thick and unwieldy, and not easy to handle, and is of considerable weight. Unfortunately, it has no concordance, centre-column references, or any other helps. If it did, the Bible would be larger than it already is. I would suggest to the translator that he make a more portable edition available, and perhaps add one of the aforementioned features, which would complement the Bible no little way. All in all, it is highly recommended, and used with great diligence. One will know the Word of God in readable English!	2002-07-19

It is based on the Authorised(King James) Version, a formal equivalence translation. Originally published as the Annotated Study Bible, it has large, bold, easy-to-read print, a definite asset. Fortunately, the myriads of archaic words are defined in the centre-column. The annotations are traditional and conservative, and explain the text very well. There are also doctrinal definitions(from a Baptist perspective)and character studies as well, plus in-text maps. The bad points are a poor-quality binding, which includes the bonded and genuine leather editions. It is a glue-bound product, and does not hold up well. ( NOTE: 10-30-07: Had the opportunity to view a few genuine leather copies of this Bible very recently. The Bible was printed and bound in Colombia; therefore, it has a sewn binding, a long ribbon-marker, and good feeling leather. I was actually impressed! Check the inside page of the Bible and see where it is printed before you buy).The in-text maps are dark and a little hard to read/understand. All-in-all, I recommend this Study Bible to those who are wedded to the King James Version and who have a fundamental Baptist perspective.	2002-07-19

It is a balanced translation, in between a formal equivalence(word-for-word)and dynamic equivalence(basically thought-for-thought). Words have been added to, or deleted from, the Greek text of the New Testament. Ergo, one is reading the words of men mixed in with the Words of God. The annotations in this Bible are from a traditional Pentecostal perspective; with 4 total pages taken up with the subject of wine, expressing a temperance viewpoint rather than the actual 1st century meaning of wine. This is a good Study Bible, with nice, dark print. However, keep in mind that the editor was a member of the Assemblies of God, and the annotations reflect their belief system.	2002-07-17

He takes a position that will draw the ire of the KJV-only crowd, as he prefers the Majority Text and the various updates of the King James Version, while not discarding the KJV. He will displease the Modern Critical Text folks, as he stands squarely for the Majority Text,and the Textus Receptus. He also discusses lesser known translations, such as The Modern King James Version, the Literal Version of the Bible, and the World English Bible. The chapters are well laid out and readily understood. He explains thoroughly the KJV-only position and refutes it in a non-abrasive manner. Of the many works that have been published over the last five years that support the Textus Receptus  or the Majority text, this is one of the most logical and accurate.	2002-05-21

This is a fault in binding. The print is attractive and easy-to-read. The Bible contains much useful information and well-thought-out annotations. However, those with a traditional/conservative theological outlook will not be happy with many of the annotations, or even with the translation itself, as it employs gender-inclusive language more than any other English version. It also leans more towards the Dynamic Equivalence theory of translation than the original RSV. This edition, as are a majority of NRSV Study Bibles, geared towards those of the mainline denominations who are fairly liberal in their theology. Those who are conservative/fundamental should look elsewhere for a Study Bible.	2002-03-22
