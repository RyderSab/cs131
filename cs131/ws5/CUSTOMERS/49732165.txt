I find the reviewers who thought the games didn't illustrate his points, that it is difficult to read, and the book as a whole is not instuctive--incomprehensible.<br />The text is a joy to read (by chess book standards), the games illustrate key points in memorable, often startling ways, and his explanation of conducting a game in stages marching foward rank by rank and invadind with pieces through pawn structure quite unique, logical, and simple.<br />This book, along with a book on tactics and endings, would get a player far indeed if s/he puts in the hard work chess demands.	2004-05-16

I think this is the best chess problems book ever devised becaus:  1). Format.  It uses stars, *, **, ***, ****, to tell you how difficult the problem is--maybe a mate in two, or winning a piece after four moves, you don't know the theme or the number of moves, so it's very realistic.  2).  Material.  These are important, fantastic, yet realistic, positions that, through repetition, will become a pattern in your mind that will help you win OTB.  3.  Flexibility.  The four-star problems, the most difficult, are not forcing, but are ultra-rich in ideas.  When first facing them, I reccomend a Dvoretsky exercise:  look at the four-star problem for about ten seconds, then go on instinct and look up the answer.  <br />So far, I've gone through the book one and a half times.  I was amazed at how much faster I could get through the problems the second time.  My game has sky-rocketed to a level I've never been at in 5 years of study due to this book.  My internet rating went from 1700 to 1900 in two months (long games 30/10).<br />Put away the opening manuals.  Go through this book as much and as fast as possible, memorize about 15 Grand Master games, a few key end games, and I think you will go pretty far.	2003-09-15

The format took a little getting used to (complete games aren't presented, just ever-deepening lines), but after going through the lines, you get used to it.<br />The systems presented are pretty solid but still active.  They are easy to learn and present attacking opportunities without huge risks.  They are not ultra-aggressive lines, but they are not boring--they involve many different pawn structures from a KIA vs the French which blends nicely with the closed sicilian, to 2. c4 caro-kann and the bishop's opening.	2003-08-27

Here in &quot;Rapid Chess Improvement&quot; is a powerful systematic program of study that will certainly improve your chess.  He suggests basically going through 1000 tactical chess problems seven times, each time getting through the lot faster and faster until finally doing 1-1000 of the same problems in one day.  It's hard work, but I'm sure it's worthwhile (I just started the program).<br />Some of the beginning exercises are a bit elementary, but might be an OK warm up.<br />It's also nice to have a book geared toward class players.<br />The major problem of this book is that its outlook on chess is superficial, gearing one toward looking for cheapshots instead of having any deep understanding of the game.  What is telling is that the author no longer plays chess.  Yes, study tactics, use or alter de la Maza's methods, but balance this with the study of endgames and master games.  I highly reccomend the book &quot;GM-Ram&quot; by IM Rashid Ziatdinov as well as Alekhine's book of best games.<br />Another thing I disliked about this book was all the corny testimonials.  Half of the book is composed of them.	2003-07-03

You are expected to memorize the games!<br />Now, these positions have no explanations (except for a few rook endings used as an example of how well you need to know each position.)  The book, then, is essentially useless unless you have the End Game books Ziatdinov used to gather the positions (they are listed in the book's bibliography).<br />What is one to make of this?  The answers are not given.  There is so much work to do!  You have to memorize games?  Nearly 300 positions?  Well, this is one of the most honest chess books ever.  The author makes no appologies:  this is the work you must do to master chess.<br />Between 1997 and 1999 Ziatdinov won 200 tournaments (about two a week) and was the winner of the USA Grand Prix.  He currently has 5-7 Grand Master Norms, so do not let his title of \\"IM\\" fool you!<br />I should mention after working very hard, I fell flat on my face in chess and was about to quit.  I decided to try to contact Mr. Ziatdinov--he is one of the most generous teachers I have ever encountered, and I believe his method of teaching (and playing...every game, every move he uses the positions in \\"GM: RAM\\") is the best.  His way is challenging, but as he often says, \\"There is no King's Road in chess,\\" no easy fix.<br />So far, I have found using \\"GM: RAM\\" in conjunction with \\"Fundamental Chess Endings\\" to be _very_ beneficial.  My favorite part of \\"GM RAM\\" is the fantastic collection of classic games.<br />\\"GM RAM\\" is _not_ an instructional book.  To me, it is almost a puzzle unto itself, yes, a challenge.  Track down the positions, or even similiar positions that illustrate the same key _ideas_, analyze them with a teacher or a powerful chess program (like Fritz).  These positions are the basic building blocks GMs use in all their games--learn them _cold_.<br />Good luck!	2003-06-03

This book of games is good, and is an excellent companion to Watson's &quot;Modern Chess Strategy&quot;, but I think it could have been more interesting.  How?

Whatever--this is a fantastic book.  I hate descriptive notation like any lazy s.o.b.; here's my suggestion:  with a pencil write the algebraic notation just above the old form notation.  This also forces you to concentrate on the game more.  Every chess player should be very familiar with Alekhine, and this is a great book to do just that.	2003-05-26

I never played the Pirc, but thought it looked interesting and decided to take it up.  \\"Pirc Alert!\\" got me to understand the ideas first, allowing me to quickly memorize the sharp lines with a grasp of the tactics.  The book is easy to read and look at, with plenty of key diagrams, the most important illustration of positions colored in blue, which helps to remember it.  The book _is_ expensive, but if you plan on playing the Pirc for the rest of your life, this is the book to get.  Even if lines change, the Pirc is flexible enough, with enough ideas, that you will easily be able to alter your repetoir (there's even sections on the sister-system, The Modern Defense).

It doesn't matter one bit if this author is inventing or re-discovering using facial optical distortions in a mirror; if it works for you go for it.  It is.....bizarre.  Just to experiment, simply turn out your lights, light a candle to illuminate your face from below and squint into a mirror.
