The devastation of American families, proliferation of homosexuality as a result of mass incarceration, destruction of millions of lives - all these crimes of the American system of &quot;justice&quot; are well-documented and scholarly presented in this book. Invisible Punishment is highly recommended to those who want to understand the essence and the consequence of the world's largest, American Gulag. A great supplement to this fact-oriented book would be [...] - the web site that multiplies the impact of those facts with a powerful emotional impact (unrelated to the authors and publishers of the Invisible Punishment).	2004-01-25

Carrying the grotesque name of &quot;system of corrections&quot;, this is the system that corrected nobody and ruined lives of great many millions. It's a must reading for any consciencious American, who is willing to question the government propaganda that we live in a land of equal justice and liberty for all. A great, sad but meaningful story of the 12-year old boy, whose life was taken away by the culture of anger, stupidity amd hate, by the world's largest, infamous American Gulag.	2003-12-13

The author never mentions what are the chances, or what they've ever been, for an average American to die from an act of terror, in comparison to the chances of dying from other unnatural causes, such as domestic crime, automobile accidents, etc. Just today I've read that the authoritative JAMA claims about 250,000 Americans die every year as a result of medical malpractice. This means, about 600,000 died since 9-11-01, and how many books do we have on how to protect ourselves from bad doctors, poor hospital care, wrong medications, etc.?<br />I wonder, the American people gave up their Bill of Rights without any hesitation in an eyeblink, in exchange for some very vague, poorly defined promises of protection against the one hundred something cause of death. What would they give up for a promise to protect them, say from the number 25, or number 10 cause of death? <br />Keep studying garbage like this, great America! Stock up with gas masks, utility tapes, food, buy extra homes, the Enemy is sneeking up to your doorstep, while your Big Brother is watching you and getting even better deal than an eye for an eye overseas. This surely is making the world a safer place, America more loveable and may even extend your earthly existence by a few more cosmic miliseconds. Although that's highly unlikely, if you can think...	2003-11-06

Bertram Gross, while writing this book some 20 years ago, predicted a lot, but far from all. The fascism is here allright, but the \\"friendly\\" part is missing, and missing badly! Today's America is the land of the unfree, enslaved people, the land of presently the largest in the world and still growing at an enormous rate Gulag for the poor and disadvantaged. We now hold more of our people in cages than any other country in the world, both in real numbers and per capita. We punish our people and punish them harshly, frequently for totally victimless crimes, or for the crime of wanting to feel better in a hostile world called America. We hold in cages more mentally ill people than any other dictatorship in the world and many of them have been denied their freedom because of their actions triggered by their illnesses. We grant due process of law selectively only to those, who are rich enough to afford to buy it, while processing others through the legal grinder of the human souls, with the grotesque and bizzarre figure called \\"public defender\\" assuring near 100%, or frequently exactly 100% rate of conviction. And yes, torture of prisoners in America is quite well-documented fact. So, where's that \\"friendly\\" fascism?<br />Our government kills its people for the crime of murdering another, most of the time, only one human being, but then it sends our army into other countries, kills many thousands of totally innocent people, including entire families and small children, injures, disfigures thousands more, and never admits any wrongdoing and is never punished in any way.<br />Our Constitution has been raped and destroyed. We now have the largest police force in the world, also both in real numbers and per capita of population. Federal Government is involved in activities forbidden by the Consitution and it doesn't even feel the need to explain, justify the fact. Police breakins into people's homes, searches without warrants take pleace in massive numbers everyday (just watch any TV show Cops - they don't even hide it, they want you to get used to it). They no longer must justify any traffic stop - now they can stop you only because they ar the police, and you are not!<br />Still, Bertram Gross saw more than what 99.99% of Americans did. This book is well-documented, scholarly written and definitely interesting to read. But do yourself, your country and the humanity a favor. Read also, listen to Gore Vidal, Noam Chomsky, go to any search engine on the Internet and enter \\"American Gulag\\", \\"fascism in America\\", \\"prison nation USA\\", visit at least a few of those sites, study, read, learn, understand. Check [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] Until you can, until everything is not yet shut down and destroyed. And never, ever say you didn't know...<br />\\"...Huey Long once said, 'Fascism will come to America in the name of anti-fascism'. I'm afraid, based on my own long experience, that fascism will come to America in the name of national security.\\" <br />Nafeez Moseaddeq Ahmed, Preface<BR>and quote from Jim Garrison, New Orleans<BR>District Attorney, 1967, from the Conclusion<BR>THE WAR ON FREEDOM	2003-06-22

The materials are useful, provided you have both time and motivation to embark on a long course of self-development, with a lot of exercises, a lot of daily work. <br />The problem with this recording is, however, that it is read not by a professional reader, but by Dr. Wenger himself. He probably is a smart man, but not smart enough to understand that his voice is quite senile, lacks energy, his diction is blurred, with no persuasiveness, no impact on listener, very boring and totally non-convincing. I have no problems when youthful Tony Robbins reads his own materials recorded on tapes and CDs with his unmatched Passion, but I do have a problem with something as life-less and monotone, as the recording of this otherwise excellent course.

And it's an equal opportunity disease, striking good people from all walks of life: blue collar workers as well as admirals and generals, senators and congressmen, farmers and sailors, high school dropouts and college professors, beggars and millionaires, idiots, geniuses and our neighbor, everyday common man and woman... (...)<br />People are different, authors claim and prove in great detail. Some 10 to 15% of us have a gene, which creates different enzymes within our system, which in turn make highly addictive chemicals while processing the ingested alcohol within our bodies. Human brain is uncapable to resist the craving for alcohol, caused by those chamicals, which are never produced by the bodies of non-alcoholics. Therefore, alcoholics are not more guilty of having alcoholism, as cancer patients are guilty of having cancer, or diabetics being ill with diabetis.<br />The only solution to the disease of alcoholism is professional, medical treatment, followed by warm and sensitive care of the family, support groups, and society. Punishment, consisting of creation of severe stress, humiliation and application of strong mental and spiritual pain won't work, only making condition worse. Much worse! Primitive and superficial psychological counseling won't work, either. Only complex, modern, professional treatment will.<br />Great reading for anyone affected by or interested in the disease of alcoholism. A must for judges and prosecutors, busy sending ill people into the sewer pipe of industry of \\"corrections\\"! And those few members of MADD, who REALLY want to decrease incidents of drunk driving by fighting its causes, not symptoms, by helping alcoholics to get well, notjust looking for an outlet of their hate and anger, which are the most destructive and counterproductive of all human emotions.	2001-12-09

Today's Americans are as dumb as never before. They don't care for their liberties anymore. There are no more public demonstrations, no more organized resistanse to massive abuse of power going on everyday in America. Compulsory public education has produced its intended results, which are: dumb mass of population, possessing some basic business and industrial skills, but no critical, analytical thinking whatsoever.<br />Work, booze, TV, game, maybe sex, then work, booze, TV...that's all there is to our Freedom, which we want so passionately our government to defend for us!<br />Yes, Claire Wolfe is not always fully logical and consistent. Say, she urges everyone to learn to live in poverty, despise wealth, work as little as possible just to be able to satisfy basic needs. And also she suggests to stack up on non-perishable, even military food supplies, refresh those supplies as needed, gather and hide in different places various high quality weapons, support generously some human rights organizations, - all of which require signifficant cash resources.<br />But the reading nevertheless is important, fascinating and a great refreshment for our media-hypnotized, crazed and dumbed minds.

It is remarkable that most books about alocoholism, written by professionals with doctoral degrees in clinical psychology, or medicine, enequivocally explain and support the scientific approach to achoholism as a disease, and as subject of psychiatry. And the medieval idea that alcoholism is a flaw of character, controllable by the power of will is, as always has been, proclaimed by the vocal laymen like Mr. Fingarette.<br />All major and most authoritative medical resources, such as American Medical Association and American Society of Addiction Medicine define alcoholism as a disease which is independent of and uncontrollable by human will and effort.<br />To the contrary, many laywriters and self-proclaimed experts of the human psyche attempt to trash the minds of their readers with false, couterscientific and socially dangerous ideas, which have already put staggering numbers (exceeding one hundred thousand by some sources) of mental patients behind prison bars, making the USA a focus of critique and condemnation of many human right organizations, such as our very own, US (NYC)-based Amnesty International &lt;[...]<br />BTW, I have read Mr. Fingarette's book thoroughly and could find not even a single truly scientific evidence supporting his populist, but badly amatorish philosophy.   <br />Better get this outstanding, easy-to-read, yet written by professionals book on alcoholism: Beyond the Influence : Understanding and Defeating Alcoholism by Katherine Ketcham, et al., available on amazon.com	2001-10-27
