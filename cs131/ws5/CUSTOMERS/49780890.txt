This is truly a classic book on the subject of exorcism<br />from the Catholic perspective, but the truth is: Satan, the<br />Prince of Darkness, is much more subtle than generally<br />portrayed here.

Feminists and other people with a personal agenda will<br />(of course) disagree, but this book is vital for pastors<br />and Christians everywhere to understand the manipulative<br />and satan-strongholds that can operate (often, at first,<br />subtly) within local churches. The Jezebel/Ahab principality<br />is a demon-stronghold that can divide and destroy not only<br />ministries, but entire local churches! - It is VITAL to know<br />and understand how it operates.<br /> Pastor Francis Frangipane has identified and dealt with<br />this \\"Jezebel spirit\\" in seminars, tapes, and a booklet and<br />book. John Paul Jackson has an excellent teaching ministry<br />and here (in this book) he exposes the manner in which this<br />demonic-activity can lock-into certain personality types<br />(NOT ALL OF WHOM are necessarily female).<br /> I have worked many years as a pastor and a missionary on a<br />foreign field.

The Jezebel/Ahab principality is (from my experience and discernment in ministry) a very, very powerful means of undermining values and authority that is required within the Kingdom of God.

I would maintain that much of the Church has been blushingly blind to the very problem that the author addresses in this fine and thoughtful book.<br />  The gentle side of Jesus is wonderful, but not to be emphasized over and  above his manliness and masculine, JEWISH humanity.  Along with His  compassion and love, Jesus could be bold as the Lion of Judah.  He was the  furthest thing you can imagine from a wimp (but not at all in the sense of  being &quot;macho&quot;).  He was courageous and (can<br />you imagine it?):  AUTHORITATIVE.<br />  Let's put the MAN back in the Son of Man.  And let's see  men within the Church, not &quot;motherly&quot; or &quot;finely  feminine,&quot; but men who take the responsibiity of loving and kind  leadership and headship seriously.  Men can confront and correct sin,  deception, compromise, and hyprocrisy: Because that's the kind of Man Jesus  was (and IS).<br />  I HIGHLY recommend this book to every layman and church  leader.	2000-05-16

This surely is Dr.Tozer's classic work on the deeper, spiritual life of the Christian.  Anyone who wants to &quot;go on with God to perfection&quot; and longs to know God FOR WHO HE IS, (not just what one  can &quot;receive&quot; from God), should read this book at least once or  twice or thrice.  There are few today (or yesterday) who can equal the  power of the pen of Dr.Tozer when he focuses on his favorite life's  passion: To KNOW the depths and the heights of the Infinite and Holy and  Eternal GOD of Love and Moral Purity.<br />My highest recommendation.

Without a doubt, &quot;The Great Controversy of the Ages&quot; is over the Person and Mission of Y'shua,  Jesus Christ.  And the great challenge to Christianity and Christians is the historic rift between Pharasaic,  rabbinical Judaism's rejection of the messiahship of Jesus, and the  veracity of the claims of The Gospel and the New Testament record (in the  light of The Torah and the Prophets teachings on Messiah).<br />  Dr.Brown is  a leading Messianic/Christian/Jewish apologist and scholar.  Don't miss  this important contribution to this most important of all topics. Don't  just listen to other people's views and various biases.  READ THE EVIDENCE  FOR YOURSELF, *THEN* make up your mind.	2000-05-06

Books	4	21	38	N	N	SKEPTICS MAY TURN UP THEIR NOSE, BUT THIS BOOK IS EXCELLENT	As a pastor and a Christian, I have debated skeptics for years and have always found that they rarely take a fair few of ANYTHING relating to Jesus Christ, faith, or Christianity; the vast majority of them have a  &quot;hidden agenda&quot; that wants above all else to dodge the MORAL  ACCOUNTABILITY issue in the truths of Christianity.  By all means get this  fine and well thought-thru compendium of apologetic thought.  Mr.McDowell  makes many valid points and arguments for the veracity of the gospels and  the awesome claims of Jesus Christ, easily the most important and  controversial person who walked this sad and sin-sick planet.  I highly  recommend it for your library and family use.  Students also find it  tremendously helpful.	2000-05-06
