For me, however, it at times seemed rather flat, like a carbonated drink that has been sitting opened for a few hours.  I think the pace of the book was too slow, given that the plot is a rather simple one. But let's start with some plus's.<br /><br />I loved the extensive coverage of alien ruins and alien artifacts. These scenes -- and there are many -- were great fun.  Whenever the adventurers entered a jungle clearing and found an alien temple or structure, surprises were many and the reader suddenly sat up on the edge of his (or her) chair.<br /><br />One of the very most fun alien discoveries was the skyhook anchor, found circling the planet in a far orbit.  And the flora and fauna of the planet \\"Deepsix\\" were great fun also.  Encountering dangerous alien life forms while chopping through the rain forest -- this is great entertainment.  Especially since McDevitt does a great job bringing it all to life.<br /><br />But back to a few problems.  The author creates a character named MacAllister, and seems to want us to dislike him.  I mean, this guy is portrayed as a real jerk.  Self-important, pompous, and continually abrasive with anyone who crosses his path.  MacAllister is a journalist and writer who has attained a great reputation.  He has come to feel he is beyond criticism, and has an unpleasant sense of his own superiority.<br /><br />Well, you ask, 'what's the problem?'  Lots of books have unattractive characters.  Here's the problem.  MacAllister dominates the book.  Every -- yes, EVERY -- chapter begins with a lengthy quotation from MacAllister. These don't come to anything, and I began skipping them.  Also, the author seems to push MacAllister forward to dominate so many scenes in the book.  I asked myself, 'why do I need to continually cope with this unpleasant person?'  MacAllister is not even interesting as a character.  He is one dimensional -- a \\"one-note Johnny.\\"  He has no range, just being a crusty curmudgeon chapter after chapter.<br /><br />As I said when I began this review, Deepsix needs major editing with respect to the element of 'pace.'  It just moves too SLOW.  too many chapters go by while the author is still introducing the setting and introducing a long string of characters, some of whom prove rather insignificant in the overall story.<br /><br />Sub-plots that have little linkage to the main plot keep pulling us away from the main story, just when we are beginning to get highly involved. This 430-page book could easily shed 150 pages and be a better novel for it.<br /><br />There are some well-drawn and interesting characters that help to power the book.  These include the woman \\"Hutch\\" and the burned out aging explorer Nightingale.<br /><br />One writer compared this novel to the best of Arthur C. Clarke.  Well, there are some resemblances, especially the fascinating alien artifacts that excite the reader about extraterrestrial civilizations.  And there is some hard science extrapolated, such as the skyhook technology that shows up in Deepsix.<br /><br />But all in all, we are not talking the same level of quality.  Comparing McDevitt to Arthur C. Clarke is like comparing vin ordinaire with the finest burgundies of France.ng a crusty curmudgeon chapter after chapter. <br /> <br />As I said when I began this review, Deepsix needs major editing with respect to the element of 'pace.'

It was genuinely interesting. It may seem silly to claim that a book derivative of another writer (J. Frank Baum) is refreshingly original. And yet, this book fits that description.<br /><br />But without giving away the story, I must say that the ending was grim and miserable to the extreme. \\"Wretched\\" would not be too strong a word.<br /><br />I had read all but the last 50 pages of the book, but by then I had gotten a pretty good sense of where it was headed. I anticipated a really wretched, miserable ending. I hate books with a despairing and inconclusive sort of ending.  Consequently, I put the book aside for a month before bringing myself to finally read those final pages.  The final pages were every bit as grim as I feared, almost to be point of being nihilistic.  Everything bright or pleasant or sympathetic in the book was systematically destroyed by the author at the book's close, along with the witch.<br /><br />One reason this had an impact on me is that McGuire was so successful in creating his lead character, the witch herself.  I really began to care about what happened to her.  She was essentially a sympathetic character to me, even rather loveable in her quirks, insecurities, and vulnerabilities. For me, at least, she deserved better than she got.<br /><br />The imaginary land of Oz as recreated by McGuire was very interesting -- sort of the dark underbelly of the Oz of J. Frank Baum's wonderful childrens' books.<br /><br />The play of magic in the book was intriguing.  Just about the time we started to believe the magic was a sham, and little better than a carnival trick, some fearsome magic began to actually work!<br /><br />The supporting characters were well drawn, and the interaction between them drove most of the book.  Near the end -- including those final pages I was reluctant to read -- almost all the supporting characters were gone, and the witch began lengthy solipsistic debates within herself.  This really de-fanged the suspense and interest the book had built up to that point.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me, the totally dark, despairing ending -- and the seeming destruction of even the few gleams of light the book offered -- was a train wreck.<br /><br />If this is the meaning of life, we are all in big trouble, folks.<br /><br />I feel that I just don't need to read such depressing and despairing books.  I can put my fingers on a hot stove burner if my goal is to feel depressed and miserable.erself.

Bill Napier's \\"Splintered Icon\\" is everything the cover blurbs promise -- an exciting read that is difficult to put down.<br /><br />The characters are just deep enough to sustain the drive of the plot.  Like many thrillers, the characters travel to an exotic location -- modern-day Jamaica.  Descriptions are good, and the lush and slightly dangerous byways of Jamaica take on enough menace to accentuate the perils of the characters.  Ruthless competitors willing to kill to attain the treasure.  Kidnappings, gunplay, attempts to steal key journals that link to the location of the title's priceless icon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a few shortcomings to the book.  Or, \\"it seemed to me\\" there were.  Others may disagree.<br /><br />I was never really convinced that this icon was of world-shaking import.  I refuse to ruin the story for those who have not read the book.  But the Sixteenth Century episodes in the story try to convince us that this icon was the key to either England or Spain seizing control of the New World.  I'm sorry. If I told you what the nature of the icon was, you would find this premise ridiculous.<br /><br />Let me give you an analogy without giving away the story for you.<br /><br />It is as though you have been paid a small fortune to seek out a small, rare postage stamp.  You are told that if you do not find this stamp, and the sinister rival team finds that stamp first, the United States will crumble.  Now-- no one is going to deny that this searched item is highly valuable -- worth millions.  But the consequences as outlined by author Napier are \\"over the top.\\"  They just don't sell.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the book are exellent.  Had me on the edge of my seat.  But the closing 75 pages become very thin.  Almost as though a \\"bolt of inspiration\\" strikes the leading character, he suddenly leaps up and says, \\"I KNOW where the icon must be!!!!\\"  He then unerringly races to the location, to encounter a battle with the sinister rival team, and  . . .  just the standard canned ending.  My point?  The ending is too pat, too neat, too quick, too trite.<br /><br />This is a fine book for a read on the airplane, or to read in the bathtub where it risks the \\"deep six.\\"  It is fun, at least in part.  It is not a serious rival to Brown's Da Vinci Code\\"e sinister rival team, and  . . .  just the standard canned ending.  My point?  The ending is too pat, too neat, too quick, too trite. <br /> <br />This is a fine book for a read on the airplane, or to read in the bathtub where it risks the \\"deep six.\\"  It is fun, at least in part.

THE SECRET OF LIFE is a big, sprawling, highly episodic book that seems to lack an ending.<br /><br />On the paragraph level, McAuley writes quite well.  For instance, he describes one of his southwestern characters:  \\"She is wearing white, tasseled cowboy boots that add ten centimeters to her not-very-considerable height, white silk shorts and a matching bolero jacket over an orange T-shirt, and shades herself from the noon sun with a fringed parasol.  Her skin is so pale the maps of her blue veins show through, her teased and waved blond hair looks as fragile as spun glass.\\"  The author weaves a lot of this vivid description through his narrative.  When he directs his keen vision to landscapes, he makes Mars come alive for the reader. At this level, McAuley writes very well.<br /><br />But there are some structural oddities in the book that put me off.  After moving into the second section of the book, which puts the central character, Mariella, about to blast off for an exploration of Mars, McAuley -- at this unpromising point -- decides to wander off into the protagonist's distant past and tread water laying out background -- for about 35 pages.  He woolgathers about his character's youth, about her academic wanderings from university to university, about her half-successful marriage.  What an awful time, when the reader is keyed up for the launch to Mars, to just put all the action on hold.  Worse, a large part of this meandering seems to be only borderline relevant to the story. What a way to kill reader interest!  I must be honest.  I began to skim, because I reached a point I couldn't bear any more.<br /><br />The episodes set on Mars were excellent, in part through the writer's descriptive skills and in part due to his extensive science background.  If one could somehow excise this and make it a short, stand-alone novel, I would rate it a \\"5 stars.\\"  Unfortunately, McAuley seems determined to press on.<br /><br />The last third of the book -- set back on Earth -- blurs past in a kaleidoscope of changing scenes and settings.  Too much, too fast.  Every few pages we move to a different locale to the point that we almost lose track of where we are.  Characters spin by too fast to assume any reality.<br /><br />The book has no ending.  It just stops.  The dangerous alien life choking the seas has not been not vanquished . . . indeed, it has not even been attacked.  In lieu of an ending, the final pages wonder out loud how -- possibly -- this peril may be defeated.  And yet, I thought the survival of earth and the recovery of the seas was the whole centerpiece of the plot!<br /><br />In terms of politics and social philosophy, the author sets up some straw men, then proceeds to knock them down one by one.  The \\"greens\\" who love the earth -- all totally admirable -- are pitted against corporate robber barons.  No one is ever ambivalent or complex -- they wear either the white hat or the black hat.  \\"High Noon\\" with Gary Cooper had more psychological complexity than this.<br /><br />Still, I must say, the book held my interest very well in part. I made it to the end expecting a conclusion.  It was only in the closing pages that I began to realize the author had no intention of writing one.back on Earth -- blurs past in a kaleidoscope of changing scenes and settings.

US	53031379	R1W8G7C31Z903B	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	4	7	9	N	N	A style out of the past . . . .	I enjoyed this big novel, and read it in a surprisingly short time.<br /><br />What is remarkable about the book is that it takes the form of an epistolary novel of the sort popular in the Eighteenth Century.  Richardson's \\"Clarissa\\" comes to mind.<br /><br />\\"The Historian\\" is structured around quite a few collections of old papers.  These include several bundles of letters or postcards -- or even journal entries of persons long since dead.  The protagonists chance upon these documents in their nonstop search for Dracula's tomb.  When each document or group of documents are discovered, they are read.<br /><br />Professor Rossi -- one of the book's central characters -- leaves a bundle of letters at one point, and a longhand \\"letter to the world\\" at the book's end.  His sweetheart Helen leaves a thick pack of postcards -- oddly enough, never mailed.  The characters keep scattering documents the way Hansel and Gretel scattered breadcrumbs.<br /><br />This is the main structural device of the novel  Old letters or documents are discovered in one ancient library or monastary after another as the characters bounce around Eastern Europe.  The documents are presented to the reader, often as separate chapters, and are discussed by the book's central characters.  Then a few pages later, one or more additional letters are found.  They, in turn, are presented for the reader and discussed.  Slowly, we wind our way toward the center of the mystery.<br /><br />While this may not sound all that exciting, the epistolatory structure is skillfully used by the author.  Tension and suspense come through all this, since each letter -- or old journal, or yellowing old map -- leads us a bit closer to Dracula's tomb.<br /><br />One effect of all this garnering and presenting of old documents is to create multiple levels of time.  Some of this takes place in the Fifteenth Century, some in the 1930s, and some in the 1960s.<br /><br />There is also the sense of \\"a picture within a picture.\\"  Old bundles of letters may go on for chapters as they follow each other, one by one.  While we are reading these old letters, references are made to still older documents.  These in turn refer to scenes from the history of 500 years ago.  We get this folding of time effect -- almost as though we see mirrors reflecting other mirrors -- reflections glancing off of other reflections.  This can be a bit of a challenge for the reader, but creates a great sense of DEPTH.  History seems to unfold into the present in a series of reflections that mirror each other.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book.  I did enjoy it.  I do think that it is too long on sleuthing and rather short on action. It might have been edited more tightly -- and better at 450 pages than at its present length of roughly 650 pages.<br /><br />The author writes well, and creates an excellent sense of place.  Scenes in the book come so alive, partly through good writing and skillful use of selected details.<br /><br />I read a RAVE review before I purchased the book.  The reviewer went over the top, and just babbled his praises.  Unfortunately, I expected a book with much more action.  So, alas, I was a bit let down.  (Maybe we should be very suspicious of out-and-out RAVE reviews.  Or maybe I'm too trusting?)<br /><br />I do feel the book is very interesting.  Technically, it is structured in a way that hasn't been extensively used for over 200 years.  The Da Vinci Code is another novel that centers on historic research and an exploration of the distant past.  \\"The Historian\\" is probably on a par with Brown's novel.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see what this author's next book will look like.ithin a picture.\\"  Old bundles of letters may go on for chapters as they follow each other, one by one.

Now I just finished CRUSADE.<br /><br />I did think the CRUSADE book was on a par with ON DEATH GROUND.  Perhaps the scale of sheer horror was less.  But the description of naval battles was on a par.<br /><br />As I finished the halfway point of CRUSADE, I had this feeling of \\"battles and battles and battles.\\"  It was getting flat, and I had a feeling the authors were just repeating a formula.<br /><br />The sub-plots really saved the book.  There were some embedded narratives involving key characters.  The last 75 pages were the story of a Marines division tasked to assault the command center of the Thebes homeworld.<br /><br />In the epilogue, it was heartening that the \\"farewell\\" to six or eight of the key characters really meant something.  I was not confused -- each character stood out as an individual.  I cared what eventually happened to them.  This testifies to the quality of characterization in the book.  It's essentially an action novel, but the characters really brought it to live.<br /><br />David Weber is only rivalled by David Drake in writing \\"future war\\" novels.  And of course, Keith Laumer and the \\"Bolo\\" series.<br /><br />They are the best.  They are not always at their top form, but this book speaks well for David Weber and Steve White both.

That said, I did feel the book was well plotted and well put together.  It also had a number of very original creative flashes that keeps a reader going.<br /><br />Two separate plot lines converge in the book.  One involves a conference being held on the Andromeda Ascendant to determine the freedom or slavery of a planetary system.  This involves some fun characters as diplomats, including a very bad Nietzschean admiral who -- as one might expect -- intends to enslave the captive planets and grind their populations into the mire.  This meanie admiral engages in a delightful chess game of diplomacy with Dylan Hunt.  I won't spoil anything for readers, but the battle of wits between the two holds one's interest well.<br /><br />A second plot element that runs through the book involves a treasure hunt for artifacts of ancient technology -- think of \\"Indiana Jones\\" among the stars.  This involves Beka, who emerges as perhaps the best-sketched character in the novel.  Beka, her mom, and her ne'er-do-well brother all compete to find certain ancient artifacts.  When -- after many chapters -- these artifacts are finally brought together, an ancient engine begins to shake the very foundations of space and time.  How \\"Rommie\\" (avatar of Andromeda), Trance Gemini, and Dylan Hunt struggle to avert the consequences of Beka's foolishness makes for a good story.<br /><br />Some great touches, with panache and originality, include an attack on a Nietzschean battle cruiser by a fleet of primitive \\"sail ships.\\"  These rag-tag, solar-powered fighters are the only craft the oppressed peoples of the planetary system are able to pull together.  The battle is really David against Goliath.  This was a wonderful development in the book and gives Seamus Harper his chance to take the spotlight.<br /><br />Another very fun bit of writers' invention was the \\"warbot\\" (war robot) named Tweedledum, who plays a key part near the end of the novel.  He doesn't make a very lengthy appearance, but he really stirs things up when he does!<br /><br />The writers had to work with a \\"given\\" fictional world based on the TV series \\"Andromeda.\\"  This book could have been just \\"going through the motions\\" writing as some of these spin-off novels tend to be.

I began WAYSTATION without high expectations, since spin-off novels from video series or films are rarely masterpieces.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The novel shows some surprising quality in places. It really had me turning pages and enjoying myself.  Too bad that, overall, it lacked a satisfying ending and -- at the end -- just sort of twittered out into limbo.<br /><br />At first I was a bit put off by the constant flip banter between the characters.  However, this constant banter became more familiar by the second chapter and I started to flow with it.  Perhaps because I came to enjoy the characters. I have seen the Andromeda TV show and expected the characters to be cardboard cut-outs from the show, but the author did a surprisingly good job of bringing them to life. The best developed character by far was Trance Gemini, that peculiar little elfin woman whose role I never understood in the TV series.  She becomes the focus of this book, and carries it. I need to give Mr. McDonald a gold star for developing her into an interesting character for the reader, given that I am not sure the TV show provided him with  much to work with in this regard.<br /><br />The novel also helped me to understand some riddles of the TV series that never made sense to me.  Like, why there are TWO Andromedas -- one a hologram and one an android.  Turns out they are two different characters.  At times they even begin to argue with one another.<br /><br />The plot started so well.  The ship Andromeda Ascendant has been badly shot up in a battle with defense forces of the planet Kantar; she escapes, limping, into Slipstream drive, but is forced to drop out of hyperspace when systems fail.  The ship thus defaults into a very bad location, a quadrant with little but empty vacuum.  No planets, no moons, no asteroids.  However, by good fortune Andromeda's star charts reveal an old waystation, built centuries earlier to service starships in the early days of exploration.  The plot centers on a desperate effort to (1) travel to the waystation, (2) find materials necessary to effect repairs on the Andromeda Ascendant, and (3) return.<br /><br />Here's where the book runs into major problems.  At least three-quarters of the book (roughly 200 pages) has concluded before members of Hunt's crew even REACH the waystation.  Thus the author has only about 65 pages to roll out most of the plot and wrap up the book.  Scene follows scene in a rush, blurring past the reader as the author tries to tie everything up in a few tens of pages. Even with all this haste and compression, a lot is left hanging as the book ends.<br /><br />Perhaps the author might have had more room to conclude the book if he did not devote so many pages to Trance Gemini's dimension doors and encounters with quantum alternates of herself.  While this element worked well for a while, and was genuinely interesting when first introduced, it eventually got to be very repetitious and overworked.  I kept asking, \\"oh, no, not again -- haven't we been there before-- like four times at least?\\"  A sub-plot that got out of control?<br /><br />To wrap this up -- this novel had many elements I liked a lot.  The characters, plenty of drama, great sense of humor, and a fast-moving action plot that takes us to about page 200.  At that point structure seems to break down.  The ending is compressed, cursory, and disappointing.<br /><br />This book is too good to pan, but too weak to praise.t centers on a desperate effort to (1) travel to the waystation, (2) find materials necessary to effect repairs on the Andromeda Ascendant, and (3) return. <br /> <br />Here's where the book runs into major problems.

US	53031379	R2YTCPIW53HXZ5	0812571126	189650237	Shiva In Steel (Berserker Series)	Books	2	4	4	N	N	A half-finished novel . . . .	In the last couple of months I reviewed two other Saberhagen novels on Amazon: Berserker Star and Rogue Berserker.  Both showed more craftsmanship than Shiva in Steel.<br /><br />The other reviews printed here carry the main idea.  The book seems carelessly or hastily done.<br /><br />For example-- the first two-thirds of the book are focused toward preparing and arming a sortie against the berserkers.  The ships are prepared, the crews are trained, the strategy is planned.  Then we find out, there's going to be no expedition. A kind of ad hoc battle flares up as the berserkers somehow locate the Solarian base.  A reader has the feeling that Saberhagen started out to write a big novel, say 500 pages, and then for whatever reason needed to bring it to a very rapid close.<br /><br />As for the characters . . . again, a work half finished.  Harry's great love, Becky, shows up in the novel.  Given the build-up to her appearance, we are expecting some engagement between Harry and the girl.  However, she is little more than a cardboard cutout.  There's no characterization, really, and the total exchange between Harry and Becky amounts to just a few paragraphs.<br /><br />Several times, Harry begins to develop sub-plots.  Marut is a commander with whom Harry has lots of conflict.  He's a pretty central figure in the first half of the book.  Then he just disappears.  We finally get a sentence or two at the very end informing us that his ship was lost in the battle.  Other characters are brought on stage, given some scenes, and assume some reality in the story, to include the Emperor Julius and Christopher Havot.  Both of them peter out.  It is as though Saberhagen decided to write them into the story, then loses track of them.<br /><br />I formerly had given Saberhagen's Rogue Berserker a very strong rating.  I thought it was really well done.  This novel is really a patched-together mess.  I wonder if the publishers were pressuring him and he was over-deadline.  He had a rough draft . . . well, \\"it would just have to do!\\"<br /><br />Not for me it didn't.  Didn't do, I mean.  And one of the other reviewer's comments, that we never find out what happens to the title villain Shiva . . .  that's ridiculous.  You have a title villain, and you somehow lose track of him?<br /><br />This is a problem with today's equivalent of the pulp market.  Novels are pumped out fast, sometimes one or more a year.  Publishers keep badgering their few authors who have something of a name for more and more productivity.  If the book is ready it comes out.  If it is half-finished and desperately needs work, it comes out anyway.  At least some of this criticism should go to the editor at the publishing house.<br /><br />Saberhagen has other much better novels in print.  Buy those..

US	53031379	R1YH79IX32I6LV	0743498739	61504100	Rogue Berserker (Berserker Series)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Tightly written, full of the unexpected	This novel is more tightly written than some of Saberhagen's other Berserker novels -- more concise and faster moving.  The plotting is really skillful. Under the experienced pen of the author, the plot of this book \\"turns around\\" to bite the reader in an almost shocking way.<br /><br />Saberhagen \\"sets up\\" the reader from the first page with lots of scattered evidence that is subject to lots of interpretation. The bare facts are these: women and children have been kidnapped by the berserkers.  As Harry Winston and his boss Winston Cheng puzzle over the evidence, weighing facts against facts, they work out a pretty sound theory of what has happened and why. Using their assumptions, Harry and Cheng assemble a team and devise a plan to rescue the hostages. The whole rescue mission, which is at the center of the book, is based upon this reconstruction of what really happened. Who did the kidnappings?  Why?  What will become of the hostages?  Where were they taken?<br /><br />In this respect, the novel takes on some of the suspense of a good mystery novel.  And yet the author wisely plants some seeds of doubt.  Harry Silver's logic wars with his instincts.  \\"That HAS to be what happened . . . but it somehow doesn't 'smell' right.\\"  Have Harry and Cheng built a house of cards?<br /><br />A blur of shocking and violent events bursts upon the reader at the end of Chapter 12 -- about two-thirds of the way through the book. As Lawrence Durrell once put it, \\"take but a step to the east or the west and the entire picture changes.\\" It turns out that every key assumption of Silver and Chang was WRONG.<br /><br />As weapons blaze, as his friends are dying, and as his installation is being blown apart, Harry realizes with a kind of horror that his whole picture -- everything -- was based on wrong interpretations.  Some of his brothers in arms, on whom he was depending, turn out to be arch-villains, and the berserkers whom he thought he understood are acting in inexplicable ways, beyond anything Harry could have expected.  Furthermore, the hostages are not where everyone assumed they were. The kidnappers are not the ones that everyone \\"knew\\" were guilty. Lastly, characters who up until now have seemed inconsequential and even silly suddenly become key and central players in the novel.<br /><br />The author has managed all of this so skillfully.  The plotting is almost brilliant.  It is like one of those \\"gestalt\\" drawings where a picture seems to change from a lady's hat to a duck. The author takes the same evidence and lays it out in a different pattern.  And, suddenly everything is up for grabs.<br /><br />Harry improvises, recruiting the most improbable allies, making it up as he goes along.<br /><br />When he blasts his way finally into the fortress and releases the hostages, one of them says, \\"where are all the others?  The other rescuers?\\"  Harry said, \\"I'm it. There's no one else. I'm the only one that's still alive.\\"  What a story!<br /><br />The characters are marvelous.  The book is full of robots or androids of one type or another, and a number of interesting human characters as well. Even though \\"we all know\\" that berserkers are unreflective killing machines, you will be surprised to find a few in this book who behave in the most extraordinary ways, reinterpreting their prime directive to make the most aberrant actions seem \\"logical.\\"  Motivation of these berserkers is crafted as skillfully as in Issac Asimov's masterpiece \\"The Naked Sun.\\"<br /><br />Saberhagen sometimes evokes Asimov.  Asimov's robots relied upon their 'positronic' brains.  Saberhagen's rely on their 'optelectronic' brains.  Both Asimov and Saberhagen have so much fun warping and parsing their robotic \\"prime directives.\\"  The reader thinks, \\"robots can't act that way.\\"  but -- they can!  They do!

US	53031379	R3MX0ZVI7YG7BP	0765343215	858999086	Berserker's Star (Berserker Series)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Very full of surprises	This is the first berserker novel I have read in several years.  I found it quite entertaining, largely for the quite extraordinary stellar system, which consists of a black hole, a neutron star \\"pulsar,\\" and a \\"habitable body\\" called Maracanda.  This place is NOT a planet, as several characters keep repeating almost as a mantra.<br /><br />The concept -- for the sake of entertainment at least -- is that the gravitational distortions of massive objects in a tight orbit have created weirdness on the habitable portion of Maracanda.  Traveling around or adventuring on Maracanda is quite an experience of time and space dilation.<br /><br />The characterization is not very deep for the most part, although the protagonist Harry came to life pretty well for me.  He is part rogue and part \\"the last honest man.\\"  There's a kind of love linkage in the character of Lily, although the author never really has time or room to build this into too much.  Really, Harry's first love is his intelligent ship, the Witch.  The ship is actually a better developed character than some of the characters.<br /><br />As a very \\"fun read,\\" I give this book pretty good marks.  As for quality, I think the author succeeded in creating an imaginary place that is -- ta ta! -- ORIGINAL and that keeps you guessing.<br /><br />The berserkers are a fun concept -- a bit like the Cylons in Battlestar Galactica or the \\"replicators\\" in SG-1.  In short, legion of self-replicating robots with the gone-wrong mission imperative of exterminating all life.  These are not original, but they make pretty good -- and scary -- villains.  Because in the war with the berserkers, it appears mankind is LOSING . . .<br /><br />If you want a fun read that keeps you turning pages, and some very original ideas spun off of Einstein's relativity and astrophysics -- I think you will like this.  It is not \\"War and Peace\\" but it is fun -- and good of its kind.	2005-02-24
US	53031379	R2DKU36FEN7QMJ	0743471768	834429865	Demon's Gate	Books	3	5	5	N	Y	Some great scenes, some shortcomings . . . .	I have great respect for Steve White after having recently enjoyed the novels IN DEATH GROUND and THE SHIVA OPTION which he co-authored with David Weber. I expected much from this book, but I was somewhat disappointed. DEMON'S GATE has some great scenes that kept me reading, but to my mind the book also has some serious shortcomings.  And some of the problems Steve White created for himself.<br /><br />The names drove me crazy.  White creates dozens of odd names.  They have too many verbs, or in some cases, too many consonants, and are unpronounceable.  What is worse, many of the names are confusingly similar. For example, two brothers are named Khaaradh and Khaavorn.  I kept leafing back to the previous chapter, trying to straighten out which was which.  I will quote one sentence which can suggest to you how very awkward these names become: \\"Lanoraak, Khaaradh, and Akhraworn were immediately on their feet besides Khaavorn, bellowing their support for him.\\" I could NOT keep these characters straight.<br /><br />For another example, two of the most central evil characters in the book, a high priestess and the demon emperor, have highly similar names of about 10 letters and -- again -- I found it almost impossible to keep them straight.  The place names are just as bad. This slew of clumsy names is just continual -- the chapters are salted with them.  I can't remember having so much struggle just to keep straight who was who. Or where they were! This was completely unnecessary, in my opinion.<br /><br />The demons were great!  Steve White not only sprinkled the book with demons, but he created several orders of demons with different powers and appearance.  The scenes where the characters battled the demons were very well executed and were real page-turners.  These parts of the book show White at his best.  Some of the magic users -- high priests and sorcerors -- were also excellently rendered.  The female mages were both drop-dead beautiful and also very frightening.<br /><br />Some scenes in the book appeared to violate common sense. A good example --  Late in the evening before the great battle, the king gets this \\"brilliant idea\\" to defeat the demons.  He asks one of his officers if the men can find some digging tools.  A few hours later, demons the size of elephants are falling into ENORMOUS hidden pits that have been cleverly covered over with branches and leaves. In other words, soldiers with a few scrounged up shovels -- in a few hours and within sight of the enemy -- have excavated enough dirt to practically dig another Holland Tunnel. I mean, this borders on \\"nuts.\\"  As though a writer would describe how a bunch of janitors have rebuilt the World Trade Center overnight.<br /><br />A mixed bag. A few great scenes, a few memorable wicked characters, and . . . I have to say it . . . some major shortcomings.ening. <br /> <br />Some scenes in the book appeared to violate common sense.

US	53031379	RLTH43LBRIV5Z	0345462831	573897923	Rift	Books	2	5	9	N	N	Somewhat disappointing . . . .	I was able to get through the entire novel, RIFT, but there were times I almost put it aside. Clearly, the book was just readable enough for me to get to the end, but I had some problems with the book's quality.<br /><br />I was disappointed by three problems:  (1) slow start; (2) improbable character motivation; and (3) little real understanding of science shown by the author.<br /><br />As for the slow start-- if you can get through the opening chapters, you may make it through.  There's a lot of early development portraying the protagonist as a bored, burned-out accountant with marital problems.  A bored, tired accountant is not very interesting to me.  The guy's wife is never really brought into the story, though she is talked about in the third person a lot.  Too much so, really.<br /><br />As for implausible motivation-- this was my biggest single problem.  I keep asking myself, \\"would any REAL PERSON ever actually behave this way?\\"  To keep this short, I will just offer brief examples.  Picture this.  The protagonist has nearly lost his life and has been through a harrowing ordeal.  He wanders into a small village after having spent hours in a weakened state crossing the desert on foot.  He is exhausted, hungry, dirty, and very thirsty.  He looks longingly at a convenience store, aware that he has no money -- not a cent.  At this point, he stops momentarily to render assistance to a wealthy woman driving a luxury car.  In gratitude, she tries to press him to accept a $20 bill.  He flies into a rage, and berates the woman, saying \\"I have my pride, and I do NOT accept charity.\\"  (Paraphrased.)  He turns in anger and quickly walks away from this woman, who is still trying to offer him the money. This is not character motivation coming out of the scene-- rather, it is an author pulling the strings of a puppet.<br /><br />There are other instances.  He has broken into a woman's house.  She is afraid of him, points a handgun at him, orders him to leave, and threatens to call the police.  But . . . just a moment later, she does a 180-degree turn, puts down the gun, offers him her car to escape, and helps him develop a plan to evade his pursuers. This drastic reversal is never explained, nor does it make any sense.<br /><br />Yet again, in a long talk with Crystal, a gorgeous exotic dancer, he begins in a defiant rage, but in seconds drops to the carpet, helplessly sobbing.  Which is it?  Is the guy a macho soldier-of-fortune type, or a sensitivity-class nerd trying to find his inner emotions?  This implausibility goes on throughout the book.  I kept saying, \\"what real human being could possibly act like this?\\"<br /><br />Lastly, there's no trace of any scientific understanding shown.  The technology at the heart of the book is first described as a function of some paradoxes in quantum mechanics.  This explanation is fine, and would work for me.  HOWEVER, halfway through the book we are told that the teleportation device does NOT work according the quantum physics at all, but by some unknown and different scientific principle.  And this is never explained or described AT ALL.<br /><br />This is getting too long, and forgive me for that.  But the book is kind of lame, really.  The writing on the paragraph level is pretty good, but it appears Mr. Cox has not yet mastered the larger architecture needed for a full length novel.<br /><br />If Cox continues to write, perhaps he will get a better grip.  I hope he keeps at it.  As for this first effort -- it definitely needs work.d threatens to call the police.

I had not read the previous books in the series.<br /><br />At first I was put off, thinking, \\"hey, this is totally implausible.\\"  Then I figured out that the book follows the rules of a fairy tale.  Or even, Aladdin and the Magic Lamp.  So if a fisherman has a bottle containing the west wind, or the heroes venture into a land of faceless people -- well, in this universe, such things happen.<br /><br />Once the reader orients him/herself to this world, the read becomes more comfortable.  And it is full of wonderful surprises!  It is as though Foster is familiar with the conventions of such fantasy worlds, and does some amazing switcheroos!  These can be very surprising, and if you are reading in bed, the writer really wakes you up.<br /><br />The characters are not too deep, excepting maybe for the lead character Etjole Ehomba, who is drawn with more depth and complexity.  And a warning-- some characters are NOT what they  may seem!<br /><br />The ending of this novel is full of the most unexpected and amazing twists.  Other bonuses -- The story has a very voluptuous, beautiful, and super sexy pricess type, named Visioness Themaryl.  What happens to her at the end of the book is quite a testament to the contraryness of women, but for me to divulge the details would \\"spoil\\" the book for readers.<br /><br />The novel is picaresque, united by a journey.  Each place visited on the journey contains a separate adventure.  The dangers the group of heroes face are very original. The structure is very loose-- almost like a chain of short stories involving the same characters. (Naturally, the novel has the obligatory map of the fantasy world, which seems to be a \\"stock in trade\\" of fantasy novels these days.)<br /><br />Lastly, there's a really bad villain.  About as unpleasant and dangerous as could be imagined.<br /><br />A fun book. A good airplane book.  Not to be taken too seriously.

Rosemary Kirstein's THE LANGUAGE OF POWER is a bit different, but after all is said and done, it is a worthy continuation of the very gripping saga she has been unfolding in the preceding books, beginning with THE STEERSWOMAN'S ROAD.<br /><br />A reviewer needs to tread carefully here, since too much attention to a plot summary can prove to be a \\"spoiler\\" for those who have not begun the book.<br /><br />Let us put it this way.  THE STEERSWOMAN'S ROAD and THE LOST STEERSMAN were painted on a large canvas.  They involved quest, and crossed the mapped world.  They involved peoples, countries, cultures, all beautifully brought to life by the writer.<br /><br />THE LANGUAGE OF POWER pretty much stays in one place, the port city of Donner.  Rather than taking us across a world, this book \\"drills down deep.\\"  Rowan, the protagonist, is on the trail of the elusive \\"wizards.\\"  She has good reason to care-- she was severely injured and saw an entire people destroyed by the callous exercise of the wizards' powers.<br /><br />Now Rowan puts all her analytic powers toward unraveling the mysteries and secrets of the wizards.  And that involves going into the past.  She interviews the villagers, getting a bit of information here, and a bit of information there.  We have numerous interesting characters, most rather well sketched, who provide bits and pieces of information.  Out of this, we observe a brilliant deductive mind at work-- Rowan's.  Only Rowan has the capability to piece together fragments of the past, to finally clarify the frightening nature of the wizards.  And then, to find the courage to GO HUNTING THEM.<br /><br />With her dear friend Willam now returned (Willam, not William as another reviewer kept putting it) Rowan goes on the attack at the end of this book.  Willam, a half-trained apprentice wizard, as well as Bel, Rowan's swordswoman soul-mate, are her indispensible allies -- they keep her alive while she pursues an old, cold trail of evidence.  The upshot of this book is the destruction of one wizard, plus priceless information that will allow her personal war to continue.<br /><br />One thing so exciting about Ms. Kirstein is  -- throw out the EXPECTED.  Things happen in this book that are truly ORIGINAL.  Her narrative detailing the capture of a dragon is marvelous.  I can't spoil this by describing it, but it is totally gripping.  One can never anticipate what will come out of the pen of this writer.  To illustrate my point, I have recently read TANEQUIL  by Terry Brooks.  Not bad, really, but so predictable.  Fantasy by formula.  Change character names, and a plot summary would be much like those for Mr. Brooks's earlier epics.  Ms. Kirstein throws out the formula.  No one can imagine what is going to happen as one starts one of her novels.<br /><br />The element of surprise in her books is paramount.  It brings to my mind a quotation from Lawrence Durrell's THE ALEXANDRIA QUARTET --  \\"Take but a step to the East or West and the entire picture changes.\\"<br /><br />This book is a fascinating blend of fantasy and science fiction.  The world of the Steerswoman is a fantasy (sword and sorcery) sort of world.  But to drill down into the mystery, the protagonist Rowan must begin to enter a world of scientific thought.<br /><br />And ultimately, Ms. Kirstein has great villains ! !  The wizards.  So cold, so ruthless, so incredibly powerful -- and yet...  The wizard she fights in this book, Jannik, reminds me of the wizard of Oz -- a short, plump little man with silver hair and a smooth, disarming manner.  Not very prepossessing -- but in reality quite frightening and quite deadly.  We learn from this book that the wizards are of a different race, and of unknown origin.  They kill with no remorse.  They \\"move the very stars.\\"  Who can stand up to them?  Rowan learns that their plots will turn the world into a holocaust.  She MUST stop them.<br /><br />As this book ends, Rowan has far more pieces of the puzzle.  She knows where to look for Slado, the wizard master. Rowan goes on the hunt.  This woman has deep scars from her near fatal encounters with the wizards' minions.  She is \\"ticked off\\" -- totally.  She is going for the kill.  A bit like David and Goliath perhaps, but personally, I am betting on this very sharp woman to take down Goliath.<br /><br />I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in the series.of the puzzle.

Laurie Marks has created a very interesting and well realized imaginary world.  As in many swords and sorcery novels, we find a world at war.  This war is fought on many levels.  Conflicts between the characters tend to reflect some of the larger conflicts of the social order.<br /><br />Ms. Marks does well in creating some interesting characters.  They tend to fall into a number of categories-- elemental witches, sorcerors, warriors, psychics, seers, healers.  This panoply of roles reminds one a bit of the \\"Forbidden Realms\\" fantasy games.  Marks handles dialog well.  There are all the traits that make characters seem alive, to include humor, rage, passion, and grief.  I found myself really believing in the characters and caring what happened to them. There are some battles of spirit that add depth-- for instance, Karis's struggle to overcome narcotics addiction.<br /><br />I found some problems in the book also.  The strange sexual orientation of the book's social order was confusing.  We are not talking about one gay relationship here -- but ALL the relationships in the book.  The women are ALL involved in various intimate Lesbian relationships.  The men soon pair off into their own counterpart gay relationships.  There's no amorous relationship in the book between a man and a woman.<br /><br />Nowhere in the book does one see a family.  The Sainnite society of warriors takes all of the women they capture and puts them into villages of prostitutes.  Their relationships with these women are just serial rape.  The children born of these rapes are taken from the mothers and transported to other villages that are filled with \\"nannies.\\"  They are raised as replacement soldiers.  Is this believable, even in fiction?<br /><br />In a like vein, the one woman in the book who bears a child -- Norina -- gives the baby over to a nurse about two weeks after giving birth and essentially leaves the baby behind. This is the norm.  Norina's \\"husband\\" is a joke.  He's a weak milktoast of a man who Norina has taken as a convenience.  She states bluntly that she soon plans to leave him, and he accepts this with a hangdog look.<br /><br />It seems that the women in the book are strong both spiritually and physically.  They are the real warriors.  The men are weak and effeminate.  Medric, a male seer, is a prime example.  One can't help sensing that Marks has warped her fantasy creation to reflect a personal agenda.  It is difficult to imagine such a social order coming into existence or surviving.  For instance, one can hardly imagine a world with no stable environment to rear children, or where almost the only intimacy to be found is in gay relationships.  For one obvious point, where would the children come from?  (Serial rape, but that seems equally implausible.)<br /><br />Another problem with the book is motivational.  In a flash of jealousy between two women who are the book's protagonists, Norina blindly attacks Zanja.  She hurts Zanja very badly, inflicting deep wounds and breaking bones.  But then, hatefully, instead of administering the coup de grace, Norina decides to leave the severely cripped Zanja to be captured by their bitter enemies, who are at that moment close at hand.  This seems almost diabolic.  Remember, up to this point Zanja and Noriana have been traveling together, and are dearest friends.  Zanja doesn't even defend herself properly because she can't believe Noriana is attacking her.<br /><br />A few chapters later, Zanja and Noriana are thrown together again. Zanja -- implausibly -- takes the attitude, \\"oh, what the heck,\\" embraces Noriana, and they are once again best friends.  This is just totally implausible.  Quite a bit of this inexplicable motivation occurs throughout the story.  The female character Mabin also falls into this pattern. She does almost diabolically evil deeds at times, but there's no motivation for it that makes any sense.<br /><br />The book is interesting and not without merit.  However, for meit has some deep flaws.  Subsequent volumes continue to build onto this fantasy world, but I am not certain I will try to obtain or read them for reasons I've given here.<br /><br />In a forward to this book, Laurie Marks thanks her fellow writer Rosemary Kirstein for her support.  Kirstein is a wonderful writer.  Her fantasy novels explore Lesbian relationships, but do so with taste and subtlety.  Would that these qualities were more in evidence in FIRE LOGIC.erit.

We not only are able to revisit Holmes and Watson, but many of the stories take us into the interesting world of 19th century intellectuals and literati.<br /><br />For one example, Bill Crider's story \\"The Adventure of the Christmas Bear\\" brings Oscar Wilde to life.  At first glance, one would imagine no pair more opposite than the dour Holmes and the madcap Oscar Wilde.  And yet, they strike some very interesting sparks in the story.<br /><br />Charles Darwin comes to life in \\"The Adventure of the Naturalist's Stock Pin.\\"  Jon Breen creates a story where Darwin himself comes calling at 221B Baker Street using the pseudonym \\"Mr. Beagle.\\"  His wiles are of no use, of course, for Holmes quickly confronts him with his real identity.  The story is most entertaining, and again, is a treat for those of us who enjoy bringing of a past milieu to life.<br /><br />Bob Cratchit of Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the heart of yet another story -- as a supposedly \\"real\\" personage!  Some of these literary pastiches have to be applauded for their audacity and inventiveness.  And of course, can the writer bring the story home-- can the sometimes outre premise be woven into a Christmas tale?<br /><br />I believe these stories succeed moreso than they fail.  Considering that many of the stories are by authors I've never heard of, I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of the writing is really quite good.  The editors deserve a pat on the back.  A few of the writers are pretty well known -- I'm familiar with Anne Perry and Tanith Lee, for two.<br /><br />Is this book, \\"More Holmes for the Holidays,\\" of equal quality with its predecessor, entitled \\"Holmes for the Holidays?\\" I am presently reading my way through the latter.  It appears there is no fall-off in quality.  Good editors are good editors.  They did a capable job with the first, and sustained their good judgment with the second.<br /><br />These stories are great fun at Christmastime.  It's surprising how differently the authors \\"imagine\\" that Holmes responded to Christmas.  Often in a dour and sour manner -- \\"humbug\\" -- but in some of the stories, he has a bright Christmas spirit.<br /><br />The only Arthur Conan Doyle story involving Holmes and Christmas is \\"The Blue Carbuncle.\\"  That was a fine tale!  It's a shame that Doyle did not do more Christmas tales involving the Baker Street duo, and this book helps remedy that deficiency.Christmastime.

I had some difficulty with this book, even though I have read many of David Drake's other books with great enjoyment and enthusiasm.<br /><br />Generally, the \\"galactic politics\\" themes in this book bored me to death.  We have a young captain in a small warship struggling to survive in a very savage pond.  Naturally, there are corrupt officials and dirty deals, and the Lieutenant and his shipmates have to be clever, quick, and devious to survive.  But unfortunately, this is pretty trite.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned fairly shallow characters that are pretty much without complexity.  This is okay in an action novel, but all this political intrigue combined with fairly superficial characters -- it just \\"wears on a reader.\\"<br /><br />What I did discover is that David Drake does not disappoint with action-based \\"future war\\" narratives.  Embedded in this book are a number of simply excellent battle scenes-- gunfights in skid-row taverns, naval battles between the Lieutenant's frigate and much larger vessels (light-cruiser class).  When the ion cannon are blazing and the hyperdrive missiles are flaring, no one writes better than David Drake.<br /><br />Since the novel is a thinly linked picaresque type novel, and is essentially a series of short stories connected only by a very loose overall plot, I decided to read the book that way.<br /><br />So I skimmed and skimmed, and when the ion bolts were blazing and the missile traces crossed the heavens, I settled in for a very careful read!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this means I read half the book carefully and skimmed the rest.  But I just could not really get through this book on its own terms.<br /><br />One other thing I might mention-- Drake describes the spaceships in the book with old fashioned terms appropriate to the sailing ships of Napoleon's time.  Use of terms such as \\"hatches,\\" \\"rigging,\\" \\"forecastle\\" and the like are presumably supposed to lend a sort of \\"Horatio Hornblower\\" excitement to the story.  Unfortunately, it just seems totally absurd.<br /><br />David Drake is a wonderful writer and has done some EXCELLENT books.  Unfortunately, this is not one of them.to the story.

In the opening chapters, some adventurers raid and loot a goblin ship.  The pace here is glacial.  It takes several chapters to accomplish this raid.<br /><br />Contrast this to the book's conclusion.  In just a few pages, the library is raided, a quarrel-filled town meeting occurs, and a battle takes place with wicked forces for control of the town, all blurring by at a dizzying pace.<br /><br />There are a few structural problems, too. Jugh, the protagonist of the book, is a blurred composite of adventurer and mousey librarian. The different sides to his personality seem to clash-- they don't jell well.  In any given scene, will he hide like a timid mouse or will he pick up a weapon and fight like a banshee?<br /><br />Jugh's best friend, Raisho, is a swashbuckling, swordfighting human.  At least Jugh, for all his contradictions, comes alive pretty well as a character.  Raisho, unfortunately, seems almost a cardboard cut-out character.  Perhaps a walking, talking, sword-swinging stereotype would be more accurate.<br /><br />There is a good \\"sense of place\\" in the book.  The locales are well described and seem very real, anchoring the story.  The evil forces are well done.  Mr. Odom creates some new and entertaining monsters.  The world in which the story is set has a lot of originality.  The evil forces are devoted to destruction of books, learning, and the arts.  Jugh, late in the story, tells his friend Craugh the Wizard WHY he believe the dark forces want to destroy all books.  This development is quite interesting, and promises the reader some interesting turns in the next volume of the series, not yet published.<br /><br />A reviewer on the book's cover compares THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BOOKS to the novels of Tolkien or Terry Brooks.  This is a bit \\"too much\\" -- Mr. Odom's novel is just not that good.  However, in fairness, the novel is a good read.  While it has some flaws and in some ways one might wish it better, it is good enjoyable entertainment for a lazy Sunday afternoon, or better yet, as a good read on a long airline flight.<br /><br />Since this is only the first installment of a multivolume effort, the book sort of leaves us in limbo at the end.  So many of these \\"installment\\" novels are appearing in recent years, this sort of let down is coming to seem acceptable.  However, as a way of writing a unified piece of fiction, it does little service to the reader.  THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BOOKS has just been published -- copyright 2004.  How long would a reader have to wait to learn how the story comes out-- two more years?  As I said, far from an ideal situation, and far short of a true courtesy to Mr. Odom's readers.tter, it is good enjoyable entertainment for a lazy Sunday afternoon, or better yet, as a good read on a long airline flight. <br /> <br />Since this is only the first installment of a multivolume effort, the book sort of leaves us in limbo at the end.

US	53031379	R1MF5WDM57X4PS	0441011365	739712841	The Child Goddess	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Thoughtful, and out of the ordinary . . . .	When I first picked up and examined this book, I very much doubted I would find it interesting enough to get through it. Finally, I applied a test that I've used many times. I just opened the book and read the first paragraph. I finally decided to acquire the book and to see if it would interest me.<br /><br /> In truth, I could not put the book down and finished it in two days.<br /><br /> The investigator in this detective-like novel is Mother Isabel, a Catholic sister of a religious order that &quot;attempts to shine light into dark places.&quot; She begins by trying to protect a child who has been the victim of exploitation by a money-hungry corporation. But as she pursues justice, she encounters mystery after mystery.<br /><br /> The story also involves a love theme -- and she is forced to cross paths with the great love of her life.<br /><br /> As the mystery draws her in and the stakes rise beyond the welfare of a single child to the welfare of many children, Mother Isabel travels to a distant planet, where she continues to wage a brave but unequal battle against corporate greed and the cold pursuit of wealth.<br /><br /> This book excellently depicts a crossed web of feelings -- love between a man and a woman, love of a motherly woman for an abandoned child, and the love of a child for her ersatz mother and protector.<br /><br /> This novel could be compared with the works of Rosemary Kirstein -- books such as THE STEERSWOMAN'S ROAD. Here too, a woman protagonist is a member of a sisterhood, or religious order if you will, dedicated to the pursuit of truth -- that is, &quot;to shed light into dark places.&quot; This is to take nothing away, and I do not mean to imply that Ms. Marley and Ms. Kirstein even know each other's work. But the excellence of these two authors shows considerable parallel.	2004-07-23
US	53031379	R7BM2PEF7AV0K	0345455282	991943153	Shadows Over Baker Street	Books	3	10	12	N	N	A Mixed Bag	I have to agree with other reviews printed here.  The book is something of a mixed bag.  Few of the stories are well balanced quality pieces of professional writing.  Their strengths and limitations differ.<br />Some of the stories show a paucity of knowledge about Lovecraft's work.  In such stories, only a few of the most general references are made to the Lovecraftean canon.  Otherwise the stories just suggest the pursuit of a &quot;nightstalker&quot; figure similar to a sort of Jack the Ripper.  To justify the story's inclusion in this collection, the author tosses in a couple of Lovecraft's character names or place names such as &quot;Cthulhu&quot; or &quot;Innsmouth&quot; into the story. Nothing is ever done with these references, mind.  That would require too much effort.<br />Some stories work pretty well because the writer has worked with the material before and knows it well.  I think that Richard Lupoff's story &quot;The Voorish Sign&quot; is one of the book's best.  But Lupoff has written and published other Sherlock Holmes pastiches over the years.  He has a track record, so to speak.<br />Some of the most intriguing and most enjoyable stories set a Lovecraftian stage beautifully, drawing us in, getting us really eager to move on to the denouement.  Unfortunately, it is as though the writer at this point does not know what to do with the situation he/she has established, and just  . . .  stops.  Such is &quot;The Mystery of the Worm&quot; by John Pelan.<br />A series of biographic sketches appear at the end of the book, profiling the authors of the various stories.  Here one sees quite a range of experience.  Some of the writers have published a number of books and stories, and seem to have done their share of &quot;weird tales.&quot;  Others have published very little professionally, and seem to be either beginner professionals or serious amateurs.  This may partly explain the sense of unevenness one gets from the book.<br />If I could ask for one thing, it would be a more genuine knowledge of H.P. Lovecraft's writings by some of the authors.  Most of the writers, not surprisingly, have a good sense for Holmes and Watson, since Arthur Conan Doyle's characters are well known through a myriad of books and movies, although even here there are disappointments.  One of the weakest stories in the book, &quot;The Drowned Geologist&quot; by Caitlin Kiernan, is just a long letter supposedly written to Dr. Watson -- but we learn at the end of the story, it was never mailed.  This story reveals virtually no serious detailed knowledge of either Doyle's OR Lovecraft's writing. In fact, the only evidence that Holmes and Watson are even involved in the story at all comes in the letter's salutation, &quot;My dear Dr. Watson.&quot;  One suspects the author congratulated herself that she could make a token gesture toward the editors' requirements while writing something else entirely.<br />I enjoyed the book despite its uneven quality.  It is the kind of book that is very good to take on an airplane trip.  Three or four of the stories are very good., it would be a more genuine knowledge of H.P.

I've just read the reviews previously posted here for The Watchers Out of Time.  Perhaps some of this criticism is a little harsh.  I do agree that there's been some deception -- surely the fault of neither Lovecraft or Derleth, since both men were long dead when this edition was published.<br />The stories are all credited simply to H.P. Lovecraft on the front cover.  But -- confusingly -- the back cover describes the book as a joint effort of Lovecraft and Derleth.  Then we get more confused when, looking at the back of the flyleaf, we discover that ALL the stories are copyrighted by August Derleth alone.<br />Derleth and Lovecraft knew each other, and they did do some genuine collaboration.  But I think this volume is predominantly Derleth's work. One of the other reviewers guessed &quot;95% Derleth's&quot; as I recall.  I could believe that.<br />When I say the other reviews are too harsh, I mean that August Derleth was a pretty good author in his own right.  At his best, when Derleth writes these gothic tales he rivals Lovecraft in narrative and tone. Some of these stories are very good actually-- well worthy of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and other pulp collections of the time.<br />Unfortunately, one of Derleth's limitations when writing Lovecraftian material was his conventional religious belief.  He tended to spin Lovecraft's cosmic &quot;old ones&quot; into something resembling Christian devils or demons.  This loses much of the very chilling alien flavor of Lovecraft's original mythos. There is always a kind of nihilistic despair haunting around the edges of real Lovecraft stuff-- e.g., &quot;At the Mountains of Madness.&quot;<br />All in all, one must agree that the book is less than what is advertized.  And yet, Derleth is a good writer and his tales can be enjoyable.  I enjoyed the book and hate to see it so roundly and harshly panned.  The problem is-- this is just NOT really H.P. Lovecraft's writing.	2004-05-20

But I am not sure I am going to make it to the end.<br />A different reviewer praised &quot;many separate plot threads&quot; but I find them chaotic and distracting.  It is as though there are at least 6 or 8 separate novels.  One reads 20 or 30 pages involving one setting and one group of characters, then one gets an &quot;installment&quot; of a totally different story . . . and on, and on.<br />This can be very frustrating.  I discovered I was really interested in several of the plot threads, but bored or impatient with others.  So -- understandably -- when one of the threads that interest me is interrupted by some irrelevant narrative -- I try to race past it, skimming, I suppose you could say.<br />Overall, this writer has great talent but is very self indulgent and undisciplined.  Anything he feels like tossing into the sack, so to speak -- in it goes.  If the book were written tighter and structured in a more integrated way, I think it would be much better.<br />There are a few scenes in the book, also, that are just too silly.  In one instance, a group of raiders attack an armed convoy.  The convoy has all the lasers, missiles, and ion weapons of the 24th century.  But the raiders are riding war horses.  We are told these animals have multiple hearts and other organic features that make them very hard to kill.  The riders attack into automatic weapons fire, and we are treated to the butchery of these horses-- although, to be sure, because of their bio-engineering, the horses take terrific damage before they finally collapse.  As an animal lover, I found this pretty awful.  And more to the point, as a reviewer, I found the whole concept just simply preposterous.<br />The odds that I will make it to the last page are no better than even.  Perhaps the author should take a creative writing class.	2004-05-05

The author, whom I've never heard of, has a nice gift for verisimilitude-- the bit of description that's just right to bring a scene to life, make it seem real.<br />His characterization is great also.  I really came to like his characters.  Grace, a very tough little vixen.  She cut her teeth on a mining mech, and tried to fight mercs with a half-baked amateur conversion and weapons that didn't even work right.  Another reviewer says that initial battle was a disaster.  Actually, considering that Grace and her compatriots survived and captured a heavy tank, it was a victory.  In light of the half-baked equipment they had to work with.<br />You could call this &quot;the magnificent seven go to space.&quot;  Grace goes to a nexus starport looking to hire mercs.  She learns that while she has tens of thousands of &quot;stones&quot; (the currency), she still can't buy top merc regiments.  So she gets the losers, the down-and-outs, the mavericks, the renegades.  She can't even pay them decently-- they are working for deeds of farmland, because that is all the locals are able to come up with.<br />Well, this is one h___ of a book, let me tell you.  This bunch of loser mechwarriors, plus miners, farmers, and cattlemen, put together a ragtag army and take on a crack merc outfit.  The battles are hot, the characters seem real, the writing skill makes this hole-in-the-wall little planet come alive.<br />If I see a sequel, or another book by the same author, my checkbook is coming out of my pocket faster than you can say &quot;30-mm autocannon.&quot;<br />PC	2004-04-25

The review that follows is for the sequel to The Steerswoman's Road-- a book entitled \\"The Lost Steersman.\\"  All books in this series are highly recommended!<br />This book had very real-seeming characters, and it showed a great efficiency in exposition that seemed to take me to the center of the story in very few pages.  I'm going to try to convey my excitement with this book while avoiding a \\"spoiler\\" plot summary.  So here goes . . . .<br />As the book begins, there's a great peril facing the small, seaside town.  Rowan, the steerswoman, turns her considerable experience and skills to both combating the threat with her sword, and analyzing the origins and nature of the threat.  A steerswoman is a kind of wandering combination of a warrior for good, while at the same time a researcher and scientist.  Thus her defense of the town involves both her sword and her scholarly analysis.<br />The book is an excellent mystery.  Rowan seems to unfold \\"theory #1,\\" but then it gives way to \\"theory #2,\\" and so on.  As she gets more information, her analysis shifts and changes.  The reader is brought along, gripped and fascinated.  Each hypothesis seems to drastically rewrite the sense of what is happening.<br />As the book nears its conclusion, there is a kind of epiphany of beauty and good on one hand, and an almost diabolical evil on the other.  This goes beyond some glib surprise ending.  It is woven deep into the structure of the novel.<br />It appears no further titles will appear in this series, since these \\"steerswoman\\" books are back into print after an initial release a decade ago.  It is a pity, since much of the larger story is yet to be revealed, and the ending seemed to prepare for a sequel.  Some developments of the book just STOP, with no explanation.<br />A really extraordinary read.  I have already ordered more of Ms. Kirstein's \\"steerswoman\\" fiction from Amazon, and am counting the hours until my order arrives.	2004-02-03

These mysteries are generally fast-moving, rather light in tone, and with ingenious plots.  I was not disappointed.  \\"Ellery Queen\\" is the pen name of a two-man team who actually wrote the books.  They were at the top of their mystery-writing game at mid-century, the approximate time this book saw publication.<br />\\"The Last Woman in his Life\\" would make a great novel to take aboard a plane.  The style is not too challenging, and reads fast. It is \\"fun.\\" The ending, although prepared for carefully by the writer throughout the novel, is still quite a surprise.  And yet, one ponders the final pages and says, \\"of course!\\"<br />Much of the fun of this book comes in the three prime suspects, all of them ex-wives of the murdered man.  Johnny, a wealthy playboy, loved gorgeous, full-figured bimbos -- chorus line dancers, strippers, and minor (to forever remain very minor!) starlets. These girls have remarkable physical endowments, but are not particularly bright.  The authors do a good job of playing these \\"dizzy blonde\\" type showgirls for sexiness as well as for laughs. One or two other female characters seem quite intelligent, thus offsetting what might otherwise be taken as a patronizing or sexist portrayal of women.<br />Surprisingly, the book addresses some social themes.  It was published in 1969, at a time when woman's rights, racial rights, and gay pride were all being forged in the fires of conflict here in America.  Ellery Queen is able to play with these themes, reminding us who are old enough to remember of the revolutionary flavor of the 60's and 70's here in America.  I have to give the book extra points for that.  Don't get me wrong-- this book is not a deep treatise on the rights of man, of course.  It's a light, entertaining novel.  But some central themes of the book will surprise you.  (I have to be guarded or I will \\"spoil\\" the book for readers.)<br />Enjoying this book has given me incentive to watch for other novels by Ellery Queen.  I've read a number of them.

I do not know what happened, but  . . . .<br />Death Watch by John Dickson Carr is one of the most intricately plotted who-done-its that I've read in a while.  A policeman is murdered after midnight in a darkened house.  The murder weapon is the hour hand of a large hall clock.  The hands of the clock had been stolen from the same house two nights before.<br />Carr assembles a good group of suspects.  Some own the house, others are visitors or lodgers in the house.<br />Carr challenges the reader by amassing detail that the reader is expected to remember, and also, by changing direction just when the reader is beginning to think a suspect is the likely killer.<br />This novel is from the 1930's -- 1935, to be exact -- and thus comes to us from the golden age of detective fiction.  The years of the &quot;Black Mask&quot; magazine, and the era of detective writers such as Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett.  Carr was one of the masters.  One senses considerable quality of writing here.<br />Carr is a master of dialog, and uses this skill to bring his characters to life.  One engine driving the book is the constant bickering and disagreement between Inspector Hadley and Dr. Gideon Fell, both of Scotland Yard.  Hadley is something of a straight man, and a foil for Dr. Fell.  Inspector Hadley is an experienced and reasonably intelligent policeman, but is somewhat plodding and not very imaginative.  Dr. Fell, to the contrary, is highly intuitive and strikes deductions that at times rise to brilliance.<br />What seems so obvious and clear to Inspector Hadley -- and to the reader most of the time -- is soon shot down and debunked by Fell's unerring analysis.<br />The whole is great fun.  Carr's mysteries often have a strong dash of the &quot;gothic flavor.&quot;  Spooky houses, secret passages, bizarre appearances and disappearances, sinister characters, the trappings of superstition -- the works!  If you enjoy such effects, it's just one more source of enjoyment.<br />I highly recommend the book.  However, it is somewhat demanding.

US	53031379	R21G4UO9NM71KD	0425191672	409000137	Night Watch: A Long Lost Adventure In Which Sherlock Holmes Meets FatherBrown	Books	2	9	10	N	N	A Too Meditative Sherlock Holmes	Night Watch is a passing good mystery story.  It has trappings of the gothic-- spooky, nocturnal settings; seemingly supernatural happenings; and an interweaving of frightening superstition.  The plot also has some enjoyable complexity-- such as when Sherlock solves the mystery, but later, Father Brown re-solves it again, this time with a somewhat different explanation of events!<br />The book's subtitle suggests a balance between the detective genius of two literary master detectives-- Sherlock Holmes and Father Brown.  However, this promise is not delivered. We meet Father Brown when he is very young in this novel, just approximately 20 or 21 years old.  He says little or nothing throughout most of the book, and appears as a minor character at best.  In the closing pages of the novel, Holmes seems to sense Brown's promise but that promise is simply stated, not dramatically rendered.  Holmes says of Father Brown, \\"don't let that stolid round face and those blank grey eyes fool you.  Brown's a little genius, mark my words.\\"<br />Holmes himself is too meditative -- a kind of crackerbarrel theologian.  He waxes philosophic a bit too often.  He is portrayed near the end of his professional career, and Watson explains that as Holmes has aged, he has begun thinking more about higher, meditative sorts of truth.  But even though Watson states this, it does not jibe well with the Holmes' portrayal as an acid sort of skeptic whom we came to know in the original Arthur Conan Doyle books.<br />I don't want to seem too hard on Mr. Kendrick's novel. It was entertaining to a point, and provided some entertainment on a chilly autumn evening.  However, it can't compete in quality with several other recent pastiches (imitations) of the Sherlock Holmes books, such as those written in recent years by Larry Millett.	2003-10-27

I just finished Blind Lake, and I enjoyed the book very much, but with a few reservations.<br />The story begins with journalists visiting a scientific research facility-- an image of the surface of another planet is being studied at this facility.  Specifically, a living creature of another species is being tracked hour by hour, and day by day.<br />The problem is that even the scientists do not understand their own technology.  Self-programming computers of incredible power have driven this observational system, which is not really telescopic in nature.<br />A key to understanding some of the book's themes comes in a peculiar debate midway through the book.  Ray and Marguerite, two scientists with important roles in the project, conduct a public debate before an auditorium of people.  Ray suggests something remarkable-- that intuition is akin to dream, and that the supercomputers processing the image are really dreaming. Might the free-form thought of incredibly powerful and self-programming computers take on an aspect of a &quot;reality dream?&quot;<br />Early on, the scientists admit they do not understand aspects of the experiment, but -- at first -- they are able to take comfort in applying many principles of relativity physics--  discussing the nature of space and time as portrayed in relativity theory.  But they become more and more bewildered as impossible things begin happening.  Increasingly, they are forced to admit that the paradigms of science are just NOT explaining the Blind Lake project.<br />This unraveling of our contemporary scientific comfort is a chief part of the impact of this book. And if reality is beginning to blur with dream, the dream coming forward in the novel becomes more and more akin to a nightmare.  There's a chilling quality to the book, suggested by its very grim title.  The name of the scientific facility, Blind Lake, is symbolic of the &quot;benefits&quot; of a materialistic, agnostic sort of modern science.<br />The characterization was interesting and good, with one exception.  Ray, the adversarial and difficult ex-husband of Marguerite, seems to become a kind of one-dimensional villain and all-purpose punching bag by the end of the book.<br />The conclusion of the book brings in too much unneeded smoke and mirrors--a kind of &quot;deus ex machina&quot; of wonderous and spectacular events and effects.  But the story doesn't need these.  They tend to distract and conflict with the real resolution of the book on the level of the characters, and in terms of the plot's logic.<br />All in all, a very interesting and stimulating book.  I read it in two days, staying up late at night.  So for me at least, in addition to the &quot;echoes&quot; the book created in me, it came to be a page turner as well.<br />Patrick Callahanterization was interesting and good, with one exception.

All of Millett's novels are Sherlock Holmes pastiches.  In other words, Millett purports to continue the Holmes saga, keeping the style and characters of the original stories by Arthur Conan Doyle.  The DISAPPEARANCE takes place in the year 1900.  Parts of this novel take place in London, New York, and Chicago. (All Millett's Sherlock Holmes stories take place in the United States, presumably on &quot;visits&quot; by Holmes and Watson.)<br />All of Millett's Holmes stories have a very strong sense of place.  Millett is something of an amateur historian and fills his chapters with elaborate descriptions of the streets, buildings, parks, and surroundings the characters encounter.<br />Footnotes appear often, usually explaining details of architecture or other historical details. For a certain sort of leisurely reader, the footnotes are fine, but for others they can become a distraction. For instance, if Holmes meets Watson at an old church in Chicago, a footnote appears that tells us the year the church was built, the kind of glass used in the windows, and the year the church was finally torn down.  There's a lot of this.  Halfway through the novel, I just disregarded the footnotes entirely, and from there on, I think my &quot;read&quot; went better.<br />Millett is a very good prose stylist.  He crafts excellent sentences and paragraphs.  His descriptions are razor sharp, and his characters come to life rather well.  Of all Mr. Millett's Sherlock Holmes books, DISAPPEARANCE best brings Sherlock Holmes forward as a real, living human being. And besides Holmes, some of the other characters are also well drawn and three-dimensional.<br />There is plenty of action in DISAPPEARANCE, and even some tawdry sex. Parts of the story take place in the bordellos of several cities, and some of the villains are madams, purveyors, or prostitutes. There's also plenty of gunplay -- in fact, more &quot;Hollywood&quot; shoot-em-up action than in any of Millett's earlier four novels.<br />Melodrama is very much in evidence.  On at least half a dozen occasions, Holmes teeters at the edge of death.  But almost miraculously, he always prevails.  There's a separate cliffhanger finish for each of the three major acts-- the action in London, next New York, and finally, in Chicago.  Sometimes this is a bit &quot;too much.&quot;<br />I liked the book, although I can see some shortcomings along with the strengths. The larger structure of the book could use more unity -- it is highly episodic, with too many cliffhanger scenes to be altogether credible.  But as I say, the paragraphs are very well written, several of the characters come forward as interesting and believable, and the strong &quot;sense of place&quot; created by Mr. Millett underpins and steadies some of the almost frenetic action of the book.<br />While it was not Millett's primary intention to give a sense of life in America's largest cities at the turn of the century, somehow this comes forward to enrich the story.  One smells, tastes, and touches the America of an historical era.  This is a kind of bonus that enriches the &quot;read&quot; for me.<br />DISAPPEARANCE's shortcomings notwithstanding, I felt this novel was worth the money.<br />Patrick Callahanllywood&quot; shoot-em-up action than in any of Millett's earlier four novels.  <br />Melodrama is very much in evidence.

I will not try to write a full-scale review since at this point many good reviews are already listed. I do feel that a few observations may still be helpful.<br />I read the earlier book, IN DEATH GROUND, which begins the story told in THE SHIVA OPTION.<br />One aspect of IN DEATH GROUND that kept me on the edge of my seat was the defeat of mankind and his allies.  From the first collision with the bugs, the war began to go badly for man -- and it went more and more wrong.<br />At the end of IN DEATH GROUND man and his allies were fighting a desperate last-ditch battle at Alpha Centauri, which in this story was the web link directly to Sol -- and Earth. This battle was only won by a hair-- and by some extraordinary good luck. In other words, mankind was hanging on by their fingernails, and the bugs were prying those fingers loose!  When IN DEATH GROUND ended, mankind was in imminent peril of going down to annihilation.<br />The continuation of the story in THE SHIVA OPTION has an opposite character.  Men and their allies begin winning early in the book, and the victories are big.  In every battle, while there are losses on both sides, Terra wipes out ten bugs for each human (or allied) death.  As men and their allies rack up a chain of major victories, the book actually gets less and less interesting.  By the midpoint of this book, the ending seems a foregone conclusion. Man is sure to win &quot;by a knockout.&quot; As we plow through the final half of this very large book, we wonder if we really need to &quot;observe&quot; each and every individual bug planet go down to destruction.<br />One very interesting new element that adds to THE SHIVA OPTION is the reemergence of the bugs' &quot;old enemy.&quot;  Men are the bugs' new enemy, of course.  The old enemy had disappeared by fleeing the bugs centuries before-- a last strategy to avoid racial destruction.  Now, suddenly they are back!<br />It is very bad karma that the bugs should once again collide with their old enemies while in the middle of a war of attrition with mankind. They are already losing-- now they have to divert a major part of their fleets to counter this new threat.<br />I liked THE SHIVA OPTION a lot.  But unfortunately, one-third into the book you realize that the end is a foregone conclusion--that mankind is stretching out a great technological lead and increasingly wiping out fleets of bug ships.  So where's the suspense?  I still plowed through to the end because the battle descriptions are so well done.  Weber (with White, I suppose) has to be one of the very best future war writers out there, along with David Drake and Keith Laumer.r old enemies while in the middle of a war of attrition with mankind.

Chesterton -- full name, Gilbert Keith Chesterton -- was a British intellectual of the early 20th century who engaged in many high-class philosophical and religious debates.  His books covering areas of religion and theology are still read.<br />For diversion and entertainment, Chesterton turned his hand to mystery stories and espionage tales.  His finest mysteries involve the little priest, Father Brown.  His espionage novels include &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; and others.  Most of these tales were written in the early decades of the 20th century-- from 1910 through about 1925.<br />I read some of the Father Brown stories more than 40 years ago.  Now, in my sixties, I came across the Father Brown Omnibus in the library and started reading again.<br />The stories are excellent.  The man is a prose master.  One wishes more detective fiction written today were half as well penned.<br />The plots are so fresh, unexpected, and imaginative they just take your breath away.  Here I am, with so much more to do, drawn on and on into this huge book.<br />I have decided I am going to buy the book.  There are several editions of Father Brown, variously edited, that are still in print.  The omnibus has the whole shebang-- about 800 or more pages of the stories.<br />&quot;Try it.  You'll like it.&quot;  On a par with the Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle.	2003-09-05

I was glad to see that Truth and Shadows carries forward the plot very well.  More battles take place in a campaign by the Steel Wolves to conquer Northwind, but this time the war undergoes some original and unexpected turns.  For example, you will be surprised to discover where the Wolves have hidden their dropships-- but I won't spoil the story by telling you.<br />Characters are very interesting.  We learn a lot more about Ezekiel Crow.  He turns out to be more complex than he seemed at first-- not just a \\"boy scout\\" type of straight arrow.  In fact, he acts decisively in Truth and Shadows -- to find out whether he is a good guy or a villain, or how to interpret his actions, we will need the third and final novel of the trilogy-- not yet published.<br />The three motley \\"ground pounders\\" have now been promoted to sergeants, but still function wonderfully to bring us the dust and noise of battle from a grassroots view.  All in all, author Delrio is to be commended for flowing the second book naturally from the first-- using the larger canvas to brush in more enriching details.<br />The Prefect, Duchess Tara Campbell, never comes alive for me too well, but her aide-de-camp, Captain Tara Bishop, emerges as a very interesting and important character.  Another well-drawn character is the civilian medic who is taken as a bondsman by Anastasia Kerensky.  This character, Ian Murchison, promises to have a major part in the coming third and final novel.<br />Anastasia Kerensky is her evil and sexy best-- her rock-star leathers display a figure that could cause a bishop to kick out a stained glass window.  She's tougher, crueler, and lovelier than any of the other Steel Wolves she rules.  She doesn't get as much play as in \\"Silence,\\" but where she does appear she really steals the spotlight. Part angel, part devil, she both kills and loves without mercy and without regret.  Truly a classic femme fatale. Mr. Delrio, give us more of her!<br />One quirk of the book that struck me is the abrupt way it ends.  Many trilogies end each separate volume with some sort of reconciliation, some semi- or tentative conclusion.  This book just slams on the brakes with little logic.  Suddenly, one of the combatants just states, \\"okay, back off, cease hostilities.\\"  We know this is just a pause in the war, and it seems unmotivated.  Possibly Mr. Delrio checked the word count of the manuscript, figured out he had penned the necessary 280 pages or so, and said, \\"hey-- time to go fishing.\\"  I wish he had shaped the ending of this book more skillfully.  Especially since the third book -- which will clear up all the dangling loose ends-- is almost certainly some months away.<br />The way Delrio writes, one gets a real sense of the mud, the pain, the laser smoke, the fatigue of a major battle.  Delrio may have some military background, or, if not, he has certainly done his homework.  He makes the battlefield seem very real and very gripping.<br />I have read all but one of the new MechWarrior Dark Age series of novels. A couple of the others were pretty good-- and, alas, a couple were simply awful.  Delrio's efforts are definitely right up there with the very best. With Delrio and Coleman writing more novels in the new series, I have hopes some good reading is in store for us.<br />An excellent entertainment, and I highly recommend it.oves without mercy and without regret.

The palace intrigues and political maneuverings of the elves take up much of the first half of the novel.  One keeps being more and more impatient wanting something-- anything-- to happen.<br />There's a real lack of originality and surprising imagination that has always been the forte of these novelists.<br />I will say this-- the last 100 pages of the book, which take place as characters search for the &quot;gate between worlds&quot; in subterranean caves, is gripping and a masterful accomplishment of suspense and -- yes -- even terror.  But it comes on too late to really save the novel.<br />My comments up to this point may also suggest another flaw-- a great unevenness.  A few episodes in the book are up to the standards we came to expect in this series.  But alas, they are just a few oasises in a desert of flatness and mundane fiction.<br />Sorry-- the first two books in the series were better.  A number of years have passed between the second and third books of this series.  Maybe the writers put the project on the shelf too long, and just couldn't recapture the magic.<br />There are better books by these authors.  Spend your book budget on those.<br />Pat Callahan	2003-08-16

It is certainly ahead of amateurish efforts like \\"the Ruins of Power.\\" In DelRio's novel the descriptions are fresh and show a flair for fresh images, the characters are genuinely interesting and make sense, with sensible and believable motivations, and the books' \\"straight-ahead\\" plot draws us forward to learn the fate of Northwind.<br />In case anyone cares, the title is taken from a line in Shakespeare's Hamlet.  Much of the book's fascination comes with the clash of two well-drawn woman characters-- Anastasia Kerensky, who is also known as Tassa Kay, and Tara Campbell, the beautiful Dutchess of Northwind.  The character of Tassa Kay comes forward from another \\"Mechwarrior: Dark Age\\" novel entitled \\"Call to Duty.\\"  She was the most interesting character in that novel, and she loses little of her luster here.  Tassa/Anastasia is a warrior, but also a rather hot number with a flair for passionate, extracurricular love affairs.<br />Since I really enjoyed this book, I will very much look forward to the second and third volumes of the trilogy.  Yup, that's right-- this is the first book of a 3-volume trilogy.<br />Probably the trilogy structure accounts for one of the greatest faults of \\"A Silence in the Heavens,\\" which is the lame, unsatisfying ending.  It is more a hiatus than a true ending, since the writer is priming us for the second novel.<br />It probably should be mentioned that the book well balances \\"palace intrigue\\" against battle action.  Two major battles are portrayed in detail as the author skillfully incorporates several points of view -- an infantryman's view, a tank commander's view, a mechwarrior's view, and the supreme commander's view.  Some readers have complained about particular BattleTech novels as being starved for action scenes-- they will surely be satisfied with \\"A Silence in the Heavens.\\"<br />A good book.

It combines a nice balance of \\"palace intrigue\\" and guns-blazing action.<br />We follow the strategies of the Steel Wolf clan's commander, Torrent, who is trying to take over the planet for his clan.  Also, the conflict is heated further by the meddlings of a kind of private army called the \\"Swordsworn.\\"  These Swordsworn pretend to be defending the Republic, but they have a hidden agenda that is self-serving, and a raw grab for power.  Then last, there is the planet's native government, trying to defend against these factions.<br />All these intrigues explode into conflict, and they result in hot action at a number of points in the book.  But as in many of these books, bullets alone cannot solve the problem.  Raul and the planet's defenders have to unravel the skein of entangled betrayals and loyalties.  In the end, strategy and craftiness by Raul and his friends prevail where bullets alone have failed.<br />Another fascinating character is Tassa Kay, a beautiful and mysterious woman who flirts with Raul repeatedly.  She is also a master mechwarrior.  Her Ruyken mech is a fascinating ride for a fascinating pilot.  Bring her back in future novels, please!<br />The book's protagonist, Raul, is a kind of futuristic \\"Horatio Alger\\" -- the poor \\"loser\\" who makes good and prevails. Raul is a failure who has \\"washed out\\" from military cadet training.  But with the onset of a war, and because of several extraordinary happenings, he winds up piloting one of the planet's few battlemechs.  And piloting it very well-- turns out that Raul is a \\"natural\\" -- a gifted mechwarrior.<br />Every aspect of this book deserves praise.  The descriptions, the characters -- who seem sympathetic and real -- and the plotting.  As for the \\"Dark Age\\" setting of the current battletech books-- I am still groping to understand it, but am willing to give it a chance.  I do wish the editors would include more graphics such as drawings or maps.  The maps that are supplied seem wrong somehow.  One cannot find some of the very planets that are key to the story.  Are these old graphics that were dragged out of someone's drawer, rather than commission new graphics?<br />There are some \\"dumb\\" errors in dates.

There are a few other inconsistencies or errors of detail that suggest the copy editing is pretty thin at the publisher's.  However, these books are not Shakespeare-- they are intended to meet a popular demand and probably go through the publishing cycle pretty rapidly.  So we can live with it.<br />Some of us have read a number of Loren L. Coleman novels during the years that BattleTech novels have been coming out.

Yet throughout the book he adheres to a childlike pacifism, even when mobs are killing hundreds of innocent people.  A real person with such a background could hardly adhere with such stubbornness to such a ridiculous policy.<br />As has been said elsewhere, the battle scenes are perplexing because characters are worried about the possibility of \\"collateral damage,\\" and refuse to fire -- they are just big, lumbering targets.<br />Even the arch-villain, a witch-like woman, is trying to take over the planet to give it to the Steel Wolves clan.  This is because her mother was raped by a Steel Wolf warrior-- resulting in a fanatical loyalty to the Steel Wolf clan in this woman.  Wha?  Yes, it's patently improbable.  Too much of this very sort of far-fetched motivation -- or lack thereof -- starts to make the novel seem ridiculous.<br />As a final example-- A powerful official visited the planet, learned about the rioting and chaos, and then left in his ship.  At a key moment late in the novel, this same official inexplicably returns, just a few days after he departed.  He brings an Atlas battlemech, which he gives to one of the factions.  Characters ask, \\"why did he return?  He just left, didn't he?\\"  This is never explained.<br />There are a few good things in the book.  Some of the characters seemed interesting.  The description of the Palace of Facets, which becomes the setting for much of the novel, and the way the museum offers tools of war for desperate characters, these are a few qualities which somewhat mitigate the deep flaws in the book.<br />On balance, however, not worth your trouble.

Archer Christifori is a retired war hero, leading a quiet little military reserve unit.  Because of increasing tensions, the empress Katherine Steiner sends a military force to Archer's planet under command of a Col. Felix Blucher.  These two men are essentially honorable.  They start out on good terms.<br />However, the proverbial worm in the apple is a scheming and self-centered character named Leutenant Luther Fisk. Fisk is a subordinate officer under Blucher's command.  Fisk's father is a real big-shot who is quick to run interference for his son. Col. Blucher soon finds himself unable to discipline Fisk.  Fisk defies his commander, gets punished, and just calls his dad to get out of it. This happens several times. Blucher is helpless. As Fisk begins to realize he is beyond his commander's control, his behavior gets more and more reckless and violent.  Soon civilians are being gunned down in the streets by Fisk's men.<br />Fisk's wild-card antics soon set Archer at odds with Blucher.  In particular, one rash action of Fisk's results in the death of Archer's only remaining relative, his sister. This cannot be forgiven.  Before long the autocannons are chewing up armor, and lasers are blazing.<br />You guessed it.  David goes to war against Goliath.  Archer with his little rag-tag military reserve unit goes up against as much larger force of regular troops. Archer's old, worn-out hand-me-down battlemechs take on the pride of the Lyran Alliance. Like a Robin Hood of the future, Archer manages through guile and craft to outsmart Col. Blucher, who comes to look like a &quot;Sheriff of Nottingham&quot; buffoon by the end of the book.<br />The book is fun, and excellently written.  It is well plotted, and Mr. Pardoe is an old hand who has turned several fine BattleTech novels in the past.  The story has two sequels, also, for those who enjoy this book. Go on to read the next installment, entitled &quot;Operation Audacity.&quot;<br />Patrick J. Callahan/>The book is fun, and excellently written.

True, the Analects are  not complete but have been excerpted. The book cannot present more than a  sampling of Confucius' writings for obvious limitations of space.  Merits  of the book include its readability, with a long, discursive essay and some  translations provided by the celebrated scholar Lin Yutang.  The book also  contains a famous Chinese biography of Confucius, plus a few selections  from the writings of Confucius's most influencial disciples-- some of these  contemporary with Confucius and some from later times.<br />I could not help  noticing prior reviews that deal harshly with the book.  Some of the  criticism will not be meaningful to the nonscholarly reader, who, for  example, would not be offended that the &quot;original numbering&quot; of  the Analects has been abandoned.<br />Selection of the writings has been most  judicious.  For example, the book contains &quot;On the Great  Learning,&quot; and &quot;On Education.&quot;  To obtain all these  well-chosen sample writings of Confucius in individual editions rather than  an anthology such as this would require an entire shelf of books.<br />This  readable, clean edition will be excellent for the thoughtful person who  wants to explore across the breadth of Confucius's thought.  And despite  biting criticism in the other reviews, I found Professor Lin's discussions  of Confucius's life, thought, and cultural impact to be most helpful.<br />The  book is also a handsome little volume, and with a quality binding.  One is  proud to place it in one's library.	2000-08-24

I have read quite a few books by John Dickson Carr -- herewriting under his pen name, Dickson Carr.  I have seldom beendisappointed.<br />This book was very gripping because it pulls at the reader with two sources of tension.  First, a murderer is loose on a ship at sea. Second, a converted ocean liner is crossing the north Atlantic in waters infested with German U-boats -- during World War II.<br />Let's start with this converted passenger liner.  It has been pressed into service in 1940 to convey half a million lb. of munitions to Great Britain-- bombs, artillery shells, explosives. To save time, the liner will be crossing the north Atlantic route through waters with the most intense concentration of German U-boats.<br />In the meanwhile . . . only nine passengers ship aboard the liner.  All have reasons for taking such grave risks.  A terribly sexy woman seems to spend part of her time hoarding secrets, the other part of her time trying to have love affairs.  When she is murdered, the story really begins.<br />On the spooky decks of this largely deserted liner, a deadly killer stalks.  Is he a madman?  Is he a Nazi spy?  In the meanwhile, the liner hurtles through the pitch dark of the north Atlantic, ready at any time for a torpedo hit to turn her into a big &quot;roman candle.&quot;<br />The detective-- Sir Henry Merrivale -- emerges to restore calm to the terrified passengers, and to solve a really inventive and diabolical murder.<br />Yes, the murderer is satisfyingly evil.  Yes, the watch spots a torpedo track arcing through the sea at the big liner!<br />Lastly, the book is well written.  Carr's a master of the language.  There's a waxing love affair between the narrator -- one of the passengers -- and a mysterious and sexy young woman.  This budding passion tends to offer a little relief from the book's numbing tension.  You come to like the characters, and begin to care if they make England or not.<br />About all the tension that can be packed into a book was packed into this one.  I knocked the whole book off in a couple of days.  I couldn't stop!book was packed into this one.  I knocked the whole book off in a couple of days.  I couldn't stop!	2000-07-08

I was delighted to find such creative and imaginative touches in the book.<br />The hard sci-fi aspect has to do with a focused particle beam heading for earth from a supernova that occurred 27 years  earlier.  Earth knows it is coming, and is building a great shield out  beyond Jupiter that is 24,000 kilometers long.  It has drained Earth's  resources for decades to pay for it.  Well . . . you guessed it folks-- as  the book begins, we are just a couple of months from zero hour.  The shield  will work or fail-- Earth will survive or cook away its oceans.<br />The  pleasant surprises involve some highly inventive and delightful characters.  These include US President Celine Tanaka, a very sexy and brave female  Pres who tells us part of the story in her own words;  electronics genius  Gordy Rolfe, a vicious, murderous little dwarf who has accrued such power  as &quot;the world's richest man&quot; that he can &quot;get away with  murder;&quot; and finally, space engineer John Hyslop, an understated kind  of anti-hero who -- for all his self-depreciating ways-- is alone possessed  of the engineering genius to complete the shield in time.<br />My favorite  character, and the most fun character in the book, is this remarkable  Australian black girl.  She never had any formal education, but stole books  from an astrophysics library.  She is a supergenius-- like a young female  Albert Einstein.  Her I.Q. must be off the scale.  She alone can do the  mathematical synthesis to identify grave flaws in the shield -- and make  revelations about the TRUE nature of the particle beam.  But this little  self-educated female is truly a native savage-- combining tensor equations  with gutter-coarse language.  Combining shocking rudeness with a disarming  ingenuousness. She's a little barbaric doll, and I loved her.<br />So you get  more than you paid for-- a great hard sci-fi story, and the most inventive  and creative characters one could imagine.<br />I liked it lots-- hope you do.ventive  and creative characters one could imagine.<br />I liked it lots-- hope you do.	2000-06-27

The author can hold my  attention, and draw me from chapter to chapter. There were episodes in the  book I could not put down.  Again, she has created a weird world -- this  time on the eastern continent -- and has further developed her archon demon  as well as her evil dictator, &quot;The Prince.&quot;  Her wasteland of  death near the end is truly scarey!<br />But . . . I was a bit disappointed  comparing this book to the first in the series.  The first novel was  complete as a story-- with a beginning, middle, and end.  This just seems a  transition, albeit 650 pages of transition.  It sort of ends unresolved,  forcing the reader to purchase the third volume to see what happens.<br />The  plot is less complex and considerably more simple than the first novel, and  -- frankly -- I believe it can't support the huge number of pages.  One  wishes her editor had been a bit tougher on her, and whacked about 25  percent of the manuscript.<br />For all her strengths as a writer, she has one  irritating trait, which is to describe in narrative what a character is  feeling.  To paraphrase, she might say that &quot;Damien was deeply hurt by  what she said.  He felt pain at her words.  His anger welled up . . .  &quot;  Really, a good writer should DRAMATIZE emotion, and  &quot;render&quot; the feelings of characters in good dialog-- not stop the  book and start explaining to the reader what a character is supposed to be  feeling.<br />As with another reviewer, I have ordered the final book of the  trilogy from Amazon, hoping it is more like the Dark Sun Rising, and with  fewer of the shortcomings of When True Night Falls.  Even though I will  admit -- for all its flaws -- that When True Night Falls is good.  Just,  after the first one we have been SPOILED.  It was SO good.	2000-06-27

The plot moves smartly, and -- as in many virtual world novels -- one journeys through many landscapes and settings with the characters.<br />I enjoyed the blend of &quot;sword and  sorcery&quot; with science fiction.  The evil smells like real evil, and  evil is so powerful that sympathetic characters like Damien and Ciani are  almost overwhelmed with it.  In fact, it is almost unbelievable luck that  they survive-- or is it a kind of divine providence-- a deeper justice  working behind the daily events?<br />Perhaps the most electrifying aspect of  the novel is the &quot;devil's bargain&quot; where Damien is going against  insuperable odds, and finally decides he must have the assistance of the  world's most powerful sorcerer-- the &quot;cursed&quot; Gerald  Tarrant.<br />Gerald is an epitome of evil-- and has sealed a hell's bargain  for the gift of immortality.  He is honor-bound to assist Ciani and Damien  on their quest, and yet his evil is so manifest it begins to corrupt Damien  on the journey.<br />Damien himself realizes he has made his own  &quot;devil's bargain.&quot;  He has enlisted the help of the evil wizard  at the jeopardy of his own soul.  What's worse, Damien is a warrior priest,  and his fidelity to his religion is the very basis of his self-image and  even his magical powers.<br />The evil is evil-- very very-- and you will find  yourself drawn through this novel.  You will burn the midnight oil until  late, and be bleary-eyed at work.  But it is a great read!	2000-06-26

In this novel Wolfe finds himself in quite a different world than his familiar brownstone.  The portly detective who never leaves home finds himself stranded far from home -- a bit like the situation in Too Many  Cooks.<br />Characterization seems to shine in this early Wolfe novel.  Archie  does indeed meet Lily Rowan for the first time, as another reviewer points  out. The repartee between these two is delightful, and provides an  interesting love interest.  Wolfe -- perhaps destabilized by being  &quot;stuck&quot; in an unfamiliar setting -- is at his most autocratic,  eccentric, and unpredictable.<br />This very early Wolfe novel, first  published in 1938, has some of the freshness of other early Wolfe novels.  It was written when the character of Wolfe was still rather new to Rex  Stout.  It centers around a most peculiar crime.  I'll avoid describing  that to keep the reading experience fresh for the reader.  Suffice to say,  it is very difficult through the first third of this novel to convince the  District Attorney that a crime has even been committed!<br />Given the  excellence of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe novels, I'm only surprised that so few  are currently in print.  This book-- if it can be obtained-- is a good one  to put on your permanent shelves.	2000-03-28

Let me start out by assuring you that I'm not spoiling this story for you.  The facts I mention are in the opening pages of the book  . . . thereafter, you are on your own.<br />Who would deliberately poison a group of  school children?  This is the larger framework of the novel.<br />The main  story takes place in a sprawling rather Victorian mansion-- all Carr's  repertory of atmospheric effects.<br />Again, there's an inexplicable crime --  only a motive is missing.  How could anyone profit from these crimes?  There's also a person accused who's possibly innocent.<br />Carr not only  presents the conventional mystery, with a number of suspects and --  initially -- no clue to the enraveling.  He takes the reader on a tour of  the murderer's mind.  Carr discusses through the voices of his characters  some of England's most diabolical murderers.  Through the voice of his  chosen detective, the obese and eccentric Dr. Gideon Fell, an exploration  is made of at least six infamous poisoners.  What motivated them?  Can it  apply to the present case?<br />As other reviewers have stated, the plotting  is meticulous.  Every detail is considered.  The conclusion is very  consistent with the presentation.<br />I will say this-- the book proceeds  slowly.  There's limited action.  The book seems designed for readers with  an analytic turn of mind.<br />As I recall, the novel was written in 1941.  It is definitely an &quot;old classic.&quot;<br />Personally, I thought it was  well worth the price.	2000-03-27

This is not easy-- his books are very old and only Amazon provides a good  source.<br />This is one of the very best by Carr.  What draws me to Carr is  the mastery of mood, tone, and atmosphere-- a brooding, semi-supernatural,  atmosphere of the Gothic-- of terror, of raw fear-- of people literally  frightened to death.  To put it crudely, it's like &quot;Sherlock  Holmes&quot; meets &quot;Stephen King.&quot;<br />In this novel we have a  fabulous beginning with an &quot;impossible murder&quot; that seems to have  no explanation, a &quot;femme fatale&quot; woman, the setting of a ruined  Norman tower in France, and a most sympathetic leading character, Miles.  Dr. Gideon Fell is a colorful and delightful detective who usually enters  the story at least a third into the book.<br />Frankly, the conclusions  sometimes let the reader down -- or seem to -- because Carr's skill at  &quot;atmosphere&quot; has got the poor fellow so on the edge of his chair  with anxiety that no ending could totally meet the expectations.<br />This  book-- like many Carr books -- has a neat love interest-- a totally  improbable love between a convalescent British gentleman and a French  &quot;woman of the streets.&quot;  The love interest alone drew me through  some of the chapters.<br />Carr's style and descriptive skills are excellent.  He will describe a setting with original turns of phrase.  He will paint  word-pictures that force one to reread the paragraph more than once,  savoring the writer's skills.  He's a highly literate man with a control of  English that would have made him successful in writing more conventional  novels.<br />This is probably the best Gideon Fell novel I have read, and one  of the two or three best novels by Dickson Carr I have read.  I urge you to  enjoy the book, and wish you, er, &quot;unpleasant dreams.&quot;uot;	2000-03-19

This book, like many by John Dickson Carr, has a powerful gothic element--  a sense of fear, dread, and doom that draws the reader into the book.  I was impelled to read this entire novel in little more than 24 hours.<br />The  book gets off to a rapid, fast-paced start and does not slow down.  In some  ways, the first half of the book was more gripping than the conclusion.  While the crimes are ingeniously solved, they are almost too contrived.  Carr almost goes too far in forcing us to see how every tiny detail  thoughout the book was &quot;in line&quot; with the denoument.<br />The  characters were well developed, and the evil characters seem to be Carr's  forte.  There's also a love interest in the book, and the sense of a loner  protagonist going up against enormous odds.<br />Generally speaking, I liked  the book and feel I got my money's worth.

The Federation forces have fought the Bugs to a stalemate.  Both sides have taken fearsome losses.  The Bugs have retreated to lick their wounds and rebuild their fleet.  The Federation  forces (including humans) are hoping for a year -- or better, 18 months--  to replace their losses-- a full 40 percent of their total naval tonnage  before the onset of this war.<br />There's no question to me at least that a  sequel was originally planned.  Important threads of the story also simply  &quot;end&quot;-- the survey squadron that gets lost in a series of  unmapped jumps, for example.  The authors just seem to forget about this  thread totally.<br />There are also numerous hints that the Federation forces  do not understand the Bugs-- what motivates them.  Numerous hints are  thrown out-- some very blatant -- that the Federation will not achieve a  breakthrough in this war until they come to &quot;understand&quot; the  Bugs.  Admirals keep saying after each battle, &quot;what motivates them?  What drives them?  Why do they do such things?&quot;  Given this constant  teaser throughout the book, I'm SURE the authors planned to eventually  sketch in for the readers the weird psychology of the Bugs--  bring them  &quot;up close and personal,&quot; if you will.<br />If a sequel comes out, I  would love to read it.  However, as one other reviewer said, it has been a  full two years since &quot;In Death Ground&quot; was published.  There's  not only no sequel, but the publisher has not even thrown out any hints  that one is coming.<br />Many things could have happened, including a falling  out between Weber and White, health problems of the authors-- who knows?  However, we may be in a spot where no sequel IS EVER going to come out.  I'm SURE one was originally planned, or maybe even a trilogy.

I purchased this book in part on the strength of three 5-star reviews on this site.  This is a very handsome hardcover volume at a surprisingly reasonable price.<br />There are three classifications of stories in the book.  First, stories primarily written by Adrian Conan Doyle, with some input  from JD Carr.  Second, two stories written almost entirely by Mr. Carr,  possibly with some slight input from Doyle.  Third, six stories written  solely by Mr. Adrian Doyle.<br />Since I have read a number of mysteries by  Carr, and expected much, I was most disappointed to find his two stories  the weakest in the book.  In one instance, after reading the first page I  was able to anticipate the entire plot.  In the other case, I simply found  the story flat, uninteresting, and narrowly derivative of similar stories  in the original Holmes canon.<br />To the contrary, some of the stories by Mr.  Doyle cannot be praised enough. One that's typical, &quot;The Adventure of  Foulkes Rath,&quot; seems up to the work of Arthur Conan Doyle himself. All  in all, Adrian Doyle admirably captures the style and brooding Gothic tone  that so typifies many of the best stories in the original Holmes canon.  Moreover, Adrian Doyle's stories have a kind of life and warmth that brings  the Edwardian world alive for the reader.<br />I would give the book five  stars were it not for a few tales that seem off the pace, and decidedly  inferior to the others.  Alas-- and surprisingly-- these are from JD Carr's  pen.  Perhaps Carr tried too diligently to write an impeccably logical  mystery, where nothing in the denoument was not well provided for in the  early story.  The effect, unfortunately, was to create a mechanical kind of  plot, which made it all to easy for the reader to anticipate too accurately  the entire unfolding of the story.<br />So in this interesting and generally  worthwhile book of tales, we might have the amateur outwriting the old  master.<br />All in all, a worthwhile purchase -- and handsome book with great  bedtime reading at a very reasonable price.hase -- and handsome book with great  bedtime reading at a very reasonable price.	1999-09-05

I have read a number of others, but most of the best are in the past.  I'm delighted that a talented writer has gotten his teeth into this series, and hopefully can continue to  breathe life into it.<br />The personalities were developed very well for an  action novel.  As well as we could ask.  Hector's personality came alive as  his &quot;blocks&quot; were slowly removed, one by one, and his real  personality emerged.<br />Battle scenes were gripping, and they were abundant.  You got to really care about the characters, also.  The ambiguous ending  makes us wonder if William Keith is planning a sequel.  I hope so.<br />One  theme that unifies the book and adds a bit more than just the  &quot;thriller&quot; aspect is the exploration of &quot;machine  intelligence.&quot;  The aliens are machines also, and the contest is not  just based on gunfire, but on whether Hector's mental processes can  &quot;checkmate&quot; the alien thoughts of the /*/*/*/, as the invaders  call themselves.<br />David Drake's books are great, but he has totally  stopped writing future war novels.

I've noted that some other reviewers did not like this book.  Actually, I was very satisfied with it.  One of my favorite characters, little Nkima, the monkey, has a prominent place in this book.  The book also has pretty  women, savage tribes, and a very spooky and decadent lost city, which is a  setting for much action.<br />Some have criticized the new author's style.  However, Burroughs himself writes a kind of very dense, 19th century style  which makes it very hard for me to recommend Burroughs to teenagers.  Unless they want to keep encountering unfamiliar five-syllable Latinate  words, and 80-word complex sentences.  Let's fact it, EGB wrote some pretty  dense stuff.  Lansdale's style is cleaner, and is more typified by short,  direct sentences.  The description is good, and the mood is well controlled  by Lansdale.<br />I did think this book is more bloody and graphic in its  violence than the original EGB Tarzan books.  Tarzan always killed to  defend himself or rescue &quot;drop dead&quot; girls, but the graphic  details added by Lansdale are a bit grim at times.<br />I did feel the bad  guys through the early book were not bad enough.  They just seemed to be  violent military deserters with no sinister or evil plans except to steal  another safari's supplies.  They are just foils, really.<br />I like Tarzan's  new personality.  He has a times a biting wit, expressed in the laconic few  words that we would expect of him.<br />The writing surrounding the airplane  crash and the &quot;sparks&quot; between the surviving passengers-- these  seemed excellent writing.<br />If Mr. Lansdale writes more Tarzan books, I  will buy them for sure.  Alas, this was originally published in '96, and  apparently nothing more has come out.  So perhaps there will be no more  Tarzan left to read.<br />By the way, another reviewer said he has read  &quot;everything Burroughs wrote.&quot;  Well, I've read all the Tarzan,  Barzoom, and Pellucidar novels at least twice, so I guess I'm well-informed  also.<br />Try it-- you'll (probably) like it!guess I'm well-informed  also.<br />Try it-- you'll (probably) like it!	1999-05-06

The only problem with pairing these two Tarzan titles is that they are too similar.<br />Both involve lost kingdoms, one medieval and the other Roman.<br />Both involve two warring cities or kingdoms at opposite ends of a  valley, and the strife between them.<br />Both involve &quot;gosh &amp;  golly&quot; that enduring civilizations from the distant past still live on  in Africa.<br />However, this is not intended as sarcasm or criticism.  These  are each in their way excellent stories.  Tarzan, particularly in  &quot;Lost Empire&quot; shows a lot of knowledge and research of ancient  Rome.<br />One of Tarzan's most sympathetic roles is as the rescuer of  friendless, lovely females, and he has his hands full in fulfilling this  mission in each of these novels.  He also becomes the defender of the  downtrodden.<br />Descriptions are good, and in each book Burroughs sets out  to create -- chapter after chapter -- living, imaginary worlds peopled with  interesting characters.

Usually the details, characters, and descriptions are interesting enough  that we don't resent this rather unimaginative trait.<br />However, these two  novels are so close in plot, I'd recommend readers buy the pair, read one,  and then go back to read the second after some intervening books have been  read.	1999-05-06

Burroughs' love interest is passionate, but  &quot;clean&quot; in language and not objectionable for youths with an  enthusiasm for adventure and fantasy.<br />Burroughs always has a surfeit of  what Aristotle called &quot;invention.&quot;  His stories are wildly  imaginative, and at times, very original.  His monsters are really scary,  his villains are wicked as sin, and his ladies, who the book's hero tends  to rescue, court, lose, and rescue again, are downright stunning in beauty.  His female characters are also surprisingly &quot;modern.&quot;  They are  spunky, peppery, and have a mind of their own.  Surprisingly, both the  protagonist and the heroine emerge as pretty well realized characters,  despite the action packed plots which leave little room for any sort of  formal &quot;character development.&quot;<br />If this particular book has a  shortcoming, it may be too many chapters wandering through secret tunnels  and subterranean passageways.  Some of this is okay, but after 150 pages of  this, the reader begins to get cabin fever.<br />A good read.  One of the  better Burroughs Mars (&quot;Barsoom&quot;) novels.	1999-02-13

Again, I'm not disappointed.<br />The story involves a young adventurer named David Innes who decides to accompany an elderly professor on a test drive of an  &quot;iron mole.&quot;  This drilling machine is intended to penetrate the  earth in search of minerals.  However, something goes wrong.  The controls  break, and the iron mole plummets straight down for hundreds of miles, to  break through into an &quot;inner earth.&quot;<br />This world is inhabited by  dinosaurs, primitive tribes, and a race of evil bat-like creatures called  Mayars.  David must rescue a stunningly beautiful young woman, who's  completely stolen his heart.  But more, he must somehow end the dominance  and exploitation the Mayars exert over the primitive humans in this  world.<br />At the time this book was written, before 1920, there were serious  treatises being written about the possibility that our earth was hollow,  with an inner world to be discovered.  Burroughs apparently just  capitalized on this now out-of-date scientific notion.<br />The Mayars are  terrifying, the girls are fantastic, and there's a nonstop series of action  scenes.  The friendships David makes with various prehistoric warriors are  well drawn.  For an episodic adventure novel, the characters are made real  enough that the reader really CARES what happens to them.<br />This is the  first of the Pellucidar novels.  There were at least six, I believe.  Pellucidar is what Burroughs called the inner world within the heart of the  earth.<br />The language is clean-- the book could be recommended to young  people with no concerns at all.  In fact, teens -- or the young at heart --  are the prime audience for these fine adventure books.	1999-02-13

But ironically, it's a paradise that soon turns into a kind of  violent warring hell.  The plant men are only the beginning.  The bitterest  enemies are a race of almost diabolical priests, the Tharns, who set loose  white apes and plant men to slaughter thousands of religious pilgrims.  I'm  not spoiling the plot at all, since this becomes clear in the first two or  three chapters.<br />Again, there's a deep bond between the hero, John Carter,  and a brave and stunning young woman named Thuvia.  John Carter, a warlord,  is not content to merely escape.  He must somehow end this evil empire of  hypocritical priests and mass slaughter.<br />One fine element is the  reintroduction of the green warrior chieftan, John's dear friend from the  first novel in the series.<br />There are strains of deeper thought woven  throughout.  For example, the biting satire against mindless  &quot;fanatic&quot; religions.<br />Heck of a book.  Burroughs writes in a  style that would seem a bit heavy today.  But after a chapter or two, the  reader usually can get in the stride.  These books read fast-- you can't  put them down.  The heroines are GORGEOUS-- but the language is  &quot;clean&quot; and the books can be recommended for teens.  The  description-- often in battle scenes-- is up to anything written in  adventure science fiction today.  This book was written-- amazingly-- in  about 1917.	1999-02-13

Of course, you have to make allowances for the writer's style-- the book was written in the late 1920's. Synthetic  Men had some of the best (scariest) monsters and one of the best plots of  the eleven Burroughs Barzoom (Mars) novels. Ras Tharvas, the wicked  scientist, is always a hoot.  But the story has a serious tone as a young  man in love is desperately trying to save his sweetheart from a terrible  fate  -- marriage to a Hitler-like emperor-criminal.  He becomes a monster  to reach her and save her, but she's terrified of him, naturally.  How he  works all this out, stymies the wicked guys, and gets the girl, is quite a  heck of a read!	1999-01-29

The Airship is a kind of dirigible.  Remember, this is before the Wright Brothers' flight. Old as these books are, they are full of thrilling adventures and most engaging  characters.  Huge numbers of these books were sold, partly because they are  gripping and well done. In this book, Tom's souped up zepplin helps him and  his friends to escape trumped up, false charges for a bank robbery--  actually committed by others.  Tom also meets a sweetie girl-friend when  his dirigible temporarily goes out of control and crashes into the roof of  her school! The characters are a real treat!  Fun, odd, colorful, and  wonderfully drawn. Great gift for a young person.  I believe this is a  handsome facsimile of the 1910 edition.	1998-12-10

The book's still a darn good read.  Stolen patents, a villainous criminal gang, and Tom's genius in  reworking a used motorcycle into the fastest machine on the road. This book  is, I believe, a facsimile reprint of the original edition of this most  interesting 1910 volume. Try it, you will like it.

This fine facsimile of a classic 1910 boys' adventure book would make a beautiful gift.  Young people up to about age 14 would love it. Tom discovers a secret tunnel dug by criminals to access Swift Enterprises  grounds and steal his secrets. He soups up a motorboat to get double the  original speed.  At one point, he fights for his life as he tries to  outrace a boat full of gunmen from a criminal gang. Tom is kidnapped and  imprisoned, but escapes. The style is lucid, simple, and clean for young  readers. The setting of 1910 adds an exotic quality to today's readers.  These were the best-selling boys books of all time, with possible exception  of Hardy Boys. Your son or grandson would love it.  In a beautiful reprint  of the original edition.	1998-12-10

The title character has no real role in the book.  We look for this lady for 200+ pages, but when we  find her, there's nothing there.  The setting, characters, and dialog are  excellent.  But the book spins out of control.  The last 75 pages wind the  plot so over-complex, I began losing track of who was who and what linked  to what.  I suspected a kind of &quot;set-up,&quot; also as I approached  the conclusion.  Betty, the title character, had been kept as a kind of  slave for many years-- a sex slave, really.  The oppressor was a wealthy  white man, respected by the community.  The author injected numerous  comments to the effect, 'that's the way it always is, a black person  enslaved by whitey.&quot;  Was I reading an allegory, or watching the  author spin out his own social resentments? I had mixed reactions.  I've  seen the film version of &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress.&quot;  It was  excellent.  I am not sure &quot;Black Betty&quot; would make a good film  without major editing.	1998-12-10

Carr wrote during a classic  time of American mysteries, and it's reflected in his well-tuned plot and  ample clues.  You CAN solve this one if you read carefully.  There are  some wonderful innovative &quot;turns&quot; such as the dead who are NOT  dead, and the kidnapped who are NOT kidnapped . . .  I will say no more  lest I spoil it for anyone. If you love &quot;spooky&quot; mysteries, you  will love this one. It's a real pleasure to see these classics still in  print.	1998-10-25

John Dickson Carr is a great mystery writer from the era of Ellery Queen  and other masters. This book involves a murder that takes place on a tennis  court-- the wire mesh fencing around the court is the &quot;wire cage&quot;  of the title. This is one of those murders which &quot;could not possibly  have been committed&quot; but was. The riddle type mystery involves  interesting characters who have all sorts of dynamics going-- passionate  love, old hatreds, rivalries, and so forth. If you like the sort of mystery  that challenges you to identify the killer, this one's for you. It's great  to see some of these classics in print.	1998-10-25

A huge fleet is assembled, with dozens of  ships, including transports and the Inner Core's best warships.  Even some new Frigates built using recaptured Star League technology.  But most chilling and impressive is the emergence of a 300-year-old Star League battle cruiser-- it had been hidden and hoarded for centuries by Com Star for just such a grand and glorious battle. By far the largest warship in the fleet, and probably the largest in space for that era.  Wow!  There is one naval engagement with a Ghost Bear fleet, to whet our appetite for action, but the REAL action is building toward the sequel.  Think of this novel as &quot;Part 1.&quot;  Here's good character building, good plot, and good action.  Helps forget the stasis and total lack of action of the preceding volume in this series.  The Hunters is highly recommended ! ! !	1998-01-22

This novel was a deep disappointment.  It was not unexpected that political maneuvering among the princes of the star empires, such as the Steiner-Davions or the Kuritas, would be important in the opening chapters of the book, since such exposition usually sets the stage for the story.  However, in Grave Covenant, the talk never stops and the action never starts.  As of page 180, nothing has happened except endless conferences and endless political maneuvering.  In the second major section of the book, I expected battles and action would begin.  Still nothing happens.  The only difference is that the endless talking occurs on a jumpship, not in palaces.  I consider this book almost unreadable.  It is deadly dull.  I love the Battletech novels, but suggest that some of the others are better reads.	1998-01-11

It's as though the author just stopped writing.  Little is resolved.  On the whole, though, the book is rich and beautifully written.  Again, Simak takes American small town life and fills it with strangeness and wonder.  Originality is so apparent-- in so many ways.  For instance, who could imagine that some flowers growing by the roadside, transplanted into the garden by an old man, become a window to communicate with the stars?  Read it, you'll enjoy it.  And you may wish, like me, that it had a better ending.	1997-11-12

Half the fun of the book is the unlikely partnership of these characters.  I especially liked the very tough young woman who had been banished from the Steel Viper clan.  She was tough as nails, never softened up a bit-- but she was deadly in a mech, and she was very sexy!.  Picture this book as an interplanetary &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; who take on the worst of the bad guys. The Star Lord is a total dirtbag whom you love to hate.  He is a deadly danger to the Inner Sphere unless stopped.  And these five turkeys manage to stop him!  A book that was great fun to read.

However, the last 120 pages represent really excellent  writing.  The Caballeros gamble it all to take a planet.  The battle action mounts and builds.  Now suddenly the plot is clear and the description brings the huge battle to realistic, picturesque life.  Some of the best battle action of any Battlemech novel.
