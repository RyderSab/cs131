US	50503261	R1NAUEOE1RVTJ4	0415969980	169039682	Lost in the Grooves: Scram's Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed	Books	3	8	16	N	N	+1/2 -- Some gems, some impossible rarities, some overwritten reviews	This anthology scores the same high-points and suffers the same problems as a good anthology or tribute album. On the up-side, the concept (music folks writing about their favorite unknown, neglected or currently overlooked albums) is a winner. Also in the plus column are many of the recommended albums, and several of the writers (including reruns of vintage 1970s pieces from Creem, Phonograph Record, and Flash).<br /><br />In the cons column, the writing is inconsistent, including some terrifically overworked copy. The picks often range into albums of incredibly marginal interest or complete inaccessibility. The editors would have done well to drop essays on obscure vinyl-only releases, as most readers are only going to be frustrated by their lack of availability.<br /><br />The book's theme is often more compelling than the execution. Motivating readers to reappraise Adam & The Ants' \\"Kings of the Wild Frontier\\" - absent its original media hype - is a worthy cause, as is the championing of favorites by David Allan Coe or Swamp Dogg; but essaying obscure '70s Yiddish or ukulele albums is more of a hipster parlor trick than a really useful review. The same could be said for Dolly Parton's incredibly rare (and unreissued) first LP or mid-period Frank Sinatra Jr. albums; they appeal more as a tour through the collected authors' record libraries than useful leads.<br /><br />It would have been helpful if the editors had taken the time to research the current (or recent or historical) CD availability of these selections, and provided that information as margin notes or an appendix. Thanks to Al Gore's Internet, you can track down some of this information yourself (including CDs available on e-tail, via reissue labels, in the secondary auction market, etc.), but knowing what's been reissued in the first place would be a big help. 3-1/2 stars if allowed fractional ratings.

Unfortunately the authors rarely deliver the reader inside the temples themselves. Instead, they spend an inordinate amount of text rehashing introductory material about artists, songs, labels, musical genres and scenes. It's not necessarily uninteresting, but it leaves readers in the lobby, rather than actually taking them into the studio.<br /><br />Worse, the writing is hugely uneven. The chapter on Atlantic is just that, a chapter on the Atlantic label, with tidbits about the studios they used. The chapter on Columbia, on the other hand, does a nice job of communicating the label's producers' emotional attachment to their studios. The text itself ranges from well-written to hyperbolic (\\"It is indisputable: there is no one label that had as much impact on the development of rock from the 1950s to the 1970s as Chess.\\") and overly clever (\\"Everyone wanted in, and the [Chess] brothers, refashioned as record men, kept adding more pawns to the Chess set.\\").<br /><br />What this book does accomplish is a grounding of hit songs at their physical points of creation. It untangles the juxtaposition of Top-40 radio and strips away the music industry's placelessness by re-contextualizing songs with the writers, producers, engineers and musicians who created them. Who knew that Eric Clapton's \\"Layla\\" was recorded in Florida, within the same studios that reverberated with Hank Ballard's \\"The Twist,\\" The Eagles' \\"Hotel California,\\" and The Bee Gees \\"How Deep is Your Love?\\"<br /><br />The book's photos provide intimate views of studios in use (not to mention, under construction), it's a shame that the accompanying text isn't as fully detailed on the technical and artistic inner-workings of these \\"temples of sound.\\"	2005-05-12

While others had fleeting commercial success or labored in record-collector obscurity, Elektra managed to maintain its artistic roots  as it found its way up the top-40 charts. Label founder, Jac Holzman, and co-writer Gavan Daws re-tell the music industry's transformation to a conglomeratized business through the prism of Elektra's emergence in Greenwich Village folk clubs to its absorption into the WEA triad.<br /><br />Holzman's first-person reminiscences are brilliantly interwoven with interviews from many of those who were there, providing additional shades to many of the story's events. The first half of the book is particularly fetching, following Holzman as he founds his label amid the folk revival of the early '60s, and makes up business practices to match his feel for the art and artists. Also of great reward are Holzman's tech-rich descriptions of equipment and recording sessions. Less incisive is Elektra's flight into the arms of Warner Brothers, no doubt reflecting Holzman's relative disinterest in the business of music.	2005-04-29

Even more pleasing are the numerous \\"easter egg\\" details planted in the peripheries of the pages - the mice that rule the cat, the flag-waving lizards at the imaginary race, the recurring planes and birds in flight, and much more. Even very young children will enjoy playing \\"what's that?\\" or \\"where's the ladybug?\\" with Dollak's detailed, colorful pictures.<br />The story of Frannie's relationship with her dog Pickles will appeal to young ones as an engaging, silly story of role-reversal; those children who've taken a turn at the family pet's water dish will no doubt find a certain amount of confirmation here. At the same time, older children will find valuable underlying social ideals, such as treating others as you'd like to be treated, and imaging yourself in someone else's place, all couched in a clever and engaging context.<br />Did I mention the pipe smoking, hat-wearing squirrels?

As the company's creative director (he was the mind responsible for Warner's two-LP samplers in the 1970s, and the twisted copy with which they and other releases were advertised), Cornyn had a keen eye for the people and forces that shaped the label's growth, and its eventual fall.<br />Together with co-writer Paul Scanlon, Cornyn is truly engaging as he discusses the label's early history as an offshoot of the movie studio, and the numerous tributaries (artists, producers, label heads, subsidiary and sister labels) that flowed into its eventual success. The arc traced by the record business from the late 50s (when studio head Jack Warner decided it was time for the studio to try the record business again) through the early part of this century is a fascinating path of continual reinvention. Cornyn's story takes in the rise and fall of 45s, LPs, independently programmed radio stations, syndicate-like consulting, not to mention numerous well-known artistic and corporate personalities. He even covers the beginnings of the industry's current battle with file downloading and swapping.<br />The chapters discussing Warner's merger with Time-Life, and the resulting culture clashes and misplayed opportunities are fascinating. It's too bad that Cornyn retired before he could chronicle the subsequent Time-Warner merger with AOL. On the other hand, one might suspect that the personalities involved in the latter merger were nowhere near as colorful as the long-time record industry execs in the former.<br />This book is a fine mix of personal memoir and chronicle, written in witty prose that is surprisingly lacking in jaundice. This is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the record industry, yesterday and today.	2003-08-17

Pepper	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Interesting read about George Martin and The Beatles	While this book is ostensibly about the making of Sgt. Pepper, it's more revealing of George Martin and his view of The Beatles. The sections detailing album production (coupled with Martin's musical analyses) tend to be rather dry, and the divvying of songwriting credit provides little more than grist for the Lennon-McCartney argument mill. What turns out to be most interesting is Martin and Pearson's ability to communicate some of the feeling of the times, some of the extra-studio influences that brought the Beatles to the making of Sgt. Pepper, and subsequently led to the creation of the album.<br />With the huge number of books written about The Beatles, one could easily point to other volumes that cover some or all of this ground. But Martin had a unique position in the Beatles coterie, and though this volume is far from a tell-all, it does leverage his vantage point. It's not explosive in a way that radically redefines one's view of The Beatles or their times, but it does provide some first-hand perspective that adds shades to the ever aging picture. How much of this is accurate, and how much is shaded memory, is hard to say. Beatles fanatics may find the so-called McCartney-esque slant infuriating, but those who simply lived through times will find Martin's writing pleasantly evocative.	2003-03-25

And with a personality as strong as his, it's difficult to lay too much blame at the feet of co-writer Jerome, either. The result of their collaboration is an interesting set of anecdotes that sketch Bowen's character (you get the sense that the writing voice is largely accurate), with occasional flashes of insight, but very little real depth.<br />Bowen's life in music has been an unusually rich one. Having started out as an early rock 'n' roll musician (with Buddy Knox and the Rhythm Orchids), progressing through a career in the music industry that included reviving the careers of Dean Martin (Bowen produced &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody&quot;) and Frank Sinatra (Bowen produced &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;), and a string of successful engagements as a record company executive in Nashville, Bowen's path crossed that of numerous fascinating characters. There's an interesting story about each, but they often fail to reveal much about the acquaintance, Bowen or their relationship.<br />Bowen's post-Reprise years led him through early work with soon-to-be luminaries Don Henley and Glen Frey, but the book has surprisingly little to say about their music. His tenure at MGM provides an interesting anecdote about drop-shipping around the label's regular distribution system, but fails to discuss why. Again, interesting stories, but not particularly revealing.<br />The book really doesn't take off until Bowen arrives in Nashville. Here there are interesting insights on Bowen's studio work, his view on musicians (including an enlightening discussion of stage versus studio players), his effort to drive Nashville to digital recording, and his philosophy about constructing an album as a 40-minute performance.<br />Bowen concludes with a nicely detailed view of Garth Brooks' rise to 400-pound-gorilla status. While there are certainly other sides to the story, Bowen's rings with a lot of truth - most especially his description of how Brooks' contract demands crippled Capitol/Liberty as a label.<br />This is a good read, but given Bowen's life, it should have been a great read.ere are certainly other sides to the story, Bowen's rings with a lot of truth - most especially his description of how Brooks' contract demands crippled Capitol/Liberty as a label.<br />This is a good read, but given Bowen's life, it should have been a great read.	2003-02-27

And though he provides interesting portraiture of all three, what he really documents - using the three artists as vehicles - is the changing business of the country music industry, and by association, the broader changes wrought by and to American media and culture. It's a well-written volume, with some illuminating conclusions, fleshed out by first-hand observations the author made in and around Nashville.<br />Much has been made of Feiler's veracity, but, to a large degree, his larger theses are independent of the specifics. Brooks and Judd have each taken their digs at Feiler (the latter being more surprising, since Feiler's portrait of Judd is, ultimately, quite flattering), so one might take his biography of their lives with a grain of salt. Even so, his conclusions about Nashville's changing face, both musically and operationally, are usually spot-on.<br />The Cliff's Notes rendition of Feiler's work focuses on his portraiture of the three principals: Garth Brooks as an obsessive careerist who only finds joy during his time on stage, Wynonna Judd as the screwed-up (but ultimately triumphant) result of a screwed-up childhood brought upon her by the most heinous of mothers, and Wade Hayes as the naÃ¯f, making his way through a hurricane of market forces. By threading these three stories with history of Nashville's business, the reader sees how the threads of art and commerce have intertwined over the years, with commerce realizing a substantial choke-hold on artistry in the '90s.<br />Of particular interest is Feiler's description of the symbiosis between artists, labels and radio. The manipulations of hit single charts, the conniving for chart position (and the lurid world of not-exactly-payola that fuels it), the trading of accurate charts for those that can be \\"influenced\\" is eye-opening for those outside the industry. Feiler's discussion about various trends in country music, the rise of women signaled, in part, by the Judd's supremacy, the displacement of Wynonna by the sex-appeal of Shania, and the replacement of earlier artists by a new wave, are all very compelling.<br />The book is weighted towards reporting on Garth Brooks, which isn't necessarily a negative, since his is the most complex portrait, and Feiler finds his greatest insights in Brooks' rise and plateau. On the negative side, parts of this book were previously published as magazine articles, and there is some unnecessary repetition. The careful reader will wonder whether Feiler's editor actually read the entire book through.<br />Feiler is a fine writer, and has provided a unique portrait of Nashville through the peak of its '90s supremacy. Whether or not you believe the details he reports on his principal subjects, there's a deep ring of truth in his analyses.various trends in country music, the rise of women signaled, in part, by the Judd's supremacy, the displacement of Wynonna by the sex-appeal of Shania, and the replacement of earlier artists by a new wave, are all very compelling.<br />The book is weighted towards reporting on Garth Brooks, which isn't necessarily a negative, since his is the most complex portrait, and Feiler finds his greatest insights in Brooks' rise and plateau.

His description of the Louvins' home of Sand Mountain, Alabama -- with cultural and societal development heavily influenced by the mountain's physical isolation -- is worth the read alone. Similarly, his discussions of Sacred Harp singing and shape note music books provide a priceless introduction to some of the nineteenth-century roots of twentieth century folk and country music.<br /><br />A chronology of the Louvins' recording sessions (with detailed discussions of most every song) is neatly interspersed throughout the book, and Wolfe does an admirable job of capturing the interpersonal brotherhood that drove the act. He provides a palpable sense of how the Louvins came to fame, the setbacks (some external, some self-imposed) and hard work that created and cemented their legacy.<br /><br />This book originated as the text accompanying Bear Family's CD box set \\"Close Harmony,\\" and, unfortunately, does not include the complete discography presented in the notes. Further, having sprung from annotation, the text is often heavy with discussions of the Louvin's recordings in lieu of the artists (and those enabling the recordings) themselves. Finally, there are some rather obvious editing and factual errors (e.g., the geography of California's Central Valley and Bay Area is poorly represented) that should have been cleaned up before going to press.<br /><br />All in all, a terrific biography of one of country music's most revered (and best) harmony acts.	2003-01-01

In addition to the two icons, numerous other country acts began or expanded their stardom on the Hayride, and though Logan provides some interesting anecdotes about Johnny and Jack, Kitty Wells, Faron Young, Slim Whitman, Webb Pierce, Johnny Horton, Johnny Cash and George Jones, he never really delves into the Hayride itself.<br />His dishing on the Grand Ole Opry, while probably close to the bone, is a poor substitute for a deeper discussion of how the Hayride itself worked. There's some interesting analysis of why the Hayride kept giving up its stars to Nashville, but having been written so long after-the-fact, the of-the-moment accounts focus more on the stars than the show. One never really gets a feel for the Hayride's own arc of fame, nor the nuts-and-bolts of how the show (both stage and radio) operated.<br />That said, and even with the factual errors noted elsewhere, this is a worthwhile first-hand account of a seminal program that fostered one of the great transitional periods in country music's history.	2002-12-31

The time we wasted attempting to make up for the incomplete or incorrect descriptions was not worth the leads provided by the guide. It's unclear if these problems were the product of editing errors, or, more seemingly, issues with the writers documenting areas they hadn't actually visited. Whichever, we realized that bad information is a lot worse than having no information at all.<br />Here are two examples of misinformation contained in this guide. On page 308, the K-R Drive-In is listed as &quot;north of Roseburg.&quot; What this description doesn't point out is that it's actually 20+ miles North of Roseburg, which also makes it North of several other smaller cities (which could have been named to more exactly pinpoint the drive in's location). In fact, it's halfway between Roseburg and Eugene, which is how we finally found it from a local's directions.<br />This painful lack of precision could easily have been avoided by providing the exit numbers (rather than just the exit name) that accompany every exit on Interstate 5 in Oregon. The exit numbers are keyed to the mileage on the highway and let you quickly determine how far an exit is, in either direction, from your current location. For highways without numbered exits, mileage markers would work just as well. The omission of such directional information reduces the value of the travel guide significantly.<br />A second example of poor directions can be found on page 271. The guide states, &quot;also in the same area, past the Toketee Lake Campground, you'll find the Umpqua Hot Springs down a short trail.&quot; This is inadequate and wrong on several counts. First, there's no description of the 2-mile drive off of Highway 138 that is necessary to get to the campground. Second, there's no notation of the additional 2-mile drive on a gravel road, once you pass the campground itself. Finally, and most unbelievably, the &quot;short trail&quot; is a reasonably strenuous, very steep, 1/4-mile hike along the edge of a hill. Handrails line the route for both support and to keep you from tumbling down the hillside.<br />Like many guides, this one is full of good leads, but as these two examples demonstrate, it occasions to follow through with incomplete or incorrect information. This can leave you on the road, attempting to piece together the details you need to actually find something. And given the hilly and mountanous terrain of Western Oregon, you can't count on any sort of cel phone connectivity to help you out.<br />With the other books and maps (including the AAA Oregon Tour Book) we brought along, and our nightly visits to various websites to piece together the next day's itinerary, we were able to circumvent some of the problems with Frommer's guide. In the end, however, we were unable to trust the directions in this book, making it significantly less useful than it should have been.ort trail&quot; is a reasonably strenuous, very steep, 1/4-mile hike along the edge of a hill.

Banal, perhaps, but not boring.  The irony encapsulated in a desloate stretch of highway titled &quot;Picturesque Indiana&quot; cannot be underestimated in its appeal or entertainment value.<br />The pride displayed in entrance ways to multimillion dollar turnpikes or the cafes of motels on well-traveled tourist highways speak to a time when the connectivity of automobile travel was still miraculous.  Similarly for the cards documenting the rise of shopping centers (malls were still to come), factories, trailer courts, and all manner of 50s and 60s innovation.  It all feels quite quaint now, magnified by the editor's terrific selection of poorly composed and wackily titled cards.<br />The editor has a terrific eye for oddball cards, and the inclusion of cards that show edge wear or postmarks helps bring them to life as mail-art.  Perhaps the only negative is that the card backs were not included; a shame, given that the descriptions given there are often as good as the picture image.  I also note the peculiar insertion of blank pages here and there.<br />A must-have volume for postcard collectors, collectors of kitschy 50s/60s art, or just about anyone with an interest in the intersection of industrial and consumer arts.	2001-01-12

Eastman's dialog is simple enough for early readers to pick up words, yet complex enough to keep parents from being bored to tears on the thousandth reading. The story of a baby bird separated from its mother runs through several emotional phases (independence, discovery, loss, panic, fear, rediscovery), including the story arc's overall resolved drama, and invites children to surface and discuss their own separation anxieties. A must-have for every early reader that will turn into a book full of memories as they age.	2000-11-02

Another is that some of the text is nothing more than quotes cribbed from the liner notes of record albums.  It adds up to nothing new for those who collect and listen to this music, and fails to convey much beyond the  ephemeral album-cover marketing to those just picking up on easy listening.<br />What's missing, especially in the first 2/3 of the book, are first-hand accounts and interviews.  Virtually none of the great composers, arrangers, songwriters and musicians discussed in the book are actually interviewed.  In some cases, they have passed on, but in others, either Lanza couldn't track them down, or simply chose not to. It's a shame, because what's left reveals virtually nothing about the people behind the music.  The last 1/3 of the book, especially the section about Beautiful Music radio, provides a hint of insight, but again, falls short of providing any sort of authoritative historical account.<br />Overall, the book's structure is difficult to follow, and the lack of a discernable arc leaves the reader unmotivated. The text within the chapters is often scattered and without discernable point. It's too bad that Lanza's editor didn't do a better job of keeping the book focused, and helping him find a more readable outline.	2000-10-12

He has a tremendous sensibility about where to go (and perhaps more importantly, when to stay put), and a newsman's nose for a story. The stories that he digs up are not so much daily news, as people and places that are exemplative of small-town life, forgotten times, and the general oddities that make the world more interesting than yet another faceless mall (or Starbucks or McDonald's).<br /><br />Woodbury delights in his subjects, and in many ways, is himself the most interesting subject of his writing. His reactions and feelings (especially his musings about being a wandering journalist) are a cross between reporting and diary-writing, creating a highly engrossing blend. Among the selection in this book are stories of Bill, Wyoming (population 1), eating a plate of cow brains, waging war on chipmunks over Cheezits, sampling potato ice cream and visiting museums and attractions such as Jake the Alligator Man and Death Valley. Long out of print, Amazon can usually help you find a used copy.	2000-09-12

In  addition to intriguingly written descriptions of the museums (which make  you want to visit pretty much everything listed), address and phone  information is included. Most listings for museums in small towns also  relate the location to the nearest major city. An appendix provides web  site and e-mail address, as well.<br />The only thing missing (as in most tour  guides, alas) is a map that pinpoints where these museums are in relation  to where you are (or where you're going). But given the descriptive  directions from major cities, and the organization by major geographical  region (and then by state), it's not too hard to figure out.<br />This is one  a must-consult volume for anyone taking to the road, or visiting a new area  of the country.	2000-09-06

That is, in addition to  fairly encyclopedic information about transportation, hotels, restaurants  and attractions, it provides a good deal of useful information about how to  get the most out of your vacation.<br />For example, rather than just  providing a guide to hotels, it prefaces the detailed listing with a  section discussing the pros and cons of different accomodations.  Motel or  hotel?  Small casino or megacasino?  Downtown, the Strip or further out?  Similar help is available for picking what games to play and where to  gamble, what shows to see (and where to sit), and so on.<br />This guide  provides the sort of &quot;I wish I'd known that&quot; information you  gather on your first trip to use on your next trip. This lets you avoid  many of the common mistakes your first time out.  Obviously a lot of this  is subjective, and you won't agree with their assessments every time, but  overall their evaluations are fair, and their tips are exteremely useful.	2000-08-16

Never having played  the game above the playground level, I never really learned the roles of  different positions, and didn't understand the depth of planning that goes  into designing an offense and defense.<br />Theisman and his co-writer Brian  Tracy certainly know both the big picture and the intimate details of  football.  They've also found a clear writing style and organization with  which to make their presentation.  From the very basic rules of the game to  more complex dissertations on players' roles, play construction and  coaching strategies, the authors provide concise, useful information.  Theisman's asides about players and game history provide good context and  will enhance your appreciation of games that you watch.<br />Football experts  may not glean much from this book, but even those who've played (or play)  the game may find it useful to read up on other positions and areas.  Those  who are new to the game or just passing fans will find this to be very  educational.	2000-08-16

Still, the beauty of these trademarks and the cleverness of  their design are both a pleasure to view and and a source of inspiration.  By pulling these logos out of their sublimated context and displaying them  front and center, they turn into works of art.<br />Baker and Blik have  gathered together a wide range of logos, including some very familiar (The  Pep Boys, Zig-Zag, Elsie the Cow), and many more hopelessly obscure - but  no less fascinating. And by organizing around themes, the reader can get  some ideas as to how themeatic elements came and went with the years.<br />A  nice coffee-table or bathroom book that is also at home on a graphic  designer's bookshelf.	2000-08-16

Not only does it give you a feel  for what the road was like at the dawn of America's love-affair with  automobile traffic, but it gives you a feel for the psychology of those  pioneers who attempted to drive the Route.<br />While we're now accustomed to  well-marked Interstates with easily located on and off ramps, early  cross-country routes were less  highway and more  stitched and patched  collections of local roads, filled in with connectors and dotted with small  towns. The map was, in essence, the route itself. Following these early  routes was not trivial, and drivers had to take caution not to find  themselves stranded without food, lodging or fuel.<br />Rittenhouse's guide  was the first comprehensive effort to assuage fears of long-distance car  travel, and provide a mile-by-mile guide to services and sights along Route  66. While most of the sites (and most of the services) he documents are  long-gone, the sense of wonder that is Route 66, and the thrill of coasting  into the cities through which it threads, remains fully intact. No one  should drive Route 66 without a copy of this in the glove box. Doing so  would rob your of a good deal of the road's history.<br />Note to West  Coasters: though the book is arranged from Chicago to LA, it can just as  easily be read backwards for the Eastbound trip.	2000-08-04

The combination of  clever verse and brilliant exposition -- stretching along the wide-open  road until the punch line could be delivered -- is unlike any other ad  delivery in history.<br />Author Frank Rowsome, Jr. tells the story of the  campaign's creation and life, and provides a listing of all signs from the  first in1927 (&quot;Shave the modern way / No Brush / No Lather / No Rub-in  / Big Tube 35-c Drug Stores / Burma Shave&quot;) through their last in 1963  (&quot;Our Fortune / Is Your / Shaven Face / It's Our Best / Advertising  Space / Burma-Shave&quot;).  In between is an amazingly clever collection  of poems, including contest winners, shorter signs for smaller displays,  spin-off tooth powder and lotion jingles, and regional ads.<br />Great reading  for those remembering the signs as well as those who just want to get a  smile from some great advertising - one of the USA's most underappreciated  art forms.	2000-08-04

The result is a terrifically engrossing exploration of  life's smallest and most self-intimate moments: the breaking of a shoelace  (why one and not the other?), the drifting float of a plastic straw in a  can of soda (why do plastic and paper straws act differently?), and so  on.<br />Baker not only observes these every day thoughts running through his  head, but provides fully fleshed musings on the pathways they ride through  one's brain.  It's an amazing technical feat that provides page after page  of laughs and knowing nods. This isn't just a book of fiction with  footnotes, it's a book of fiction with footnotes that essentially supplant  the mainline text.  In doing so, they make conscious some of the ideas that  we usually consider only in the privacy of our own heads.	2000-08-02

Though this is not necessarily the book for those  wishing to get the deepest possible understanding of abstract algebra, it  is the perfect introduction for those wishing to understand enough to apply  the concepts in a computational setting.<br />Perhaps the only really  disappointing aspect of this book is that it's out of print, and that no  second edition seems to have been written.  A shame, given that many of the  concepts described within are now the foundation of probabilistic  algorithms and encryption schemes, none of which are discussed.  Still,  what is presented makes an excellent foundation for understanding the  what's and why's of these more recent applications.	2000-07-12

It's true, as another reviewer suggests, that some of the humor will fly over the head of those unknowing of 1970's politics and popular culture. But that's only part of the book. Most of the exchanges can be understood by anyone who reads carefully and ponders the subtext of ridiculousness with which the author toys. Most impressive are the series of letters in which Lazlo's fictional voice gets more and more exasperated as the replies fail to comprehend his point. The identity of who is playing the fool becomes blurrier and blurrier as corporate drones try to answer his outlandish queries. This is a milestone of American humor.	2000-05-09

Perhaps it's the introduction of Lazlo into a world in which he's already known. The  responses from correspondents who already \\"get the joke\\" make one feel as though they're peeking behind the Wizard's curtain. Still, given  the pungency of the concept and the quality of Novello's writing, this  couldn't help but be another good read. It just couldn't possibly live up to the original volume.	2000-05-09

His explanations of the cyclic weather patterns of the Bay Area, and the interactions between ocean-born events  and the coastal, Bay and mountain geographies are easy to understand.

It's good background for anyone who invests in the market, and  especially useful to anyone who works in (or with) the financial IT  industry.<br />As other reviewers have noted, the poor copy-editing is  embarassing.

And with no map to locate a city within a state's boudaries, it's  difficult to tell whether you're within a hundred miles or more. The only  solution is to employ a map (paper or web-based) to figure this out.<br />Add  to this a complete lack of addresses, phone numbers or hours, and you'll  find yourself searching through a phonebook as well.<br />It's a useful source  of ideas, but leaves the reader to do way too much of the legwork.	2000-05-06

Not only are the Sterns superb food writers (I cannot read this book without getting hungry), but they have an exquisite  sensibility for picking the very best in downscale local cuisine.  They  lead you to the places that you'd eat in several times a month, if you'd  grown up in a location, or lived there long enough to have clued yourself  in. Add exceptionally useable organization to this, and you have a 5-star  guide book.<br />Separating their reviews by region, and, most importantly,  providing maps that show the relative location within a state, they've  provided the best-possible organization.  It answers the most important  question of a hungry person: what's good to eat *near* *here*.  Rather than  having to flip back and forth from an index in the back, you can turn to  the map of the state you're currently in (or planning to visit) and  pin-point what's within driving range.<br />I've visited over a dozen of their  recommended spots, including Primati Brothers in Pittsburgh (mmm,  sandwiches with french fries and cole slaw loaded on top), and several BBQ  joints in Texas, and they've never failed to be anything less than very  good.  Most are excellent, and every one is unique and full of local  flavor.<br />Of the dozens of guidebooks I consult before travelling, this is  #1.	2000-05-05

Given that it's issued in the same size and binding, I'd always assumed it was written by Seuss.  My realization that it was written and illustrated by P.D. Eastman cleared one of my largest childhood confusions: I *loved* \\"Go Dog Do,\\" and merely *liked* \\"The Cat in the Hat.\\"  Years later I realize that Eastman's art is funny, while Seuss's is fantastic, and I prefer the former to the latter.  As another reviewer mentioned, you can stare at these dogs for a long time -- there's incredible depth to the expressions and postures of these seemingly simple illustrations.  The insomniac dog who sleeps through the next morning's reveille is a favorite! The repetitive narration is similarly hypnotic, and you'll quickly find some of the expressions creeping into your every day dialog. All in all, my very favorite childhood book, and one of the few that I still re-read a few times a year. [Â©2000 hyperbolium dot com]	2000-04-11
