However, years and years of narrow private interests have also shaped society and bred an incredible cynicism that allows so many to carry on with the institutional behavior that is ultimately shaping the world.  So yes, it's pretty obvious--incredible corporate power is going to destroy a lot of people, while enriching others.<br /><br />The background is explored, including of course, the 14th amendment, giving artificial, legal entities the power of people.  The founding fathers make their appearance and their worst nightmares--basically the USA of today--are affirmed as their vision was sold out long ago.<br /><br />As for human rights, one hopes the world allows for some lucky folks here and there to be paid attention to in between the important business of getting rich.<br /><br />Certainly sobering, it's the kind of book that will bewilder some, or simply be dismissed as oversimplying the magic of corporate power, which couldn't possibly be doing irreparable harm to the planet and its pathetic, multiplying masses of useless human capital when it's making so much money.<br /><br />Free market?  Maybe one day.	2005-08-06

Seemed like a great idea, until we fast forward to the present, and find our very lives subordinated to pathological institutions that care only about survival, with little regard for the flesh and blood people that still walk the earth.<br /><br />The 'pathological' part comes from the idea that if you psychoanalyzed a corporation as you would a person (since indeed, on paper, legally, they are the same thing) you would find yourself surrounded by a bunch of psychos who can, and will destroy you in order to meet the bottom line.  Welcome to now.<br /><br />The range of opinion in the book, as in the film, is very wide, covering Noam Chomsky, who sees corporations as monsters that want us to consume things we don't want nor need, to Milton Friedman, who figured out that since a corporation is owned by shareholders or partners, it doesn't need to give a damn about the people that live in the sphere it occupies.  This genius insight has provided the rational basis for every greedhead to walk the planet in the last few decades or so.<br /><br />Occasionally, there is a CEO out there who actions some concern about the future of the planet, and the example here is Ray Anderson, who figures prominently in the film.  Needing only a few decades or so to realize that carpet manufacturing MIGHT be harming the environment, he took steps to make his firm 'sustainable', meaning your kids will have a planet to live on.  But more often, we have institutionalized insanity like steps to claim rainwater from the sky as corporate property, trying to pull a fast one on the poor folks of Bolivia, who are not 'educated' enough to see the brilliance of this.  Or the folks of India, who think that maybe, just maybe, ownership of seeds should not be defined by corporate patents.  But what do they know?<br /><br />Not an easy book to digest for some, since the revelation that we've once again designed the gigantic gun that can blow us all away is a bit much to handle.  But there is hope, however slim.  It's in work like this that serve to educate us, if just a bit, in between Starbucks breaks at work, about the massive phenomena that shape our lives.' enough to see the brilliance of this.

Giroux examines neoliberalism as the main 'philosophy' or force that has driven the USA toward a more private society where the social contract is chipped away, job, life, and health security are weakened to strengthen authority, inequality has gone through the roof, and of course, money rules.  That it's now easier to imagine the end of the world before the end of the current strain of capitalism (which has pretty much replaced democracy) just about says it all.<br /><br />Giroux covers the erosion of public debate, where the complete corruption of terms neutralizes discussion and discourages thinking ('conservative', 'liberal', 'terrorism', etc, etc), the slow death of public space, public service, and the obsessive privatization of life, and other major phenomenon you never hear about in the news because you'd probably want to kill yourself, or do something about it.<br /><br />He's certainly not off point, if anything, he's rightfully disgusted about the state of affairs.  Where is the outrage, he asks.  As for the Bush administration, it's not new, it's just more extreme in its vision of an 'ownership society' and in the empty rhetoric of 'rugged individualism' and 'freedom from the government' that is, of course, a weapon against the common schlep who can only increase their human value by positioning themselves as profit-generators.  The poor subsidize the rich, absorbing risk while the dough pours into the same few pockets.  Everybody else can rent themselves out to whoever decides to keep jobs in the USA, where we endlessly consume while producing less and less.  And the government, well, it's this terrible, meddlesome, flabby entity that should be cut down to size because it's restricting all of us.  Unless, of course, that same government works overtime to protect the rich from the market forces that would destroy them as it bails out failing companies, enacts tariffs, and gives huge breaks to those who need it least so that we can all survive but hiring ourselves out to the same folks.  If you're lucky, maybe you can work at a nice suburban office park that your favorite credit card or cell phone company has decided to establish in your area.<br /><br />Judging by this sober assessment, the US of A is heading down the tubes, and fast.  What does one do?  The time to act is now, it seems, though our choices are fewer and fewer.  When we're all sitting in front of a computer for 8-10 hours a day doing intellectually bankrupt work for pathological institutions that threaten to toss us out because we don't fit into their Excel columns, cost too much to take care of because of a massively inefficient health care system, and are subject to huge phenomenon that nobody really bothers to address in the pursuit of cash, I guess we can all hope we're near the blast radius when mankind decides to finally blow up the world.<br /><br />Not the most cheerful book, it's a cold, hard look at what has happened to the state of democracy in the USA, and how the forces of capital have boxed and wrapped every facet of life, destroying anything the founding fathers had in mind.

It's the most refreshing and honest one, it would seem.<br /><br />Densmore comes off as more down-to-earth than the other members, and he was also the youngest of the group.  Often tired of Morrison's performance-delaying-slurring-ruining stupors, he's also the most ready to admit that he feels guilty over Morrison's death and the fact that the band didn't try harder to help an obvious addict.<br /><br />He comes off far more readable and tolerable than Ray did in his embarassing effort Light My Fire, complete with the cover of modern-Ray hugging a digital Jim.  That's to say nothing of the text itself, which was apparently written with New Age beads clutched firmly in hand.<br /><br />Densmore's account is evenly paced with personal info and Doors stories, right from the beginning of the original lineup to the final, depressing days of the band as a live outfit.  The writing is straightforward, not fancy.  There are some great photos, too.  Densmore comes across pretty well without resorting to animosity toward ex-bandmates who eventually went on tour again as The Doors without him(!)<br /><br />Still recommended, it at least has credibility amongst the plethora of Doors 'associates' accounts of 'Jimbo'.	2005-06-07

It doesn't do much for the book, and is thankfully spare.  The intro is not very useful at all, but the pictures often speak for themselves needing only a few sentences after the basic details (year, etc).  Posters range from ad-mocking pleas by artists and civilians while some is pure government PR, some of the cruder pictures evoking earlier 20th century wars.  Some are printed in English to reach foreign powers while some are in Roman or Cyrillic to appeal to the homeland.  Many are extremely creative and clever, using universal logos and symbols.  Subjects for these single-frame calls-to-arm include the slaughter of a people and a plea for attention, the fear of Islam in Europe, the fear of a Croatian-Nazi state, the uselessness of the UN, etc, etc.  There's a good cross-section of material as well and brief notes about the differents propaganda machines in each country.<br /><br />Chilling to look at the posters and think about the carnage done in their name; the more aggression ones are even darker years later.	2005-06-07

For one, he's got brains enough to publish the same book three times, rant daily on the airwaves till you think he might pop a blood vessel, and probably laugh all the way to the bank.<br /><br />The self-hatred dripping from this man is remarkable.  He's a hero to anyone who wants to direct the hatred outward in a socially acceptable fashion and write cheap, useless books about his 'conservative' rantings.  He jumps around from topic to topic, pointing out the absurdity of the world, failing to note the absurdity of a world where this man is even remotely taken seriously as a commentator.<br /><br />Sure, he touches on important topics and he blasts both sides of the fence and both parties with regards to homeland security, to terrorism, the military, education, etc.  But he soon neutralizes himself by going off the deep end in one of his now-classic rants a few moments later, using his own supply of witty little bad names for liberals or gays and basically anyone who doesn't like his version of what America should be.<br /><br />An educated, intelligent man, Savage hides the utter contempt for his audience and the world so well that he's a big star on the radio.  Congratulations.  Another great American.	2005-05-28

Books	4	13	21	N	N	Essays that , like, prove it's amazing and stuff	For the ignorant fools who didn't know what they were watching the first 168 times around, this book has essays with subtexts and subconcious imagary that will blow your mind.<br /><br />A box office failure shined to gold by looking-back critics and an army of fans, Blade Runner is now the requisite sci-fi inspiration film.  It's still a stylish but bleak, cold film and has rightfully earned its supercult status.  A lot of people responded to it in their own way.<br /><br />The book has plenty of food for thought, but it gets to be much after a while.  Authors compare the various themes in Blade Runner and use this as a springboard for ruminations on Frankenstein, feminism, film noir, you name it, Blade Runner has it.  Slave narrative, horror film, it's in there.  And there's room for an updated version as plenty of published material has appeared since this book did in the early 90s.  Recommended for the obsessed Blade Runner fan--and there is no other kind.	2005-05-26

It would be American Psycho where he would take the flat, affect-less ramblings of decadent young characters and run with it most convincingly.<br /><br />About a group of decadent, drugged, boozed, rather dim college students and their various sexual, drug, booze, and other escapades.  Told from several points of view, all of the characters are like the appalling background characters of Less Than Zero brought up front.  It begins to wear down after a while, especially with the shifting povs.<br /><br />If you like Ellis, definitely recommended.  It would take a few more years for some kind of massive depression to set in to write American Psycho, or whatever he was going through, because it gets dark.  Rules certainly sold a few more copies with a film version recently--but honestly, of all the good books out there...they option this?	2005-05-24

Just get rid of that damn brain, you don't need it.  Icke has the answer.<br /><br />This enlightened man likely noticed the amount of time people were spending in an attempt to understand how the world works, how it has changed, and how it can change through organized effort.  Looking to relieve people of the tremendous burden of being alive and thinking about the world, Icke finally penned the tome we've been waiting for.<br /><br />Yes, it has all the answers.  Pretty much.  He comes from every angle, and then, in a real coup of publishing wit, he hits us with the secret.  The world is run by another species from the fourth dimension.  A species of lizards.<br /><br />Though I strongly suspected this when I noticed Bill Clinton's tail wagging with glee during a press conference in 1994, Icke finally comes clean with the whole thing.  These lizards literally rule the planet.<br /><br />After learning these secrets, I threw away all of my books.  Don't need 'em anymore!  If anyone is interested, I'm selling my brain as well.  Used, minor wear, normal sized, pink, squishy.  I'm asking a fair price.<br /><br />One thing troubles me about the book, in fact, about all of Icke's work.  He conveniently excludes a list of the drugs he is taking, or perhaps more importantly, the drugs he has been prescribed but is not taking.	2005-05-23

Very wide in scope, this is nevertheless a pretty complete account of what the heck happened down in Houston when some very ambitious, very intelligent and driven men got together and made billions through the institutionalization of pathological scheming.<br /><br />Even if you don't have much knowledge of finance and the corporate world, this book is accessible in style and scope, and though it might send you to the Web or to a dictionary on finance to clarify what's what, it's an extremely important book.  The impact of this scandal should not be underestimated, nor should anyone sit back and think this kind of thing can't happen again.<br /><br />This follows Ken Lay from his beginnings, on to the creation of an entity called Enron, on to the entrance of brilliant but arrogant mastermind Jeff Skilling, on to the entrance of professional sleaze/accountant Andrew Fastow, on to the point where it all came crashing down and the house of cards could no longer stand, and then some.  Since trials are still pending and the smoke will not be clearing for a while, no doubt an updated version can be expected in a few years.<br /><br />This book is valuable for anyone who would like some insight into the complex world of finance, the energy business, organizational behavior and management, and frankly, anyone who is American and just might be concerned about massive, unaccountable corporate entities ripping you off while you sleep.<br /><br />Recently made into a film, the book is full of details, and well put together.  Even if you think the players are lowlifes, you might be impressed with the sheer level that the schemes were taken to.  The cynicism and greed of businessmen run amok is literally a life-threatening force in the world.n the world.	2005-05-17

I've thumbed this book in mild, introverted amusement a couple of times, but really, it doesn't tell you anything you can't find on a website out there.<br /><br />It could be that half the people you work with at your job are, in fact, introverts, and they're doing whatever you're doing.  It's not a disease, and people can adapt.<br /><br />And frankly, it's all fine and good to say 'be a writer' or 'be an artist', but that hardly helps as these are professions one rarely can plan out with any certainty unless they are in the service of something other than yourself.<br /><br />A couple of professions are suspiciously missing, though I guess they have their reasons.  Professional mercenary might be good (if you're into that sort of thing) or professional hitman, since that seems like an area you can have plenty of alone time as you trail a potential target or intimidate witnesses.<br /><br />Surprisingly, truck driver is missing, though mail service is included.

The solution is 'utlimate victory'.<br /><br />That about clears it up, as for a while I thought it was 'ultimate failure' or 'partial victory' or 'ultimate spending'.  But it's clear here that in order to succeed, we have to win.<br /><br />It's also pretty clear that the best way to achieve this goal is by going after only our most embarassing clients first.  So Saddam Hussein, while a total thug, was the easiest target, he being a third-rate dictator barely holding on.  But because of the nasty things he did in the 80s, which were fine back then, we had to destroy him in 2003.  So there's one.<br /><br />But the authors appear to be confused about some of our other clients, like Pakistan, or Saudi Arabia, for instance.  While Saudi Arabia is one of the world's most autocratic regimes, where you can't even go to a movie, they're really nice guys because we make billions on black gold.  No winning there, sorry guys.<br /><br />It's also nice to read Ollie North's intro, where he discusses how liberals screwed up and let this whole terror thing get out of control.  Despite Ollie's own involvement in a massive terror operation, it's nice to know he's still around to point out the way to 'ultimate victory'.  Also helps when you have a FOX show, and when that network helpfully plugs this book.<br /><br />Book could be worse, but let the bookstores worry about it, since they'll have to ship these babies back or just mark them down again.	2005-05-12

Something is always missing when people describe him--he was a charming but complete cynical bastardo.  One has to be impressed with the trained abiltity to just lie to people outright and make them believe it.  A man with no vision but a knack for quick power plays, the wily Slobo finally committed about fifty too many war crimes and just had to go.  He now resides in The Hague, where his high blood pressure will be the ultimate judge before the hasty four-year trial wraps up.<br /><br />Slobo sounds like a rather banal, cold dude.  His rule was hardly prosperous.  Multiple wars, sanctions, NATO bombs, refugees, massive atrocities--again, Slobo's skill is his ability to paint himself as a not-so-perfect leader who is no worse than anyone else.  The country was run into the ground and finally they just couldn't take the atrocities and burned the Parliament building.<br /><br />A very thorough account of the Milosevic years, though obviously Milosevic-centric.  More than a biography of the leader, a pretty good history book as well.<br /><br />Revised edition is inevitable.  If he survives sentencing, we can possibly expect the autobiography, in which Slobo writes his own history book.	2005-04-29

The cop has to do what he has to do to get her back.<br /><br />The real story is that this was made into a film in 1980 that is nearly impossible to find.  This thing is screaming for a DVD release.<br /><br />Where to begin?  For one, the cast.  James Brolin plays the guy who is trying to get his daughter back, looking like Christian Bale with a beard and long hair.  Dan Hedaya plays an insane cop who chases Brolin through the streets of NYC firing a shotgun.  There's a Puerto Rican gang also after Brolin.  Basically, no one will listen to him.  Clemenza from The Godfather plays the detective assigned to the kidnapping.  Adult acting legend Sharon Mitchell plays...a stripper, during a scene in 'the 42nd Street porno district' as it's called by name.<br /><br />There are potentially disturbing scenes that are absolutely deflated by hilarious overacting.  A lot of cursing, a lot of shouting.  A lot of running, a lot of chases.  Not much sense.  New York is depicted as a complete cesspool of criminal lunes, dirty cops, and just irate, disgruntled people.  The subplot of the whacko's mother-issue-complex-thing is disturbing, yes, but isn't given enough weight because the scenes are interrupted by the comic proceedings.  At one point, Hedaya is fed to the dogs, literally.  Brolin travels through some of the finer neighborhoods of 1980 New York.<br /><br />Incredible, incredible film.  Totally forgotten.  Occassionally appears on TV, late at night.<br /><br />I assume McGivern just sold the rights and let the filmmakers run with it.  Should be studied as a prime example of overacting.	2005-04-25

The family lasted only 28 days before leaving, so he says.<br /><br />What's really amazing is that this whole business has been thoroughly debunked for years by countless sources, including the Lutzes, who even changed their stories.<br /><br />Even if you actually believe that a house can become possessed, or that a red-eyed pig can spy on your house, or that the strange odors eminating from your house could be paranormal symptoms and not symptoms of bowel movements or a backed-up septic tank, the material here becomes downright laughable.  I will give Anson credit for trying to dramatize the whole thing and create a spooky ghost story--after all, he was a hired writer, and he did his job all too well.<br /><br />But really, the facade collapsed a long time ago.  But that won't stop Mr. Lutz, who helpfully hosts a website, including a 'Store' section where you can buy merchandise.  And the fact that a family has lived comfortably in the same house for years and years with no reports of Satan trying to toss them out of his digs seems to be no issue for the obviously cursed and now-divorced George Lutz.  Who said real estate wasn't an evil business?<br /><br />This whole shameless 'Horror' isn't funny anymore, and remaking a shoddy film for the new generation is downright sad, cynical, and of course, unnecessary.  Yes, it's a horror.	2005-04-14

Looking for a rat who'd tell all, Scorsese had the perfect guy in Hill, whose book Wiseguy (told to Nicholas Pillegi) became the basis for the classic film Goodfellas.<br /><br />Down but not out, Hill has his own empire of Mafia-lore, with cookbooks, his website, his appearances on Howard Stern and other forums, and now this enlightening book.<br /><br />Here, Mr. Hill talks about his days after the mob, in Witness Protection, and on the run.  He gleefully rats out more of his old buddies, including his own wife, who finally wised up and divorced him.  He also names some names, as in who killed who, who is buried where, etc, etc.<br /><br />If you really like Henry Hill and think you have something to gain by reading even more detail about his life, then go right ahead.  The large print and numerous typos should make this a quickie.  But if you've had enough of the glorification of a punk, a guy who never got 'made', a guy so low down the pole that nobody would even bother whacking him anymore, then help yourself.

It's actually Bill Clinton, who lives right here in the USA and can be easily captured and tried for perpetrating the crimes of 9/11.<br /><br />The various authors detail Clinton's efforts to learn how to fly a 747 with Atta back in the old days.  They also detail how he recruited an army of Clintonistas to carry out the 9/11 atrocities, all the while fooling people into believing he was relaxing in his home in upstate New York.<br /><br />There is a side mention of Al Gore's efforts to poison the nation with anthrax, and how he was nearly busted when trying to sneak some of the white powder out of a secret government lab beneath the Pentagon.  Also, the book discusses Hillary's secret training camps in upstate New York, where liberals learned how to make bombs and write propaganda.<br /><br />But mostly, it's Clinton, who finally came through on his promise to blow up the World Trade Center, after his failed attempts in 1993.  Granted, he was already on vacation at the time in 2001, but his plan had been delayed by a cigar obsession that lasted several months and derailed some of the operation's steps.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book doesn't cover Clinton's autobiography, where he gleefully boasts about how he pulled off the crimes and still remained popular.  Perhaps a revised edition in the future?	2005-03-17

No doubt a 9th, and 10th habit do exist.  Perhaps penning another rehash of previously published material?  A true success story.	2005-03-17

They may even help him.<br /><br />There is an effort to craft George W. Bush into another type of Ronald Reagan--a charismatic, amiable but clueless man who can deflect criticism elsewhere.  After all, Reagan is a man who barely understood what was happening under his own administration.  Bush, as far as vision and policy go, is pretty much irrelevant.  He's a perfect choice for the party, acting like a mouthpiece, incapable of remembering what his handlers told him to recite, and yet gaining popular support because he's a 'manager' and a 'leader', etc, all piled on with enough rhetoric to satisfy the many folks who are actuall being shafted by the Prez and those who are really running things in Washington.<br /><br />By the time Bush II is done, there may well be an encyclopedia set dedicated to his unique brand of English.  In the end though, books like this are just novelty, and perhaps these days they are best left alone, so the morbidly curious can just check out websites like Slate that devote much space to cataloguing the wisdom of George W. Bush.	2005-03-15

The Great Shark Hunt is a good start for anyone.<br /><br />Thompson wrote plenty, and for plenty of sources.  Shark Hunt collects various articles and opinion pieces that he penned for obscure publications like Scanlon's to the pieces for Rolling Stone to the Sports pieces he contributed here and there.<br /><br />The result is the 'gonzo' style--insertion of the author into a story, often with copious amounts of chemicals, though this is often not the focus, as some may believe.<br /><br />There is a straightforward honesty and curiosity in Thompson's writing that is still fresh.  He is able to look at everything from politics to the hippie movement to the Super Bowl with his irreverant eye, and an excellent bull radar.  He talks with people from all ends of the spectrum, and we often get lucid pictures of the way things are amidst the alcohol, the acid, and the general gonzo antics.<br /><br />A good book to pick up, beginning, middle, or end.  Probably the best compilation, as it covers the formative gonzo years from the mid-60s on, covering plenty of Nixon action, hippies, sports, more politics, etc, etc.<br /><br />Thompson was an excellent writer, deserving of far more credit than the literary establishment is likely give him even in death.	2005-03-15

They are not organized in any particular manner, and the subjects range from wounded soldiers to refugees to atrocities.<br /><br />The text is spare and not particularly illuminating; this volume is not a good source for real information about the wars, as it only mentions fleeting facts.  The pictures depict all sides in these wars--Serb, Bosnian, Croat, Muslim, Kosovar--as victims and as fighters with portraits of refugees, paramilitaries, soldiers, and the dead and wounded.  There isn't a whole lot of spin, which is good.<br /><br />All told, the pictures are big, colorful, and powerful most of the way through, from the famous shots of one of Arkan's Tigers kicking a dead woman in the head, to the makeshift morgues in Kosovo during the Kosovo war of 1999.  Those early shots from the beginning of the Bosnian war in April, 1992, including the Muslim man begging for his life, were barely saved--Haviv apparently hid one role when Arkan's Tigers demanded he surrender his film.<br /><br />The statistics at the end are interesting, but not yet complete as some numbers have since been updated.<br /><br />This is mainly just photos, and is recommended to complement any of the better books on the Balkan wars, one or all.	2005-03-10

That said, this is easily one of the best books on The Doors, period.<br /><br />This book is exactly what it says, a chronicle of every Doors show ever played, with information provided where available (and where people could remember).  Obviously, many entries are more complete than others, particularly later on as concerts were better covered, etc.  Where possible, entries includes the date, venue, attendance, set list(s), support acts, a brief synopsis with notes on the show (how they sounded, if Jim was wrecked, if they messed up a song), etc, etc.<br /><br />Absolutely the Bible of Doors bootleg collectors, this book flew in the face of claims from the band members themselves that concert tapes didn't exist, when, in fact, author Greg Shaw obviously reviewed concert tapes for many of the entries here.  The Doors responded by releasing a box set that disappointed Doors boot fanatics, then wound up slowly releasing some of these shows that we'd heard about for years (Cobo Hall, Detroit, Aquarius Theater, etc).<br /><br />This book really should be back in print, it's much more valuable than another tell-all about the band or about Morrison.  Excellent rock book.  Not sure it's worth the ridiculous amounts that some are selling it for, but if you can find it for less, it's just a no-brainer.	2005-03-03

Like Wiseguy, it's the real account that Scorsese fashioned into a film (with Pileggi's help again).<br /><br />Casino tells the story of the Chicago mob's major role in running Las Vegas, how it happened, and how it more or less ended (or appeared to) in the 1980s.  Instead, corporations (institutionalized gangsters) took over, and now we're to assume that gambling is a respectable, fine industry.  It's hard to cheer for the state 'gaming' officials as they pursue mobsters who are skimming a casino, of all places.  A character in the film says it best when he exclaims, 'You mean the money we're robbing is bein' robbed?!'<br /><br />A good read before or after the excellent film.  Readers will note that the basis for the Frank Vincent character (Frank Marino in the film, Frank Cullotta in real life) provides much of the info here, certainly on Tony 'the Ant' Spillotro, the basis for the Pesci character.  There's quite a bit of detail as far shady business dealings, politics, and mob bosses go, but less of the nitty gritty mobster detail from Wiseguy.<br /><br />Hard to know whether to weep for the old or new Las Vegas.  While it was mobbed-up in the past, it's now a neutralized Disneyworld and a respectable holiday destination for families.  One wonders who the real greedheads are.<br /><br />A good, if overlong account.	2005-03-02

One wishes he'd include that in the About the Author section.<br /><br />Can one party really be so wrong?  In the American one-party/two-faction system, one wouldn't think so.  But in the world of being a professional party hack, it's not only thinkable, it's the only thought one can have.<br /><br />You can't become a true partisan hack until you condemn the entire other party, not just John Kerry.  Blasting one politician, who apparently staged his stint in Vietnam only so he could use it for later political gain (instead of just respectfully dogding the draft, say) is not enough.  Instead, all wearers of the donkey pin are painted with a blue brush.  Any facts that refute the cliche about Democrats being 'weak' are conveniently ignored, and any evidence on Republicans being 'weak' or 'appeasing', are ignored, too.  That's real professional work, after all.  And discipline.  Nice work, sir.<br /><br />Any relevant points, and there are certainly always some, are buried by the negative tone of the book, which makes this hard to read for any thinking person who doesn't bow down to the Donkey or the Elephant.  One can imagine Patterson's opinion of anyone with the gaul to not register with one of these hallowed parties.<br /><br />I was so impressed with Patterson's decision to just go for it and become a full-blown hack, I nearly applauded as I 'read' this mighty, earth-shattering expose in a local bookstore, before replacing it next to his other work, which was all a warmup for the real show.

On the other, it's nevertheless interesting to look into the shiny life of Frank and the decadent world of entertainment.<br /><br />George Jacobs was Sinatra's personal valet during Frank's most popular phase until he was fired for dancing with his wife one night (Mia Farrow, who the author had to babysit while Frank got up to more of his antics).<br /><br />No doubt there's a little bitterness, but the tone of the book is not negative.  Jacobs deserved better than to be written off with a lawyer's note, as was Frank's habit with getting rid of 'friends', but we can still get a dirty look inside the Chairman of the Board's lifestyle.<br /><br />The focus is Frank, so we have to forgive George as he glosses over his marriages, his various kids here and there, and his supposed restraint in the face of temptation when he hung with Frank and his crew.<br /><br />Sinatra comes off as an obsessed man, and while there is probably not much in the way of surprises here, we get some dirty details and some insight into Frank's 'way'.  While Sinatra could be a great guy, he was also an obsessed man, a guy who just couldn't be alone, and a man who never got over Ava Gardner.  Read with gusto about Frank's 'detailed' files on all the new starlets in Tinseltown, about Frank's anatomical gifts, about his appetite for Jack Daniel's and cigarettes, his gangster pals, and his raging temper.  'One-take Frank' was also an accomplished actor who refused to do more than one take, making one wonder what a Sinatra/Kubrick film would look like.<br /><br />Jacobs seems to love Frank, but he has a lot to tell, and I guess that means exposing some ugliness about his former boss.  Of course, since Frank is dead, he can't sue, making the appearance of this book quite convenient.  Still, it's an inside, if sleazy angle.  And it serves as another reminder that Hollywood is a sleazy and amoral place where some of the lowest forms of life creep.<br /><br />Everything from the childlike glee that Frank got from setting off cherry bombs in his friends' shoes (this is a 50 year old man, mind you) to his use of his personal valet as a babysitter for wives and girlfriends while Frank got up to, er, other assignments, is all here.<br /><br />Jacobs should either be condemend or applauded or both.  Either way, we get to pick through the sleaze of the great American vocalist in all his pinky ring glory.p.   <br /> <br />Everything from the childlike glee that Frank got from setting off cherry bombs in his friends' shoes (this is a 50 year old man, mind you) to his use of his personal valet as a babysitter for wives and girlfriends while Frank got up to, er, other assignments, is all here.   <br /> <br />Jacobs should either be condemend or applauded or both.

This book probably sold most of its copies during the early days of W, and most certainly right after September 11, 2001, the day that partisan hacks completed their takeover of the media.<br /><br />It made good (business) sense to publish a book about how it was obviously all Clinton's fault that we were attacked, so we could huddle under Bush as he began his impressive campaign to destroy the brand name of the USA and encourage terrorists around the world to mobilize for more jihads.  But that's how opinion is often formed in the United States of Amnesia, so much so that Bush has convinced a good number of folks that starting several wars will, in fact, reduce terror, rather than encourage it.  I can't think of a better propaganda campaign or a better job of proving that 2 + 2 = 5, and such a campaign is only helped by books like this.<br /><br />The material is very selective, the context is often distorted, and this often sounds more like a personal beef with Bill Clinton rather than a serious study of how Clinton 'endangered' the country, or even a study about global terror in the 90s.<br /><br />Of course, it goes without saying that you can write the exact same book about every single US president in the last 40 years or so, but that would require thinking, which the target audience of this book is not expected to do.  A shame.<br /><br />Avoid unless you collect partisan flame books.	2005-02-17

Much of the material may be familiar to folks from countless lectures and interviews, as well as chapters in longer anthologies.  But the recorded lecture here, in very good quality, is concise and fanscinating, a good one-stop for an intro and then some on the history and importance of propaganda in American history.<br /><br />Chomsky talks about the rise of propaganda as a tool of social control, right from the early days of the Ministry of Information in Britain to its American counterparts, the advancement of propaganda in the business world, and the necessity of the elite classes to mold the public's mind and reduce the serious threat of democracy.  All of it is very clear, with many references, and with an often sarcastic nod toward the intentions of the planners and the real effects, right to the present day.<br /><br />This should not be digested alone, but rather with a sampling of the author's written works and various interviews and composite interviews from over the years that cover similar points.  Also, the excellent volume 'Propaganda', the original guide by Edward Bernays, has been put back in print with an intro by Chomsky.<br /><br />The discs are a bit a pricey, and you may be able to find similar lectures available digitally online, but this is still worthwhile, and good for repeat lessons as it's fairly succinct but more than enough food for thought.	2005-02-10

In this winner, Daniel Flynn, who prides himself on having been kicked out of lecture halls for his views, tries to knock down a few folks who have committed the ultimate American crime: thinking.<br /><br />The problem with the book is obvious right away.  If smart people fall for bad ideas because of ideology, then how does the author explain his own obvious and unconcealed bias?  Is he smart?  Is he falling for ideology?<br /><br />This is the sort of thing that happens when people disregard facts and can't actually answer arguments.  Apparently, the environmental movement is not totally legit because of the people who helped advance it years ago.  People are blinded by 'leftist' ideology, so they're to be discredited.<br /><br />The targets are familiar, the charges very old, and very tired, and very refuted.  Noam Chomsky here is still a Holocaust denier, a supporter of the Khymer Rouge, a predicter of genocide (he didn't 'predict' genocide, but quoted common sources), etc, etc.<br /><br />I can't wait for the sequel to this log, where the author analyses himself, lauding his ejection from lecture halls for his amazing ideas.	2005-02-03

The Middle East figures heavily (Israel, Palestine, the first Gulf War) as does Central America, Afria, Kosovo, etc.<br /><br />This is a valuable release for anyone interested in something besides the evening news, say, to explain the origins of not only 9/11 but of international terrorism, wherever it pops up.  The contributions of Schaap, Ray, Chomsky, and many others concerning US internvetion abroad provide quite a different version than the 'official' history that is often accepted without question (we spread 'democracy' to this country, ended 'communism' in this country, fought for 'humanitarian' reasons in this country, etc.)<br /><br />The articles are all concise, and you can pick through this book as you see fit, focusing on specific regions and incidents.  There is a lot of information and brain food here to help people navigate the media and the various histories that are embraced by those who have something to gain from one interpretation over another.

And I can't blame him.<br /><br />This is an important consideration of how the landscapes of America have changed, and not for the best.  The decline of American cities, the rise of the never-ending suburban sprawls, the addiction to cars and to oil and highways, all contribute to the decay of social fabric.<br /><br />It all sounds deep, but Kunstler is clearly onto something.  Himself transplanted to the suburbs of Long Island, Kuntsler is angry at what he sees as an America that is less and less concerned with maintaining any lasting community, anywhere.<br /><br />All you have to do in this country is go to a few different cities and look around.  First off, you can hardly distinguish most big cities from each other in the US--you have a downtown (in some cases among the worst part of a particular city, and often deserted and bland) and you have the endless suburban sprawl.  What you find is isolation, isolation, isolation.  Pick a big city, and you see the problems still being faced decades after population shifts, demographic changes, cultural changes etc: Detroit, Atlanta, St Louis, Miami, etc, etc.<br /><br />Architecture is in the dumps, as short-term profit is the motivating factor behind flat, faceless and featureless buildings.  Suburbia has long been the answer for many: miles of designed streets with identical houses, cut off from undesirables by miles of highway, encouraging an inefficient life where everything is separated, the car has replaced the PERSON as the unit we build for, to say nothing of the cultural wasteland half of America becomes with the influx of 100 fast food chains, a Walmart, a mall, an 'entertainment complex', etc, destroying anything that once gave a place character.<br /><br />The notion of public space is different in America than elsewhere.  Here, we don't seem to think much of it.  While it may enrage some folks to compare ourselves to Europe and its cities, Kunstler points out that European cities are built to last, so to speak.  Public space is respected and cherished, cities are built around people and for people, and so what if you don't have a Chili's, an Outback Steakhouse, a Radioshack, a Best Buy, a Wal Mart, etc, etc everywhere.<br /><br />Even in New York you see the chains have moved in to stay, the blandness extends to every facet of life.  At least you can walk out the buildings here and walk on a street and see people, unless of course, you don't want to see anyone except those who are exactly like you.<br /><br />Important stuff, and God-forbid, thought-provoking.e ourselves to Europe and its cities, Kunstler points out that European cities are built to last, so to speak.

Parenti comes at every angle and rails against an unjust, trumped-up war that was dishonestly reported and then forgotten.  It is nevertheless important as it set the stage for further international adventures out of the scope of international law, now a US policy staple.<br /><br />Parenti is not denying that an ugly civil war was taking place.  What he is disgusted with is the 'presentation' of this 'war' as a humanitarian effort, an unprecedented act of altruism by powerful states to save an opporessed people.<br /><br />Parenti focuses on things like collateral damage, economics of Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe, the media and 'their atrocities', bumbling politicians, etc.<br /><br />Not everything here is so convincing, but there is much merit in the argument against the war, a war now forgotten and brushed over as our committment to this troubled corner of Europe ends.<br /><br />Recommended for a different take on the Kosovo War.	2005-01-19

This manual, a seminal document, is a key resource on the thoughts and workings of the public relations industry, then only a speck compared to what it is today.  Everything from corporate PR to advertising in general has basically internalized what is covered in this book in order to serve those institutional functions that mold the public's mind.<br /><br />This is all related to the 'manufacture of consent', something that Chomsky, who writes a good intro here, and Ed Herman explored in depth in their book 'Manufacturing Consent' where they lay down a Propaganda Model.<br /><br />This is a huge topic for Americans, period.  While media and their role, and their 'slants' is a hot topic (sometimes even within the media, but to limited scope of discussion) this book is a straightforward reprint of the PR industry manual.  It's no 'secret'--it's more like company policy.  It's far more illuminating than the latest pundit book of the week, discussing, among other things, the 'liberal' media, say.<br /><br />Don't let the intro or its author derail you from reading this--this is nothing more than a mini-bible on how to manipulate the masses in an institutional framework (media, PR, government, etc).  There's nothing really controversial here, since this is basically a historical document that still holds up after decades.  Highly recommended.	2005-01-06

With his sagely advice on tipping, as well as scoping out Elite Vacations magazine for his next yachting trip, Trump offers invaluable advice on succeeding in your pathetic, meaningless life.<br /><br />Of course, I assume he's writing a revised edition, since this one omits the chapter of 'thinking like a billionaire' that talks about writing a worthless, glorified supermarket checkout counter 'book', and collecting a few more dimes.<br /><br />Otherwise, the book has a shiny cover, and the paper stock appeared to be pretty standard.

The analysis is done through the filter of the thoughts, ideas, intentions, and inventions of the filmmakers.  It chronicles Friedkin's influences and work from his television days right on through to Rules of Engagement (this volume is a revised edition, as the original 1990 one only went to The Guardian).  The chapters are smartly broken up into two parts: one is a detailed reading of the film, noting the details and imagery, the other is about the making of the film, with comments from Friedkin himself, the best part of the book, and with the many collaborators and players.<br /><br />The result is a body of work that is consistent with Friedkin's personality and interests, if not consistent in overall quality. This serves as an excellent depiction of a strong personality, an obsessed man, in many ways, and the conflict of directing 'Hollywood' films but with an outlaw element.  Friedkin's films do come off as consistent: there is a gritty, cynical attitude, and the endings are not typical--there's hardly a film in Friedkin's catalog that ends happily ever after.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent book.  Friedkin comes across loud and clear in this book: obnoxious, intelligent, honest, funny, and a total character who made some excellent films.	2005-01-04

He is effective in presenting the idea that the people of the USA should, perhaps, wake up and take a look at the country and think clearly about things.<br /><br />Superpatriots are, in Parenti's estimate, those who stand, often blindly, in defence of anything done under American auspices, and those who back the president regardless of rational argument.  Superpatriots are not 'bad' people--rather, Parenti illustrates that it is a dangerous, arrogant tendency, and one that does not benefit the citizenry.<br /><br />While many people want to believe that the realm of accepted debate in this country is 'serious', there are some who rightly point out that the 'serious' debate about American power and influence is anything but, and that defenders of the faith are successful not in enlightening people, but in indoctrinating them, narrowing the spectrum of acceptable thought, and neutralizing any dissenting forces.<br /><br />There are some who may read this book and think Parenti is a 'Communist', say, throwing around terms that are divorced from reality but are successful in connoting effective imagery (Communist = USSR = bad), but this is hardly serious at all, and is an example of the extent people will go to avoid thought.<br /><br />The book is short, but as a summation of some of the ideas of dissent that are finding a larger and larger audience in America today, it is valuable.	2005-01-03

Instead, many are content to wallow in unreadable texts with long, impressive terms that, in the end, have little at all to do with films.<br /><br />Studying modes of production, the words of the filmmakers themselves, trends, etc, we can figure out a lot about films.  But that's not good enough for some people because it's too straightforward and obvious.  Instead, an entire vocabulary needs to be invented--poststructuralism, film semiotics, etc, etc, in order to mask the quite obvious fact that we still don't know a thing.<br /><br />If we had any concrete understanding of how films 'work' on our minds, then someone could write a book that a 12 year old could read and understand.  Instead, we get books like this: inpenetrable, heavy, intellectual tripe.<br /><br />If you believe there is actually a 'theory' to film, and that such a 'theory' can be applied to a large body of film and work, then this might be for you.  If you're more interested in the real world, on planet Earth, you may want to avoid the subject altogether...	2004-12-31

It tells you a lot--considered to be a kind of low art form, it attracts serious scholars who, rather than applying common sense or rational thinking, literally invent whole vocabularies to disguise their utter lack of knowledge and general cluelessness with regards to these staples of 'pop' culture for the 'little people'.<br /><br />It's classic academic constructs.  It's obvious that Clover, and she's not alone, is either incapable or unwilling to just say what she means.  Instead, and in order for a university press to pick these things up, the ideas have to be draped in dense, unreadable, and often laughable language.<br /><br />Are there interesting ideas here?  Yes, certainly.  Are they easy to understand?  They can be, but not here.  You may feel like a moron after reading about your favorite slasher, but don't worry--you haven't been exposed to the careerism and isolation of the cinematic ivory tower yet.<br /><br />The book can be half as long if they tried to make it accessible to the people who actually WATCH horror films, but it is instead geared toward people who want to study the people who watch horror films, from a detached perspective, armed with a dictionary and a black turtleneck.<br /><br />I would actually recommend this book for horror fans, but with reservations.  It does try to get at what is happening in this genre, and why we watch these movies.  But don't feel bad if you laugh at some of it--that's part of the real world.	2004-12-31

When three young boys were found murdered and mutilated, a Satanic-cult case was prepared against three local misfits in West Memphis, Arkansas.<br /><br />The evidence against the boys is pretty slim, any way you look at it.  The biggest weapon of the prosecution were admissions from the teens themselves, admissions that don't make much sense.  When we look closer at the (now-incarcerated for life and/or waiting to be executed) teens, we find murky waters indeed.<br /><br />There is a lot going on here, and Leveritt does a pretty good job of weaving through the cast of players, including lawyers, parents, victims, judges, etc, etc.<br /><br />It's fairly obvious that the judge has absolute contempt for the (court-appointed) defense from the start.  Not being a lawyer, nevertheless some of the decisions are downright odd.<br /><br />It all sounds like a case of the prosecution, the community, and the state wanting to put these brutal crimes to rest, quickly.  Most disturbing in this whole thing is the behavior of one of the victim's children, famously captured in the two documentary films on the case.  Mark Joseph Byers, a petty career criminal and all-around lowlife, is acting rather odd in the face of all of this, and he mysteriously never does any jail time for his numerous (and hair-brained) offenses.<br /><br />Something reeks in this whole thing, period.  Whether or not the '3' are given another trial is a whole different story, and it doesn't look likely that they're going anywhere soon.  Disturbing, period.	2004-12-07

David Horowitz has been on a roll of late.  He's expected to be some sort of authority on the viciousness of the left because, of course, HE was a member of the new left.<br /><br />Horowitz is like the intellectual version of Michael Savage.  A great self-promoter who, trying to make a mark in the world, switched 'sides' and now makes a decent living blasting other leftists.  He has an unhealthy obsession with 'debunking' Noam Chomsky, to the point where he pens his own 'anti-Chomsky blog' on the Internet.  He likes to think he is toppling the monolithic Chomsky, whom he mistakenly believes is a messiah to radical leftists.<br /><br />Get off yourself, Dave.  This book, from the title alone, should raise suspicion.  Radical Islam and the American left?  Once again, Horowitz is incapable, or more likely, just plain unwilling, to distinguish between 'justifying' terrorism, and looking for reasons behind terrorist attacks, for instance.<br /><br />It's sad that in this climate, a born-again neocon can pen a book about how the left is lined up with radical Islam, while we have a president who claims to be doing the work of God in democratizing the Middle East.<br /><br />Yes, the world is a scary, dangerous place.

This is an educated, intelligent man.  He has notable insights into immigration, and multi-cultural societies, with California (or Mexifornia) as an example of multi-cultural change.  He's very well rounded, and he's not an outright conservative pundit or intellectual.<br /><br />But too often, I found him repeating what I hear on cable TV, the same old lines, the same old tired arguments about the war on terror.  He loves the anti-American argument.  He thinks people 'don't get it', when they complain about the USA but meanwhile want to act and be like Americans.  There are some points to be made here, but too often I found Hanson comfortably settling into the easy chair to wax on about American greatness and international cluelessness.<br /><br />I like how he throws out lines like \\"Second, the Europeans also don't have a clue about America's world role--past, present, or future.\\"  Huh?  I take this to mean that they a) actually don't know any history, or b) don't 'get' our role in history from the American point of view, meaning unconditional support for the world's superpower.  It's funny, of course, considering we as a culture filtered down from Europe.<br />He settles into a veiled 'love it or leave it' attitude, with the classic, 'why do so many people flock to America?'  I don't think they flock here because they don't like our policy in Iraq, I think they value the freedoms and opportunity available here.  Hanson is either clueless, as is a President who can ask with a straight face, 'why do they hate us?' or he simply knows the answer but...<br /><br />It's funny, and sad, really, that Hanson, and millions of others still don't seem to 'get it'--namely, that there may actually be a separation between the people, the culture, and values of a country (America) and then the actions of the government abroad and at home.  I guess you can never get enough mileage out of pointing at people and saying 'anti-American'.<br /><br />By the time you finish the book, if you can, you might wonder whether Hanson himself believes what he's writing, or if he's an outright cynic.  I guess it doesn't really matter in the end, since if he's a good enough writer, then the effect will be the same.

Romero's Dawn of the Dead	Books	1	7	9	N	N	Too much room in Hell	If you're a Dawn fanatic, don't get too excited about this panel-by-panel re-drawing of Romero's classic.<br /><br />On the one hand, you would think that the pink-blooded, sometimes comic-bookish tone and characters of the film would translate well to a comic book.  On the other hand, a panel-by-panel presentation of the film we know and love is not only unnecessary, but it's not even well done.<br /><br />The artwork is lame, the color is blah, the inking is serviceable, the whole thing is rather pointless.  There's gore, sure, but it's almost too much, too late.  Nothing is done with the themes of the film, nothing is done to increase appreciation of a horror classic.<br /><br />If you want anything 'literary' with regards to Dawn, track down the novelization that Romero co-write when the film appeared.  Heck, even track down the academic study of Romero's work.  The latest Dawn Ultimate DVD box set (highly recommended) contains the first issue of this 3 book series.

Ann Coulter is right by the sell-by date of her leggy, blonde, conservative pundit career.  Now at least 40, she may only be able to pull off this kind of book once or twice more before even Sean Hannity has to stop inviting her to appear on his show.<br /><br />Judging by the cover alone, with the leather-clad Coulter standing in front of a blackboard, I'd say the publishers know exactly what they have on their hands.  Coulter is like a movie star who the studios burn out and disgard after both have been handsomely paid.  Is she were Steven Seagal, this could be like her 'Under Siege', the big hit before the career slide.<br /><br />Or perhaps not.  Nevertheless, Coulter is one of the best, most devious liberal agents in the media today.  Her television performances, matched by her written rants, reveal a remarkable talent for cheerleading, which has led many to believe that Coulter is really a liberal in disguise, trying to discredit the Republican party with her material.<br /><br />As for the book, it appears to be like the others, a nice, glossy cover, and the font is not too bad, and it fits nicely into supermarket magazine racks, too.	2004-10-12

Of course, the end of 'major' combat was announced in May 2003 (during the president's impressive photo op), so it's safe to declare the 'war' over and proceed with this coffee table book.<br /><br />The book looks good, certainly.  It is competing with any number of other nice, big, glossy books of pictures from Operation: Bad Intelligence.<br /><br />For a book on the Iraqi conflict, we'll have to wait for some time, it seems.  This book has some gorgeous shots of the leadup to war, the war itself (where the Iraqi army mostly went home to get heavily armed for Iraq War II, or III, I guess), and so on.  It looks like Bush's carrier landing scene was a virtual announcement to the publishers of the world that it was time to get those 'history' books rolling.  There is a solitary shot of a soldier's flag-draped coffin, giving one a reminder that many more have died since.  There are also shots of Saddam's palaces, and reminders of his own atrocious behavior which we were a bit late in condemning since we indeed supported it all the way.  The book needs revision, as Saddam has since been captured, reminding us that he wasn't sitting in an underground lair, stroking a white cat and planning world destruction, but was threatening the American people from his spider hole with a six-month beard and bad breath.<br /><br />The book barely hints at the horrors of war the way similar photographic works have.  Sure, we see some battle shots, a few wounds, dusty, blown-apart buildings in Baghdad, but the book offers nothing new on the US armed forces or on this or any other war.  Actually, I expect this baby to be on sale pretty soon, just in time for the publishers to push out a new book covering 'Post-War Iraq', meaning impending civil war.  Perhaps it's best that the book is light on commentary...	2004-09-20

When you see a book titled 'The Cinema of', you know it's supposed to be serious.  (Instead of 'The Films of', 'The Movies of', etc.)<br /><br />Williams, who did a good book about families in the American horror film (Hearths of Darkness) asserts that much of Romero's work is connected with the naturalist tradition of writers like Zola.  He also traces lines to EC comics, and connects up Romero works like Dawn of the Dead with the director's hometown of Pittsburgh and a certain vision of a consumerist society that masks a certain social decay.<br /><br />The problem with books like this, however good the points they make, is often the language and the presentation.  There is a large body of Romero fans, particularly Dawn of the Dead fans who may appreciate a 'serious' consideration of the director's films (or his 'cinema').  However, I think most fans are alienated by work like this, which is too stuck in academia and is often bloated by unnecessarily flowery language and interpretation to appeal to the people who are watching these films regularly.  It's unfortunate, because film is such a mass, popular medium, and yet the academic study of the medium is too stuck in the ivory tower.  It seems like you can't just write the obvious, or even just discuss the films if you want to be taken seriously.  In order to be write a 'serious' book about an American indie's 'cinema', you have to wrap it up in frameworks that are as lifelike as some of Romero's zombies.  The book certainly has good points to make and provides some food for thought (or flesh for thought), but I found it a bit much at times as Williams almost painfully recounts scenes from the films with weighty pronouncements (not particularly backed up) and also, annoyingly, gets names and quotes wrong (fact-checking).<br /><br />Maybe Romero will return to the sub-genre he created with a film about zombies running rampant in a university...	2004-09-20

I'm not a black metal fan and can't profess to empathisizing with the genre necessarily, but I found this a pretty interesting rock book.<br /><br />The maddening thing about this book is the way it jumps all over the place.  It is in desperate need of better indexing and organization, because there is a lot of information.<br /><br />If anything, this book should be given to people who think Norway is a nice, small, idyllic country with none of the problems of a place like the USA.  Non-comformity, for some of the players in this book, led them to, er, interesting paths of intense speed-metal guitar, quasi-Satanic dabblings, church burnings, Pagan ideleogy, Nazi-glorification, jail, the afterlife, etc.  The book is about what intense alienation, isolation, and a little ideology can do to some young people.  Being the second edition of this book, the material also covers more recent events and the inevitable splitting of the genre into many other sub-sub-genres of metal (yes, apparently it's possible) distinguishable only to the truly dedicated.<br /><br />This is a good look at how a rock 'scene' develops in another part of the world with its own demented twist.  Much of the material is now the stuff of 'legend' for other bands to continue the trend of loud, very angry and very serious music.  I'm not sure what drives so many people to paint their faces with corsepaint, reference Satan, burn churches, stab their friends to death, etc, etc, but perhaps the people of Norway themselves should be looking at this.  I'm no expert, but I can bet the average Norwegian has either never heard of black metal, or if he/she has, regards it as some lunatic element in their society.  While perhaps not entirely lunatic, I'm sure there is probably something the people of Norway can learn about their own culture and society from these events.  It's probably not something they want to learn.  Also fascinating is the law in Norway, which dictates a maximum of twenty-odd years in jail for murder (this isn't Texas), meaning that Count Grishnackh will have ample time to develop his 'ideology' and will likely have time (and maybe even the following) to implement it when he gets released sometime in the next decade or two (just in time to run for Norwegian parliament).<br /><br />As someone wrote, this is the Norwegian equivalent of gangsta rap, where your street credibility may well ride on how many churches you've firebombed, or how many people you stabbed, or threatened, or whether or not you ever made a necklace out of pieces of your buddy's skull.s in jail for murder (this isn't Texas), meaning that Count Grishnackh will have ample time to develop his 'ideology' and will likely have time (and maybe even the following) to implement it when he gets released sometime in the next decade or two (just in time to run for Norwegian parliament).   <br /> <br />As someone wrote, this is the Norwegian equivalent of gangsta rap, where your street credibility may well ride on how many churches you've firebombed, or how many people you stabbed, or threatened, or whether or not you ever made a necklace out of pieces of your buddy's skull.	2004-09-16

The book is broken down into sections about The Victims, The Perpetrators, The Plan, etc.  From a roll of undeveloped film found in a field we see pictures and self-portraits of the Serb paramilitary men who wreaked havoc on this small pocket of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in 1999.<br /><br />This event occured well into that war, making one wonder.  The majority of the real 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo occured after NATO decided to bomb the place to smithereens in a 'humanitarian' intervention that still doesn't make much sense.  Milosevic's indictment for Kosovo mostly contains charges of war crimes after the bombing started, making one really wonder about the 'Clinton Doctrine'--literally provoke bad guys into doing worse, and then squash them (and the whole country).  Noam Chomsky had a good simile for the 'humanitarian' intervention as practiced in Kosovo: it's like watching someone getting mugged in the street, and instead of stopping it, you pick up a rifle and kill everyone--criminal, victim, and bystander.<br /><br />What's also striking of course, is the suggestion (and common knowledge) that there are many men like the ones being accused here.  One of the uglier lessons here is that if you want to be effective at terrorizing a people, you go out and hire professional criminals.  There is fascinating testimony from men who were recruited for the 'Lightning' (Munja) paramilitary brigade, or Arkan's 'Tigers'.  In a Dirty Dozen-type way of doing things, criminals were recruited from jails to become professional ethnic cleansers, since you just don't get the same results from a conscript army.<br /><br />Lots of brutal images, a reverent book.  Should be read with some knowledge of the war to form a better opinion.	2004-09-16

The mere concept of an Anti-Chomsky reader is interesting, implying that he's a messiah and that 'we will set out to debunk him once and for all'.  To think that one book, or a whole series of books that construct Chomsky-ite theories in favor of straw man arguments will finally 'debunk' him can't be serious, and the book should be read with a fat grain of salt.<br /><br />I don't know what exactly set Horowitz and Collier off on this.  I don't believe Chomsky ever penned an anti-anybody reader, and for good reason.  What are you telling people about your own work and opinion?  It's almost as if Chomsky's work has revealed something unacceptable about not only the authors but about other intellectuals, and it just can't be tolerated, so an irate book claiming to 'finally' debunk this thinker is needed.<br /><br />Noam Chomsky is not God, folks.  He would probably be the last one to think he is.  What's important is that you do not have to agree with everything he says--something his critics conveniently believe about anyone who references him--in order to find value in his thinking.  Chomsky has never written a 'manifesto', or a 'bible', or an anti-whoever book.  He doesn't have a 'plan'.  He subscribes to a type of thinking that often tries to consider 'honesty', as in, actualy intellectual honesty.  And he has written and talked about his own work often enough to suggest he is well aware of his own role in the intellectual world, and that he doesn't spend 24 hours a day pursuing the 'truth', not even close.<br /><br />I almost can't believe what some of this book covers.  The whole anti-Semite argument returns, yet again.  Once again, other intellectuals appear to be condemning him for not loving the Israeli leadership and the Israeli legacy of state terror, and therefore making him 'anti-Semitic', meaning he hates himself, of course.  Once again we have mention of Holocaust denial, which is absolutely idiotic given how much has been said about this.  More has now been written about Chomsky's alleged support of Holocaust denial than what Chomsky wrote in that intro the infamous book in the first place.  If you believe in free speech, he was basically saying, you would believe in someone's right to pen a book about how the Holocaust never took place--no matter how ridiculous, since Chomsky never even read the thing, and believes that even entering such a discussion is 'to lose one's humanity'.  The Khmer Rouge discussion is another look at this overplayed 'example' of how Chomsky 'supports' mass murder, etc, etc.  Again, given the brains behind the book, I'm surprised that they challenged what they did.  The examination of the propaganda model is very unfortunate, misrepresenting Chomsky's and Herman's work and once again ignoring the central theme in favor of feverishly debunking someone who says a lot of things that people don't like to hear.<br /><br />Perhaps if Chomsky joined the ranks of countless intellectuals who condemn others for crimes, and ignored what his tax dollars are contributing to, his critics might quiet down, which is exactly the point of much of his work.  Why criticize another country for their crimes when you have less influence to change them?  Why not examine yourself, and your country, and look to correct what you yourself may be responsible for?  It's an attempt at intellectual honesty, a difficult and bumpy path, and it's not surprising that it's been often met with frothing contempt by many.  It's a lot harder to express dissent than to simply line up and support existing power.<br /><br />Noam Chomsky is a person who is thinking about the real world and is trying to explain it.  He has specific beliefs about the role of power in the world, and about the role of the superpower of which he is a citizen.  He is not always correct, or 'right'. And given the amount of work Chomsky has done, the amount of talks, and interviews, and information he has dealt with (he's very empirical) the idea that one might tome (with the very original 'negative' photo of his face) will 'finally' put permanent suspicion on this man is rather childish and unfortunate.ith (he's very empirical) the idea that one might tome (with the very original 'negative' photo of his face) will 'finally' put permanent suspicion on this man is rather childish and unfortunate.	2004-09-15

This is a seriously in depth look at Wes Craven's demented debut, Last House on the Left.<br /><br />Szulkin has done a ton of research.  There are countless references in here to obscure genre work, foreign films, etc, etc.  Plenty of pictures, too, big, bright and shiny pictures of various artwork from the film and its unofficial 'sequels', grisly scenes, and more.  Whatever you think of the film, this is an impressive book.<br /><br />Last House on the Left is definitely demented, but looking at the current state of the horror genre, it holds up pretty well.  The raw, grainy quality and the depiction of the kind of sick, stark horror you read about in the papers--this is definitely not a movie that glorifies crime and murder as other slick, entertaining films do.  Craven would do similar things later in the decade with The Hills Have Eyes, another ultra low-budget but creepy study of an American family.<br /><br />Video nasty buffs and horror fans will highly appreciate such a respectful book about an oft-disrespected and reviled film.  I mean, this is the second, revised edition(!)  That is dedication, folks.	2004-09-15

Though she is Croatian, 'the war' is the entire breakup of Croatia and Bosnia from 1991-1995.<br /><br />Instead of another story about the victims of that war, she looks at the perpetrators and studies the war crimes trials at the ICTY in The Hague.<br /><br />The book is an attempt to paint a selection of the perpetrators not as 'monsters', which is the easy and obvious thing to do, but as human beings.  It's an attempt to be honest for a moment, though not a complete attempt.  But she takes a selection of known and not so well known accused war criminals and tries to show something about them as people, something that shows that these are human beings that are being accused and convicted of unspeakable behavior.<br /><br />Among the well known figures are, of course, Slobodan Milosevic, whose chapter is called Beast in a Cage.  It's a very good, if not obvious observation about this man.  Despite so many articles, and stories, and at least four biographies, there is very little the outside world seems to know about this man's personal life, about him as a person.  In the end, he really does look very gray, the ultimate bureaucrat who figured out how to stay in power for a long enough time before it all came crashing down.  She depicts him as a man of no warmth whatsoever, which is consistent with many other descriptions of him.  She invokes the thought that 'Evil is the absence of empathy', which is certainly relevant in many of these cases.<br /><br />Other notable characters from this rogues gallery include Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb army, and still at large.  Responsible for one of the most heinous atrocities of that lousy war, the Srebrenica massacre, Mladic is depicted as a man who did evil to others, and was punished from above by the suicide death of his daughter.  Drakulic believes that not only will he be punished for life by her loss, but also by his likely failure to ever understand the reasons.<br /><br />There is an executioner from the aforementioned massacre who received a 'light' sentence due to the circumstances--complete fear and being trapped and surrounded by death-intoxicated comrades.  Two women get the consideration as well, the ladylike Biljana Plavsic, who plead guilty at The Hague and expressed remorse, and Mirjana Markovic, wife of Milosevic, who is living in her own world, it seems.  While not on trial, she escaped to Russia, now wanted by the Serb government.<br /><br />The writing is smooth and simple and the book is filled with memories of Drakulic's childhood as she relates to some of the characters via common references to a country that no longer exists.  The ending two chapters about 'why we need monsters' and some final thoughts becomes a bit much since much of it is indeed obvious, as is she requires praise for speaking what more and more commentators should be speaking about these trials.  The people involved were indeed human, they were 'ordinary' in some circumstances, even, but a combination of pressures, and circumstances, and elements inside them made them act in ways that horrify and mystify us.  Yes, indeed, looking at these people from ground level, and not from above, will help us learn something about ourselves, which is of paramount importance.also by his likely failure to ever understand the reasons.   <br /> <br />There is an executioner from the aforementioned massacre who received a 'light' sentence due to the circumstances--complete fear and being trapped and surrounded by death-intoxicated comrades.

All this time I thought anti-American sentiment could have to do with the policies of the American government, and not our amazing freedoms that the world is so jealous of.  Now I know that Belgium, that seat of world power, is feverishly working to undermine American power at every turn because they just can't stand our freedoms.  Ditto France, that evil and corrupt nation, so opposed to our freedoms.  Even Britain, our own mother country, has such contempt for America, not because we throw our weight around (like they did for a few centuries), but because we have these amazing freedoms that they know nothing about in their own impoverished and morally bankrupt society.<br /><br />The world just doesn't get it, I guess.  They keep focusing on our foreign policy, which some people actually believe is hypocritical and self-serving.  They focus on trivial details like the reasons for going to war in Iraq, failing to understand that we were acting to defend all of humanity by toppling a monster and liberating those poor Iraqis.  To prove our altruism, we will soon be marching into Saudi Arabia to free the poor from that tyrranical government, only after we condem Israel for oppressing the Palistineans, but not before we liberate Pakistan, and certainly not before we use our might to defend human rights in Africa.  Some people even misunderstand George W. Bush, whose eloquent denunciations of evil regimes are so profound that he himself can barely recite them, so excited is he to achieve world peace.<br /><br />John Gibson himself is a leader of enlightened thought, and his forum on Fox News channel is constantly upheld as one of the very few honest and serious places Americans can turn to learn about how much the world hates us because we are so free.  In France, where freedom is a foreign concept, they look over the Pond and see us dancing joyfully, celebrating our freedoms while they wait in bread lines, oppressed by the tyrannical Chirac dictatorship.<br /><br />This John Gibson has come out of nowhere to speak Truth to the people.  I encourage all to absorb his work, and to religiously tune to cable to hear his words.  In November, we will exercise our democracy by voting for one of two white, Yale graduates, both of whom defended America in the past, one against the North Vietamese, the other against other foreign empires who threatened to attack Texas in the early 1970s.here freedom is a foreign concept, they look over the Pond and see us dancing joyfully, celebrating our freedoms while they wait in bread lines, oppressed by the tyrannical Chirac dictatorship.   <br /> <br />This John Gibson has come out of nowhere to speak Truth to the people.

Gareau uses a number of case studies to determine the extent of US involvement in countries like El Salvador, Chile, Argentina, and he briefly covers other 'hot spots' like Cambodia, Nicaragua, and of course, Iraq.<br /><br />  The information is not 'secret'. Certainly, the media has covered these areas over the years, usually supporting a very familiar line. However, the reality on the ground is something quite different than the various US administrations have described in all of their lofty rhetoric about combatting terror, about 'why do they hate us?', and about eliminating imminent threats.<br /><br />  The book also looks to current events in an evaluation on the Bush II administration's 'War on Terror'. Gareau's summation is anything but laudatory for the 'counterterror' being carried out by the US and its allies and proxies. The behavior of the world's dominant superpower is often arrogant and bullying, and it's nothing new to Bush II. The case studies stretch back to at least the 1950s, with US involvement in the hemisphere stretching back a century in some cases.<br /><br />  There's been a very close link between US support and aid and state terrorism in a number of the cases, and some of the shorter bits on other countries and regions echoes this as well. (See Holly Sklar's 'Washington's War on Nicaragua' for an overview on that 'successful' job of 'spreading democracy'.)<br /><br />  The purpose is to illustrate what the United States has done, is doing, and is capable of doing when its interests are at stake and when a lofty goal is announced. Communism, Drugs, and Terrorism are excellent pretexts for widening America's sphere of influence and ensuring that clients and potential clients do not step out of line. 'Counterterror' becomes a code word for state terror, and when we've achieved our 'goals', we like to pat ourselves on the back for a job well done, sometimes leaving a trail of misery behind (Central America).<br /><br />  Highly recommended for anyone interested in current affairs. A stark look at the 'War on Terror' will reveal something about ourselves, and much about a media, intellectual community, and government that is dedicated to hypocrisy and to state terror when it achieves the 'right' goals.e and ensuring that clients and potential clients do not step out of line.

Even engaging in this discussion betrays a simple understanding of what the media in the US really is.  Perhaps people still believe that the news is always objective, and balanced, or even that it should be.<br /><br />The American corporate media shares the interest of its owners, its advertisers, and ultimately of the state.  The intellectuals and commentators it hires and features make a living justifying actions with impressive rhetoric and lofty terms.  That's their job.  The media is not liberal or conservative by nature, or by control.  It is an arm of state power.  Do liberals work in the media?  Yes.  Do conservatives work in the media?  Yes.  Is one man throwing the switch in an underground bunker for CNN in favor of 'liberals'?  No.  Does Rupert Murdoch invent stories every night for Fox News?  No.<br /><br />This argument is very popular, and for good reason.  You'll never get a straight answer, you'll hardly ever get a discussion WITHIN the media about how they themselves operate.  Therefore, you can continue to bandy it about, point fingers, and hold up 'irrefutable evidence' of how biased the media is.<br /><br />Does the media betray bias?  Uh, yes.  It is biased largely toward state power, and will frequently line up with the interests of the people who own it and who pay for it.  Cable news and newspapers do not sell news; they don't make money writing 'liberal' stories.  They sell their audiences to the powerful advertisers who pay them, which is how they operate, at a very basic level.<br /><br />You can sit there and document the examples of liberal thought in the press, and find many.  Or you can document the examples where the press is mysteriously silent or is subordinate to their controlling interests, something that will tell you far more about the media than how many stories about Bush's military record appear in the New York Times or about how many commentators criticize John Kerry on cable.  The most laughable arguments frequently occur WITHIN the media, when they point fingers at each other, trying to assert that another news source is NOT fair and balanced.<br /><br />This certainly does not justify what the media does.  In fact, they deserve much blame for their practices, which serve to indoctrinate the public by and large, and ensure the people have little to no real power on major issues.  Is it 'liberal' that we are bombarded with useless information about Scott Peterson?  Or Kobe Bryant?  Or obsessed over the trial of an obviously guilty ex-football star?

There is little background to the wars in the former Yugoslavia. That is for other works to present. The focus here is the 'new military humanism' of the West as an idea, and as a practice, with the Kosovo war of 1999 serving as the example. The examination takes into account the Orwellian notion that in free societies, it 'wouldn't do' to mention certain facts, namely the facts that contradict the lofty ideals we profess to be upholding.<br /><br />The book is not an outright condemnation of the intervention in Kosovo, and it does not propose hard solutions or alternatives. This is an examination of the conflict, and of the implementation of a 'new military humanism'. Given the impressive amount written about the war, and the support it was given by intellectuals (from across the spectrum), this is a serious look at whether or not our aims and justifications really hold up. There are few works that actually explore the conflict from this angle, challenging the canned version of the events.<br /><br />Chomsky asserts that the humanitarian aims and effects of the Kosovo war do not hold up to any scrutiny. Chomsky's position is thus: in a crisis, we can choose to do nothing, choose to mitigate it, or choose to escalate it. He believes that NATO, in fact, chose to escalate the crisis through the bombing campaign. Did we choose to engage the army on the ground, and the forces committing atrocities in the province? No. The bombing escalated the crisis, and indeed, after Milosevic failed to cave in, the civilian population was targeted, and of course, devastated, as an already impoverished country was made to pay for the crimes of its corrupt leaders. Did Milosevic have to put a 'horseshoe' operation into action, once the bombing commenced? No, he didn't. But when you bomb someone, you don't expect them to throw flowers at you, you expect them to react, and the reaction here was cynical, and 'entirely predictable', in the words of Wesley Clark.<br /><br />Chomsky examines the 'official' version of the events, challenging the chronology while exploring how a certain depiction of current events will morph into a story that supports certain actions, particularly when those actions and interventions are undertaken by the 'enlightened' states of the West.<br /><br />  The Kosovo war is slipping down America's impressive memory hole; of course it's never discussed in the endless considerations on the 'War on Terror'. In fact, if we really cared about ending terrorism around the globe, we would explore our own actions. Milosevic claimed he was fighting terrorists. The KLA were considered terrorists by the US and the West, it was explicitly stated before our involvement. Acting to preserve our 'credibility', we armed and supported said terrorists, and demonized not only the Serbian government, but the whole people, wrecking a country that will take decades to recover, if it ever does.<br /><br />  Hmmm.

Before you accept any label that's been pinned on him, give his work a chance.  His biggest crime just might be paying attention to facts, and questioning the praise we pour on ourselves, and actually caring about things like morality, and hypocrisy, and people.<br />Chomsky is the antithesis of the kind of intellectual and pundit that corporate media prefers, and he directs much criticism toward this 'establishment'; indeed, he has compared intellectuals and elite opinion-makers to the commisars of Soviet Russia.<br />This book is a sort of summation of material he has covered extensively before and since in different formats.  The book proposes some important questions and considerations about this point in history.  America finds itself in a state of unparalleled power in history.  How do we use it?  What is the cost of the quest for global dominance?  The stakes are higher than ever.  Terrorism, WMD, nuclear capability--these are things that threaten our existence.  Are our current leaders really concerned with ending terrorism?  Were they ever?  What does the doctine of pre-emptive action mean, especially as applied to Iraq?  And how long will people buy the same old stories that don't hold up under scrutiny?  Who stands to really gain from global hegemony?<br />Chomsky reviews recent events like 9/11, world reaction, the National Security Strategy of 2002, announcing a doctrine of pre-emption, and, of course, Iraq, which is being played out as an outstanding example of hypocrisy and blind embrace of power.  Once again, he goes through some useful facts about Iraq and America, namely that Saddam was a US client who had to be punished when he stopped following US orders.  But of course, we now care so much about the Iraqi people, you know, we liberated them.  And we cared so much about them when we supported Saddamn's reign by wrecking the country with sanctions.  It's such a sham, you wonder how Bush himself can not crack up when he defends the 'reasons' for the war (WMD, democracy, etc, etc), or how he and most politicians can hide their utter contempt for the man on the street, or for anyone who actually looks at reality.<br />What is now clear in Chomsky's work is a very self-reflexive element, because Chomsky realizes how his work is viewed through the traditional doctrinal filters.  Therefore, much of it seems like very, very bone dry humor, as he exposes the BS of politicians, elites, and ultimately ourselves.  We're spreading democracy in Iraq...but are we really spreading democracy?  Do we realy care about democracy, or the rights of all people, or freedom for everyone?  Running through one case after another, the answer is quite different.<br />There's a very good reason Chomsky is often dismissed, or simply despised.  His work concerns elementary moral questions, intellectual honesty, and general concern for PEOPLE, not institutions, or even states.  He's anything but anti-American, if anything, he's very American.  He cherishes freedom, and he routinely states that many of our American freedoms are unique and unprecedented.  He reminds us that in a democracy, in a real democracy, you don't 'rally to the leader', you don't blindly worship the state.  If we believe in freedom, real freedom, then we question power structures and their authority over us, and we reject them if they're not legitimate.<br />Chomsky is not a 'liberal', he is radical, his criticism is for the entire system and its track record.  He does not have a 'master plan', and he would reject anyone who claims to.  Notice he's been called everything under the sun: Marxist, Nazi, Stalinist, Communist, anti-American, deranged, etc, etc, etc.  His answer?  Yeah, you DO have to be deranged to pay attention to things like elementary morality, and to actually have concern for your fellow man.  Highly recommended reading for anyone who wants to think about current events, to seriously think, and to look outside the very narrow spectrum of debate in this country that is favored by the media and intellectuals.think about current events, to seriously think, and to look outside the very narrow spectrum of debate in this country that is favored by the media and intellectuals.	2004-07-19

There are now close to 20 suspects in the Ripper case, and indeed in the 1990s alone quite a few new suspects appeared on the scene thanks to research and fanaticism on the part of various writers.  Now Cornwall has thrown herself into it, and it's somewhat troubling.<br />Of course, at the end of the day, there's no smoking gun.  There hasn't been a smoking gun, and given that the murders took place in 1888, and evidence and various records are long gone, it's highly unlikely there will be a smoking gun.  The whole business already inspired someone to forge a 'Ripper' diary and try to pass it off.  This has since been debunked numerous times, with the author himself swearing that it's a forgery, yet people still believe it.  Every year someone discovers someone who was in London in 1888, hated women, etc, etc.<br />Folks who are interested in the Ripper may peruse this book, but it's clear from the 'evidence' and the layout that this is anything but 'Case Closed', if anything, it says something about Cornwall, who writes about her own doubt to this theory.  And admittedly, while there are some nice coincidences, and Sickert indeed may have been a bit off his rocker, and indeed may have penned Ripper letters (of which there were many fakes), it's no more convincing than several other theories of the past ten years.<br />Notice the '71% off' price tag of this book, which shows you something in comparison to other books on the subject.  There are much better books about the whole case, and you'll likely learn more from those if you care.  It would be nice to put the whole Ripper case to rest, finally.  The energy and resources some folks have put into 'solving' this business is becoming more alarming.  Recommended if you must, but it's hardly a 'final chapter'.u'll likely learn more from those if you care.  It would be nice to put the whole Ripper case to rest, finally.

The war against Nicaragua is staring into the same memory hole that other unpleasant chapters of American history get dropped into by politicians, much of the media, and ultimately the people.<br />Way, way back in the 80s, the US launched an illegal war OF terror against the mighty Central American empire of Nicaragua, which was threatening to destroy the United States and our very way of life.  So evil was this nation, so dangerous, that they had to be crushed, to the point that it's easily one of the most dirt-poor nations in the hemisphere.  Starting up their own Reich, eliciting the support of the Evil Empire (since no one else would help), Nicaragua is a classic example of what happens when puppets no longer follow orders and want to go off on their own.<br />Holly Sklar has written an in-depth, meticulously researched book that betrays little bias, since the well-known and easily verifiable facts speak for themselves.  The story is very ugly, indeed.  So egregious was the US that we were condemned by the World Court for 'unlawful use of force', a nice euphamism for, well, aggression, terrorism, etc.  After hearing this unacceptable verdict, the US responded by walking out of the World Court, and escalating the war.  The contempt for international law continues unabated.<br />The book is very detailed, and well-indexed.  You can focus on certain chapters without losing the overall story, and indeed many Americans will recall all the hoopla, nicely spun by the media then and now.  Of course, some of the very players are still on the scene today, with Oliver North now a respectable Fox News employee, and John Negroponte displaying his characteristic dedication to the Third World in his new role in Iraq.<br />Highly recommended reading for any American, this book will not be found next to your latest fashionable pundit's 'book'.  It does, however, give an insight into how world powers behave, then and certainly now.	2004-07-09

If you want a good understanding on how debate has been watered down and clouded through the miracles of television and 'punditry', and how corporate media is indeed a strong arm for power structures, then proceed with 'reading' this book.<br />It doesn't involve reading the book end to end, sentence by sentence.  You can 'read' through Hannity in a bookstore, by selecting any number of chapters here.<br />Sean Hannity doesn't even approach silly.  He looks like he might be serious.  He wears a suit, he enunciates, he's in a shiny TV studio with monitors, and some papers, and he uses controlled gestures with his pen to emphasize his serious points.  As long as this facade is up and running, you're most of the way there.<br />Sean Hannity is very good at his job, killing time between commercials so Fox News can sell you to advertisers, which is how they make money, and how (and why) they operate.<br />Anyone who is serious, be they 'conservative' or 'liberal', can see through this sham.  But there are many who like to relax, confident that merely tuning in to Hannity's show (where he is paired with the other serious commentator, Alan Colmes, who resembles a skull with hair and glasses) will inform them and enable them to repeat 'facts' the next day at work to anyone who dares to challenge Hannity's hero, the infallible George W. Bush.<br />Hannity is such an expert that he (or rather, his ghostwriter) bases an entire book on a debunked 'theory' of appeasement, the old Neville Chamberlain and Hitler story.  Nobody actually takes this seriously anymore, but please, Sean, don't let it stop you.<br />Of course, in case you didn't know, 'liberals' may be nice people, but they're uninformed, and they have the nerve to deny the existence of evil.  Also, Bill Clinton is largely to blame for all of this terrorism, and George W. Bush is restoring dignity to the White House because instead of having an affair with an intern, he's only lying to the people, alienating allies, ramming through a dangerous foreign policy, launching his own illegal war, helping his very rich friends, and trying not to laugh at the little guy, who takes in the neck, yet again.<br />So, yes, please read this book.  If you want to understand how scary cable news has become, and how dedicated those in power are to keeping the public completely subordinate, then enjoy.

Random Threats from an Unarmed American	Books	3	6	14	N	N	Watch the watchdog	This is Michael Moore's first book and probably the most valuable, in that it hasn't been sullied by the publicity and outright nastiness that has developed between the 'left' and the 'right', with Michael Moore now involved given the success of Bowling for Columbine and now Fahrenheit 9/11.<br />Michael Moore is not really a serious commentator, I wouldn't call him a 'serious' political dissident.  His avenue of approach is humor, which is good and bad.  For one, he can reach more people with a colorful, humorous, and irreverent approach, and that's good.  What's bad is when he is embraced solely for offering a very public dissident view, regardless of how he does it.<br />Serious commentators appeal to your thinking by arguing with facts, citing evidence, and avoiding personal attacks, bombast, and hatred.  Moore is clearly angry, but his points are often clouded, something obvious in most of his films.<br />By now, we so know where he is coming from that his mere mention of Bush is supposed to get his fans cheering since we can assume he's going to rail against him or flat-out insult him.  And that's a shame, because it sullies any serious intentions he has of changing people's minds.<br />For the most part, this book attacks the one-party system that operates in America, passing itself off as some kind of amazing democracy.  And this is very tied to 'Big Business'.  Moore is very frustrated and angry with a system that clearly favors institutional values over people.  As in, why do corporations, already posting impressive profits, cut more jobs and move them overseas, for instance?  More profit, of course.  Yes, people suffer, but in the current system the hope is that the corporation (or country) will benefit and then begin to pass these benefits down to the people.<br />Moore does not believe in this, nor should he.  He came to the public eye following his 1988 documentary 'Roger &amp; Me', which concerned the awful fate his hometown of Flint, MI suffered after GM decided to up and move the whole city industry (automobiles) to post greater profits.<br />His point is very relevant, his forum is simply geared toward a wider audience than much serious commentary, which, again, is good and bad.  The problem is that you have to be careful about what you say when you're given a spotlight like Moore now.  He knows he has an audience with him, and right now his audience should be watching him as well as the government.<br />His points are well taken.  He stresses there is no difference, fundamentally, between Republicans and Democrats, and that they are essentially factions of the same party, one dedicated to big business and enterprise.  The focus is hardly on the common good.  Large corporations and trans-nationals do indeed operate with less scrutiny than the government, and the effects of their actions upon the public are very real, indeed.  This ties in to some of Moore's other points in his work, that our perceptions have been conditioned to some degree to tune elsewhere for alerts: fear of crime, drugs, terror, etc, all as defined by power structures that do not want prying eyes exposing what they're doing.<br />With Moore's popularity and the resources now available to him after his recent successes (money and resources to make more films, get his word out, etc.) I think everyone should take a look at what he says and call him out when he's not honest.  Just because he's not 'for the system' does not mean he does not operate like anyone with an agenda, if anything, distaste for the status quo may compel him to use all kinds of manipulation to get more ears.<br />The book won't win you over if you already hate the man for his anti-Bush stance.  On the other hand, if you appreciate serious commentary about where America is going, this book will not suffice, either.  But perhaps it will whet one's appetite to learn a little more than what cable news tells you.red after GM decided to up and move the whole city industry (automobiles) to post greater profits.  <br />His point is very relevant, his forum is simply geared toward a wider audience than much serious commentary, which, again, is good and bad.

He delivered his share of beatdowns as well.  Trying to avoid the heat of New York, where he was aligned with various low-level street crews of wannabe wiseguys, he fled to South Beach, Miami, where he had various contacts and was able to open up a successful club, starting a massive snowball that would go uphill in a hurry before tumbling down.<br /><br />This book is a good indication of the difference between careful, career criminals and those who make good only to destroy it in a hurry.  Paciello's reign was short, and he wasn't helped by the buddies who ratted him out.  This is not a flattering photo of anyone but rather a presentation of thieves who would rob anyone and everyone they could, rob their own friends, and screw you over without thinking.<br /><br />The book is certainly serviceable of its kind, written by a Daily News reporter with typical poetic touches here and there, but overall a decent read.  Included are photos (usually mug shots) of some of the characters like Mikey 'Flat Top' and 'Messy Marvin', hardly a fascinating portrait of the criminal mind.  If the picture of Paciello is at all accurate, it's doubtful he will remain in Witness Protection very long.  Recommended for true crime mob addicts, as well as anyone who lives in Brooklyn (Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, Bay Ridge) or Staten Island, since you'll recognize names, places, and events.	2004-06-18

Ann Coulter knows what she's doing.  Whether she actually believes what she's writing may be irrelevant at this point.  As long as it appears she is presenting serious and factual information about how liberals are, in fact, guilty of treason, then her point is made.<br />What must be admired in a demented way is her total dedication to the cause.  That is the mark of a true professional, after all, and she is a professional cheerleader for the far right wing.<br />According to Ann, the left, and liberals, and Democrats (all conveniently lumped together) have been consistently wrong about every single issue for at least fifty or sixty years now, they hate America, they want to destroy America, and Bill Clinton is evil and is responsible for many of the ills now facing America.  This is her schtick, in a nutshell.<br />So half the country is guilty of treason.  I'm guessing that after this nasty portion of the population is liquidated, America can be safe for people like Ann Coulter: rich, white, overly opinionated, and full of hatred (most notably for herself) and absolute contempt for people, including those who would buy her book.<br />A good sampling of Coulter quotes is enough to tell you what this book is about and what she is about.  Go ahead, crack this one open and indulge for a bit.  Then put it down, and go on with your treasonous self!	2004-05-24

The book is a quick overview on, yes, the 'way of the wiseguy', a kind of 'guide' to wiseguys from the guy who was 'Donnie Brasco' to the mob.  So we get bits about how wiseguys dress, what they do on an average day, whacking people out, eating out, scamming, scheming, etc, etc.  The problem is that much of it is familiar.  Matter of fact, anyone who's read a few books about the mob, watched your Godfathers and Goodfellas and Casinos and Sopranos, or grew up in New York, will already know most of the material in this book.<br />It's shameless, really.  Okay, we had the book and film Donnie Brasco, both of which were fascinating.  Next, the Brasco name was used to sell fictional mob stories.  And now this.  It's a funny thing, but while some mobsters become turncoats and sing songs for book deals, law enforcement officials are often more shameless as they roll out yet another Mafia book to a Sopranos-indoctrinated public.<br />I'm reminded of another Mob figure named Henry Hill, who is now a regular feature at your local bookstore as well.  Aside from Wiseguy (and the excellent film Goodfellas) we have the Henry Hill cookbook, and Henry's own guide to 'the Mob's New York'.  And, of course, in June 2004 Mr. Hill is coming out with another book, this one detailing his years on the run, in and out of Witness Protection.<br />Yes, the Mafia has provided us with yet another cottage publishing industry, and yes, there is an appetite out there for true crime.  But this is definitely not one of the better offerings on the subject.<br />And ask yourself why it's appearing now, almost 25 years after Mr. Pistone's assignment with LCN ended.  Yeah, I smell a dollar, too.	2004-05-24

I'm very surprised this book hasn't received more comment.  This is the story of a man, living in America, who organizes a terrorist group for export to his home country (Kosovo).<br /><br />In detail, we read about a Brooklyn roofer and Kosovo ex-pat, who, upon hearing of the strife in his country helps organize KLA resources.  The KLA was actually branded a terrorist organization by America and most of Europe in 1998.  Their aim, it was no secret, was to launch attacks on Serb police and civilians in hopes of triggering disproportionate responses (re: atrocities) in order to lure the West in to help.<br /><br />The Kosovo War is now, of course, another cottage publishing industry (like every war.)  However, the war is mysteriously absent from public debate and is yet another chapter of American foreign policy that is doomed to the memory hole.<br /><br />More than two years before the re-declaration of the war on terror(ism), the Kosovo war was another illegal war (by largely ignored international standards) that accomplished little but remind Europe that the US is still the dominant military power in NATO (and the world.)  Indeed, the bombing campaign escalated the level of violence in the region as Milosevic's 'horseshoe' strategy was put into effect, driving people from their homes and triggering major atrocities on both the sides.  In 2004, tensions flared again as ethnic Albanians burned Serb homes in retaliation, driving yet more people out of region to ensure it becomes completely Albanian, thus making the claim of independence more viable.  Perhaps the US and NATO didn't realize how sticky the situation could become.<br /><br />While the KLA was disbanded, it wasn't long before another rebel group formed with the aim of driving Serbs out of portions of Serbia proper and making new geographic claims.  Macedonia has seen flare-ups of similar tensions.  NATO and the West were not prepared nor intensely interested in mitigating these actions.<br /><br />Imagine, if you will, a book about a successful Iraqi ex-pat who helps organize terror squads from Brooklyn for export to Baghdad, to kill Americans and pro-American Iraqis.  Or an Irishman who organizes IRA cells from Boston...oops, nevermind.  These selective doctrines of intervention (you know, like NATO just suddenly deciding to care about Kosovo) fall apart under scrutiny.  In 1999, 'Serbs' were, of course, synonymous with Nazis, the most evil people in Europe, so it was okay to bomb their cities to smithereens because Milosevic was just an awful guy (though once a convenient ally).  It was okay to fund and train groups once branded as terrorists only if it made the West look more civilized and humanitarian in the process.<br /><br />The US should never have entered the Kosovo conflict.  The war accomplished little for the Serbs, the Albanians, or Europe.  More and more, it looks like an exercise in American muscle-flexing.  And the cited humanitarian reasons for the war are borderline absurd.  As in, how is it humanitarian to blow apart a country and drive the people into further poverty?  Or undertake a bombing campaign with the full expectation that the ethnic cleansing might get out of control, which it did, driving hundreds of thousands from the region and creating a whole new and genuine humanitarian crisis?  Sometimes, if we can't think of a real solution to a complex issue, it might be better to stand back rather than escalate the violence and cause more harm.<br /><br />It's nice to know a fanatical ex-pat (who happens to be Muslim, proof that the war in terror is not about religion, but power) can help lure the lone superpower into a dusty and desolate pocket of Europe to bomb the daylights out of an impoverished country.  This man's story is indeed fascinating, even admirable--we don't doubt his passion in defending his kin.  But are we supposed to cheer the guy on?  In many ways this is far more disturbing than any accounts I've read of the actual war.desolate pocket of Europe to bomb the daylights out of an impoverished country.

Finally, he decides to just flat-out cash in on the whole Jim-Morrison-faked-his-own-death-and-escaped myth himself and pen this fiction tale of a rock star who faked his own death to escape, and the band mate who finds him.<br />It may be nice to think about, or indulge, but really, this is truly shameless.  I know Morrison was his friend, and they were close, but for this book to appear now, it's just a bit much.<br />The problem is how plain silly most of it reads.  After his underwhelming autobiography, where every other paragraph talked about Dionysius, or the chi, this is Ray doing fiction, but the same voice is there.  I doubt Ray thinks Jim is really alive, but to listen to and read him, you never know.  As long as he can continue to play up the myths...<br />I wasn't around for the first coming of The Doors, so I don't know how they sounded in their time.  But today, they sound like one of the very best rock groups ever, and there's hardly been a band that sounds like them since.  They tried to do a little more than just play a rock show, and the theatrical elements, and the dark, mystical and mischievous touches in their music still speak to a lot of people today.<br />But Jim Morrison is dead.  He was an alcoholic, probably very depressed, addicted, and burnt out in 1971.  No amount of waxing about Dionysius, or Indians, or Chief Mojo Risin, or acid, can change that.  He's dead, he's not in hiding, let him rest, listen to and enjoy and appreciate his work.<br />I'm surprised Ray didn't attempt to throw in another Greatest Hits package with this book and charge more $.	2004-05-18

Then one day, when John Gardner finally had enough of Bond, Glidrose hired Mr. Benson to carry on the franchise.<br />And so it goes.  Each Raymond Benson effort, beginning with this one, has been a cheap, painful excuse for a James Bond novel, even by the worst Gardner standards.  They are linear in the way a computer game is linear, going from part to part mechanically, guiding you along, past everything you expect.<br />Benson writes a cross between the cinematic James Bond and a fan-boy's imitation of Ian Fleming.  The writing is so bad, so amateurish, that it begins to feel like fill-in-the-blanks.  Trip to Q Branch?  Check.  Ridiculous, super-equipped car?  Check.  Gorgeous women falling for Bond?  Check.  Exotic assasins?  Check.<br />Benson is writing a slightly more detailed version of the James Bond films, and trying to inject Fleming by simply citing the details about Bond and his personality, but nothing flows well, he doesn't get what Fleming was doing.  It's like he has all the details, the plotting, a linear thread, but he can't write it.  I'm confident Ian Fleming is spinning in his coffin as Bond is carried on by a super fan-boy, and an American, no less.<br />At this point, I would recommend reading Ian Fleming.  John Gardner did a couple of decent books.  Raymond Benson, however, is an embarassment.  The Bond literary franchise has been cheapened, and is perhaps best left alone at this point.	2004-05-05

He has taken right wing talk radio to a new level, a new level so absurd it shouldn't deserve comment.<br />Who is this guy?  Who is Michael Savage to tell anyone about 'Saving America'?  The real enemy within is within Michael Savage.  There is so much self-hatred dripping out of this book, and out of the airwaves, it's really something.<br />Savage is perhaps the extreme end of this, right past Ann Coulter, another entertainer.  His primary tool is hatred.  Everything here, even well-meaning points, is ulimately clouded by hatred.<br />The vitriole falls right in line with similar, vulgar propaganda.  What's the best way to get people to listen?  Why, incite hatred and rage, of course.  Savage has studied some of the most significant propaganda of the last century, I'm sure, right from the MoI to Goebbels to modern cable news.  The man is, after all, a professional.<br />Just go to his website and check out his '8 Point Plan' for America from 'The Paul Revere Society'.  Everything there plays right into the minds of people who think 'we're giving the country away', 'we're being overrun by gays and foreigners', and similar sentiments that often coincide with a 'Leave it to Beaver' picture of America that never existed.  Notice the number one issues is 'traditional marriage', since Savage saves a particular large dose of vitriole for gays.  Notice there is nothing on that list speaking about the actions of corporations and governments that operate with less scrutiny and are slowly but surely shaping how you live your life.  But no, it's gays, it's foreigners, and it's probably Bill Clinton, too.<br />The easiest thing to do is wrap yourself up in the flag, say you're a patriot, and then repeatedly blast your opponents, hammer away at them (with flat-out hate speech) and then claim that YOU'RE under siege.<br />I would not recommend buying anything this man has penned.

I'm a tremendous fan of William Friedkin and his seminal horror flick The Exorcist.  But I'm kind of torn about this book.  On the one level, it's nice to have a serious book that considers so many angles on the film, the director, and the source material.<br />However, this is now the 3rd edition of this book in about five years.  Actually, this is called the 'Revised 2nd Edition'.  I bought the first two, now why should I plunk down more money?<br />Mark Kermode is apparently obsessed with this film, maybe a bit too much.  As if two books and a part in numerous Exorcist documentaries were not enough for him, we have another edition of the book.  Take it easy, Mr. Kermode, it's one movie.  I would rather have another BFI book on another Friedkin film (French Connection, Sorcerer, To Live and Die in LA, etc.)<br />If you don't have either of the two previous editions, I would highly recommend this.  I'm guessing the update was primarily to address The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen (one of the most shameless movie titles ever), which of course, included scenes Kermose certainly had seen, and written about in the first two books.  But overall, a reverent book.	2004-04-30

I wanted to know more about this case and dive headlong into the ugliness of America.<br />The book should be read with a grain of salt.  Having seen the film first, what struck me most about the book was how much of the staging and dialogue comes directly from the book.  It's some kind of interpretation of the events; the book is really a true-crime novel, not a straightforward document of the case.  There are many scenes between the teens themselves, with extensive dialogue and interaction that only the 'characters' were privy to.  Schutze also neglects to cite any sources at all, so we don't know who he interviewed (if anyone) or exactly what material he had access to.  Since Schutze is primarily a journalist, his book is successful at gripping the reader like a good news story, but it shouldn't all be taken at face value.<br />This book, the film, the whole case, is a fascinating and disturbing one.  A half baked (in every sense of the term) murder scheme by these teenagers, the mind-crushing stupidity just floored me again and again.  I can't point to any one thing that caused this crime.  Yes, Bobby Kent was despicable, and maybe he deserved to die, but by the end, you may decide they all deserved to die.  This is proof that wilful stupidity should be a crime.  That's part of the manipulative element of the book and the film--first, you're galvanized against Bobby Kent, then you want to condemn everyone else.  I was even disappointed to learn that Marty Puccio's death sentence (in the chair, no less) was commuted to life.<br />Perhaps what's most remarkable is that there were a million times when this murder could have been avoided.  Say one of the kids just chickens out.  Or one of them suggests they just stop hanging out with Bobby, or maybe confront him, since he seems so sad and pathetic every time Marty does stand up to him (&quot;You know you're my best friend, Marty.&quot;)  Or maybe the Mafia 'hitman', nothing more than a mixed-up punk who chickened out of a street gang, takes one look at these kids and tells them to get lost.  Or maybe the stoner, Donny, wakes up for 10 seconds and realizes what's going on.  Or maybe the kids pool their (small) brains and realize that if you DO want to kill someone, it's probably not a good idea to involve SEVEN people who can't keep their mouths shut.  I would have had more respect for this bunch if they came up with an ingenious idea to  make Bobby 'disappear', but no.  The combined idiocy had me wishing they all got fried.<br />I stress that Schutze's approach is very novelistic.  The main facts of the case are known, but the author really embellishes it here with dialogue and scenes of the teenagers living their ultimately empty lives where boredom has become a science.  Also note that the film disregarded the ethnic angle (Bobby Kent was Iranian-American), the gang angle (Marty may have been associated with a Florida gang), and even the physical angle (Bobby had bulked up with steroids which contrbuted to his raging).  Getting Nick Stahl to play Bobby was key though, so some of the above was jettisoned in favor of a good actor.<br />There is a gallows humor to the story; at times the whole thing is so demented you don't know whether to laugh or cry.  The film disturbed me.  It was one of those movies you see that ruins your life for a good week or so.  After being thoroughly disturbed by it, I ran out to read the book, then returned to the film and was able to contextualize it better.  I can now laugh at the absurdity of the whole thing while still being disturbed.  It's great.<br />Interesting that no less than three of these people are out of prison and walking the streets again.  Nice.  I highly recommend this book and the film if you want to stare straight into the horror, like Colonel Kurtz, and embrace darkness.  It will give you at least eight reasons not to have kids, or move to the suburbs.e to the suburbs.	2004-04-22

It is way too easy to read some history and figure out that a staple of reactionary governments is to scare people into sacrificing rights in order to fight enemies.  Terrorism, in particular, is one of the most effective bogeymen there is. <br />The threat from terrorism to the US is very real, make no mistake.  Terrorism is a problem.  However, it has always been a problem and not just here.  To assert that terrorism and despots are evil is obvious.  Yeah, we all know this.  To then use this as yet another springboard for attacks on your political enemies is plain cheap and transparent.  Hannity is obsessed with Bill Clinton and still talks about impeaching the man for hanky panky.  It would be inconceivable to talk about a president who manufactured a war, and helped ensure the US would be resented the world over.  Or a VP who continues to suppress the details of meetings with corrupt corporations (Enron) in forming an energy policy, and complains about the `eroded powers' of the executive.  No, it's much better to just blame Bill Clinton, who surely must have caused the blackout, mailed anthrax to people, and is probably behind Mad Cow disease, as well as the general moral degradation of the United States (directly linked to giving gays more rights and advocating free speech.)<br />Sean Hannity is a professional cheerleader for the Republican party.  He is not a journalist, nor is Alan Colmes.  (Journalism at least attempts to appear impartial.)  They are cheerleaders who repeat what you want to hear.  This book is nothing new and is as lame as his previous offering.    <br />It is very easy to wave the flag (or stand in front of the Statue of Liberty) and talk about being a patriot, and fighting the good fight, and leading the way, etc.  This is professional propaganda, after all.  However, it's also bankrupt of anything new or of any real solutions to fighting terrorism.  This is not a book you have to study or even read through to understand.  You know whereit's coming from if you've ever watched Sean Hannity shout over and cut off the people on his show.  Hannity is not serious, and he hardly warrants comment.<br />This book alone may be drivel, but a steady diet of material like this is harmful.  A scared population will submit to whoever is in charge, something the people in charge expect and desire.	2004-04-21

He ratted his buddies out, went into FBI hiding, then left the program.  Now he plagues the rest of society by shamelessly appearing on the radio (calling into Howard Stern), in bookstores (Wiseguy, this, a cookbook, and another upcoming crime book), movies (basis), and naturally the Internet, with his own website.<br />Hill comes off as a complete lowlife in Wiseguy, and he still does.  As if we're supposed to be endeared toward a loveable wiseguy who has gone straight, he brings us this, his 'guide' to New York.<br />This is nothing more than another 'inside' book about the New York mob.  It basically lists addresses of Mafia hangouts--restaurants, bars, social clubs, etc, etc.  He advises you that this place was where so-and-so got whacked, or never, ever look for this one social club, or such a place had great clams, or Gino is buried here, etc, etc.  It's so tired, he's so tired, you wish he'd go away.<br />Henry Hill was not even a made man, and the people he ratted out are mostly dead or in jail, so there is a notable irony in his expose.  He's giving you an inside tour of the Mob's New York, yet he's flat out admitting he was so low down the totem pole he's not even worthy of attention from real gangsters.  Talk about credibility issues.  That Goodfellas is such a great movie is testament to Scorsese's talent as filmmaker.  Henry Hill was the subject not because he was interesting (he's basically a lite goon and a weasel) but because he was willing to blab about it.<br />Don't waste your $ on this one.

Many of the interpretations in this book are indeed interesting, but that's largely it.  Using psychoanalysis on horror films can produce fascinating theories on certain types of films and on specific films (Jaws, Carrie, Psycho), sure, but in the end it doesn't prove a thing, and it's a largely isolated fascination.  Psychoanalytic film theory has been pretty much called out by post-theorists like David Bordwell who want to see some kind of evidence.  Creed's book is over a decade old now, and theorists like Bordwell state the ball is in the court of the psychoanalysts of film to provide a more substantial theory with empirical evidence to back up these theories.<br />There is probably something to be learned from studying film in conjunction with psychology.  As for psychoanalysis, in books like this, one is reminded how much of the work simply wallows in itself.  While the insulated core of film 'theorists' sit in universities and philosophize, the subject has stagnated and has functionally moved nowhere.  It's a classic academic construct that succeeds mainly in distinguishing the professors.  Given that film is such a broad and popular medium (and to study horror films, no less) it's a shame that some of this work can't be qualified or introduced to 'the masses' who watch these films regularly.<br />Within film studies, there are many who don't delve into theory, and for good reason.  It is largely useless.  Even when there are valid points to be made, the work settles into ornate language, as if the only way to express obvious assertions and be taken seriously is to dress it up for the academy.  Rarely is any useful evidence offered on how your mind reacts to what you're seeing on the screen and how you put together the references conscioulsy or unconsciously.  Too much of the work reeks of elite intellectuallism, a competition to ensure the most impressive terms are invented for unproveable assertions about the beloved medium.  To sit around and talk about vaginal representations in Alien and Jaws--not to say there isn't something there if you look at these films closely--with no worry about having to actually prove anything takes a lot of training.<br />What's most troubling in work like this is the application of constructs like Lacanian psychoanalysis (stemming from seminal Laura Mulvey works) and other debunked theories.  The social sciences has a habit of distinguishing works that are based on left-behind theories, something hard sciences simply cannot do seriously.  Recommended if you really want to delve into this niche market in the field.ginal representations in Alien and Jaws--not to say there isn't something there if you look at these films closely--with no worry about having to actually prove anything takes a lot of training.<br />What's most troubling in work like this is the application of constructs like Lacanian psychoanalysis (stemming from seminal Laura Mulvey works) and other debunked theories.

I truly believe that Ian Fleming would have died again had he heard that a fanboy took his famed character and cheapened him so.<br />The sad part is, I really believe that Raymond Benson tries hard with these books.  And they're appalling, every one of them.  That's the scary part.<br />I did not read this book.  I stopped reading Benson with the previous outing, which I couldn't even finish.  I really enjoyed the Fleming Bonds, and even liked a few of the Gardners.  But the decision to hire Raymond Benson remains a mystery and has killed my interest.  I won't read this one, because I have no reason to believe it will be any better than the previous ones.<br />The few things Benson does well--basically make up halfway decent stories for a Bond story--are wasted with amateur writing.  Benson even went so far as to include graphic sex scenes in the books, for no particular reasons.  It came off as seriously embarassing.<br />Do not waste your time or money on any of the Benson Bond novels.<br />Benson has apparently taken time off after this novel (which appeared in 2002.)  He's dedicating his time to putting out his own, original garbage.  We can only hope the management of Glidrose gets medicated and hires an actual writer again...	2004-03-20

He actually comes up with good Bond-like stories for his books. Hong Kong, Cyprus, Gilbraltar--a focus on the British empire past and present. He also does some good research. Sometimes too good--he includes lengthy descriptions of places and encapsulated history lessons.<br />What Benson does very, very poorly is write. He takes the above and whittles it away with amateurish writing and an unprofessional atmosphere. But it makes sense, since Benson used to write software.  It's painfully linear, and the good stories are wasted.  It's like taking a steak and dipping it in peanut butter. What a shame.<br />I read this book and really wanted to like it. The story is a good one, and it's relevant to current events. The situation between Cyprus and Turkey has been sitting stagnant for years yet it could still go off in a second. Some strange stuff happening as well. What is with Bond's car, his Jaguar that, if I understand Benson correctly, could survive a nuke. Not enough to have missles, guns, oil slicks. Now Bond's car has skin and armor that's so powerful you wonder what kind of engine is in that thing to carry that tank around.<br />It gets boring quickly when you know Bond can't get harmed in his car. He doesn't even have to drive the thing. Who knows, the Bond of the future may do his mission from his flat on a laptop and cell phone while Moneypenny cooks and cleans for him.<br />I just can't accept Raymond Benson as a novelist. I don't get it. They need to get someone else, and fast. The books can't get any worse in the writing department. Let Benson return to his esteemed role as President of the James Bond Fanclub.	2004-03-20

It appeared hardly a year after the conflict in Kosovo, and with the wealth of material that has appeared about Serbia, Kosovo, and Milosevic, it is slightly dated in its tone, though the many quotes and accounts of the happenings on the ground are valuable.<br />The dirty secrets of this conflict are touched upon: the recruitment of hardcore criminals to become members of MUP (interior ministry police who were tapped to murder civilians and suspected terrorists), the elaborate chain of command that Milosevic worked while avoiding any paperwork that could tie him directly to any war crimes, the flat out aggression by NATO against the civilian population of Serbia, the heightened humanitarian crisis that the bombing actually produced, etc.<br />While the Serbs are generally the Nazis of the 90s during the Balkan wars, with the Kosovo conflict it is Milosevic who begins to bear the brunt of the blame, while the Serb people are hapless bystanders punished for their support of a de facto dictator whose cynicism sealed his own fate.<br />The Kosovo war is beginning to take on a strange tint.  The 'humanitarian' reasons for the war are suspect at best.  The massive NATO bombing helped escalate the waves of violence on boths sides.  It also helped them slap together a hasty indictment against Milosevic and his top brass, all charged with war crimes that occurred after NATO started dropping bombs on their heads.  Go figure.  Meanwhile, it was known from the outset that no ground troops would ever enter Kosovo or Serbia, so there was an expected rise in the ethnic cleansing.<br />What's interesting is also the cover.  It shows the side of a building with a massive hole, the kind usually produced by bombing.  Peering out is an Albanian man, suggesting that the 'humanitarian intervention' is, of course, anything but.<br />Perhaps not stressed enough is the wealth of disinformation about the conflict itself.  The number of suspected dead was grossly exaggerated, the damage done to the Yugoslav army grossly exaggerated, and the overall success of the war completely questionable.  Is it humanitarian intervention to blow apart a country from above while exacerbating the crisis you claim to be reversing?  In many ways, Kosovo was a manufactured war against a trumped-up bogeyman.  In a post 9/11 world, does this sound familiar?<br />The war did not solve the Kosovo issue, far from it.  Its product was revenge killings of Serbs who had lived in the province for generations, while giving legitimacy to glorified terrorist organizations like the KLA, which officially disbanded, only to appear in modified form later, attacking people in Serbia proper while the UN stood around and watched.  It also strained relations between the US and Russia and with China.  It was a heavily protested war in Europe, and it didn't help when the Chinese Embassy was blown up 'accidentally' when it was clearly marked on common street maps of Belgrade.  Oops!

For those who want something a bit more enlightening, Chomsky puts forth bold assertions that many people wouldn't be willing to even consider in the wake of the attacks.  One of his main assertions throughout is that if the US wants to really fight terrorism, we should stop participating in it.  He cites specific, uncontroversial examples such as Nicaragua and the Contras, or Turkey, where massive US aid (by Bubba) helped the government do to the Kurds what we bombed Milosevic for when he tried it with Albanians.<br />I don't agree that Chomsky is insensitive to the victims of 9/11 in this book.  I believe that his attitude is similar to many others': that such an event, while shocking, is not entirely surprising, especially to anyone who's been paying attention to the world in the last decade.  Of course, he condemns the actions.  He does not rant that American lives are paramount in the face of other atrocities, which may not make his critics happy, but he also regularly acknowledges that, in our society, we simply do not ask certain questions.<br />Therefore, it's disconcerting to some that Chomsky is able to discuss the matters of 9/11, terrorism, and the USA's global presence with what sounds like an almost arrogant detachment.  Unlike the countless pundits on TV though, Chomsky rarely generalizes and cites sources for his facts.  He may skew them how he likes, but he rarely makes up whoppers to prove a point, a favorite element of television debate.<br />Chomsky has been vocal about America's foreign policy for decades, and it's entirely reasonable to suggest that his tone is now relentlessly radical left with an evil eye for capitalism.  However, I still believe reading Chomsky is a heck of a lot more valuable for the average reader and more enlightening than hours of CNN, Fox, or the wrapped-in-the-flag latest book from a TV `pundit'.<br />It's funny, whenever a corporate media pundit mentions Chomsky, it's usually to rip him as 'anti-American', yet the points he actually makes are rarely refuted.  Just calling him an 'intellectual' (he does not consider himself such) or an 'academic' is enough to discredit him in the eyes of those who see intellectuals and anyone critical of America as evil incarnate and in league with terrorists. Since he often cites specific facts though at times selectively, and he jettisons bombast in favor of serious consideration, he is the complete antithesis of loudmouth talking heads. Chomsky's arguments are certainly not airtight, but his presentation of facts, his acknowledgement of the de facto state of opinion, debate, and education in America, and his straightforward tone (he is very lucid in his speech and writing) make this a very compelling and important read.henever a corporate media pundit mentions Chomsky, it's usually to rip him as 'anti-American', yet the points he actually makes are rarely refuted.

It seems like Bill Clinton mostly got away with his own war of aggression, which was as manufactured a war as the recent one in Iraq.<br />This war was fought by NATO, which, no one noticed, had gone and switched its mandate after the Cold War to cover basically policing Europe, at least on paper.  Funny that the Bosnian war went on for four years, but after Monica Lewinsky, everyone suddenly got interested in civil unrest in Kosovo.  At least that's how it looked.<br />This book is a collection of essays with different angles on how the war in Kosovo was actually pretty damaging for America's foreign policy.<br />There are many relevant points here that shed light on the 'humanitarian' aspect of the war.  How do you blow up a country in a humantarian effort?  It doesn't make sense.<br />It's interesting is to read this book and look at this war and Slobodan Milosevic and then look at Saddam Hussein and the push for regime change in Iraq.  As long as they were helpful and could be used by America as political pawns, both figures were spared war crimes indictments.  Both were propped up longer by sanctions.  But when they stepped out of line, watch out.  Milosevic was pretty handy in negotiating a peace deal in Bosnia, which is eggshell-fragile and includes a laughable map.  Saddam was a good guy when he was killing Iranians.  But when he just wouldn't play nice with NATO, ultra-cynic Milosevic was bombed Saddam-style and slapped with a speedy indictment for not only Kosovo, but Croatia and Bosnia.  Representing himself, always an entertaining spectacle, Milosevic is really suffering now as he stalls for time in a trial that will likely last four years alone.  As far as the War on Terror goes, we see it's a selective War on Terror, as the CIA helped train the KLA, a terrorist group.<br />This book is definitely recommended.  It covers a lot of material that isn't discussed in the many personal and historical accounts of Kosovo and all of Yugoslavia.ed in the many personal and historical accounts of Kosovo and all of Yugoslavia.	2004-02-23

Robert Kaplan's jaunt through the deep, dark Balkans seems sorely old and plain bleak.<br />Supposedly this was the book Bill Clinton read that convinced him the problems of the Balkans were beyond control since it was all about ancient hatred, etc, etc. a popular conception during the media-heavy Bosnian war.<br />Balkan Ghosts is...depressing.  There are some truly depressing chapters, in particular the parts about Romania and the legacy of Ceaucescu's madness, as well as the bits on Kosovo and its Alabanians.  I'm not sure what the purpose is through all of it.  The essence that Kaplan seems to have about the Balkans is that its dark in every way, it's a world we can only watch but never learn.  It's a bit offensive, is what the book is.  There is a detached arrogance to the observations, but it's tinged with distain.<br />There are plenty of serious books on the history of the Balkans that focus on more than the rusted effects of Communism or the same old ancient hatred and distrust lores that continue to spin and spin as excuses.	2004-02-15

It reminds one how warfare changed because of what landmines could do.  Signficantly, the book explores how landmine production became dictated by industry as opposed to necessity; the better the landmine business became, the more they tried to sell to everyone around the world.  Landmines have done more than some might expect, though the book also examines how their usage has become a mutual element of modern war and their effect sometimes negated.<br />Landmines, the book also reminds, are made in some of the richest countries and often appear en masses in the world's poorest countries, littering troublespots like Cambodia, Sudan, and Afghanistan.  While landmines played a role in the quick and decisive US victory in the Persian Gulf in 1991, they also plague future generations as they can lay around for decades, their detection and removal costly and slow.<br />The book is concise and well indexed.  You can read this from the middle or even the end.  There are also 'Vignettes' throughout covering different kinds of landmines and explosive devices and their history and origin.	2004-02-15

Changing his original name and even his vocation, he has molded himself into a professionally vitriolic chickenhawk who broadcasts out of the most liberal town in America (SF, CA.)  His vitriole is so focused, so reactionary, his dedication must be commended.  He is tremendously funny.<br />Sadly, he is also listened to and even loved by many people.  Not only does he pollute the airwaves, but he writes books, too.  Being a funny satirist--a right wing hatchet man who'll say anything his ignorant fanbase wants to hear--his main crime is really the high exposure he receives, though this can be chalked up to the companies that bankroll him and keep him on the air and on the shelves.  Is that liberal bias?  Or is it capitalism at its  finest and sleaziest?<br />Since he's not serious, Savage hardly even warrants qualification of his points and his rants.  He is a crass comedian, and like most crass comedians who don't change their shtick or try to grow up, he, too, will be chewed up and spit out by the same machine that made him.

Like punk, goth has become a blanket term used to describe any band that remotely approaches a certain aesthetic that was once (sort of) original.<br />Thompson's book sets the record straighter by focusing mainly on the UK and the post punk scene that was the birthing ground for what would become 'gothic' rock.  The author covers the separate 'scenes' that grew up in various parts of the country (London, Leeds, etc) and how they differed and developed.  When the initial thrill of punk receded, post punk rose up and developed along different lines, spinning off and inspiring genres like goth and even new wave.  Much attention is given to The Cure, Southern Death Cult, The Sisters of Mercy, Bauhaus, Siouxsie, etc.  A lot of ground is covered, from Joy Division (described as having a 'gothic' sound) through the wranglings between Andrew Eldritch's Sisterhood and the ex members of the Sisters, toward the Fields of the Nephilim, who tried to fill the gap left by the Sisters.  Toward the end, the American scene is covered a bit, focusing on 'Death' rock with bands like Christian Death and .45 Grave, for instance.<br />The book is well researched, well written and not particularly biased.  Thomson's style is smooth and well organized.  The chapters deal with specific months and years and move around from the status of one band to another.  The author also touches on more recents developments since the 1980s, addressing the various artists and bands that have been characterized as 'goth'.  But again, the main focus is on progenitors of the genre rather than latter day pretenders to the throne.<br />There are also some decent pictures, but overall this is an excellent rock book, full of information for even casual fans of the genre or of the particular bands mentioned above.

He is still very funny and very talented, but his shtick can get just a bit old, and fast.<br />This book started as an article, and if you can, I would track that article down and save yourself the money and the time it takes to read this very slim yet somehow plodding hatchet job on anything popular for Middle America.<br />This subject was stinging and hilarious as an article, running the perfect length and not overstaying its venomous welcome.<br />But as the book drags on, Queenan is so relentless with his targets that the reader feels a backlash coming.  Sometimes it seems like the mere mention of &quot;Tony Orlando&quot; or &quot;Phil Collins&quot; is supposed to be enough to make you laugh and understand how disgruntled Queenan is.  And simply the word &quot;suck&quot; is used and used again to describe everything Queenan doesn't like.  Okay, Joe, we get it.  It's a bit tired to read page after page of insulting &quot;middle American huckleberries&quot;, etc.  I guess if people are not as fortunate, intelligent, or rich as Queenan, they're more or less despicable cretins to be mocked by the admitted &quot;cultural effete&quot;.<br />Another problem is that many of Queenan's references are either already outdated or beyond obvious.  The entertainment industry does the job for him when cheap targets like Steve Guttenberg or Joe Piscopo are chewed up and spit out by the industry itself once it has no use for them.  The vast majority of figures like this really do wind up just going away, and why?  Because the audiences--the middle Americans Queenan loves ripping to make himself sound smarter--disgard their product.  Queenan's biggest problem is with crap that poses as art, and he even admits that certain cheese is not so bad, as long as it's aware that it's cheese (as he discovers that Manilow is a good entertainer, if a cheeseball).  However, I did find it a bit nauseating when our intrepid author, who has immersed himself in popular culture and become addicted, needs to take a trip to France to cleanse himself and rediscover real beauty and culture.  Can you say vomit?<br />It's very, very funny at times, and the index is hilarious.  I wouldn't pay much for this book again; you may be able to track his rants down online.ating when our intrepid author, who has immersed himself in popular culture and become addicted, needs to take a trip to France to cleanse himself and rediscover real beauty and culture.

This book has taken a beating from some reviewers, and for good reason.  Appearing at a time when the mere word \\"Serbs\\" was synonomous with \\"Nazi\\" in the media, the book poses itself as a fair look at this nationality.<br />Once again we have a slanted book depicting Serbs in a less than favorable light.  Once again, the Serbs are strictly the bad guys of the Balkan Wars through and through, and the actions of their neighbors are not afforded a similar taint.<br />And, of course, we go through nationalism, treated like a poisonous word.  An inevitable outcome of the fall of Communist Yugoslavia, nationalism was the most readily available tool politicians could use to move and shake the country.  Of course it didn't move and shake in the right direction all the time, but nationalism is not the poison, per se.  Go and find me a more nationalistic country than the USA for starters.<br />The book did not appear in time to cover the Kosovo war, but Judah would approach this topic with another book entitled, oddly enough, Kosovo.  It's a better bit of work than this book, which is packed full of information as Judah struggles to run through an entire people from beginning to end, stringing selective facts to hammer home a point Judah had long before he penned this, which is to confirm that the Serbs are misguided, and are, in fact, the bad guys.  Naturally, ancient history and myths are given mighty weight as reasons behind the quest for a<br />Greater Serbia.  Trying to hold on to provinces like Kosovo are not part of some Greater Serbia pipe dream.  Imagine a Mexican-dominated southern state trying to secede in the future.<br />And as one reviewer has pointed out,  one of the most offensive bits is the real working over that Judah gives Orthodox Christianity.  I'd like to see Judaism or Islam put through such a ringer, with major figures undermined and traditions marked as bizarre and strange.  Real nice.<br />All three major Balkan leaders of the 1990s should share some blame for the carnage of those wars, but it's only the pesty Milosevic who gets the brunt of it.<br />Thankfully, enough time has passed for a wider array of accounts to appear on the Serbs and the Balkan Wars.  Judah bites off quite a bit, but it's clear that he's already decided how to digest it.blame for the carnage of those wars, but it's only the pesty Milosevic who gets the brunt of it.<br />Thankfully, enough time has passed for a wider array of accounts to appear on the Serbs and the Balkan Wars.

US	52357858	R2ZKBAB1Y8WL9P	0515133078	58080034	Never Dream of Dying	Books	1	1	4	N	N	Never again	After enjoying James Bond novels for the guilty pleasures they are, I finally have to put them to rest with Benson's latest `novel'.  I may pick up a Bond book one day, but it will not be a Benson.<br />Ian Fleming's novels are finally back in print in the USA, and I would encourage everyone reviewing here to pick them up and read them all.  Fleming was very good at what he did.  Bond was a perfect character to go to the movies, and he has endured as a character well past the Cold War.<br />Bond was resurrected for the page in the early 80s by spy novelist John Gardner, who churned out no less than 13 Bond novels in about 15 years.  Some were good, some were awful.  It became clear that Gardner was not very interested in the legacy or the character of Bond.  His books seemed to be about a guy named Bond who was a secret agent.<br />Raymond Benson, super James Bond fan and indeed president of a fan club, was given the mantle to write these books.  Not a novelist, Benson did good research and came up with good stories to work Bond and UK interests in.<br />Unfortunately, he is a bad writer.  A non-writer.  His books alternate between long descriptions of everything Benson learned on his fact-finding missions to the locales featured in the novel, and then he cuts over to action, bad dialogue, more description, and even went so far as to include some nauseating and embarrassing sex scenes.  He cannot write a novel where all of these elements blend into a solid story with sharp plotting and clear characters.<br />Benson is obsessed with Fleming's Bond.  However, he is not obsessed with attempting to write prose that even approaches John Gardner, let alone Fleming.  The results are incredibly disappointing and downright silly at times.  I don't know how well these have been selling, but it seems like the literary franchise of Bond has been destroyed.  While each new Bond films takes in more than the last, Bond books just keep getting more upsetting.<br />I couldn't even finish this book.  After resurrecting characters Fleming created and killed, Benson's plotting is very shoddy, skipping out on Bond for whole sections.  The lack of anything approaching engaging prose made me put this, and Benson, down for good.<br />I gave him a chance.  I endured most of `the Union' trilogy, which is a sad attempt to resurrect SPECTRE.  It doesn't have to be this bad.  Glidrose needs a pro writer who can up the stock of Bond books.<br />Not recommended.

Eyes Wide Open does become as much about Raphael as Kubrick (if not more) but it still works to paint Kubrick as human, something that reams of analysis, criticism and speculation consistently fail to highlight.<br />Rather than fawning on Kubrick over the slim length of the book, Raphael continually reminds all that HE himself is an intellectual, blah blah blah, and the tone becomes hard to bear.  It's not particularly cohesive or earth shattering, and the conversations that appear in transcript-like form work to put words in the director's mouth.  However, it's still valuable in that it offers a rare glimpse into working with the elusive Kubrick.  I would take this with a grain of salt, and Kubrick's family did not appreciate this effort in the least, denouncing it on their website.<br />It may still be of interest to people who want an inside view (albeit skewed) that the many tomes dedicated to breaking down Kubrick's small but mighty canon of films don't bring to the table.<br />But be warned: with Kubrick gone, it's Raphael who tries to get in the last word...	2003-10-08
US	52357858	R33H9JV3R5XXPB	0802140122	65240666	Twelve	Books	2	6	7	N	N	Less and Less Than Zero	This is a young-adult book dressed in Bret Easton Ellis' clothing.<br />Twelve has fooled many people into thinking it should be sold along with other serious fiction.  It also appears to have fooled a lot of critics who raved about it, and even two respected writers who added their blurbs to the jacket.<br />Nick McDonnel's family is in the New York literary elite.  So stop wasting your time trying to qualify a book that should never have been published in the first place.<br />Twelve does not resemble Less Than Zero--it's an out and out [imitation] of that book.  Less Than Zero is not a very good novel to begin with, and finding that we live in an age where it is now some kind of blueprint for young writers is scary.  However, I believe Ellis has fulfilled his potential with his later works.  Perhaps McDonnel can do the same; after all, with a best seller in his teens he'll get the chance.<br />Twelve reads like a writing assignment that hasn't even gone through rudimentary editing.  I doubt anyone wanted to touch it up too much lest McDonnel's powerful editor-father put in a phone call.  It leaves the reader in limbo along with the protagonist, teenager White Mike.  Taking a year off after private boarding school and deferred at Harvard, he's a low-level drug dealer, selling his wares to people he has grown up around but now has little use for.  He goes around town, detached from his surroundings, not really close to anyone anymore.  Sound familiar?<br />The title refers to the drug that brings a number of characters together, however it is hardly explored.  The murder story that puts the plot in motion is practically forgotten as soon as it comes up.  Entire characters are introduced and dropped.  The author gets cute by making some chapters consist of only one sentence, a device a good author might actually put to real, stylistic use.  Again, this book doesn't even<br />Plot spoilers?  Please.  If you can't see the awful and clich&eacute;-ridden Columbine-inspired ending hovering like a mile-wide UFO from the first few pages, you just might be raving about this book.  The characters are rich.  They live in townhouses.  Their parents are never home, and when they are, they just don't care.  They kids do drugs.  They drink.  They party.  Have [physical relationships].  You see where this is going.<br />It's hard to rip a first time author who wrote this in high school, except for the fact that the book has been published widely and reviewed widely and pops up on shelves everywhere you go.  Hey, I bought it.  I like Ellis, but it's sad to see him aped in such poor fashion, right down to the italicized flashback format and the random, bloody violence (Claude's amusing cheek-pop).<br />Save your money.

(In Casino, Joe Pesci played a character closely based on Spilotro.)<br />The problem with this book is that it's misleading from the start.  This book is not really about Spilotro all that much.  Bill Roemer penned Man Against the Mob and then his ego must have really swelled.  Roemer spends a good portion of this book talking about himself.  When he's not reminding the reader that he's brave, courageous, strong, a lawyer, a former boxer at Notre Dame, and an all around good person, he name drops about a thousand other law enforcement people involved in taking down mobsters.  It makes you wonder about the ridiculous amount of money and resources dedicated to busting the Mafia; meanwhile, a guy like Spilotro managed to stay out of jail for a good portion of the time he was muscling Vegas.<br />Roemer didn't know Spilotro all that much.  He admits this, and yet his book just goes on and on.  He only met Spilotro a couple of times, and Roemer reminds us that he's so brave that he wasn't afraid of 'The Ant', a nickname that Roemer is proud he helped coin.<br />If you're interested in the story behind Casino, book and film, then this will be of interest.  It has a few insights into some of the other characters, but there isn't enough about Spilotro, who must have been a bit more complex than Roemer thinks if the guy had the kind of street power he did in Las Vegas.<br />While Pileggi's Casino is a bit too Lefty Rosenthal-centric, The Enforcer is a bit too much Roemer to handle at times.	2003-08-18
US	52357858	R281Z76UO9W6ER	0571199860	342149898	Kubrick	Books	5	4	4	N	N	We were waiting	This book has been held in high regard ever since it first appeared.  Earlier editions were becoming collectible and were always disappearing from libraries.<br />I guess it was safe for a reappearance following the passing of Stanley Kubrick and the completion of his body of work.  The book has been reworked beautifully, including all of the amazing color photos, essays, and interviews from before plus some new additions, namely chapters on Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut chapters.  There are additional interviews with various collaborators.<br />In short, in the wake of Kubrick books that sprouted up following the director's death in 1999, Ciment's Kubrick ranks right at the top.  It's a gorgeous volume, and the interviews (done by Ciment following Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, and The Shining) are some of the most enlightening words from the director.<br />Highly recommended for the Kubrick fan and the film buff.  Also recommended is Thomas Allen Nelson's Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze.	2003-08-18

It's about how screaming about how evil liberals are, and then turning around and doing the same thing--name calling.  Slander.<br />I've had many a good laugh thumbing through this in bookstores since I will not think about paying the conveniently bloated price for this book.<br />Ann Coulter is either:<br />a) insane<br />b) very smart and very rich from exploiting idiots<br />In the assembly line of people dedicated to making 'liberal' a swear word, Ann Coulter takes the cake.  Over the past 15 years or so, certain factions of the Republican party have latched onto the Next Big Thing when it comes to vitriol: Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter.  It's old, folks.  It's disgracing that party.  Liberals are not separate species.

Since this book appeared in 1998, The Doors--sans John Densmore, who had an iota of self-respect--have played Las Vegas.  Thank God Jim Morrison didn't live to see his bandmates mutated into an embarassing lounge act, singing his songs in the performance graveyard that is Vegas.<br />It's clear Ray Manzarek does not like Densmore.  It's clear now and it's bitingly clear in this book.  Ray Manzarek has a real go at the history of The Doors, rewriting it exactly as he'd like it to sound in his mind.  Ray conveniently ignores entire albums, tours, and other events in favor of waxing on about the chi, about how unbelievably incredible The Doors were and still are.  He has a lot of love for Jim Morrison, but even this is tinged with a nasty shade of green.  Instead of facing the fact that Morrison had a serious drug and alcohol problem, Manzarek creates an alter ego for Morrison known as 'Jimbo'.  See, it's all 'Jimbo's' fault.  Jimbo is the redneck alcoholic idiot that Morrison would become at random times, not the regular Jim Morrison who was a brilliant poet and all around nice guy.<br />You can imagine why he hates Densmore.  Riders on the Storm, Densmore's version of the story, clearly shows that the drummer felt guilt over Morrison's spiral downward.  Densmore came off as honest; he didn't beat the reader over the head with endless babble about Dionysus or the Age of Aquarius and the massive amount of acid Ray appears to have taken.<br />Meanwhile Manzarek would rather attach some kind of cosmo-spiritual explanation to Morrison's decline.  He claims to have seen the spirit literally leaving Morrison's head the night of the final Doors performance in New Orleans in 1970.  It's embarassing, it's manipulative and it speaks volumes about Ray's character.<br />Ray always looked like an erudite.  He was well-spoken and he loved Morrison, backing his friend up as a serious poet.<br />However, Ray comes off as vindictive, clouded, and plain silly in this book.  He has a serious beef with Oliver Stone, referring to him as a fascist, a term Ray still throws around like it's 1968.  Ray was horrified at another version of The Doors' story by another artist since Ray wants it told according to hiw own memory.  Unfortunately, what Ray remembers is very selective.  This book spends eternity to reach the release of the first Doors album in 1967 and the same year follow, Strange Days.  Ray just doesn't want to get too involved in the REST of The Doors' days.  He hardly makes mention of the fact that after Morrison died the band kept going, releasing two studio albums and touring.  Conveniently, those two albums STILL have never been released to CD.  As with their impressive resume of doctoring live albums, The Doors are unmatched in selling the same material over and over while keeping the stuff fans really want tucked away (hence the boxset delay and its underwhelming content).<br />I would recommend this strictly as an offical version of the story from one of the band.  However, be very careful in reading Ray's story.

It's black box recordings of doomed flights.<br />If you're interested in knowing what happens in the final moments of an airline disaster, of seeing part of the human drama as well as the resolve of a skilled crew working to the very end, this is something for you.  It can be creepy, but there's an insight into these events that the news can't capture often.<br />The transcripts, which usually pick up right before the real disaster begins (an engine going, etc) are presented with a little bit of backstory and commentary.  There is not a lot of technical info to assist a reader unfamiliar with the flight crew's jargon and not enough information about each of the 28 flights (some of them near-misses) chronicled.  As another reviewer noted, there is no indication of time in the transcripts to more fully reveal how the events unfolded.<br />In the end it's fascinating to find these collected here; many of the tapes having never been reproduced.  I'd recommend it if you think you might like it.  Some people might think you're disturbed if they see you reading this, but that shouldn't stop you.  Again, it's not very technical, and basically focuses on just the transcripts, but it's in a niche market...	2003-06-19
US	52357858	R3CTLDA5NCTQ65	0375703845	939433309	Glamorama (Vintage Contemporaries)	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Fashionable terror	A few years after finishing and reviewing Glamorama, I still feel like the novel is an over engineered project. For a writer who has never been concerned with traditional narrative or plot, Ellis' most plot driven book is not a whole lot of fun and is emptier than most of the models in its pages.<br />Ellis has made a career out of moralizing about the empty world of American consumer culture at the end of the 20th century. People with a lot of money, a lot of time, and very little to show for it all walk around looking great and mistaking each other for someone else (though it never seems to matter in the end). Occasionally, they feel something akin to emptiness, but they're usually too wrapped up in their own world of Xanax and restaurants to do anything about it.<br />Glamorama includes everything Ellis has done before, and then some. There's a sense that the novel got a bit out of control, even if it is the most plot driven work he's ever done. It should probably be two separate books.<br />Victor Ward is the \\"It boy\\" of the moment, a young model/actor/ beautiful person. He's floating through life in a haze of other beautiful people, fashion shows and booze and drugs and a sadly repetitive lifestyle that is, in fact, going nowhere. Ward is recruited by a mysterious figure who possibly works for Victor's US Senator dad to track down an old schoolmate in Europe.<br />Long, long story short, Victor becomes tied up with a cell of supermodels turned international terrorists. They blow up stores and subway stations and passenger jets. They murder and torture people. Their motives are never clear. And in the end, like Patrick Bateman's crimes, they may be imagined.<br />Ellis throws in a number of devices that half work and half tire the reader into a submission where we're too worn out to really care about them at novel's end. Is there a real film crew making a movie around Victor? Is the film crew in his head? Are the constant references to confetti everywhere, and an awful smell, and a song playing somewhere in the background reminders that this is not real?<br />I ask because I thought that unlike American Psycho or the short pieces from The Informers the story was suffocated by the trappings and the details until it seemed like none of it mattered. That would be fine if Victor Ward was likable or interesting enough to hold our attention. But he's as shallow as everything around him. Also, with the onslaught of celebrities and fame and glitz, there is absolutely no indication that anybody in Glamorama has anything inside of them--anything--that would indicate why they are famous to begin with. Perhaps not models, but maybe actors or musicians or other artists. There needs to be some kind of talent, some spark, that would set these people apart from anyone who is good looking but just not famous.<br />Ellis himself has said that he's not sure if he's going to write novels anymore after this. I don't think there's a whole lot more he can do with the milieu he launched into at a very young age with Less Than Zero. I think he really hit a stride with American Psycho. Patrick Bateman was funny, he was silly, he was vulnerable--all elements that came out clearly when the book became a film. And whether or not the murders and the rapes were all in his mind or not, Bateman was still somewhat likable; at the very least you could laugh at him. I think Glamorama would be unfilmable, that Victor Ward cannot possibly carry a story.<br />This is a difficult book to recommend. It is not Ellis' best work. However, those who enjoyed American Psycho will find the first half of the book treading familiar ground and may enjoy it. There is nothing new here, though. Even the sex and violence, described in excessive detail (an entire chapter dedicated to an airline disaster) do not hold the reader the way they did in American Psycho. Oddly enough, these scenes in Glamorama actually seem less important to the plot than they were in American Psycho.In the end it really does look like a work that took the better part of ten years, a project where the wheels came flying off yet the book kept moving.In the end it really does look like a work that took the better part of ten years, a project where the wheels came flying off yet the book kept moving.	2003-06-18

This time it's a boy, a young man a few years older than the teen Andrea of that book.  Mitch is 23, in between menial jobs, not in school, and generally going nowhere.  His family involvement is minimal and with no encouragement from those around him to do<br />anything, he does nothing.  User refers not so much to the familiar drugs and booze of twentysomethings but to the use and attempted use of those around him.<br />The problem is, Mitch isn't even good at it or good at anything for that matter.  The thing he does most expertly is smoke a cigarette, as Nelson writes repeatedly,<br />\\"He smokes.\\" ..., which would sum up the main character.  Broke, bored, and with little personality to get him more than sex with people he doesn't even care about, there is no request for sympathy and none given.  Stealing something here and there, bumming a ride, trying to get into a club for free (\\"I used to work here\\") all sum up the not-as-cool-nor-fun-as-it-seems life of a slacker.<br />Nelson has a smooth writing style that makes this a fast read.  However, it comes off as a watered down version of the kind of young and the useless stories that Bret Easton Ellis began in the 80s with Less Than Zero.  Ellis is both loved and reviled, but one thing has become clear.  In the years since Less Than Zero, Rules of Attraction and even American Psycho, he looks that much better compared to the competition.<br />Not to say that User is going for the same thing.  The reference to Less Than Zero on the back cover is ill-advised but undoubtedly inserted to sell the book.  (Hey, I bought it!)  And that's part of the problem.  Don't expect a Less Than Zero for the end of the century.  This book basically meanders through the few weeks (or was it months?) in the life of Mitch.  There's no real plot and there is no pretension on the flip side.  No larger statement that is present in Ellis' work (even though that author prefers the sledge-hammer to the head form of subtlety to get his point across.)  As a slice of post-grunge youngsters with nothing to do and nowhere to go (through their own doing I might add) this is harmless enough.  It's only occasionally insightful but actually seems less mature.  Mitch is a less consistent narrator than Andrea in Girl.

This poorly titled book should be called \\"Goth Guide\\", as it is essentially a guide of what is what in the \\"goth\\" world.<br />It seems that the main issue with this movement, or subculture, or whatever, is exactly that--the difficulty, impossibility, and at times downright refusal by its own members to accept any form of ghettoization.<br />Which in many ways is good, since who needs more stereotypes and uniforms one must adopt in order to enjoy a Cure record. However, it is also doomed to be an obsolete term that will no longer really map itself to anything definitive.<br />To give a good example of what this guide really is, take the Bands section and look up The Sisters of Mercy. This section really just reviews the band website for bands considered \\"goth\\", or just bands that people who like bands considered \\"goth\\" also seem to like. Anyway, author Mick Mercer, credited on the back as the premier \\"historian\\" of the goth movement (er, right) completely rips the band, Andrew Eldritch, and the website because they no longer contribute to the \\"goth\\" movement that made them so popular.<br />And why? Well, do a little outside reading and you'll find that Eldritch doesn't speak with Mercer at all since The Sisters of Mercy have made a concerted effort to distance themselves from the Goth label. Therefore, they get lousy ratings.<br />Remember when a certain small college in the Northwest suddenly stopped talking to US News and World Report? Sure enough their rating dropped to the bottom the next year, simply because they didn't take part in the survey.<br />Who's going to blame Eldritch for no longer wanting to be associated with a \\"movement\\" (which sometimes resembles less a movement than a fashion stance and a continued imitation of a few bands from the 80s) that never really moved past a certain point and has become popularized to the point that mall stores dedicate fashion gear to it?<br />Mercer slames the band for not \\"contributing\\" to the scene in a long time.  What does that mean exactly?  I wouldn't exactly describe much of what The Sisters did after Floodland as gothic rock.  Even today as they tour and present new material (slowly, that is) the sound is not The Sisters of old but a new incarnation with a more industrial tone.  Whatever.  The point is that the band was considered important, but now that they no longer want to wallow in some 80s notion of what gothic rock is they get discredited.<br />Back to the book, which I don't even own but flipped through in a bookstore one day. You'll find all the latest bands who are considered \\"goth\\", I think, as well as stores, clubs, web sites, etc. Mick Mercer has his own cottage publishing industry on the ever-difficult to pin down \\"movement\\" and will most likely continue to update this guide enough times to resell it over and over.<br />However, as a one-stop resource for bands and shops and clubs, it's well-assembled.  Heck, this would be a perfect web site, but I doubt Mercer could get people to subscribe to it for money.e.  What does that mean exactly?

It's bad like the three before.  And it's probably as bad as the countless that will come after it.<br />Given the massive success of the recent Bond films with Pierce Brosnan, I'm puzzled why Glidrose chose to dumb the franchise down and ignore any chance of a bigger market?  007 is a brand name icon, so why didn't they try and get bigger and hire a more high-profile writer?<br />Maybe Bond has become too cinematic.  Nevertheless, for some reason that I may understand one day, Glidrose asked Raymond Benson to write.  Not a writer, Benson was more like the biggest James Bond super-nerd fan club president.<br />Doubleshot suffers the same wounds of all Benson efforts.  The man can't write--he can't put together different elements of a story in any kind of enjoyable order.  We know he does extensive research because he basically describes the vacation he took to research the place.  He's incapable of weaving suspense, character development (Bond behaves very, very stupidly in this entry, I'm beginning to worry) or action into all of the settings he describes.<br />Doubleshot gives Benson a chance to blab on about all he knows about bullfighting.  Wonderful, I feel enlightened now.  No opinion has Benson, whereas Fleming made known what Bond liked and did not like.  Benson is so contrived that the new Bond books can't be considered on any sort of serious level, even as comic books.  They're just...there.<br />There is no doubt that John Gardner was a better writer.  Sure, Gardner didn't really like Bond nor have a particular reverence for the character, but at least his writing was smooth and professional.  Benson couldn't fill Fleming's shorts.  Fleming was a guy who did what he wanted to do and enjoyed life, dropping dead in his fifties with a massive heart attach brought on by smoking, drinking, heavy food, and just being manly.<br />Raymond Benson, in the many interviews he's done and the many articles about him, does not strike me as a very wild and crazy guy.  He looks like he once drove his car 95 mph on the highway and that's about it.  Fleming knew how to dress.  Benson is a Haggar wrinkle-free guy.  Fleming would be appalled by Rockports.  Benson, well...<br />Avoid this novel UNLESS you are a die-hard Bond fan (the reason I'm here trashing this thing).

I don't know why I chose to review a novel I read about 11 years ago in early high school now.  My English teacher had some contempt for it.  But for some reason, part of the novel stuck with me.<br />Sure, it's Lois Duncan, who pretty much cranked out young-teen books and owned a big part of that market.  Dependable writing, generally.<br />Killing Mr. Griffin stays interesting because it's about a psychopath who manipulates other students into the title act.  It's not told from the killer's point of view; the story is all from the most sympathetic female's pov.  Nevertheless, in this day and age of post-Columbine, Ritaline-addicted youth, this book is powerful in the high school setting.  I think it highlights the apathy and coldness of young people and the misdirected rage.<br />Duncan is not fancy.  The storytelling is straightforward.  But the sinister plot to freak out Mr. Griffin followed by the sudden death and the actions of the guilty group make this a pretty quick, compelling read.<br />My English teacher must have thought this was popular drivel, but I think with age it takes on relevance and still works.	2002-09-08

Anyone who doesn't like Ellis should read this book and then read Ellis just to see how much better he is than you think.<br />This is an extremely poor novel.  The subject matter is nothing new at all, but that doesn't even touch on how lame this effort is.  The writing is amateurish, even for a first novel.  I know it's been said before, especially in these reviews, but without famous parents Molly Jong-Fast's slim novel would never see the light of day.<br />If you think Ellis writes about characters we can't possibly like, check out Normal Girl.  The protagonist is Miranda Woke, a burnt-out 19 year old Upper East Side Jewish girl who has spiraled into a coked-up, alcoholic waste of life.  She displays little if any intelligence or even insight into drugs and her lifestyle.  She illicits no sympathy.  She goes to rehab, which has a chance for some interesting moments, but no.  We get nothing.  Storylines are brought up and then dropped or simply never explored.  Friendships are made and forgotten, insights touched upon and never followed through.<br />Basically, this book gives us nothing new about society kids and their problems.  If anything, it makes us scoff even more, especially when we learn just how much of this novel is autobiographical.  Wow, Ms. Jong-Fast was in rehab, was an alcoholic, and has cleaned up her life, and is now in her early 20s.  Big deal.<br />I can't stress enough NOT to spend your hard-earned money on this.  It is poorly written to boot.  Entire dialogue sections are so clumsy we can't tell who is saying what.  The rudiments of writing a novel are not there.  Perhaps the author will improve, but not without any more of my money.	2002-06-26

People either go along with him or wind up reviling him.<br />This is his first novel, and to be honest, if you're new to Ellis, I wouldn't start here.  I believe his best novel is American Psycho, by far.  Less Than Zero shows the promise he would develop in his later work, and so it's strengths lie there.  It's not a great book at all and shows the immaturity as a writer (he was only 20 when he wrote it).  But all of the important elements of his fictional world are present.<br />The characters are empty people who search for something resembling joy in their decadent world of too much money, drugs, fast cars, absent parents, and a general zoned-out removal from the surroundings.  Ellis taps into an aspect of depression that is very powerful--the sense of no feeling, of nothing mattering anymore.  I don't think you can underestimate his ability to transport you effortlessly into these worlds.<br />However, it certainly isn't to everyone's tastes.  Scenes of grotesque violence are present in all of his works, and their appearance is often depicted as routine as the designer labels of the characters.  There is a beautiful understatement to his prose sometimes.<br />Again though, this is not Ellis' finest hour.  Read American Psycho or even The Insiders before checking out his beginnings and you'll see that he has developed.  Ellis is an author worth reading at least to form an opinion.  He is too often attacked by those unfamiliar with most of his work.	2002-05-13

At least 10 of the stories in this book were 'adapted' for the big or small screen.  Most of the films were bad (some were appalling) but the titles will catch people's eye and hook them.  Most of the stories are rather short, and that works to their benefit.<br />Many of the tales collected here are missing...something.  A motivation, an explanation of SOME type, a likeabe character.  Children of the Corn comes off as the scariest, in my opinion.  Just plain creepy.<br />Meanwhile, Gray Matter was just plan...weird.  Not scary, just bizarre.  Over time, an old man turns into a giants, disgusting and slimy gray blob.  It may have something to do with all the beer her drinks, but...<br />Sometimes They Come Back is unsatisfying in its ghost story setup, but The BlackBoard Jungle-type setting and character development work well.<br />Trucks is, of course, the source for one of the worst Stephen King films of all time, and also one that he directed: Maximum Overdrive.  This is a very short story, and it has a simple point, if you can call it that.  The machines are striking back.  That's it.  Very bad film.  But because people love us, they made ANOTHER version of it, using the story's title.<br />Battleground is something out of a bad comic book.  Toy soldiers attack a man.  Not a bad treatment, but a little bit more here would have been better.<br />Graveyard Shift is creepy and atmospheric for most of the way, but the characters are way too weak.  Another inspiration for another bad film.<br />The Lawnmower Man.  Nothing at all to do with the film.  This story is just plain bizarre.  Not scary, not creepy.  Just freakin' weird.  King must have been on something when he penned a few of these.<br />All in all, a lot of this stuff resembles a Twilight Zone-eque world.  Think Tales From the Darkside but maybe a little better.  And sometimes worse.  Best apart about this book is the variety and amount of stories.  King is a great storyteller, say what you will about his writing style.  He hooks readers and in this book he keeps the tales short and often sharp.<br />I'm nowhere near a King afficionado, but I would say this is probably a pretty good start if only to appreciate his maturity and superior handling in the novels he wrote right after these stories.es.

A teenage boy who once went through \\"a phase\\" of murdering others gives us a peek into his mind in this incredible debut by Scotsman Banks.<br />The narrator, Frank, is not your average teenager.  Not by a long shot.  There doesn't seem to be a normal person in his entire family--or what's left of it.  An obsessive father with more than his share of issues, an insane brother who has escaped and is returning home, a multitude of bizarre aunts and uncles, a flaky, irresponsible mother, oh, and a brother and two cousins that he killed.<br />Frank describes the murders in great detail, and also gives us a serious justification for them, all the while mentioning his sanity like it's a given fact.  But compared with what is around him, Frank is far from the worst.  Isolated on a small island connected to a town via bridge, Frank doesn't officially exist on record.  The island is his hunting ground, and he has grown into a large child, complete with even more elaborate games and rituals he can play and perform alone.<br />It's difficult and perhaps unnecessary to note the lengthy plot, because this is a page turner, though it doesn't present itself as such right away.  This is a careful novel that takes it time and reveals it's secrets at an excellent pace.  And it has quite a few surprises for the reader.<br />Personally, I found this novel to be a tremendous influence on Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho.  I can't recall from the interviews I've read from him, but Ellis must have read this book and read it well before or during his crafting of American Psycho.  Both novels are in the first-person of someone who is supposedly less than sane, thus offering very graphic yet flatly related and highly descriptive scenes (that naturally wind up shocking us).  Both novels offer murdering narrators who share a similar, obsessive style of carrying out their days.  (In both books there are scenes of what is pure routine to the narrator--routine but important).  In both narrators there is a clear hatred of another people--most notably women.  When you read Frank Caulderhame, you can notice the elements that Ellis liked and worked with in Patrick Bateman.<br />Nevertheless, this is a very fine debut for Banks.  It was probably much more shocking back in 1984, but today it retains a distinct voice and all of its scares.  Banks has the reader look where most people don't ever want to look, and that's always important and noteworthy if not to everyone's tastes.<br />Highly recommended modern novel,especially if you like bizarre tales, are an Ellis or American Psycho fan certainly, or just want what has been called one of the \\"Top 100 Novels of the Century\\".

The novel turns out to be as playful as the jacket, with plenty of comic book color thrown in.<br />It's the adventure of Billy Chaka, an American journalist working for Cleveland's best-selling Asian American zine.  Covering a handicapped Olympics in Tokyo he finds himself thrown into a wild adventure involving beloved geisha girls, the yakuza, and other characters culled from the Japanese underworld.<br />There's plenty of action, as Billy usually resorts to fits of martial arts in many situations.  And there's a lot of humor derived from Chaka's observations on Japan and the Japanese and especially on geisha girls, with whom he is obsessed.  Also a bit of un-PC humor which is refreshing.<br />This is something a little bit different and a very playful novel.  I'd recommend it as a quick and fun read.  I'm sure Adamson has more Chaka adventures in the works.  His writing is, for the most part, smooth and confident.	2001-08-09

Yet again Benson has some nice touches here, including Bond's mental torture.  But that's nothing compared with the torture Benson has inflicted upon die-hard Bond fans for the past 3 years.  With his high school English prose Benson can't even approach John Gardner, let alone Fleming. In this entry Bond does some incredibly stupid things and credibility is stretched even for a Bond story.  Do I really need to talk about the story?  It's well-researched, more or less, but the writing is so bad, so amateurish, that only my love of Bond can keep me reading.  And make no mistake, I will continue to read Bond novels, and most likely I will continue to be severly disappointed as long as Benson is at the helm.	2000-09-28

It's hard to think of another book that has had an American Psycho-like impact in terms of reader attraction/revulsion.  There are the legions of people who despise it, and these are often people who have refused to read  it (so there's your explanation right there.)  But walk into a college  bookstore and what will you find?  Stacks of this book in plain sight, and  being scooped up by curious people just wanting to see what the fuss is  about.  Finally I picked the book so I could see what it was all about, and  before I looked up I had read about 80 pages already.  A very swift 399  pages is American Psycho, and I also found myself laughing out loud quite a  few times.  This is the blackest of humor, downright demented at times, and  if you give it a chance it is incredibly funny, often in a disturbing way.   Read it once and you might find the violence so disturbing as to distract  from anything else and taint the book.  Buy look at it again and you find  that Ellis has made Patrick Bateman...a dork(!)  (Indeed, this is how  Christian Bale imagined the character in the film.)  The violence is never  the point in this book, but it is cut into a ludicrously-painted world of  money run amok that it HAS to be over the top.  Does it matter that the  violence is real or not?  Ellis doesn't care.  There is no plot and it  works best that way.  Patrick Bateman is an ongoing monster: the yuppie.  It's a book that people love or hate.  By far the most disturbing fact is  NOT the violence, but the fact that incredibly vapid people like Bateman  and his crew really exist, and are out there withdrawing hundreds of  dollars from ATM machines FOR NO REASON...	2000-06-04

With Milosevic defending himself in the Hague for years, literally, one wonders what a Franjo Tudjman trial would have been like.<br /><br />Perhaps he would have cited this book, which reads like a prescient defense of himself in court for his own war crimes, though this never happened as Franjo checked out in 1999, while Slobo was still in power.<br /><br />What he is explores is of merit though.  It's mostly history, not as much philosophy, on WWII, Croatian atrocities, demonizatoin and propaganda, and the attempt to recognize the horrors on all sides.  And his policies would seem to follow right along.  Too bad Milosevic didn't pen his own academic ode to the horrors of war, but he doesn't seem to need it.<br /><br />Interesting document from the late Croatian figure who led his country to independence, and got some pretty clean hands and some US help.  And good PR.  And good timing.  He died before all sides could finally come to the table and admit that, yes, we committed some horrendous atrocities.  That some of Franjo's cronies are flying to the Hague shows the luster is fading a bit.	2000-06-03

Thomas Harris is very good at what he does, but I was a bit surprised that he so obviously wrote this novel as a screenplay in so many parts.  There are lazy, lazy descriptions that could  have been taken straight from a film script, and of course Hannibal was  snatched up and is being made.  In this third entry we get more of Hannibal  Lecter.  We even get a background on him, which I don't mind but which has  caused some major disappointment from fans.  I think that Harris fudged the  timeline a bit though.  Silence of the Lambs appeared in 1988, the film in  1991.  In Hannibal, we learn that Lecter has been free for 7 years, yet  everything points to the film taking palce in 1999 or 2000.  He has also  made Lecter almost superhuman in terms of intelligence and other ability.  And Clarice Starling, who disappears for long periods in this overlong  novel, seems like a tired creation, as if Harris became sick of her  personality, which was never well developed to begin with.  And no mention  of Will Graham of Red Dragon, he being perhaps the authority on Lecter?  Well, it will be interesting to see how the film presents the ending, which  is really a bit far out.  Hopefully though, this is the last of the  Hannibal Lecter books.  Until Harris is offered another 75 billions dollars  for a novel and the rights.	2000-06-01

It's a shame  really, because Christopher Wood and John Gardner actually rose above the  standard movie tie-in book with their own novelizations of earlier Bonds.  But Benson is an out and out hack. (Somewhere in Tomorrow Never Dies he  actually writes a sentence like, &quot;The car was completely  destroyed.&quot;)  I would recommend this book only to die-hard Bond fans  that buy all of the books.

This book is completely shameless and absolutely embarassing to read.  It  is a disgrace to everyone it purports to tell the story of.  Biskind picks  the most crash-and-burn directors and really goes to work.	2000-05-05

He does a couple of things well: making up Bond stories for the modern era, and paying tribute to Fleming (but in details only).    Otherwise, the novels are just poor, very poor.  Raymond Benson used to write game modules, so his sense of plotting is very linear, perhaps too linear.  Matter of fact, he should ditch the novels and volunteer to write the excellent EA Bond video games, since this would make use of his penchant for plot and his stories, and we wouldn't have to read his embarassing prose.      How or why Benson was given this job is a great mystery, perhaps proof of how low Glidrose regard the Bond literary franchise.  The novels could appeal to a broader crowd if they had a real writer, someone who can actually write prose.      The story concerns a cheap attempt at resurrecting SPECTRE, this time called the 'Union'.  The setting is mostly mountainous, which could have been interesting (Benson probably read Into Thin Air and a lightbulb crackled somewhere) but once again, a decent idea is ruined with amateurish writing.  Benson prides himself on writing a more 'Fleming' Bond, but sadly he doesn't realize his own absurdity.  Fleming was very good at what he did, and his novels still hold up.  Benson is not even in the same league.  Fleming himself would gasp and die another death if he read one chapter of this novel.      Avoid Benson's Bond books at all costs.  They have cheapened and destroyed (probably for good) the James Bond literary world.  Even during Gardner's worst he could at least write well.	2000-03-11

Despite whatever was going on his personal life that made him take time off, he tried to pack too much into this work.  It feels very  labored, and there are too many devices which impede the story from moving  forward in any satisfying way.  Most notably, the whole idea of the  different film crews running the show.  Also, Victor is too unlikable, and  frankly, too stupid of a character to justify nearly 500 pages of his  little journey.  The story goes awry when he leaves New York on the QE2,  and the terrorism, of course described in loving detail by Ellis, including  pages and pages of description of a place crash, is utterly  without  poignance.  Even the sex scenes are unnecessarily over the top, almost  numbing and certainly pornographic.  Overall though, a must for Ellis fans  I guess.  There is quite a bit that is downright hilarious in this book.  It just feels a lot less complete or neat as American Psycho, if that makes  sense.	2000-02-26

You can already see his influence on a number of younger writers today, and hey, for better or for worse, it means something.  To call his writing  'blank hyperreality', as one critic on the UK edition jacket did, is very  accurate.  Glamorama is very ambitious.  It took Ellis nearly 8 years, but  in the end it seems like 2 or 3 books he tried to sell as one final 90s  statement.  If you are looking for a return to the style of American  Psycho, his masterpiece, this is it.  But somewhere when our protagonist is  on the QE2 the book changes too much.  The whole device of having everyone  in the novel being filmed by two different camera crews is just  unnecessary--a grand, pretensious idea that Ellis, instead of abandoning,  hangs onto until it almost completely mucks up the story.  As a matter of  fact, the last 50 pages or so make no sense on first read, or second.  But  the journey there is generally smooth and entertaining.  Suffice to say no  one with half a brain in Hollywood should ever touch this, or any of Ellis'  work.	2000-01-22

Ray, you have got to be kidding me.  It's as if the book was going  too long, the author was told to get it done, so he breezed through five  albums, tours, Miami, the trial, etc.  No talk about the 1970 tour?  All  the different shows?  So many stories?  THAT'S what the people wanted to  hear.  Not eight hundred thousand references to Dionysus and the chi and  why LSD is so great.  The amount of pro-drug talk in this book should get  Ray put away in the clink!  I think the last thing the author needs is more  acid.  I like dealing with whole albums and all of the songs in one  chapter, yet from Venice Beach, 1965, when Ray hears Jim sing  &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; to him up until the first album takes FOREVER  to get to.

Not only is an American writing about England's greatest spy, but an absolutely awful writer at that.  Fleming was incredibly smooth, his books flowed cleanly  without causing one to stop too long and think about them.  Benson tries  too hard to put continuity references into his books--ok, we get it  Raymond, you've read all of the books 800 times--instead of concentrating  on any real writing or insight into Bond.  The action is lame-the most  exciting points involve reaching new heights on the mountain and trying to  figure out who the villain on the mountain is, even though we find out  early.  No surprises here folks, just another limp attempt to introduce yet  another SPECTRE-type organization with yet another cliched terrorist group.  And their calling card?  How original!

I snatched up the latest Bond book which has just appeared in some London bookshops and read it immediately.  Once again, I felt something really lacking with Benson's effort.  First of all, and once again, I am perplexed  as to why Glidrose chose someone who had never written a novel to pen the  new Bond books.  John Gardner was an established spy novel writer already,  and even though his Bond books could often be a mixed bag, he had a very  smooth, deliberate style most of the time.  Benson is strictly an amateur  in the writing department.  He sometimes wallows in exposition, or worse,  has the characters wallow in expository dialogue so that he can explain the  history of (pick a book) Hong Kong, Cyprus, X organization or whatever.    High Time to Kill finds Bond tackling the Himalayas, which is a potentially  interesting location for a Bond book (think Benson was reading a little too  much Into Thin Air?)  However, once the book gets to the mountain, with  Roland Marquis, an old school rival of Bond's, the story comes to an almost  deadly halt, despite touches of action.  The chapters climax with each new  height in meters that the climbing team reaches, en route to a McGuffin  called Skin 17.  ::Yawn::   The third tallest mountain in the world, while  good for a documentary or true life account, makes for an incredibly boring  Bond novel setting.  Granted, there are some very solid elements: the  Bond/Helena Marksbury relationship, twists at the end (who is behind the  Union), and some other points about Bond's life but Raymond Benson is,  quite simply, a poor writer.  He can't put all of his Bond knowledge, the  exciting locales or the action, into any type of engaging form or prose  that rises above standard cliche-ridden books of the Bond ilk.   It is all  too obvious that he writes consistently with a movie deal in mind, and that  he is (still) praying that EON options one of his novels.  John Gardner, in  my opinion, never did this.  In fact, Gardner even used SPECTRE in THREE  novels AFTER the it becames clear (with For Your Eyes Only and eventually  with the non-official Never Say Never Again) that the films were finished  with that whole thing.  Gardner books like The Man from Barbarossa, Never  Send Flowers or No Deals, Mr. Bond never felt like movies so much as a  different and intriguing type of Bond novel (not to say that those books  didn't have their share of flaws.)  &quot;The Union&quot;, the ::yawn:: new  secret criminal organization behind the mayem in High Time to Kill are  given nothing in the book to distiguish them from any of the countless  organizations that Bond has faced before in Fleming and Gardner books.   It's downright cheesy and cliched.   It's a mystery and a damn shame that  the task of writing the world's greatest spy character has been handed to  someone clearly not capable of following his predecessors except in a limp  way.  One can only hope that Benson's contract is up shortly and that the  job is given to a real writer.	1999-04-30

For a while, the only books by John Gardner I had ever read were his James Bond novels.  I knew he was a spy novelist for years so I finally picked up a different book of his (Confessor) and I loved it.  I also realized how DIFFERENTLY he wrote when he wrote non-Bond novels.  I  don't think he put one half of the effort into some Bond novels that he did  into other, non-Bond books.  His style and writing is exactly the same in  all of the Bond novels with the exception of COLD FALL, which reads like  Gardner loosening up and writing more freely (probably since he knew it was  his last Bond.)  SEAFIRE could have been great, but once again Gardner does  a shoddy job of bringing together potentially interesting story elements.  The villain is the next Hitler (um, didn't Bond fight the next Hitler in  ICEBREAKER?) who has something to do with destroying the Caribbean with an  oil spill while inventing a new way to control oil spills (I still don't  know what the Fourth Reich and oil spills have to do with each other.)  Bond proposes to Flicka von Grusse (and we all KNOW she will die for that.)  However, I give Gardner credit for changing the Bond world with his OWN  series, and not keeping everything static like all of the movies.  He has M  on the verge of replacement, Bond being promoted, a new committee watching  the other committees.  John Gardner wrote some good Bond books (Death is  Forever, No Deals, Mr. Bond, Icebreaker) but there are times when he seems  to rush them or just not care about Bond or the books themselves.  Seafire,  quite often, feels like one of those times.	1999-04-13

Benson is not even a  good enough writer for a screenplay novelization.  He has zero style and  zero feel for character.  It's like he's describing the action as simply as  he can and making it so distant that even as simple as the book is it  becomes taxing to get through.

The man wrote more Bond novels than anyone else, and while of course Fleming was the original and the best, Gardner turned out some very good books (as well as the inevitable  bad ones.)  But he was a good, established writer, something Benson clearly  is not.  He's just over his head trying to write novels.  Gardner was not  perfect, heck, he had me wanting something much more plenty of times, but  he at least had a good formula going often, which is what Bond is all about  in book and film--formula.  The writing from Benson is so bad, and his  attempts to recall Fleming are almost pathetic.

I guess sworn statements and  scientific proof by experts mean nothing, huh?  Hey, I have a Van Gogh in  my basement and it's real.  Know why?

Dumas may have had access to a few more  interviewees than Fuhrman but he did not have the Sutton reports nor talk  at all about the autopsy.  Bottom line: Fuhrman is (was) a cop, Dumas is a  journalist.  What does this mean for you, the reader?  Well, if you're a  fan of true crime you will probably appreciate Fuhrman's concentration on  the case and the murder itself.  Dumas is too flowery in his language and  he even goes off on a 20-something page tangent all about the extensive  history of Greenwich, dating back to the Vikings(!)  That's great for a  history book but does not have a thing to do with the murder of Martha  Moxley and is completely unnecessary (re: padding.)  Dumas also speeds  through the developments of things years after the murder, lingering on  only the first few years after the 1975 killing.  Of interest is the  reporting of Fuhrman's presence.  The problem is also that Dumas has no  real opinion of the case or of the identity or motive or carrying out of  the murder.  Fuhrman comes up front and reconstructs the scene in a very  detailed manner and explicitly names the killer in his mind (Michael  Skakel.)  Dumas is content sitting back and feeding you this strange place  called Greenwich.  But anyone interested in this case will most definitely  read both books.  Dumas' book is better read after the more case-involved  Fuhrman book.  Fuhrman will hook you more to the case first than Dumas  will.	1999-01-21

For years I always had the feeling that he wanted to write another mammoth book about a Mob family but something stopped him  from doing so, so he dabbled in it in all of his books.  I hope for his  sake he at least got a huge advance to write this 500 page, cliche-ridden,  at-times-laughably-bad &quot;Mob&quot; story.  Don Clericuzio provides some  of the funnier moments in the book since he speaks in poetic strides,  spitting out wisdom along with ricotta cheese.  Speaking of cheese, I  wouldn't be surprised if Puzo takes the money and runs from this and  retires.  If he picks up his pen again he should be forced to sign a  contract with the publisher that states he cannot write about his  fairy-tale Mob(s) anymore.  Of course, if he doesn't write a book with the  Mob, what the heck is he going to do?  He can't write about anything else!   Everyone loved The Godfather.

His discription of Dr. No is fantastic and the character,  or the little we learn of him, is one of the more intriguing villains in  all of the Fleming canon.  However, his early and rather laughable demise  just stinks of having nothing to do with the whole setup.  There was a big  blank after the death of Dr. No and I was like, huh?  The whole point was  to dump bird crap on him and wrap up this whole complicated mission.  Oh  well.  It's still a Fleming Bond, and I have yet to read a &quot;bad&quot;  one.

After all, the man penned  the mega-seller and incredibly famed Godfather novel and films and probably  hasn't a made buck off of anything else he's done.  Every time he tried  other things that didn't quite sell like the tales of the Corleone family  he must have wondered, &quot;what's it going to take?  How can I get  another huge hit?&quot;  Well, after twenty odd years or so he said to hell  with kidding myself and the readers of all generations.  Let me just return  to what I know best: the Mob.  It's like he's whoring himself to himself.  Exactly what planet is the Mob Puzo writes about on now anyway?  Has the  guy learned anything since he wrote the Godfather about the Mafia?  He  writes the Claricuzio family in the near-present alomst exactly like he  wrote the Corleone family in the 1940s.  Mr. Puzo, you know, times have  changed in organized crime JUST A BIT.  Appalachia, Joe Valachi, the  Chicago outfit, John Gotti, etc.  Have you read anything about the real  Mob?  If the Claricuzio family was so smart and powerful, why, 30 years  after the opening or so are they still gangsters?  Are you too dumb to go  legit and make big bucks all the way and buy respectability?  I guess it's  just that bad blood mixed in from the Santiado family that throws the whole  plan of the venerable Don out of whack.  Proof of the prostitution of Mr.  Puzo was the immediate TV mini-series of The Last Don, which, quite  honestly, for a mini-series was not bad.  (Witness awful literary  translations like the ABC Shining one.)  Then, the absolute most shameless  thing: Last year's Mario Puzo's The Last Don II, which Puzo had NOTHING to  do with except that they were his characters which he probably signed over  for a decent buck only to have half of them killed and the  &quot;closure&quot; at the end of the original mini-series and novel erased  for the sake of fast-food TV entertainment.

Books	5	1	3	N	N	By far the best True-Crime book of 1998	No matter who reads this book, one thing will become apparent to all: Mark Fuhrman is a flat-out good detective and a professional through and through.  His book represents the best that police -and-detecitve-written  true crime has to offer.  It is never boring, it teaches the reader quite a  few things about detectives and detective work, it uncovers new details and  presents intelligent and informed and never overblown speculation about the  unsolved murder of Martha Moxley.  Frankly, I would feel very confident  with Fuhrman investigating the murder of someone close to me.  However, the  book also has relevance in other areas tha nthe murder of Moxley. This is  the story to some degree of Fuhrman post-OJ Simpson mania and his  interaction with other people who obviously want nothing to do with a  marked man.  I don't think there was a better opportunity for Fuhrman to  pen another great book than this case for a number of reasons.   His  connection with Dominick Dunne brought him into the case, the case deals  with a rich and powerful family covering up about a brutal murder, the case  also deals with mishandling of evidence and all kinds of botched procedure  by investigating police, etc.  Fuhrman goes step-by-step through the  available facts and evidence and the evasive Sutton reports to paint his  own picture of what happened that night in 1975.  The chiller is knowing  that the killer of this innocent girl is alive and well and probably still  hopping from one clinic and institution to another under the cover of his  family and attorney(s).  After reading this book I anxiously look in the  news for stories about developments in this case.  It would be insane not  to finally try and indict someone for this after this book.  Mark Fuhrman  may have had to retire early and move to a farm in Iowa, a man ruined by a  very disgusting character-assasination, but I can't applaud him enough for  refusing to lay down and keep quiet.  As he says, he is and always willbe  a detective.  I can't wait for another book from him.	1999-01-12

I think it is impossible to slam this book too much because, simply, I found it to be one of the best researched and constructed Bond novels in a long time if not ever.  No one can ever fault Benson thus far with his  first 2 efforts.  The man takes the time to research and put together a  fantastic story.  BUT, no matter how much I liked the story and the  characters and the action the prose and writing of the book are all too  often just plain poor or amateurish.  Ian Fleming was so smooth and never  too wordy, and John Gardner had his own smoothness and solid style, but  Benson's writing is strictly high school much of the time.  Descriptions  and action scenes read so simply it makes you wonder if the guy really  cared.  And to read him in interviews he constantly mentions that he is  writing Fleming's Bond.  Why not write Bensons's Bond?  Fleming died 35  years ago.  We don't need a copy.  We need someone who loves Bond, and no  doubt Benson does, to create great stories, which he does, and inject HIS  OWN perceptions of Bond without trying to copy all the Fleming-isms.  And  please, if you must Mr. Benson, take some prose and fiction writing  courses.  I love Bond and I believe Benson truly loves Bond but the vapid  prose is too damn ugly to lift the Bond novels to a higher and more read  and respected level, which, with the quality of the research and the  stories, they can reach.	1999-01-12

For fans of  unsolved crimes this book is a must-read, involving an interesting  setting--a wealthy, secluded community--coverups, disturbed characters,  police foul-ups and Fuhrman's own taste of the people and police of  Greenwich, who mostly shunned him in his attempts to learn more about the  crime.  I anxiously await Fuhrman's next book; with more efforts like this  he can establish himself as a highly capable and very important true crime  author.  Reading Fuhrman  I immediately found the best of what true crime  from a law enforcement officer can provide.  True crime is either from a  journalist or from a former cop or agent.  Fuhrman is never boring and his  approach to the case is very professional.  It would be exceptionally silly  if potential readers were turned off simply by the name Mark Fuhrman.

I have not read Sleepers, but I am going to guess from what I have heard  that it is a better book than Apaches.

Unfortunately, most of the good ideas  get cancelled out by some rather ludicrous ones.  Most of the main  characters are just plain shallow, and they are often hard to distinguish,  filled with stereotypes.  While reading this novel I kept thinking that it  felt like Carcaterra wrote it expressly to be turned into a film, namely  with some big stars and lots of gunshots.  The ending belongs in a Rambo  film, and even the idea of setting it in the early 80's loses any relevence  after a while.

He takes the above and whittles it away with amateurish writing and an unprofessional atmosphere.  It's like taking a steak and dipping it in peanut butter.  What a waste.<br />I read this book and really wanted to like it.  The story is a good one, and it's relevant to current events.  The situation between Cyprus and Turkey has been sitting stagnant for years yet it could still go off in a second.  Some strange stuff happening as well.  What is with Bond's car, his Jaguar that, if I understand Benson correctly, could survive a nuke.  Not enough to have missles, guns, oil slicks.  Now Bond's car has skin and armor that's so powerful you wonder what kind of engine is in that thing to carry that tank around.  <br />It gets boring quickly when you know Bond can't get harmed in his car.  He doesn't even have to drive the thing.  Who knows, the Bond of the future may do his mission from his flat on a laptop and cell phone while Moneypenny cooks and cleans for him.<br />I just can't accept Raymond Benson as a novelist.

I see there are about 100 reviews already of this book, but I had to add my $0.02.  I think we have to try and accept that the Mafia Puzo writes about here simply does not exist, as it is a bit too fairy-talish and old fashioned.  But, fairy tale does not mean bad.  Puzo is giving us a modern day setting but it seems like he wants us to dream that a Godfather-type Mafia still may exist or even COULD exist.  I love how the Clericuzio family wields incredible power and yet the Law poses little or no threat to them.  Yeah, right.  Well, it is nice to read about good 'ol Don Clericuzio, who now in his wise old age speaks like a poet and spouts the great wisdom he has learned in his eighty-somewhat years.  And naturally he has a strict code of ethics--he thinks that assasinating the President of the United States (in order to be able to legalize all gambling and clean up in the casino biz) is the MOST heinous thing one can do (it's a damn bad thing, granted) and YET he heads the most powerful crime family in the country, making his fortune on, essentially, breaking the law.  Interesting sense of civil ethics and duty he has.  But then again, if it weren't for the wide open space of America, he wouldn't be the top gangster.  One note though:  Um, wouldn't legalizing gambling destroy one of the Mob's central money-making operations?  And also, with the Clericuzio controlling Vegas casinos (didn't Puzo see Casino and realize that the Mob simply can't control casinos anymore?) the legalization of gambling across the USA would HURT Las Vegas!  Why fly out there when you can gamble in your hometown?  Cross's casino, the Excalibur, would lose $$$.  Also, I would like to see Mob have as big a hand in a major movie studio or a major casino like in THE LAST DON and get away so clean.  Very romantic notions that Puzo provides.  Well, it is a very entertaining summer read, or subway read, or beach read, etc.  THE GODFATHER is much more polished, and of course, better.	1998-05-02

Following the very disappointing BROKENCLAW, here Gardner gives us a different Bond story--one with very little action, lots of plot, and yet, a real page turner.  This is certainly one of the most political Bond stories, and it is concerned with issues in the headlines at the moment (or from 1991), namely the Gulf War and also the shaky state of the former Soviet Union.  The story concerns a free-lance terrorist group--The Scales of Justice--demanding the trial of a former Nazi SS officer largely responsible for a massacre of Russian Jews in Barbarossa during WWII.  They claim to have the real man, but meanwhile the French Secret Service have captured another man whom they believe is the criminal.  An agent of Mossad--the Israeli Secret Service, a Russian KGB official, James Bond, the French Secret Service, and various other spies all engage in a plot to unravel The Scales of Justice.  What they uncover is an ambitious Russian general with plans to sabotage the crisis in the Gulf War by sending a nuclear strike among other things to the United States.  There is a lot of plot and very little action--pretty much all in the next to last chapter or so.  And yet it is very carefully laid out by Gardner, who doesn't give us an unbelievable love story nor a completely ridiculous ending as he did in the preceding clinker BROKENCLAW.  In BARBAROSSA Bond finds himself confused about his role in the mission, and he also finds that a number of the people around him are not who they seem.  One of the best elements is the way Gardner weaves an exciting tale involving elements from real-life modern stories and situations in the world--the Gulf crisis and impending war, the state of post-Communist Russia and quests for power.  There are a number of intriguing characters and some great scenes, such as M receiving the news that 007 has been killed.  Bond is not the central figure all of the time--he finds himself neck-deep in a complicated web of intrigue.  The writing is certianly an improvement over BROKENCLAW, as!  is Bond's relationships with the opposite sex here.  Some may be disappointed by the greater presence of story and by the fact that action takes a backseat, but give BARBAROSSA a chance indeed.  It is very well written, tightly plotted, and frankly very exciting.  Do not disparage the name Gardner when it comes to Bond.  Although this is more of a solid thriller and less of your typical BOND story, it is a welcome addition to the canon.an improvement over BROKENCLAW, as!  is Bond's relationships with the opposite sex here.

There is some really solid action and Bond is also given a very believable reason to go after Mr. Big, the villain (what else could he be with that name?)  Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA chum, is mauled by sharks.  (This part of the story was not in the film Live and Let Die but was rather used in the later film Licence to Kill.)

I don't know, but I think that somewhere along the way the wheels came off of this particular Bond vehicle.  Brokenclaw is a fast read, kinda fun, but in the end it is rather disappointing, and the ending itself is, in my opinion, pretty ridiculous.  The villain--Brokenclaw Lee,  a half Chinese,half Blackfoot Indian gangster who controls most of Chinatown in San Franciso--is intriguing, but by the end of the novel, after the ludicrous showdown between him and Bond, it seems a shame that we didn't get more about him or his plans.  It feels like Gardner was going fine and then sort of jettisoned a number of elements and fine setups and instead rushed to end it nicely in the (usual) 300-page format.  And when all is said and done, a lot of things are just pretty damn unbelievable, even for a Bond story.  For instance, and perhaps most strikingly, is the relationship between Bond and &quot;Chi-Chi&quot; (a code name), his Chinese female partner on the case. Hardly knowing each other they seem to fall in love like that, and the finale involves Bond entering into a completely ridiculous one-on-one matchup with Brokenclaw all because he has to save Chi-Chi because he would do ANYTHING for her because &quot;love stays.&quot;  Um, is this the James Bond we know?  Certainly Bond would save a damsel in distress, but here it seems rather cheesy, because the love and attachment is unconvinving at best.  I mean, Bond beds down with gals on every case, so what made Chi-Chi so special?  I don't know, and neither does Gardner seem to.  It's frustrating.  There really isn't a lot of action, but the book is never really boring either, and that's a good thing.  Gardner sacrificed some more involving elements for the sake of a quick, smooth read.  'Tis a shame, because the story and the villain especially have potential.  As a matter of fact, I am pretty disappointed with Brokenclaw, especially since the beginning and parts of the middle and even some nice details are wasted.  We never get to learn too much about Brokenclaw's plans, they are mentioned and taken for granted.  There is Ed Rushia, a good supporting character, and M has a bigger part than usual in it.  I can't totally knock the book because I enjoyed many parts, but as a whole, Brokenclaw seems lazily slapped together toward the end, the romance just plain cheesy and trite.
