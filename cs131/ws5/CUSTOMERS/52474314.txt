Bad guys beat up good guys.  Good guys really beat up bad guys.  Bad guys . . . well, you get the idea.  The excessive violence is accompanied by excessive sex, with various characters going to bed with each other for no good reason.  It seems that Lehane has finally succumbed to the difficulty of writing a series:  he has run out of ideas, and is filling up pages with graphic content that he hopes will sell.<br />The characters are also less interesting or even stereotypes, including an unethical psychiatrist, a dysfunctional family, and a sociopathic ruthless criminal.  The latter two are all too reminiscent of previous Lehane novels.<br />I hope that there will be a sixth Kenzie/Gennaro story. I also hope that Lehane waits until he has one of his uniquely original plots before he writes it.	2001-05-07

I read it once a decade ago and a second time recently.  To decide whether you'll like it, consider the following.<br />Structure:  Durrell is writing spatially as well as sequentially.  The first book, Justine, leaves gaps in the reader's knowledge to reflect the gaps in the narrator's knowledge.  The second book, Balthazar, retraces the same material and fills in some of the gaps as the narrator learns more.  The third book, Mountolive, tells the story in the form of a traditional novel (third person) and fills in most of the gaps.  The fourth book, Clea, is set later in time; it once again leaves gaps to reflect what the narrator doesn't know.  This is a fascinating approach, but to enjoy it, you must be willing to endure unanswered questions that reflect the narrator's lack of knowledge (including some, in Clea, that will never be answered).<br />Introspection:  The characters spend a great deal of time looking within themselves, trying to understand their motives and desires.  This can be interesting to those who like psychology.  But the characters spend so much time introspecting that it becomes annoying.  They are so self-centered, so hung up on everything they themselves do and wondering why they do it, that after a while one longs for a character who is more interested in someone else than in him/herself, more interested in action than in endless thought.<br />Style: Durrell is a wonderful wordsmith.  Some of his sentences will stay with you for a long time.  And he paints vivid word pictures of Alexandria.  But that is also a problem:  he paints, and paints, and paints.  After a while, even readers who much prefer character-driven fiction to slam-bang potboilers will long fervently for something to happen.<br />Characters:  If you like detailed descriptions and analyses of secondary characters, you may find characters such as Scobie enjoyable.  If you don't, the extended timespent on such characters will become a tedious digression that slows down the story to a snail's pace.<br />Plot and philosophy:  If you've spent a a fair amount of time wondering what love is, why some lovers are manipulative, why some love is destructive to the lovers, why and how people destroy their own loving affairs because they don't understand themselves and their motivations, this quartet will provide you with considerable food for thought.  But if you regard love more as something to experience and feel than to analyze and interpret, if you believe that you're pretty much in control of your emotions and won't fall in love with someone who's bad for you, if you regard love as something fairly straightfoward and relatively easy to understand rather than as something highly complicated and abstruse, the lengthy reflections and ponderings of the characters will probably drive you up the wall.<br />Culture:  World War II Alexandria is of course far different from the contemporary United States.  If you like exploring different cultures and peoples, you'll like this aspect of the quartet.  But if you like to identify with the characters in a novel as a way of getting into the story and better understanding yourself, you may find that these characters and locales are too different for you to do so.<br />Overall impact:  Tbe book reads like a lesiurely and luxurious immersion in words, words, words.  This can be sensuous and enticing.  It can also leave the reader with the feeling of watching a craftsman put on a show that, ultimately, has little lasting impact.<br />There is much in the quartet to admire.  But there are also serious negatives.  For me, the considerable effort hasn't been justified by sufficient rewards. Which is not to say that I won't go back some day and try it for the third time.	2001-05-04

As always, he takes you in a direction you don't expect with plot twists that are impossible to predict but not unfair.  I'd have preferred Angie to act differently at the end, but that's a minor quibble.  The downbeat plot conclusion is necessary in order to emphasize the social criticism that Lehane wants to make, and the most important motives are highly original, even mind-boggling (can't be too specific here as I don't want to give things away).  (And yes, the prologue and epilogue make excellent sense and add considerably to the intrigue and impact of the story.)	2001-05-02

The answer is an emphatic yes, and this is where to begin (Lehane's books must be read in order, because he divulges earlier secrets in later books).<br />Lehane is an excellent writer, there are unexpected twists that even the most sophisticated reader is unlikely to guess, he includes interesting and thought-provoking social criticisms, his protagonists are likable, and gore is kept to reasonable limits necessary to the plot. Lehane is far more interesting than James Lee Burke, whose protagonist is all too reminiscent of John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee and who repeats themes too often (bad guys beat up hero, hero gets even by punching out bad guys, et cetera).  If you like mysteries and/or crime stories, Lehane is well worth trying.	2001-05-02

As always, details are important and attention must be paid.  What makes this one special is that characterizations, Shakespeare's Othello, and Freud's belief in the  extensive dark side of every human personality play an equally important  role.  &quot;Curtain&quot; is psychological and literary as well as  mysterious.<br />A few nits can be picked:  the villain's personality might  have been fleshed out in more detail, one or two clues may be of borderline  fairness.

This is an engrossing story, a fast-moving tale with memorable characters  and a heart-warming ending.<br />&quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; is the tale of a  brilliant street urchin who's recruited to help Earth win a life-or-death  war against the Buggers.  The science fiction aspects of the story are  skillfully done, as is a moving account of Bean's growth from hardened  self-centeredness to caring and maturity.  The novel works beautifully on  all levels.<br />If you haven't read either book, starting with &quot;Ender's  Game&quot; avoids spoiling one major and several secondary surprises.   Also, recognizing certain scenes that were described in more detail in  &quot;Game&quot; adds to the enjoyment.  However, &quot;Ender's  Shadow&quot; can stand on its own.  Both books are well worth your time and  money.	2000-05-23

Learning all of the material in this  book, if you can, should improve your test score.     (2) The  multiple-choice questions can help you detect areas in which you are  weak.<br />Negatives:  (l) The essay questions bear no resemblance to the  essays on the Psychology A/P Test; practicing on these is a complete waste  of time.    (2) The multiple-choice questions are not similar enough to the  ones on the A/P Test; Barron's questions are more representative.    (3)  There are some errors and misstatements.  For example:  p. 1, psychology is  the study of behavior AND MENTAL PROCESSES; p. 13, statistics are ALWAYS  calculated on samples (a number that refers to a population is called a  parameter); p. 12, inferential statistics ARE USED TO DRAW  CONCLUSIONS/INFERENCES ABOUT A POPULATION BASED ON  DATA OBTAINED FROM A  SAMPLE and are NOT limited to testing differences between groups; p. 135,  The Oedipus complex in Adler's work OCCURS AMONG CHILDREN WHO WERE PAMPERED  BY THEIR MOTHERS AND WISH TO CONTINUE THIS &quot;SPOILING&quot;.   (4)  The  book is not well written; some material is too condensed and difficult to  read.   (5) The chapter-ending quizzes are a waste of time--too brief and  in the wrong format (the A/P test does not have fill in the blanks).   (6)  As with any review book, important material is omitted; but it also spends  too much time on material that is very unlikely to appear on the test.<br />In  sum:  Spend most of your time studying your textbook and class notes and  practicing on previous Psychology A/P Tests.  Then read Barron's and try  those sample tests.  If you're highly motivated and have extra time, then,  perhaps, spend some time with this book.	2000-05-22

Pluses:  Excellent writing--smooth flowing, some memorable lines, realistic  dialogue.  A troubled, introspective protagonist, reminisicent of John D.  MacDonald's Travis McGee.  A fast-moving plot.  Change-of-pace fantasy  conversations with Civil War figures, brought on by a drink laced with LSD  by the bad guy. Minuses:  Burke's bad guys are always one-dimensional,  sociopathic, no complexity of character.  The new skeleton in Robicheaux's  closet is one too many; too many bad things have happened to him; not  believable.  Readers of other books in the series will be familiar with the  scene where Robicheaux goes over the edge and gets too violent and the  scene where he's on the receiving end. Worth a try if you like good writing  and don't mind plot devices similar to other Robicheaux novels.	2000-01-12

Unfortunately, this places most of his story beyond human comprehension.  The alien dog-like race is interesting and appealing, but the human  characters are not.  Vinge makes the error of placing Johanna and Jefri in  peril and killing off their parents far too soon (this is not a spoiler; it  happens by page 25), before we've had a chance to know them and care about  them.  Nor does the appeal of Vinge's writing come close to that of Bester,  Heinlein, Asimov, or other noted science fiction writers.  If this book  represents the best of modern science fiction, as the blurbs and some  reviews claim, modern science fiction is in bad shape.	1999-11-18

Morrie Schwartz showed a remarkable courage facing his difficult  death, and Mitch Albom cares a great deal about Morrie. Morrie's words ring  true, and if we all followed them, we'd be better off.  But too little  space (and depth) is devoted to each idea, and too little recognition is  given to the difficulty of changing oneself for the better.  As a result,  it's unlikely that Morrie's words will have a lasting effect on anyone.   This is the kind of book that one reads, nods sagely at the advice, sheds a  tear or two--and then goes on behaving exactly as before.	1999-10-29

This is a wonderful reflection on the innocence we lost in the Viet Nam era, with interesting, multi-layered characters you won't soon forget. There's little terror or suspense, so  don't look for that here.  And it's possible to find some minor quibbles  (though perhaps the cartoonish nature of the characters in &quot;Low  Men&quot; is all in Bobby's mind, a way for him to rationalize not helping  his friend?).  But if you like characters so real you can hear them  breathing, people who are trying to deal with life's difficulties as best  they can (even as you and I) and who can never escape the child they once  were; if you like a story that's set against the backdrop of one of our  most important and unforgettable eras, and is told imaginatively in five  separate but related segments; if you like an upbeat ending that will touch  your heart and raise your spirits, don't miss this book.  Highly  recommended.	1999-10-16

They're wrong.  Turow's first (&quot;Presumed Innocent&quot;) is by far his best, a fascinating legal thriller combined with a flawlessly plotted murder mystery. Commendably, Turow tries to deal with complicated  and conflicted personalities.  But &quot;Personal Injuries&quot; suffers  from four major flaws:  (1) The two main characters, a con-man lawyer with  some good aspects  and a squeaky-clean FBI agent with hidden problems,  aren't likable or sympathetic enough for us to care about them.  (2) The  characters keep slowing down the story with reflections about their past,  and Turow keeps slowing down the story by describing every character in  detail the first time we meet them.  (3) A character with Alzheimer's  disease who we also don't care about because she's only in the story to  give the FBI leverage over the con-man lawyer--he can't afford to go to  jail and leave her alone.  We never get to know her; all we get is the  depressing details about her illness.  (4) A downbeat ending that leaves  the reader feeling sorry he ever got involved with this bunch of people. If  you're looking for a well-written character study that shows the good and  bad in people yet leaves you with an upbeat feeling, opt for Stephen King's  &quot;Hearts In Atlantis.&quot;  If you're looking for a fast-paced legal  thriller, look elsewhere.	1999-10-12

Not by amassing more wealth and possessions, according to the Dalai Lama.  He recommends that we focus on internal, spiritual issues:  we need to  recognize our connectedness with all human beings, learn to restrain anger  and other negative thoughts and emotions, and develop patience and  compassion for others.  For the way to be happy is by being a good, ethical  person. This is useful advice that can help anyone who takes it seriously.   But self-change is difficult; considerable effort and will are required.   Getting ahead by pulling other people down is widely accepted in our  society, and those who most need the Dalai Lama's advice may be the least  likely to read this book and follow his teachings.	1999-09-15

As with Barry's columns, his prose flows smoothly and his dialogue is  realistic.  But don't expect to find here the techniques of a first-class  novelist, such as conflicted and multilayered characters and carefully  crafted phrases that etch themselves into your memory.  Most of the social  commentary is obvious and sledgehammerish, though there is a very funny  thread involving calllers to a radio talk sports program.

Creamer wisely focuses on  the story, including descriptions of important games that make you feel  like you're on the field with the Babe.  Comments by Ruth's contemporaries  add to the realism. &quot;Babe&quot; gets off to a slow start--a chapter  dealing with Creamer's feelings about writing the book, and more details  about Ruth's childhood than you probably want to know.  But once Ruth  starts playing baseball, the book grabs you and won't let go.  One caveat:   the discussion of Ruth's womanizing, while necessary and not extensive,  makes this book inappropriate for young readers.

But the heroine lacks the appeal of Fast Eddie Felson, and  the conclusion is flat.  In marked contrast to &quot;The Hustler,&quot;  which teaches both Fast Eddie and the reader about the real meaning of  winning and losing, the heroine in &quot;Queen's Gambit&quot; learns little  except to play better chess.  This leaves the reader with a feeling akin to  stalemate:  not a bad novel, but you don't feel like a winner when you  finish it.	1999-02-24

As always, Julian and 1820s London are appealing.  Competent, but not as memorable as the exceptional  &quot;Cut To The Quick.&quot;	1999-02-23

It's  interesting  to read about 1820s London, and Julian is still an appealing protagonist,  but the plot flaws (and for some readers, the sordid topic) make this one  more of a disappointment than a pleasure.	1999-02-23

Sure, it's possible to quibble:  some of  Asimov's characters lack depth, and the trilogy owes a considerable debt to  Gibbon's &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&quot;  Don't quibble.  Read and enjoy a work of science fiction that belongs in everyone's list of  the all-time ten best.  (But skip Asimov's more recent efforts to extend  the Foundation story.  He should have known better.)	1999-02-23

This one is not.  A confusing hodgepodge of ideas that never ring true, &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; illustrates what happens  when a talented author becomes overly self-indulgent and neglects the  requirement of a soundly plotted, clearly written story.	1999-02-23

This entertaining and clever deception, plus the fascinating setting of 1820s  London and an appealing protagonist in Julian Kestrel, makes Cut To The  Quick one of the best mysteries in years.  Don't miss it!	1999-02-23

Yes, and it works very well.<br />   Jason Keltner and friends bicker their way through a mystery that features  computer technology, numerous laughs, various plot twists, and a fast-paced  story.  The main character has a vulnerability that makes him appealing and  interesting, as when he considers returning to a restaurant and asking the  comely seating person for a date:<br />   &quot;Jason didn't feel like leaving  town.  He flirted briefly with the notion of going back into Denny's and  asking the seating person to go somewhere, but there was nowhere to go, she  was probably not there anymore, it was getting light out, and--the most  compelling reason--there was no way in hell he could ever actually bring  himself to do that.&quot;<br />   Any male who has ever wimped out on asking  an attractive woman for a date will identify with these rationalizations  and feel a kinship with Jason.  Present company included.<br />   I could have  done without the final plot twist, and some readers may be bothered by the  absence of any interesting, well-drawn female characters.  However, these  are minor quibbles.  &quot;Coffin&quot; is a compelling, humorous mystery.	1998-09-28
