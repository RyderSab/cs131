US	53032953	R2R946PEGXD5YA	0674016874	55275137	The Evolution-Creation Struggle	Books	5	15	20	N	N	excellent analysis of the distinction between evolution as science and evolutionism as metaphysics	I think M.Ruse is one of the most profitable authors in the CED(creation-evolution-design) debate, this book is literally(was for me) a once-in-the-door-must-read-now book.<br /><br />The book is an extended look at the distinction between evolution as a professional legitimate science and evolutionism as a metaphysical program which uses the science of biological evolution to create and justify it's moral, societal and eschatological worldview. As such the battle between YEC(young earth creationists) and people like Dawkins, Dennett, Gould, Wilson etc is a religion vs religion battle not as it is mislabelled and misunderstood as a religion vs science battle.<br /><br />This book ought to be required reading for anyone who desires to enter into the innumerable online CED discussions, perhaps then something would actually get to the point of reasonable and fruitful conversations there, for without the distinction the argument is endless and worthless. I sure hope this book gets the eyeball time it deserves, especially from those i see everyday posting the same arguments that are category errors because they lack this distinction.<br /><br />The theme of the book appears on pg3:<br /><br />\\"The dispute (between evolutionists and creationists), as we shall see, is more than merely a matter of right and wrong. At some deeper level, it involves commitments about the nature of reality and the status and obligations of humans in this reality. In particular, I argue that in both evolution and creation we have rival religious responses to a crisis of faith--rival stories of origins, rival judgments about the meaning of human life, rival sets of moral dictates, and above all what theologian call rival eschatologies--picture of the future and of what lies ahead for humankind.\\"<br /><br />as he says in a few more pages--this is a clash of rival metaphysical world pictures, evolutionism and creationism.<br /><br />Chapter 1-Christianity and its Discontents<br /><br />Begins with a history lesson, \\"the Reformation did have repercussions and implications that slowly began to undermine the very foundations of Christianity.\\" pg 13<br /><br />It is this crisis of faith that Ruse locates both the beginning of creationism and evolutionism, brothers birthed from the same Western culture, responding to the same growth of secular science and the critical and people upsetting social and cultural changes that undermined the religious certainty that had previously glued together medieval European Christendom. \\"The first reaction to the eighteenth century's crisis of faith was simply to opt out of the conflict. In this view, reason and evidence, made supreme, are tools of the devil, and on the really crucial issues they are deceptive. The way to God is through an open and loving heart, through emotional commitment, not rational choice--that is, through faith and conversion. Thus the Protestantism of the Reformation gave way to evangelicalism, \\"pg 17 The first separation, the first big battle, is epistemological, something i have come to believe over the years and really appreciate how well Ruse ties together pieces i know but didn't fully see related to the big picture, a valuable thing.<br /><br />He then makes a crucial alignment, millennial thinking and apocalytic thinking, in particular, premillennialism with creationism. This forms one of the major threads of his entire argument. But he looks at progress next, seeing it as postmillennialism, secularized and brought down from heaven to earth, applied to all of humanity not just a portion. This is the counterpoint thread to premill, and he associates it with evolutionism. How he does this is the topic of Chapter 2-From Progress to Evolution, \\"the cultural idea of progress led to the biological idea of evolution.\\" pg 28 It is a good and informative chapter, perhaps if you only can skim a few pages this is the chapter to look at first. He introduces the great chain of being and the political connections to both the French Revolution and to Darwin's upper middle class British culture, thus laying the groundwork for Chapter 3-The Growth of a Pseudoscience and 4-Charles Darwin, the real meat of the book and when he introduces his really big idea.<br /><br />Ruse is proposing that evolution started as a pseudoscience which incorporated cultural and social values into a system which only in the 1920-30 became a professional, a real science, as it incorporated genetics and becomes what we now call the neo-darwinian modern synthesis. Chapter 5-the Failure of a Professional Science is the years following Darwin and how the evolutionism domains the field by presenting a science-based ideology that has as it's purpose the explanation of the meaning of life and the human position within it.<br /><br />Chapter 6-Social Darwinism is a short study of H.Spenser and T.Huxley and how they built \\"Popular evolution--evolutionism--offered a world picture, a story of origins, and a special place for humans in the scheme of things. At the same time, it delivered moral exhortations, prescribing what we ought to do if we want things to continue well.\\"pg 122 rengthening the case for the religious nature of post-Darwinian evolutionism was its link to millennial thinking, which began to flourish in a major way in popular culture in the nineteenth century\\". pg 123<br /><br />Progressivism or as Ruse terms it secular post-millennialism is the modern myth that most drives our modern capitalist societies, that evolutionism hooked into this thinking is crucial and most certainly one of Ruse's great contributions to the debate with this book.<br /><br />Chapter 7-Christian Responses, but 8-Fundamentalism is the more interesting of the two chapters. He aligns fundamentalism with the American providential historical idea of the city on the hill, where the common ideology was that God has very special plans for America in His great scheme of things. It was nice to see a line about pew space, a crucial measure i used recently in a class i taught on American Presbyterian history, perhaps that is why i like the book, big pieces of it resonant with me...... He brings up Scottish Common Sense realism, the Civil War as a theological crisis that separated North and South, allowed the North to move more liberally religiously and socially and had the South, home to fundamentalism, react to all these as it separated and isolated after the War.<br /><br />Chapter 9-Population Genetics outlines how evolution began to be a real professional science and slowly ridded itself of some of the more ideological and social values that it had.

Plantinga. It's only 15 years old yet in many places it seems a little dated, surprising for a philosophy text. Written for Christian college students, not necessarily philosophy majors but interested in the philosophic basis of the faith, it is a short, rather nicely constructed, book suitable for Sunday School adult classes as well as personal enrichment. Very little philosophic jargon and great care to introduce and explain new concepts, nice job.<br /><br />The book starts out with what he calls the challenge of evidentialism: the idea that you must have sufficient evidence for a belief to be rational. He uses this to build \\"the evidentialist belief in God\\" theme: 1-it is irrational to believe in God in the absence of sufficient evidence 2-there is either no or not sufficient evidence to believe that God exists. To the theist he offers 3 alternatives: theistic evidentialism means that there is sufficient evidence to be a theist. Fideism that belief in God is either contrary to or irrelevance to the faculty of reason. Reformed epistemology which he contends challenges the concept of rationality itself.<br /><br />Chapter 1 is it possible to prove the existence of God? He looks at the cosmological argument, Paley's argument from design, R. Swinburne's probability argument. And ends up with: \\"the power of a theistic proof is, in part, a function of what one already believes.\\" pg 40. He ends up with the useful distinction of proving something is cogent and persuasive is a personal issue, not an objective, one size fits all, proposition.<br /><br />Chapter 2 is the problem of evil. He early on makes a useful distinction between a theodicy: a justification of God's ways to man, and a defense: to show that it is not irrational to believe that God is both good and powerful and that both natural and human evil exist. subsections 6 and 7, pg 82-89 are perhaps the best writing of the book, i'd start there to see if i'd wish to read the whole thing, although at about 150 pages that decision is not as important as say with a 1000 page book. It is a quick read and sums up current ideas more than introduces new ones. His argument is a defence on the lines of Plantinga's freewill: God achieved a greater good by allowing mankind to be free even though it introduced suffering and evil in the world.<br /><br />Chapter 3 is the heart of the argument for RE, that is that evidentialism is just plain irrelevant to the issues, for God is not a scientific thing but a person, we need to use personal relationship qualities when dealing with God not abstract reasonings as we would with things. This leads to Plantinga's idea that the belief in God is like the belief that other minds exist, which appears to us as an immediate idea not something that we can or ought to reason to, but reason from.<br /><br />Chapter 4 builds on this idea of basic beliefs and reasoning from vs reasoning to and criticizes foundationalism and introduces Plantinga's ideas about T. Reid.<br /><br />I found the book interesting, worth the time to read, despite knowing most of the information (i found Clifford and James in Chapter 3 the most informative and new to me material, you might look there 2nd if you are just browsing the book). It's organization and argumentation are well above average and worth looking at closely as a model on how to write good philosophy.

Engrossed, subdued by the painfulness of the narrative, a little off the beaten track for me as it is a first person account of his life upto about 1993. But attracted to the snippets of reflection and theologizing that accompanies what is a straightforward tale of trust in God in the middle of a cruel war. Simply put God is good and is worthy of our trust but don't expect Him to be safe and protective from the unpleasantness of life and sin in this fallen world. Our battle is with the darkness of evil and with an evil one, who will who will crush and devour us if he is able to, the only security and hope is in the hands of God preserving us not from trials but from spiritual death and ultimate separation from Him.<br /><br />Dear Mr. William Levi,<br /><br />I am sorry to have read of not just your trials and wanderings but of the death and destruction of your people of Southern Sudan, not just for a short period of time but for several generations. I honestly can not explain your hopefulness and joy in the future except as a gift of God not just for your benefit but for ours as well. Materialism and a superabundance of toys has sapped the strength and vitality of the American church for any type of discipline or chastisement by the Lord. We expect God to be safe and to make us safe to continue to accumulate more while not only sharing little but understanding even less of how hard it is to claim the name of Christ in much of the world. The jolt that your book provides that here you are safe in America but spending all your time and energy on Operation Nehemiah when you could be enjoying yourself as do we, is as unwelcome as it is necessary.<br /><br />I am sure that the energy and trust of God so evident in your book will continue to bring you true joy as it enables you to bring help to your countrymen and women who have suffered so much over the last 30 years. In your task i wish you the best of not successfulness but of Godliness and Goodness. Thank you for what must have been very difficult to share your life with strangers as you wrote this book.<br /><br />sincerely,<br /><br />We each have our own story to live out in this world. Some short and bitter, some like William's sad on the surface but joyful underneath. He is the descedent of Hebraic tribesmen who preserved the Hebrew faith in the Horn of Africa for 2 millennium and who became Messanic Christians with the first Western missionaries. But the ugliness of civil war based on religion, the jihad of extremeist Islamatists in Khartoum have killed 2 million and exiled 5 million of his Southern Sudanese countrymen. To retain one's faith at all in these circumstances is amazing, but to prosper, to thrive in the face of murderous and destructiveness of Shar'ia enforced at the point of an AK47 is simply a work of God. To escape from all this, to fight for a university engineering degree and go back to there to struggle is on the surface certifiably crazy behavior. But perhaps that is the final chapter, crazy for God's work is not irrational but trusting in the ultimate trustworthiness which even in death rescues the believer from the evil one's snares. Understanding this world not to be ultimate but preliminary gives a certainty and a trust that the secular and materialist can not comprehend but need belittle as the underminding of all they believe.<br /><br />We fight on different fronts but it is the same battle, his faith and trust are good examples of how American Christians ought to hope in God's strong right arm and not their own. It is a gentle read, even breezy, worthwhile the time for anyone interested in either spiritual things or the battle between Islam and Christianity in Southern Sudan. It is not preachy but rather low keyed observations that ought not to put off even the secular reader, who has much to gain by understanding William's journey.Islam and Christianity in Southern Sudan.

Good idea, pretty good implementation. I learned a lot about Briggs and somethings about Massa.<br /><br />But i ended up wanting more detail and a slightly lower level of explanation. It is obvious that higher criticism is built on historicism (at least to me after reading the book, he does make the case well) but what are the hermeneutical principles and more importantly the underlying epistemological questions that higher criticism was trying to solve?<br /><br />it is certainly part of a greater movement of the 19thC towards using scientific epistemology in religion and in history, but i think he ought to write a second book putting Briggs into context on these lower levels of philosophic thinking.<br /><br />But for an introduction to Briggs and to the years where liberalism entered into the Presbyterian church in particular it is perhaps the most recommended book to me. This was part of a Sunday School class on the history of American Presbyterianism for me and as such was a crucial and important writing for me. thanks to the author, i hope to see more from his word processor. especially something on epistemology of higher criticism.<br /><br />thanks.	2005-08-01

If you are trying to understand Machen i would read his _Christian and Liberalism_ first, then this book, followed by D.G.Hart's _Defending the Faith_, together they form a worthwhile and significant introduction to a key theologian of the 20thC.<br /><br />What is historicism?<br />That history can be understood only as a result of natural forces. That is no supernatural causes are needed to fully and sufficently explain anything.<br /><br />What is liberalism in the Christian Church?<br />the acceptance of the presuppositions of anti-supernaturalism and historicism as applied to the life and death of Jesus and the beginnings of the Church.<br /><br />What did Machen think about the historicism and liberalism of the Presbyterian Church?<br />he was against it.<br />Having fought for 20 years over the issues and the related call to be a seminary professor and a preacher he understood it's significance and destructiveness in the Church.<br /><br />It is competently written, an enjoyable read, well documented for further study, but most importantly passionate. His depth of sympathy for Machen is transferable to the reader, the author's desire that his research serve the greater good of the Gospel is evident and something i am grateful for. Scholars who love the Lord and use their brains to help others to understand their common Faith. good stuff.<br /><br />my heartfelt thanks to the author.<br /><br />best evidence of the quality of the writing are these pull quotes:<br /><br />pg 12<br />As applied to the New Testament, historicist teaching means that the biblical documents and events must be explained as wholly the result of natural historical forces and processes, with the implication that no room was to be allowed for divine suparenatural activity.<br /><br />pg 16<br />Philosophical precommitments (including the naturalistic assumptions of historicism in the prevailing approach) led various scholars toward widely differing positions regarding the proper interpretation of the evidence, illustrating the fact that the presuppositions with which a scholar begins his research often play a large part in the conclusions he is allowed to reach.<br /><br />pg 17<br />whether the Bible is regarded as the written revelation of the living God or as the merely human record of the religious experience of ancient peoples.<br /><br />pg 27-28<br />Rushing up against the prevalent American Protestant view of the Bible, history, and truth-a Bible which was regarded as a revelation from a transcendent God, a history into which such a God could act and a truth which, when once established, is absolute, permanent and universal-came a stream of European thought...The new mentality rejected the categories of the static, the eternal, the changeless, the universal, and defined human existenace (and all other existence) in the terms of growth, development, change, and process.

It fostered confidence in empirical and inductive means of arriving at truth. It promoted a conviction of the necessity and validity of scientific investigation.

Harp of Mind & Media for this opportunity.<br /><br />i hope this review is sufficient to get more books from her, although i'd prefer something a little more difficult *grin*<br />It is not a book that i would have found on my own and i appreciate the opportunity to read it.<br /><br />The book appears to be volume 2 of a set _The Fallacy Detective_ being vol. 1, going to the publisher's website christianlogic confirms this. It also appears that the authors are two brothers, i'd suspect in their 20's. Their purpose is to offer to the Christian homeschooling movement a good introduction to logic at the level of junior high, roughly 10-16 years old. I'd be reluctant to offer or recommend the book to anyone older since they would suspect that i am insulting their intelligence with a book filled with pictures and examples aimed at kids. This is despite an extraordinary need for adults to learn the principles in this book, but the form would be a turn-off to much older than 16. It could be successfully used as a junior high text in a public school system as well, there are a few outspoken Christian examples but the tone of the book is not so religious that people would complain. (the book jacket says 13-adult)<br /><br />Enough about to whom it is addressed. What is the content?<br />Three major parts:<br />first, Tools for thinking, an introduction to logic.<br />second, tools for opposing viewpoints, an introduction to argumentation and evidence.<br />third, tools for science, an introduction to scientific epistemology and experimentation.<br /><br />I appreciate the way the lessons are worded, they do not reflect the common vocabulary (for instance, they don't use the usual latin terms for the fallacies) but rather represent some well thought out personal battles. For instance, lesson 2 makes the distinction between a discussion, a disagreement, an argument and a fight. Lesson 8 is when not to use logic and observes \\"It is never good to be illogical. But sometimes it is best not to speak aloud the logic in our minds.\\" If only i had learned that lesson at 13, or 16, or 25, or 35, well you get the picture. I would have appreciated more of this insightful and talented writing and less childish examples overall.<br /><br />It is the authors' evident desire to arm Christian kids, especially homeschoolers, with the particular tools they need to operate in and argue with a greater culture that is in some ways opposed to their religious or social beliefs. I'd suspect that this is at least partly autobiographical for them, however i don't know more about the authors then i can glean from this one book, i have not read the first volume. (a glance through the website confirms these observations) As a minority viewpoint under some pressure from the greater culture, fundamentalists who homeschool their kids are looking for good textbooks and hopefully websites to further their kids education, (i would hope that the adults embark upon such an adventure for themselves as well) From reading the book carefully and browsing the website, i think the authors are well on their way to providing such a service and at a decent and reasonable level. For what it claims to be, it is a good book.<br /><br />It's evident strengths are a consistent tone, addressed to an audience that is well known to the authors so that the information is directed at them without going over their heads and being confusing. I only wish i had books like this one to recommend to adults to read to learn these importants lessons: logic, argumentation, scientific epistemology. For over my years on the net it has often been painfully obvious that most adults and many Christians do not know these issues and make a confusing mess in their defense of their beliefs. I can see where kids raised on a few books like this can be far better defenders of their faith then even their parents are. So i do recommend the book for the age group as indicated.<br /><br />I have only a few observations that might help improve a subsequent edition.<br />On the exercises, make them more complex, cross a few chapter boundaries with the same example, extending the illustrations and making it a several week project. This is the desire for section 5-Projects, however it is introduced too late and too distinct from the rest of the material, integrate it back into the book, use it as a common thread to unify the entire book, to pull together the reasons for learning to think logically and argue reasonably.<br /><br />On the noticable lack of references(3 chapters together had less than 12 listed), *gong* further reading, website links, etc. Big mistake, the great big meta philosophy and logic sites ought to be prominently displayed and used throughout the book. They are not your competitors, ignorance and stupidity are. Use the networked world to pull pieces of interest into the kids world, stimulate them. How you can write a book on logic and not quote the fallacy files escapes me in this time of books with their own webpages, email lists and discussion groups like this one has.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />Lastly, because of the age group this book is addressed to you must: get and keep their interest, involve them in the process of learning, make it rememberable. I see good evidence that the authors are aware of and interested in these themes, i only wish the principles were applied a little bit better. For the book suffers from being choppy, not incoherent but darting and inconsistently progressive, trying to do too many little things and missing the larger lessons that would unify the book and the exercises.<br /><br />So it is a good effort, needs a second edition with references and weblinks, fulfills a critical need and is well addressed to its audience, a strong B in anyone's analysis.<br /><br />FYI<br />i rescanned the book, just in case something factual in my review was wrong.

US	53032953	R2MP4XEZC44V8K	0195121295	187501543	Religion and the American Civil War	Books	5	22	24	N	N	a must read on the topic	First it is a collection of essays. They are uneven in both quality and in provoking my interest, they cover an odd range of the topic=Christianity and the American Civil War. There is no evidence that the writers interact with the other essays so i believe it is a collection rather than a deliberately written-for-this-book set. So it looks more like an introduction to a body of interpretation than the analysis of that kind-of revisionist history that the essays represent. But several of the essays are extraordinary.<br /><br />Especially the one by Mark Noll.<br /><br />The Bible and Slavery by Mark Noll<br /><br />chapter 2 of _Religion and the American Civil War_ Miller, Stout, Wilson (eds)<br /><br />i've never been moved to write a review of just a single chapter in a book of essays. Tempted several times but i've never done it, this essay is tremendous and deserves a wide audience and careful thought.<br /><br />For me, this chapter has been one of the great ah-ah! just as i thought experiences of the last few years of concentrated studying. I've written in the past that i think slavery as a moral issue and Copernian revolution as a scientific issue are critical events in history that illuminate Biblical hermeneutics. Well, the Sunday School class which begins in about 8 weeks has helped supply the motivation to delve a little deeper in the slavery issue and finding this book and particularly this essay has been a great joy.<br /><br />He writes: \\"The problem of the Bible and slavery was always an exegetical problem, but never only an exegetical problem. ... (then he offers 4 constituencies who offered answers) The first option was to admit that the Bible sanctioned slavery and, therefore, to abandon the Bible, at least in anything like its tradtional shape, in order to attack slavery. (William Lloyd Garrison)...(the second option, since the Bible obviously sanctioned slavery was that) faithful Christains should accept the legitimacy of slavery as it existed in the United States out of loyalty to the Bible's supreme divine authority. (most southern theologians)...A third, and the most complicated, response was held by some abolitionists and moderate emancipationists. They conceded that, while the Bible did indeed sanction a form of slavery, careful attention to the text of Scripture itself would show that the simple presence of slavery in the Bible was not a necessary justification for slavery as it existed in the United States. ... this argument required a movement from the words of the Bible to theories about how the Bible should be applied to modern life, and it often seemed indistinguishable from the next response. (The fourth response) was to distinguish between the letter of the Bible (which might be construed to allow slavery) and the spirit of the Bible (which everywhere worked against the institution).\\"<br /><br />It is this movement from the words to the meaning of the words or the ideas transmitted to the readers that is the essential difference between a conservative and liberal doctrine of the inspiration and authority of Scripture. I've tried to use the idea of a pyramid of interpretation in my Calvin class and will repeat the metaphor in the history class. How the pyramid is constructed is that facts form the bottom layer, the next layer up is low level interpretative theories, mostly about the particular meaning of words in the immediate context. Something like phrase meaning, the next layer is sentence meaning, where it appears that the fundamental meaning of written words appears. (Text without context is pretext.) The layers are constructed inductively from there until at the peak are the fundamental ideas of the text. But what does this have to do with the fight over slavery and the Bible?<br /><br />As Noll aptly points out, \\"From the record of these sermons, it is evident that proslavery advocates had largely succeeded in winning the Bible, when taken in its traditional sense.\\" Because the traditional hermeneutic in the mid 19thC, like the conservative one today, is tied to the words not the meaning as being the locus of inspiration, as being the very vehicle to transmit meaning, the South won this battle. It also ties into the last sentence of the essay: \\"The North-forced to fight on unfriendly terrain that it had helped to create-lost the exegetical war. The South certainly lost the shooting war. But constructive orthodox theology was the major loser when American believers allowed bullets instead of hermeneutical self consciousness to determine what the Bible said about slavery. For the history of theology in America, the great tragey of the Civil War is that the most persuasive theologians were the Rev. Drs. William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulyesses S. Grant.\\"<br /><br />For Noll, these four options are reduced to a forced dichotomy--either orthodoxy and slavery, or heresy and antislavery\\" by the slippery slope to unbelief argument inherent in the idea that to modify your literal hermeneutic was to attack the very basis of inspiration and authority, so that those who spoke against slavery were immediately condemned by Southerners as 'liberals' who did not accept the Bible as the very Word of God. This is the issue that about two years ago had me personally making the connection between a Young Earth Creationist ideology and slavery. The radical dichotomy, the semi-Manichean stance that there are only two sides to the discussion: God's and Satan's, and if you are not with us then you are being used by evil. Noll explains that it is this literal, common sense, man in the pew, democratic hermeneutic that had evolved in the US over the last 250 years that was responsible for the problem. He explicitly ties three things into it: Scriptura sola, the regulative principle, and the Third Use of the Law (moral teaching shows need for salvation as well as a blueprint for the Christian's grateful response to God). It is this democratization of Bible reading and application that has it's source in the priesthood of all believers in Luther but only derives its power from its tie into the social culture of the nascent US in republicanism via the English as opposed to the French revolutionary experience. This democratic hermeneutic required that the fundamental meaning be singular, literal, usually narrative, simple for everyone (the hand on the plow ideal) must be able to read the words for themselves. This eliminates the educated, difficult, literary entanglements, complexity, multiple levels etc for the common sense as derived from the Scottish commonsense realism philosophers.<br /><br />The theological clash brought on by two sides with a radical polarization into atheistic abolitionist and faithful Biblical slavery supporters (the logical error of composition) was driven by not just the rise of loud abolitionists who were also not orthodox Christians but the very hermeneutical problem of understanding how to (re)interpret the obvious texts that supported slavery without subverting the authority and unity of the Bible and becoming those you hate. Noll points out that people believed that there were only three options for this slippery slope of the retreat from the literal views of Scripture: church-authority, the Spirit-enthusiasm, or Reason, all destinations that orthodox American Christians considered abhorrent. \\"With relentless pressure, skillful defenders of slavery insisted that any attack on a literalist construction of biblical slavery was an attack on the Bible itself.\\" sounds strangely familiar, no? Noll goes on to outline four other communities of faith that had potential answers for this false dilemma: African Americans, Roman Catholics, high-church Protestants and the border state Presbyterians, and why each failed to make their voice heard over the din of sabre rattling that lead to the death of 600,000 on the battlefield. (1 white man died for each 10 slaves freed)<br /><br />Noll looks at R. Breckridge and C. Hodge as \\"two conservative Presbyterians who felt the force of the proslavery arguments but who yet retained a desire to shape culture in Christian ways offered the best chance for articulating and orthodox hermeneutic that could escape the proslavery defense championed by their Southern Presbyterian contempories.\\" Breckridge did the separation of the word slavery in the OT and NT from the Southern experience of slavery route. \\"The shape of the argument was similiar for both Breckinridge and Hodge. Both conceded that the Bible sanctioned \\"slavery\\", but Breckingridge denied that what the South practiced was biblical slavery, while Hodge felt that the Bible hedged the practice of a legitmate slavery with so many ameliorations that the practice must end when those ameliorations were pursed to the logical \\"gospel\\" conclusion. ... Both took for granted that the Bible must be an interpreted book and that the meaning of its words must be conditioned by other realities-with Breckinridge, shifting social conditions over time, with Hodge the fuller context of the Scriptures themselves.\\" This is the common way you see the argument pursed today, that OT/NT 'slavery' != Southern racial lifetime 'slavery', all they share is a common word, without sharing the higher pyramid level meanings.<br /><br />Noll ends the essay with tackling the problem of confusing race with slavery and the legacy that continues to haunt the US in this regard.<br /><br />It's a good essay, for it sums up in a particularly valuable and systematic way many of the related issues i've been struggling with, thanks MN.ble reading and application that has it's source in the priesthood of all believers in Luther but only derives its power from its tie into the social culture of the nascent US in republicanism via the English as opposed to the French revolutionary experience.

I appreciate the quality of the writing, the evident research and the passion with which he handles the material.<br /><br />I come to the book as a study to prepare myself to teach an Adult education class at my church on the issues in the history of American Presbyterianism. These sections on the Civil War, it's prologue and aftermath are important ones and i found this a valuable and interesting resource for that study. What i found was a consistent and coherent viewpoint, well argued and amply evidenced, i don't believe i have a bad thing to say around the smoothness or readability of it at all, literally not a dull unreadable page in the book.<br /><br />the ideas:<br /><br />pg 7<br />Perhaps the Civil War illustrates as no other episode in United States history how religion works in a society, how powerful it can be in creating moral preceptions in people which have significant consequences in society. Historians have noted that great irony that evangelical Christianity, once a source of political union, helped to cause the secession and sustain the bloodshed that followed. Patrriots, North and South, cloaked themselves not only in the flag but in biblical rhetoric and religious belief as they went out to fight. ... that religious teaching and belief became the basis for wartime propaganda that may have prolonged the war and made it so severe.<br /><br />Amen. this idea impressed me so much that it forms a crucial thread in my class. thanks to both the book and its well documented evidence that this is what happened.<br /><br />one of the interesting ideas is that the South for various reasons was intensely conservative and looked back at a hierarchical and rather rigidly structured society as an ideal. New ideas were filtered through this backwards looking socio-political structure and if they threatened it, rejected out of hand for their inconsistency with these deeply held ideals. The north on the other hand, due to immigration, industrialization, secularization was not in a position to limit incoming concepts and was as a result more progressive and more experimental. The South labelled this atheistic, abolitionist, and turned every conflict into a moral battle between the forces of Southern goodness and North evil.<br /><br />The chapter that i found most interesting and most useful was labelled \\"Slavery is not opposed to the Will of God\\", partly because it fits well into my own studies partly because it is full of interesting and provocative insights. I appreciate the completeness of the data as he works through the specific ways the 3 main denominations split over the issue of slavery and what were the different arguments presented. Data with good organization, the best you can hope for in a scholarly book, nice.<br /><br />Something that adds to the experience of reading and coming to grips with the information contained is that he uses a consistent and rather colorful and expressive vocabulary:<br />providential theory of history<br />fireeaters<br />immediatists<br />compensated emancipationists<br /><br />i appreciate the ability to quickly recognize what he is talking about even if i was unfamiliar at first with either the terms or the situation. a real plus.<br /><br />the first chapter is on death, how its commonness and abruptness shaped the religious values of the South--\\"This is no our rest\\"<br />the next is a quick introduction to both a Biblical and cultural defense ofSouthern slavery, some of the problems and most of the big ideas---\\"Slavery is not opposed to the Will of God\\"<br />3 is \\"Republican Christianity\\" and is a decent intro to 1)providential theory of history 2)difference between republicanism and hierarchical values inherent in Southern culture 3)<br />4 is \\"Religion has something ... to do with Politics\\", despite the general religious ideal that the Faith and Politics were different spheres, the churches and preachers did get involved. the bulk of the chapter is on how the denominations split in the late 1830's over their inability to work out the moral issues of slavery<br />5-\\"From such withdraw thyself\\" is a nice analysis of the role religion and religious spokesman playing in the secession, i appreciate pg 185 where he lists 7 ideas that Mitchell Snay found in fast day prayers<br /><br />1-human events are part of God's plan<br />2-nations, like individuals, have a relationship with God<br />3-Jehovah chastises nations for the corporate evils of its people<br />4-the united states have sinned as a nation<br />5-national apostasy involved the neglect and perversions of religion<br />6-southerners were not without sin, but New England was the real den of iniquity<br />7-by disunion, the south could avoid further infection and become a more holy land<br /><br />these pretty much sum up not just the issues of that day, but the book itself.<br /><br />there is a short last chapter \\"A pure Christianity\\" that pulls together the ideas with the finality of losing the war<br /><br />an enjoyable, instructive book, worthwhile to read if you have any interest in the topic.

US	53032953	R3XWQKTJ73FKZ	0873779290	571353731	A Defense of Virginia and the South	Books	5	28	37	N	N	More than a defense of Southern slavery	This is perhaps one of the 10 most important books i've ever read.<br /><br />I first read this probably 25 years ago, and i haven't ceased to be challenged by it ever since. I am in the middle of writing 3 essays on the Civil War and American slavery. This was a reread where i took my time and paused and gazed off into space continually. such a book. a day painfully and thoughtfully spent. I am presbyterian, Dabney is one of my heroes, perhaps after Calvin my favorite theologian, his writing is persuasive, passionate, thoughtful, painful, challenging, etc etc. Leave a whole day for this small book, you will need the time to ruminate under the nearest tree and image yourself in the antebellum South, first as a white man, then as a black slave, then again as a Christian of each race. How do you reconcile the contradictions between \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\" and the black backs broken by years of whips and forced labor, where the whips were in the hands oftentimes of people in the pews of the same churches we sit in today? How can a Christian let alone a competent and serious theologian defend slavery after the Civil War?<br /><br />The possibilities are pretty well defined:<br /><br />1)he was so effected by his culture, economic needs and socio-political environment that his religion was simply trumped.<br /><br />2)the Scriptures support something called slavery which is not the same thing as the South called slavery. a confusion of terms.<br /><br />3)he was sincerely wrong, confusing the packaging of the ideas in the Bible with the inspired ideas themselves. dwelling on the text and missing the real principles.<br /><br />4)the Bible really does support slavery and for that reason alone is to be discarded as a barbaric relic of long gone days, we have progressed past that.<br /><br />5)all of the above (in different amounts, with different accents) plus Christianity over time frees slaves as a matter of being consistent with higher level principles. amelioration.<br /><br />1 is the basic Marxist analysis... 2 is the common way Scripture is defended today, online, OT and Roman slavery was not heritarily nor was it race based... 3 is the classic liberal explanation that was the North's stock answer... 4 is the Garrison emancipator answer... 5 is mine.<br /><br />what follows are a few of the most significant quotations from the book and my short analysis. Amazon reviews is too short to write a good essay, but this gives a good idea of Dabney's writings and his arguments.<br /><br />Our best hope is in the fact that the cause of our defence is the cause of Gods' Word, and of its supreme authority over the human conscience. For, as we shall evince, that Word is on our side, and the teachings of Abolitionism are clearly of rationalistic origin, of infidel tendency, and only sustained by reckless and licentious perversions of the meaning of the Sacred text. It will in the end become apparent to the world, not only that the conviction of the wickedness of slaveholding was drawn wholly from sources foreign to the Bible, but that it is a legitimate corollary from that fantastic, atheistic and radical theory of human rights, which made the Reign of terror in France, which has threatened that country, and which now threatens the Untited States, with the horrors of Red-Republicanism. Because we believe that God intends to vindicate His Divine Word, and to make all nations honour it; because we confidently rely on the force of truth to explode all dangerous error; therefore we confidently expect that the world will yet do justice to Southern slaveholders. The anti-scriptural, infidel, and radical grounds upon which our assailants have placed themselves, make out cause practically the cause of truth and order. pg 21-22<br /><br />---In addition to defending the institution of Southern slavery, Dabney's second big point is just this, abolitionism is Jacobin, in fact he uses the term consistently for the anti-slavery northern parties. As such Dabney is an excellent place to start a study of the various pieces of the Enlightenment: Scottish, English, French and how they crossed the Atlantic and took root here very differently than in their homelands. Scottish common sense appears to be a philosophic rebuttal to the Humean skepticism and French radical anti-revealed religion ideals. But for Dabney this quote sums up much of how he preceives and deals with his Northern opponents-they are radical Red Republicans bent on bringing the French terror on his beloved South. Remember the book is written several years after the defeat of the South, Dabney knows painfully how the story ends, at least so far.<br /><br />This abolition is purely the result of a supposed military necessity, because the North believed that otherwise she could not overthrow the South in an unjust. war. But for this single fact, the Africans would still be in bondage, so far as the Yankee was concerned. The proof is, that the Chicago platform of the Black Republican party in 1860, expressly repudiated the purpose ever to meddle with slavery in the States. Mr. Lincoln, the chosen man of the North, solemnly asserted the same thing in his letter to A. IH. Stephens of Georgia, in his publick inaugural, and in his messages. The Congress, after.the beginning of the war, solemnly declared to the world by a joint resolution, that the purpose of the war was only to restore the Union, and not to restrict or change State institutions. Mr. Lincoln constantly declared to the Abolitionists, that if the perpetuation of slavery tended to restore the Union, it should be perpetuated. His standing invitation to the States in arms against him was: \\"If you wish to keep your slaves, come back into the Union.\\" Can the North be believed in her own declarations? Then, the charge made is true-that abolition in the South was prompted by ambition and hatred, not by philanthropy. Nor has this act been less wicked in its effects than in its motive. To the white race it was the most violent, convulsive, reckless and mischievous act ever perpetrated by a civilized government.<br /><br />pg 88<br /><br />---The issue is that no one really cared about black people, certainly in the light of subsequent history true on the whole, racism was firmly established North and South. but the minor issue is that the South treated black people better than the North treated their white laborers, this is an open issue for me.<br /><br />It does in the first place, what all secular history and speculations fail to do: it gives us the origin of domestic slavery. And we find that it was appointed by God as the punishment of, and remedy for (nearly all God's providential chastisements are also remedial) the peculiar moral degradation of a part of the race. God here ordains that this depravity shall find its necessary restraints, and the welfare of the more virtuous its safeguard against the depraved, by the bondage of the latter. He introduces that feature of political society, for the justice of which we shall have occasion to contend; that although men have all this trait of natural equality that they are children of a common father, and sharers of a common humanity, and subjects of the same law of love; yet, in practice, they shall be subject to social inequalities determined by their own characters, and their fitness or unfitness to use privileges for their own and their neighbours' good. But second: this narrative gives us more than a pre diction. The words of Noah are not a mere prophecy; they are a verdict, a moral sentence pronounced upon conduct, by competent authority; that verdict sanc tioned by God. Now if the verdict is righteous, and the execution blessed by God, it can hardly be, that the executioners of it are guilty for putting it in effect<br /><br />pg 103,<br /><br />---this is both the Hametic verses defense and a defense that slavery is the result of moral or economic failure. this argument also appears in Rushdoony and much of the Christian reconstructionist defense of slavery. The problem: unlike prisoners on a southern prison farm, black slaves where not there because of something they did. The defense that this kind of punishment and retribution slavery is Biblical misses the point that no black slave was made a slave because of his/her economic or moral failure, but most were there because they were born black. This is the big question of if OT slavery=Southern slavery and the answer is a firm no. OT and Roman slavery was not genetic, was not racist and was not for life, let alone the children of slaves.<br /><br />They were to be bought and sold. They were heritable property: (Mr. Sumner would prove hence, \\"mere chattels.\\") iHere is involuntary slavery for life, expressly authorized to God's own peculiar and holy people, in the strongest and most careful terms. The relation, then, must be innocent in itself. With what show of candour can men say, in the face of a sanction so full, so emphatic, so hearty, that Moses, finding the hoary institution of domestic slavery so deeply rooted that it would be impossible then to abolish it, tolerated it, and limited it by all the restrictions which he could apply, calculated to cut off its worst horrors? We ask, was Moses the author of these laws, or God? Does the Almighty, the Unchangeable, the Holy, connive at moral abuses, like a puny human magistrate, and content himself, where he dare not denounce a sin, with pruning its growth a little? We ask again: Is this gloss borne out by the facts? Was Moses, in fact, timid in assailing old and deeply-rooted vices, and in demanding that they-should be eradicated wholly? Let his uncompromising legislation against Idolatry and Adultery answer.. The truth is, such writers as use the above language know nothing about the true nature of domestic slavery, and draw their inferences only from their prejudices. God and Moses knew it well. They knew that it was an institution which, when not abused, was suitable to the character of the. depraved persons for whom it was designed, and wholesome and benign. HIence, they prohibit all inhuman abuses of it; and then they do not tolerate it merely as an unavoidable wrong; but they expressly legalize it, as<br /><br />pg 118,<br /><br />---this is as close as Dabney gets to answering the question that the South merely baptised a pagan institution that was essential for their economic and political society. This does not fend off the usual Marxist analysis that theology is nothing more than the rationalization of economic interests.<br /><br />But we do not admit that Moses' was an incomplete revelation in the sense of the Abolitionists. They are fond of representing the New Testament revelation as completing, amending, and correcting that of the Old. Its details the New Testament does complete; but if it were amended or corrected by any subsequent standard of infallible truth, this would prove it not truly inspired. Indeed, the history of theological opinion shows plainly enough that this anti-slavery view of Old Tesfment revelation is Socinian and Rationalistic. Modern Abolitionism in America had, in fact, a Socinian birth, in the great apostasy of the Puritans of News England to that benumbing heresy, and in the pharisaism, shallow scholarship, affectation, conceit and infidelity of the Unitarian clique in the self-styled American Athens, Boston. It is lamentable to see how men professing to be evangelical are driven by blind prejudices against Southern men and things, to adopt this skeptical tone towards God's own word. The ruinous issue has been seen in the case of a minister of the Gospel, who, after floundering through a volume of confused and impotent sophisms, roundlydeclares that if compelled to admit that the Bible treated slavery as not a sin in itself, he would repudiate the Bible rather than his opinions. But we point these objectors to that Saviour who said, in the full meridian of revealed light of thisOld<br /><br />pg 131<br /><br />---this is as close as Dabney gets to answering the big question of progressive revelation. He unfortunately is blinded and restores to name calling rather than engaging with the issue. This is a big issue and is probably the best angle to take to criticize Dabney. The point is that the Scriptures are not flat, but rather the OT must be seen in the Light of the Cross, the Resurrection and Pentecost. His failure to use Resurrection colored glasses while reading the Pentateuch makes his reading of the slavery supporting passages to cross transferable to his own society. Essentially he draws lines straight from OT society to his society without passing through higher order principles. this is a common conservative practice and is my major point of criticism of Dabney. The minor is manstealing as the origin of slaves.<br /><br />We have now reviewed, perhaps at too much length, the various impotent attempts made to escape from the meshes of our inexorable Old Testament argument. It is an argument short, plain, convincing. Although every thing enjoined on the Hebrews is not necessarily enjoined on us, (because it may have been of temporary obligation,) yet every such thing must be innocent in its nature, because a holy God would not sanction sin to his holy people, in the very act of separating them to holiness. But slaveholding was expressly sanctioned as a permanent institution; the duties of masters and slaves are defined; the rights of masters protected, not only in the civic but the eternal moral law of God; and He himself became a slave-owner, by claiming an oblation of slaves for his sanctuary and. priests. Hence, while we do not say that modern Christian nations are bound to hold slaves, we do assert that no people sin by merely holding slaves, unless the place can be shown where God has uttered a subsequent prohibition. But there is no such place, as the next chapter will show. While we well know that to secret infidels and rationalists, as all Abolitionists are, this has no weight, to every mind which reverences the inspiration of the Old Testament it is conclusive. And let every Christian note, that with the inspiration of the Old Testament stands or falls that of Christ and the apostles, because they commit themselves irretrievably to the support of the former.<br /><br />pg 145<br /><br />---this is his summary of the OT argument and presents all the major issues.<br /><br />But the propriety of slavery, like that of the restraints and punishments of civil government, rests on the fact that man is depraved and fallen. Such is his character, that the rights of the whole, and the greatest welfare of the whole, may, in many cases, demand the subjection of one part of society to another, even as man's sinfulness demands the subjection of all to civil government. Slavery is, indeed, but one form of the institution, government. Government is controul. Some controul over all is necessary, righteous, and beneficent: the degree of it depends on the character of those to be controuled. As that character rises in the scale of true virtue, and selfcommand, the degree of outward controul may be properly made lighter. If the lack of those properties in any class is so great as to demand, for the good and safety of the whole, that extensive controul which amounts to slavery, then slavery is righteous, righteous by precisely the same reason that other government is righteous And this is the Scriptural account of the origin of slavery, as justly incurred by the sin and depravity of man.<br /><br />pg 208<br /><br />---again he conflates slavery as justified punishment for secular crimes and race based heritiarily slavery. comparing apples and oranges with justifying one in terms of the other and pronouncing all as Godly. big cultural blindness.<br /><br />It is a plausible ground of opposition to slavery, to charge it with the guilt of the slave trade. It is argued that unless we are willing to justifythe capture of free and-innocent men, on their own soil, and their reduction from freedom to slavery, with all the enormous injustice and cruelty of the African slave trade, we must acknowledge that the title of the Southern master to his slave at this day is unrighteous; that a system which had its origin in wrong cannot become right by the lapse of time; that, if the title of the piratical slave catcher on the coast of Africa was unrighteous, he cannot sell to the purchaser any better title than he has; and that an unsound title cannot become sound by the passage of time. It need hardly be said that we abhor the injustice, cruelty, and guilt of the African slave trade. It is justly condemned by the public law of Christendom -a law which not Wilberforce, nor the British Parliament, nor British, nor Yankee Abolitionists, have the honour of originating, but the slaveholding Commonwealth of Virginia. It is condemned by the law of God. Moses placed this among the judicial statutes of the Jews: \\"And he that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.'

Careful objective analysis where he takes a position but doesn't seem to let it influence his studies unduely. I've this little list of good conservative Presbyterian historians that i can be sure i'll like reading their books: G. Marsden, David Wells, Mark Noll.<br /><br />The book is his PhD thesis, perhaps a bit rewritten, but it reads much better than the majority of thesis i've read. At this point, i will be teaching a class on the history of American Presbyterianism and i think this book alone is my recommendation for advanced reading on the New School versus Old School split. It's good readable history, well organized, rememberable, simply the first in Marsden's long line of excellent books.<br /><br />Second, what is it about?<br /><br />From the preface- \\"is the Church's persistent tendency to embrace American nationalism and American middle-class mores in the name of Christianity\\".<br /><br />and from page 2-\\"the transition from the theologically oriented and well-informed Calvinism characteristic of much of American Protestantism at the beginning of the nineteenth century to the nontheologically oriented and often poorly informed conservative Protestantism firmly established in middle class America by the end of the same century remains a remarkable aspect of American intellectual and ecclesiastical history.\\"<br /><br />These are really the two big themes of the book, how the second one happened, and trying to explain why the first started and is so persistent.<br /><br />Other themes worth remembering are:<br /><br />voluntary nature of the church in the wake of disestablishment after the Revolution of 1776.<br /><br />New School as the theology of revivalism/experientialism/emotional appeal.<br /><br />the moral failure of Protestantism to solve the moral problem of Southern slavery, because of its deference to Southern sentiments, and overwhelming desire to preserve unity.<br /><br />the increased theological and denominational thought in the NS after separation as a result of struggling with a new set of issues.<br /><br />Chapter 8 on the mediating theology of Henry B.

Crossed Fingers: How the Liberals Captured the Presbyterian Church<br /><br />Gary North<br /><br />available online at: [...]<br /><br />although i found it difficult to read online and purchased a second hand copy.<br /><br />How do you review a 1000 page book?<br /><br />Well, i finished it, actually quite an accomplishment. For North is an author i love to hate, i put the book down in disgust and picked it up the next day because i don't want to miss anything. North is a polemic, a fighter, nasty, often name calling, self centered, provocative, interesting, wordy, well i guess you get the picture. What the book is not: it is not strictly history, but rather something a little higher up the food chain, philosophic/theological interpretation of history, conspiracy theory, covenant theory in action, something like all these mixed together. North's extraordinary value as a writer and as a theologian is the confidence and strength his well tuned mental system produces in his works. His confidence in himself and his ideas is oftentimes overwhelming and always alluring. The problem i have is that i always put the book(s) down and have to ask myself \\"is this really true?\\" or \\"is this really Scriptural?\\" or is he overstating the case to win the debate in his mind. That is the great weakness of this book in particular, it really needed 6 months of careful research and fact checking in 1996 when it was published. You are always aware that he seems to bend the facts, both by omission and by simply being confidently wrong in order to support and prove his theories.<br /><br />His big ideas are interesting and worth the time it takes to wade through the book. The first is the idea of crossed fingers, that the pastors/teachers/theologians of the Presbyterian church had to cross their fingers when subscribing to the Westminster confession. On the issues of 6 day creation, all children dying in infancy being saved or not, and later the big ones- Calvinism, Reformed theology, the essentials of the Christian faith itself. His major motif is a mixture of covenant theology and conspiracy theory, 1-that God deals with humanity in terms of promises and promised punishments and 2-that the liberals together plotted to grab the wealth and prestige of the Presbyterian church. He ends every chapter with the sentence: \\"the crucial issue is sanctions.\\" He rightly points out that church discipline is important and if the church is unwilling or unable to fight heresy then it will end up a broad, inclusive social club where theology is replaced by institutional allegience, and the faith is replaced by a palid emotional appeal for money and power.<br /><br />As far as the details, he is good with Presbyterian history, lousy fact checking when he gets into the Dutch tradition, mostly a result of where he lives intellectually. He is ok with what he includes, which has a little too much of North's pet theorizing at times, but he is lousy with the important things he leaves out, things which contradict his theories. He is good as a nice big picture overview, but each chapter needs another source of detail and historical factual additions to help balance out the way you think. So it is a good book to read if you want to embark on a long term study of Presbyterian history and are willing to unlearn and relearn significant pieces of the puzzle, but wish to gain insight into how his theory and principles bear on the issues. I don't know of another book that attempts what he has accomplished, a general history, so to replace this reading is perhaps a dozen other books, together totally far more than 1000 pages, but such is the cost of understanding and study.<br /><br />Generally speaking, Crossed Fingers ends up telling me more about Gary North then it does about Presbyterian history, but his general principles are basically Scriptural even if rather steeply overlaid with his conservative economics and politics. And this is the final value, not just in CF but in all of North's books, he really does try to understand and deal with Scripture as authoritative and applicable to the problems of today, and for this he has my respect and my continued readership.but in all of North's books, he really does try to understand and deal with Scripture as authoritative and applicable to the problems of today, and for this he has my respect and my continued readership.	2005-04-05

I feel a real need when reading to identify with the writer and try as much as possible to see things from his eyes, but with someone so at odds with much of what i believe important and significant this was a difficult to impossible task.<br /><br />Second, the book is trying to prove something that i find wrong. Not that it didn't happen, it did, the mainline Presbyterian Church is a broadened, pluralistic, cultural club. Weston finds this admirable and desires to show in the book how it happened and some of the reasons why. Well, i am deeply saddened that it happened, wish it hadn't and would like to see it reversed, well there is a conflict.<br /><br />The book gets its strength from the very first page where he explains that the Presbyterian Church is made up of 10% liberals, 15% conservatives and fully 75% loyalists. Yes, he is absolutely right, not just on the facts but more importantly on the significance and historical repercussions of this. The ends don't battle each other as much as battle for the massive centerists, those loyalist support. And much of the battle is directed to them, not necessarily to the opponent in the debate. Radical polarizations seldom works since the middle really does have a lot of inertia and oftentimes really doesn't have deep emotions one way or another. The fact that the ends are more alike in many ways then they are like the middle is another observation that is certainly true and has its explanatory power in the book.<br /><br />J.G. Machen is a personal hero of mine, i really didn't appreciate the name calling that Weston often resorted to, but that is a minor complaint, it mars the objectivity of the book and demonstrates the author's stance more than anything else. I like the theme of Charles Briggs and Machen anchoring the ends of the conflict, in time, and will make great use of it in a class i'm teaching on the history of American Presbyterianism, which is the reason i read this book. But more than anything else i like the motif of the 3 way battle rather than just the extremes: liberal and conservative, for this insight (which is found in Machen as well) really opens up the study of the conflict to greater understanding. For it makes understandable errors of judgement on Machen's part and the failure to mobilize the center in the 1930's. He misunderstood what was going on until it was too late. The theme of Machen as martyr is overdone but again mars the surface of the book, not the big picture.<br /><br />It's not a long book, worthwhile for an afternoon's casual study. If you are more liberal than i theologically then you might actually enjoy both the book and the history it tells. I picked it up accidentally but would like to recommend it deliberately for a study on the modernist-conservative split in the Presbyterian Church.history of American Presbyterianism, which is the reason i read this book.

It starts what ought to be a dynamite discussion then jumps to something else just when it gets interesting. As a quick introduction to a wide set of ideas it is good, well written, engaging, interesting. As a carefully reasoned look at how Kuhn's philosophy of science can help theologians in designing and using a more scientific hermeneutic it is just too choppy and shallow to be in demand as a first read. It is more tantalizing then substantial, more a shadow then a ground breaking work to lead conservative Christians into an understanding of how Scriptural interpretation can grow by being in contact with modern science and philosophy of science. Maybe it is just too short to cover the subject properly....*grin*<br /><br />but it is not a bad start, worthwhile the time to read, leaves lots more unasked but potential then it answers.<br /><br />I don't regret reading it, but sadden not to know where to go to seek more similiar books. It's a good topic and deserves more from his pen.	2005-01-19
US	53032953	R2UDDJBBI98V4Z	0966665732	481731618	Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices	Books	3	17	29	N	N	interesting but not persuasive	The objective of the book, which is just part of a 5 volume series, is to convince people that the traditional Christian church's practices are of Greek and pagan origin and ought to be immediately discarded and the 1st Century church re-established.<br /><br />It is part of restorationist literature, which has a long and interesting history. (the other pessimistic model of church history is remnant) What makes this book a good entry in the argument is the passion with which the author argues and the wide ranging sources he avails himself of. I intend to follow up on several of the references presented in the footnotes, which alone raise this book above most of its ilk.<br /><br />What is lacking is a systematic review of the process of syncretism, in fact i don't believe he even uses this word to describe what is the process he is discussing. The other glaring deficiency is an explanation of why church history is not progressive, why a restoration of 1st century practices is desirable for today, simply put, why is this normative and not just illustrative or even prelude. These are two really big issues that the book is just silent about, and why i rated it as unpersuasive.<br /><br />What is interesting is that i agree with most of his conclusions, but not for the reasons he presents, although the reasons are interesting and i am glad to have been exposed to them. Although the book will be persuasive to the choir, and unsettling to those with only a little awareness of church history, bcause the fundamental problem of syncretism is enormous and really needs to be dealt with in the church. Perhaps books like this and the house church movement will ignite a discussion, but one from first priniciples not just an emotional appeal.<br /><br />Should the church build huge church buildings? no, but the reasons are not as simple as because cathedrals were built like roman temples over the sites of pagan rituals and that the 1stC Christians met in homes not specially constructed buildings. This is the opposite of the 'history is always progressive' ideal, and it is just as wrong.<br /><br />it is a nice, easy to read, fun book. if i can find other of his books cheap i will read them, ie i will remember his name, but i am not moved to order them immediately and at full price because of what i read here.ly constructed buildings.

A little too conservative political for my tastes but i do appreciate being challenged, i will search out his name and writings.<br /><br />Second, the book is simply the must read introduction to the topic. As such it will figure prominently in my summer class on American Presbyterian history which is the reason i got and read the book.<br /><br />Third, it is a collection of essays, not badly done at all, apparently there was a lot of cooperation and knowledge shared as the essays were being written and this shows in the quality of the final product. There is some noticable repetition, as well as some noticable difference in opinion on the facts and historical data, but generally there is a nice consensus and the positions are clear enough to make informed judgements. Nice result for an (ed) work.<br /><br />What is the topic?<br /><br />Creeds, confessionalism, subscriptionism are like a series of smaller included circles. The second chapter \\"The Biblical and Pastoral basis of Creeds and Confessions\\" by Rayburn is excellent and is where i would start reading to get an idea of the book and topic. Creeds are short summaries of Christian doctrine, often written in the face of particular opposition. Confessions are much longer, strive for completeness, and are summaries for memorization, study and most importantly form the element of discipline called subscriptionism. Which is the issue of how to fence the preaching-teaching ministry of the church so as to assure orthodoxy throughout the changing generations. To detect heresy while it is still uninfluential and combatable. To include the right men for the ministry, to exclude the wrong ones from the start (under care, or joining presbytery), and to act as discipline to move those inside to the outside upon serious change in thinking.<br /><br />It is not so much to these elements of subscriptionism that the book speaks to directly, but rather a narrow one of how to draw boundaries with subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith. What motivates the discussion is the mainline PCUSA being liberal and the general consensus of conservatives especially in the PCA (from which most of the authors are recruited) that the PCUSA is heretical and is no longer a Christian Church. How this happened in the 1930-northern or 1960's-southern is the underlying unspoken fears of these writers. At this point i am reminded of something that was said about the Great Wall of China---\\"a wall, no matter how vast, is only as strong as those who guard it's gates\\".<br /><br />It is to this gate-guarding function of subscriptionism that the book is addressed. In particular, how broadly is the variation to be allowed within the pastorate?<br /><br />As an image it is the width of the stroke of the brush that draws the boundary. Can you disagree with the WCF on big things? How do you define big things? Who gets to set the changing brush width as the church moves through the ages, times and zeitgeist change and effect the church? It is not a discussion of how to change the constitution of the Church to fit evolving conceptions, but will eventually lead that way.<br /><br />I think it is a unique book and am interested in more in the same vein, please email me with recommendations.hange in thinking. <br /> <br />It is not so much to these elements of subscriptionism that the book speaks to directly, but rather a narrow one of how to draw boundaries with subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith.

He is one person i'd love to sit down to dinner with and just listen to. He has seen things that are fundamentally not learnable from books, lessons too deep for words. Even though this book is a good try to transmit these important things to his readers, it must fall short because the emotional impact is not transferable.<br /><br />Death, murder, evil, state sponsored rape-torture-genocide.<br /><br />These are the pieces of our world that he has seen. A war correspondent for 15 years, he has been in all the hot spots, not just for a day or two in a nice hotel and commuting to the front, but living with the people for years. It is one book i'd love to see every new soldier/sailor/airmen take the time to read before he is seduced by the dark evil side of man's nature. A topic apropos for today as it has not been for a generation here in the US, timely, important, well written, involving, tearful, sad, frustrating, crushing- and that is just part of the way he effected me while reading and thinking about this book.<br /><br />Make this author the head of the government's bureau of propaganda. Give him the widest possible media attention and lets hear his ideas throughout society.<br /><br />But it won't happen, sadly so, for we will continue to ignore good advice and go on killing.<br /><br />just drop what you are currently reading for an hour or so, it's a small and short book, and try to learn from his unique, hard earned and terrible POV.	2004-12-21
US	53032953	R1VX1SCIH2CORC	0070196028	256096590	THE UNARMED PROPHET: Savonarola in Florence	Books	2	5	7	N	N	Savonarola- prophet or political manipulator?	part of a study to present to adult education class on missions at my church.<br /><br />I'm obligated to give a short class on Savonarola and this is part of that study<br /><br />I got the book more for it's accessibility then any other reason. It is the first full length book treatment of his life that i have read and therefore have precious little to compare it to factually. Two big problems stare out from the book. The first is that the author's bias seems to get in the way of good presentation. She appears to be interested in him primarily as a political character and has very little sympathy for the theological content of his life. The second is that the first 2/3 of the book are more detailed then they need to be and the last 1/3 (from the trial by fire) far less informative than the events warrant. It is like the 20-25 page papers i wrote in university. I'd often get to page 19 and logically be 1/2 done the paper, rather than redo the first 19 pages, i'd just move faster so i'd get just 25 pages. In the case of this book, i'd love to see the first 2/3 cut down into the first 1/2 and the last 1/3 expanded to the last half. It is really noticable and leaves an unpleasantness in my mind for the details of his last 6 months are those most appropriate to what he really believed and why. But almost none of this discussion is present: meaning, significance, etc haunt the first 2/3 and are virtually absent in the last portion.<br /><br />Now about content. Who was Savonarola and why do so many people seem to desire to claim him as an antecedent?<br /><br />First, he appears with Hus and Wycliffe in the Luther monument in Worms (pictures in the book). but he was not a crypto or early Protestant, he is throughly Roman.<br /><br />Second, he is certainly apocalyptic, but did the success of his early sermons on these topics create him or did he create a market for these sermons through his preaching? Simply, what was the relationship of the times to Savonarlo? Left unanswered, even mildly unasked.<br /><br />Third, just because he died a martyr's death, does these change the truthfulness of his preaching, either by adding to it or subtracting from it since it means he personally lost the battle? Lots of people die at the hands of people we believe ought to know better, but does the manner of one's death like this, have anything to do with the values of his life or is it something that really effects only how we think about that person's life? Luther didn't die on his way back from Worms, that gave him a successfulness denied to Hus, Wycliffe and Savonarola and many others of their ages, so what?<br /><br />Lastly, he was a moral reformer, not a doctrinal one, who tried to use the political apparatus with a few new pieces (boys groups to collect the vanities) that look remarkably modern. This intertwining of the religious and the political make it hard to distinguish things that i would like to know about both him and his times. But i will have to look elsewhere for all those answers.<br /><br />The man-the messenger, the message both content and technique of presentation(the media) and the audience. Florence looks a lot like modern western culture, it certainly was the up and coming Renaissance city. For this reason we find lots of parallels between them and us, i think this is the enduring legacy of those times. The bonfire of the vanities looks like something our materialistic, obsessed with beauty society ought to do to rid itself of superficial banalities. But it is the technique of his overall campaign that we find most interesting. The political involvement, the intertwining of religion and politics, the underlying economic causes: plague, failure of harvests, rapidly changing conditions that favor some and crush others. It is this semi-marxist (economic forces are primary and underlie everything else) that the author manages to transmit to us as a take home message. His theology and beliefs look like nothing more than a psychologized superstructure when compared to the reality of partisan power politics based on control of economic forces. This ends up telling us more about our time than Savonarola's, about our deepest ideals then about Savonarola's or his times, thus yielding a book that really doesn't illuminate him but plays at history telling.<br /><br />I could have spent those few hours more profitably with another book, i haven't found it yet, but for a start it is ok background. But leaves me with far more questions than content to answer them with.superstructure when compared to the reality of partisan power politics based on control of economic forces.

It really is a definitive, must read, first book in the field of sola scriptura.<br /><br />Breezy style, even to the point of being a little choppy. Excellent references, nice bibliography make it a tool to put into the hands of anyone interested in the issues of tradition and Scripture. He uses H. Oberman's  tradition 0,1,2,3 as a systematic entry point into the various ideas, which is an excellent way to remember as well as structure the discussion.<br /><br />I found it a little repetitive, the central chapters on the church and roman & eastern critiques a little slow, so i would certainly start from the back with this book:<br /><br />chapter 8- Critique of Evangelical Doctrine<br /><br />and chapter 9-Doctrine of Sola Scriptura<br /><br />are the two key chapters, next is chapter 3-Martin Luther and John Calvin.....<br /><br />It is not a hard read, i'd see no problem with giving it to high school students who had the motivation to read and understand their church's doctrine. It is probably a little long for an adult education class, but a few key chapters are certainly a good idea.<br /><br />I wouldn't stop my education on these issues with this book, but i would just as certainly start it here.	2004-11-15

I bought it simply because i had Martinez Hewlett along with Thomas Lindell and William Stoeger as team teachers for an unusual and very interesting seminar class at the U of Arizona, theology and biology. It was a continuation of Dr. Lindell's interests in bioethics and exactly how to relate science to theology in a constructive and useful, to both parties, manner. A truely unique experience for which i am again thankful. But if buying this book because of the author was the reason for opening it and reading the first few chapters, i would have stopped there, for the book itself must carry my interest from that point. This one did. Very much so, engaging, informative, interesting, clever, structured wisely- just a few of my comments. I seldom thoroughly enjoy a book as much as i did this one, i even wrote WOW on the last page in my yellow highlighter, it is good.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />First, it represents the culmination of two really interesting people's work. Dr. Hewlett is a clever, talented, thoughtful and spiritually aware man. He is a poet, a novelist, a viral researcher, but most appropriately to this book- a good teacher. There is something special about a talented teacher who can unfold a topic IN ORDER, with a structure that shows the neophyte how the pieces fit together. And gives us the pieces in an order that helps us see the big picture that the author's themselves grasp. Hey readers, this is RARE. More often you hit things in a logical or chronological order, pieces are thrown at you without reference to the big picture. So you often are lost as a student in a new field in the forest, concentrating on the trees and never ever able to understand why anyone would actually come to this forest. A good teacher, or a good writer, never lets the structure interfere with your reason for being there, for your motivation to read the next page. But they have you anticipate and salivate for the next chapter or the next idea.<br /><br />Second, it represents distilled knowledge, carefully written to teach the essentials of the debate so that you can be lead to understand their big point. There is lots of background information here, people, spectrums, differentiations between close ideas, that are the meat and potatoes of this feast. Yet the point they want you to understand is available in just a few pages- chapter 7 Theistic Evolution: A Constructive Proposal, but you must read the book pretty much in straight order to get there. This is because of the culmulativeness of the material, the distinctions that they make, and the specialized vocabulary you need to understand. So pick it up and read front to back, with a pen in hand to markup and take notes, this is not a walk in the park book, but a serious analysis, worthy of your best efforts.<br /><br />Third, i am impressed at the carefulness of the structure. Intro, Darwin, Social Darwinism, Creationism, ID, TE then their proposal.<br /><br />It is certainly the result of Dr. Hewlett's teaching of the topics to seniors at university, first they are looking outside of school perhaps for the first time in their lives, and second they are self-absorbed and desireous of internal consistency and coherence, those early adulthood dilemmas and opportunities. By presenting it this way, the interactions between people and ideas is so obvious that it is extremely natural to be drawn into the discussion and look inward. nice.<br /><br />I appreciate the talent and insight, for instance, \\"science must first be extracted from it's ideological wrapping\\" pg. 19, but a constant and important theme throughout.<br /><br />Hey, it is just such an awesome book, if you have any interest in the topic, just get it and don't waste time reading more reviews but get onto reading it.next idea. <br /> <br />Second, it represents distilled knowledge, carefully written to teach the essentials of the debate so that you can be lead to understand their big point.

So 12 essays, 12 writers, about 8 theologians, but it doesn't suffer from the usual essay collection disjointedness, if you were unaware of the multiple authors, i don't think you would detect it in the reading, nice. Additionally, it is very well documented and referenced, not just each essay but the book itself contains a 33 pages bibliography, thus certainly adding to my perception that this is an excellent recommendation for a early read in anyone's studies of either the theologies or the men discussed.<br /><br />I particularly appreciated the essays on Dabney and Hodge, from pg 229. \\"We whose unperceived blind spots will be deplored by future Christian generations will not speak too harshly of Dabney, who was marked by the fallennes of his own time and culture, as we are by ours. The way forward is to see beyond him by standing on his shoulders-- and on those of all the saints and doctors of the church in all ages.\\"<br /><br />In Princeton: C. Hodge, BB. Warfield, Machen, in Dutch: L. Berkof, H. Dooyeweerd, C. Van Til, in Southern: R. Dabney, Thornwell. There is a larger Eerdmans edition that apparently has 5 streams with 2 theologians represented in each group, i will look for it, to read what i missed out on. Since it is a collection, start with the person you most admire and read on, the only essay i didn't like was Dooyeweerd, which tells you more about me then it does about the essay, i am afraid. It is suitable for a small group discussion to a Sunday School class, which is why i am reading it. A nice book, deserving of wide appeal and reading.	2004-11-09

Breezy, smooth, engrossing. It is the poor fact checking and research that diminish the quality of the book. The authors simply allow their desire to prove a point to manipulate the facts.<br /><br />Something as simple as Calvin desiring his burning rather than beheading, pg 196, their's is the only book, that i have seen, that says he didn't seek beheading. Certainly a little point, but it is an accepted fact that they dispute, without even a footnote to warn the reader.<br /><br />But it is the tone and the choice of words that points to a polemical work not a history, putting this into the genre of historical fiction rather than history. For on almost every page something jumped out as either a distortion or a misguided attempt to prove a point by involving people's emotions in the case, rather than to spread out the issues for us to understand them.<br /><br />I appreciate the point they so evidently wish their readers to believe, but i believe careful even handed scholarship would be a better way to prove it than how this book turns out. To demonize your enemies and to confer sainthood on our friends is good polemics but justifiably called fiction when applying to real people.	2004-08-18

It is an unusually good and interesting book, worthy of winning the Pulitzer prize. It is a combination of intellectual history and the biography of multiple people. For what the author does is to trace several philosophic movements basically from the Civil War through roughly 1920, from the vantage point of 4 friends, hence the title, where these lives touched.<br />The overall theme of the book is explicit on the first page of the introduction, in reference to the American Civil War he says &quot;but in almost every other respect, the United States became a different country. the war alone did not make America modern, but the war marks the birth of modern America.&quot; This is truely the take home message of the book, done with sympathy for those who came home from the war and were deeply changed as a result of their experiences and for those who did not come home, whose absence and missing contributions were sorely missed by at least 3 generations(their parents, their siblings and their children).<br />The four people are: Oliver Wendell Holmes, William James, Charles S. Pierce and John Dewey. The main areas of the culture they influenced greatly are obviously: the law, psychology, pragmatism, and education respectively. But neither their names nor the fields of endeavor they dominated for so many years are adequate summaries of either their lives or their work. That is the purpose of this book, to elaborate, to explain, to tie threads together, between these 4 men and their life contributions to our intellectual culture.<br />The author does so with a sympathy that is born out of deep and thoughtful study. It strikes me as a book that is a passion, not just a writing to make money. A work of love and desire to understand the people and the times they lived through. This is reflected in a number of places i simply stopped and marvelled at the insight and understanding the author shared with me. It is not a difficult read, it is the author's desire to reach a wide audience, it is philosophic in places but not excessive to the average reader, with the accent on the inter-relationship dynamics of these men with those around them. The presentation of ideas is slipped in between letters, meetings or the establishment of groups, as they go about their efforts in universities or writing. As justification for actions and the understanding of paths taken and those not taken as a result of thinking about the big issues and their interaction with the spirit of the age. It is for this reason the book is significant, for it catches the spirit of several generations and ties together threads of history that i had previously thought independent. For these 4 men are not just reflective of this spirit but exponents and creative thinkers who fashioned it and drove it down the paths it took, rather than alternatives, especially ones dominant before the war.<br />Two intellectual themes that i found interesting an most instructive are pragmatism and the civility necessary for pluralism, both developed in chapters of their own at the very end of the book, but introduced again and again as the issues surrounding them crop up differently yet with the same overall influence in each man's life. I found the first chapters on O.W.Holmes the most fasinating, and would recommend chapter 3 -- &quot;the Wilderness and After&quot; with the last paragraphs especially poigant. &quot;And then he had watched the world bleed to death at Fredericksburg and Antietam, in a war that learning and brillance had been powerless to prevent. ... for he never forgot what he had lost. 'He talk me,' Einstein reported 'that after the Civil War the world never seemed quite right again.'&quot;[pg 69] It is to this chapter i would direct your attention for a quick read to get a flavor of the book to decide to invest the time for the whole read.irect your attention for a quick read to get a flavor of the book to decide to invest the time for the whole read.	2004-03-05

And this author has earned such a task, he is witty, interesting and more important presents these big important ideas and defends them with flair.<br />His big idea is the exchange relationship as a sociological way of looking at religions. The book assumes this and moves on to showing the results of such thinking. The first is that some types of Gods work better as exchange partners, powerful, larger scope(not a local deity, bound to a particular piece of land), a personal Being not an intellectual essence. This is essentially chapter 1- &quot;God's Nature&quot;. The subtopic is the inevitable dualism that most answers to the question of theodicy requires, that is blaming the presence of evil in the universe on another less powerful god, devil, satan etc.<br />Chapter 2- &quot;God's Chosen: Monotheism and Mission&quot; is an analysis of inclusivity vs exclusivity, or universalism vs particularism and the missionary impulse. Aptly summed up in the phrase: &quot;indeed the duty, to spread knowledge of the One True god: the duty to missionize in inherent in dualistic monotheism&quot; pg 35 The analysis of the Church of Power and the Church of Piety and the Constantinian synthesis is worth the reading of the entire book, pg 59-77. It is these pages i would recommend reading to see if you would desire to read the whole book. Converting the masses vs converting the elite and powerful is in fact a great criticism of the church that bears understanding and prayful consideration as a very serious failing.<br />Chapter 3- &quot;God's Wrath:Religious Conflict&quot; is an analysis of one of the biggest items in history that atheists or secular people point to as a deep criticism of the Church and rightfully so. &quot;But if monotheists believe there is only One True God, they have been unable to sustain One True Religion. Rather, from the start all of the major monotheisms have been prone to splinter into many True Religions that sometimes acknowlege one another's right ot coexist and sometimes don't. Hence internal and external conflict is inherent in particularistic religion.&quot; pg 117 He follows up by introducing the idea of the natural difference in the intensity of human committment to religions and how different groups supply a varying amount of requirements to match the person with the system he/she adheres to. This leads naturally into an informative analysis of how the Church as asked and relied upon the State to enforce conformity and why. The Constantinian synthesis with a sociological bent, nicely done. A good subtopic is how both internal and external tolerance are turned on together but external demands, in particular the battles with Islam via the Crusades.<br />Chapter 4- &quot;God's Kingdom: Religious Persistence&quot; is an analysis of Jewish assimilation and persistence, with an interested example of the Chinese Jews.<br />Chapter 5- &quot;God's Grace: Pluralism and Civility&quot; is a hopeful analysis and prescription for how to get along(civility) and the basis for such in true pluralism not the synthetic state enforced peace.<br />So i liked the book, i appreciate the author's writing, both style and creativity and hope that you do as well.y serious failing.<br />Chapter 3- &quot;God's Wrath:Religious Conflict&quot; is an analysis of one of the biggest items in history that atheists or secular people point to as a deep criticism of the Church and rightfully so. &quot;But if monotheists believe there is only One True God, they have been unable to sustain One True Religion.

It is the current text for our church's Sunday service sermons and as such is automatically a point of study and interest for me. This particular book was mentioned in the first sermon and it was the first i picked up as well.<br />It is an adequate introduction to the book. A little too quote-heavy, disjointed for my personal taste. It often reads like a series of sermon illustrations than a commentary. For that reason i do not think of it as a strict commentary, where the text is the big point, but rather in this book the text is the launching point to get into the literature and stream-of-consciousness provoked by the verses. There is nothing wrong with this technic, just don't confuse it with hermeneutics or exegesis, it is application, it is expansion, not textual criticism.<br />It is readable, written at a high school level, presupposes only a committment to the text as the Word of God. It is directed, imho, to pastors or preachers and secondarily to the church at large. As such it probably belongs in a pastor's library for a source of sermon illustrations, and in the adult education program at a conservative church for a text on the book of James.	2004-03-01

Spoul<br />My mother told me repeatedly 'if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all'.<br />so i will start this review with the one paragraph in the book that i found useful.<br />One of my all-time favorite anecdotes concerns the meeting of a theologian and an astronomer. the astronomer was frustrated with the theologian for making religion too complicated. He said, \\"why are you fellow so obscure? You talk about supralapsarian this and traducsianism that. You quibble over fine points of predestination and God's omniscience. For me religion is simple; it's the Golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\\"<br />\\"I understand your frustration,\\" replied the theologian. \\"You astronomers often confuse me with your talk of expanding universes this and exploding novae that. You're always talking about astronomical perturbations and galactic anomalies. For me astronomy is simple. It's twinkle, twinkle little star.\\" pg 170<br />R.C. Sproul is a gifted and well thought of theologian, and this book does not do him justice, copyrighted 1986, my copy was purchased new, recently reprint date 2001. It really should have been fixed back in 1986 and not to have gone through 8 printings in the shape it is in.<br />What is so wrong? Over simplification, dumbing down, no references, no further reading lists, no endnotes, no book titles, but a certainty of writing that suggests that this is a sufficient look at a very complex set of issues. Simplifying things, popularizing ideas is important, i think of D. Dennett or R. Dawkins or SJ Gould or C. Sagan, but essentially what this book is, is a popularization of F. Schaeffer who himself simplified C. Van Til, so what happens is several layers of dumbing down. To the point that the information is not just simple, but simply wrong, misleading and conductive of a mindset that has enough information to be immune from the greater truth. This would not be a fatal error if Sproul had 1-put a single name of a book associated with the authors he talks about in the body of the writing 2-put a single foot or endnote referring the interested reader to anything else to read to find out how the author arrived at this point, or leads to research 3-wrote with just a little more humility or uncertainty in the choice of words or style/tone 4-put a list of readings for further research or even a short bibliography in the back.<br />As is the book is misleading. It does introduce the idea of secularism as an umbrella for the various pieces of a worldview. But the rest of the book causes more uncertainty and desire to rebuttal than it is worth as a read. Sorry, the author deserves better and really ought to correct these things before the next edition, for the book does have a place in adult religious education, if fixed.<br />It is an adult education text at the church, and that is the only reason i finished it.his would not be a fatal error if Sproul had 1-put a single name of a book associated with the authors he talks about in the body of the writing 2-put a single foot or endnote referring the interested reader to anything else to read to find out how the author arrived at this point, or leads to research 3-wrote with just a little more humility or uncertainty in the choice of words or style/tone 4-put a list of readings for further research or even a short bibliography in the back.<br />As is the book is misleading.

It's 1972 or 1973, i've finished several years of college, VietNam dominates our thinking and hangs like a cloud over life, i eventually joined the Army in Jan 1973. I had a favorite and influential uncle who served in VietNam 1966-1970, and as a result i read everything that i could on VietNam.<br />This was the very best. Cool writing, but passionate underneath, scholarly but committed, historical but with the present always in mind. The best of writing and reading. Now as i review the book it looks so dated, for those memories although vivid are aged. But the book is still well written history done during the time with a political goal in mind, to inform the American public about the real issues of VietNam. As such it still bears reading, students who want to learn what those years were all about, or their elders wanting to revisit and re-evaluate long forgotten passions. In either case, this is a good place to start. For history may appear to be gone, but it is carried by those who were around, and as the years past, held ready for the inquirer in books such as these.	2004-02-17

For it is a combination of travelogue and spiritual adventure in trying to retrace the path of Hsuan Tsang .<br />Mixed up are the author's thoughts about the reading about Hsuan Tsang and his journey, the physical places that both visit as Bernstein follows the ancient monk's path, and social commentary not just on the places and people but reflects a lifetime of a newspaperman's experiences in this part of the world. What could be a very disjointed and fragmented 'stream of consciousness' travelogue turns out to be a rather organized investigation into not just the author's current travels but the relationship of the monks journey and what happened in the intervening years from the mid 7th C. Well written as the author is a successful and introspective newspaper writer, thoughtful as this is really a work from the heart for him, and for me very much to the point as i had the book with me in Xian as the Big Goose pagoda.<br />Because of the dearth of english reading material that summer travelling, i think i read it twice, once straight through and at least once more a page or chapter at a time as i was starving for anything to read, even something i had already finished. I was not disappointed, for his writing and insights are deep and bear close reading. but most of all it was worth the weight in my already overloaded pack, a true recommendation from the heart and shoulders. enjoy.	2004-02-17

It becomes not a life essential glass of water, but a life threatening monster. Changes in quantity are qualitative. Seems like such a simple idea, but it isn't, as the book shows.<br />An easy but complete read, it talks about how many people you can remember by name, or by shape at a distance. To how technology distorts and maims people and our minds. I am sure that each chapter, and each insight has a number of books now written on the topic, but this is AFAIK the best one volume defense of this cluster of insights about how size really matters.	2004-02-17

I finished the book as part of my expanded reading for an adult education class at our church on the topic of Christian worldviews. We know from the introduction that the book began as his PhD dissertation, i would suspect that this is the contents of chapters 1-8, which are just a little dry, factual presentation dominated by philosophers and their writings. Probably the best available introduction to the concepts revolving around 'world and life view', certainly well done and informative.<br />But it is chapters 9 and 10 that really interest me. 9 is &quot;Theological Reflections of 'Worldview' &quot; and 10 is &quot;Philosophical Reflections on 'Worldview'&quot;. These two chapters are worth the time to read the whole book and well worth an occasional reread in the future to keep the ideas fresh, warm and on the top of my thinking. So if you have just a few minutes to analyze if you want to buy and read this book; start with chapter 9, especially for a Christian, or chapter 10, for the more secular, and see if the book is of interest to you. If you are interested in how he presents ideas i would turn to pg 46, a section entitled &quot;Sacramental Worldview&quot; which is a section on the Eastern Orthodoxy worldview, especially from the pen of Alexander Schmemann, and is probably the best 9 pages in the first 8 chapters, i ordered his book immediately on reading this part.<br />The book is not an easy read, a certain tolerance for names and intellectual history is needed, perhaps not a common quality in today's reading public. But there is nothing that a motivated person with access to the net for more background information can't cure in a few clicks and some supplementary reading. But i am afraid most people would follow a similar trajectory as i did, a few chapters then a slow creep to the bottom of the to-be-read pile, and this is unfortunate, if it happens to you, skip to 9 and 10 and read them, then get back to the harder, less uplifting work of the details rather than the big picture. The author would be well advised to release these 2 chapters onto the (wild)net, for they are standalone, and worthy of greater broadcast then they will get following his dissertation(as packaged in the book), for they would be of great value in discussions like my class at church.appens to you, skip to 9 and 10 and read them, then get back to the harder, less uplifting work of the details rather than the big picture.

After finishing the chapter i completed the rest of the book because of the author's persuasive and compelling writing and knowledge. Two important motifs stand out from the general arguments of the book. The first is the distinction of the &quot;Church of Power&quot; and the &quot;Church of Piety&quot;, brought about by the unfortunate Constantinian synthesis that brought power, wealth, control and lots of conniving people into what had been a lowly, poor, unpowerful movement of aimed at righteous living, thus deforming everything it touched. This is the introduction, &quot;Dimensions of the Supernatural&quot;.  He has a well thought out, and interesting presentation of several related ideas: the level of commitment as indicative of not just what people are willing to put into an institution but what they expect to obtain from it, level of commitment as the psychological motor of reformation and sect-formation. This is the second great idea of the author's: The one true God of monotheism leads naturally to the idea of the one true faith as expressive of belief in this God, along with the level of commitment of individual's as determinative of where they lie on a continuum of interest/commitment. The more people demand of an institution that controls a monopoly on the belief system the more it either splits externally or reforms internally, depending on how the institution treats the rising commitment levels. This is chapter 1: &quot;God's Truth: Inevitable Sects and Reformations&quot;, and apparently the author's first book, &lt;u&gt; the One True God&lt;/u&gt;, which i ordered on the grounds of reading this one.<br />His research and argumentation is top-notch, for instance, in the section on comparing Islamic and Western slavery(in the Americas) he notes that roughly equal numbers of Africans where taken to both areas(7 million, pg 304). But where there are millions of the descendents of these slaves throughout the Americas, there exists few to none in the Islamic crescent from the Sudan through the old Ottoman empire, to India and ending with Indonesia. Such a simple yet compelling observation, indicative of much of the reasoning in the book, straightforward, interesting, and very persuasive.<br />I did not get what i came to read, that is an analysis of the arguments for and against slavery, but i got more than i expected, and interesting and awareness increasing book. If you are interested in getting a taste of the book before commiting to read it, i would start with the first dozen or so pages of chapter 2: &quot;God's Handiwork: The Relgious Origins of Science.&quot; A very readable revisionist, debunking account of the rise of Western science and the relationship it had to Christian theology.of Africans where taken to both areas(7 million, pg 304).

I did not finish this book, rather i stopped at part 3, roughly pg 180 out of 294 pages of text. I didn't finish because i scanned the material and it was of a more practical bent, which is not the reason i picked up and read the book. I am preparing to take a side branch on my creation-evolution-debate reading, looking at the hermeneutics of the justification and abolition of slavery. This book is from my pastor's library and was a textbook in a seminary class on hermeneutics, and as such is an excellent choice.<br />The price of the book and the value of the time spent reading the book is quickly recovered in just the image of the hermeneutical spiral. I now know from further online research that the image is not original to these authors but it is however the first time i have encountered it. As such a fruitful and thought provoking image i am deeply grateful for its introduction and how the authors build systematically around it. For the hermeneutical spiral consciously breaks the circular thinking that is evident in many justifications of inerrancy or in the explanation of the Bible as the word of God, i appreciate this metaphor, for this reason. The additional image of the grid of textual analysis, surrounded by the framework of an individual's thinking, while resting on the foundation of presuppositions has united several motifs i have been aware of but didn't have a handy way to see relationally. For this to i am grateful to the authors. It is a good introduction to the topic of Biblical studies and hermeneutics and rightfully takes its place in seminary and self-study libraries.	2004-01-24

What is extraordinary about the book, is not the contents, but the relationship of the author to the material he covers. From the preface &lt;I&gt;&quot;My approach has been deliberately sympathetic. I wanted to understand each confession, grasp why it had such appeal to converts, comprehend its internal integrity. I have no confessional agenda. I may reflect unrecognized preferences, reveal my own taste in religions. I am fascinated with all religions and in some respects am more fascinated with the sects outside the mainstream than with the churches within it.&quot;&lt;/I&gt; It is my opinion that the author has been very effective in presenting just such a case to us. I end up wondering how he sustained many long nights of solitary reading in the primary religious works without a particular spiritual desire for them. I am as well amazed at how nicely he captures the nuances and pecularities of religious thought and structures and turns this exposition into an effective teaching tool. It makes a great case for the professional standards and interest in the university community to have such calibre of work from a secular professor on a topic that might be dominated by partianship.<br />The book is scholarly, but readable and interesting, i found only chapter 5 &quot;Outside the Evangelical Consensus&quot;, dull enough to pass over the first time through the book, mostly a result of a lack of controversial topics and a little disjointed argument. The book has a two-pronged attack on the material, both are chronological and historical. One thread is people and the history of ideas, the other is institutions and the battles of people and the forms these ideas take within them over time. He is a very good intellectual historian, these chapters are absorbing and catch you up into the long-dead battles of thought. The institutional side seems forced at times on the issue of completeness, perhaps as a textbook this is required so no reader walks away missing important details, as a casual reader i am less interested in completeness and more in intellectual influence. As a result of this i don't think that many people will be motivated simply to pick up the book and read it sequentially from front cover to back, nor is it necessary, for the chapters are written semi-independently. I found chapter 3 &quot;Theological Foundations&quot; and chapter 7 &quot;Reformed Theology at Maturity: Taylor, Hodge, and Bushnell&quot; very interesting and worthy of careful study and followup of references. The sections on Hopkinsian system bears the marks of a particular interest for the author and shows in the writing. So i would recommend a read of chapter 3 to test the waters to see if this book is for you, it being the very best of a good book.e institutional side seems forced at times on the issue of completeness, perhaps as a textbook this is required so no reader walks away missing important details, as a casual reader i am less interested in completeness and more in intellectual influence.

Robbins<br />I don't read much fiction, but this is good historical fiction. I have some interest in war and guns, just enough to pursue a book like this, with the details of being a sniper interesting and holding my attention. But my major interest is in this novel as a window into the big picture, how humanity fights and dies. That is the value of novels, for they can (as this one does) reduce these big issues to two men hunting each other in the winter snow, waiting for the one shot which results in the death of the looser.<br />I basically read the book in one sitting, addicted to get to the climax and see whose body it was freezing in the snow. And who won by picking the pockets and claiming the weapon of the looser. That is the judgement of a good book, do you read it greedily? War of the Rats passes this test. The second test is does it help you to think new thoughts, feel new emotions, identify with the characters and learn from the time spent?<br />From the details: shooting through mortar shells, helmet on a brick rather than a stick, shoot then move, to the big items: 1.5 million Germans lost in Stalingrad, 30,000 made it back to Germany from 1948-1954, while 90K died in Soviet Gulags, the book weaves the issues together, forming a coherent and interesting whole. From the German as intellect and his Siberian counterpart as instinctual wolf hunter on the taiga, to the issues of walking dead they just don't know it yet, the book yields lots of paths where you can follow the author's reasonings and have hours of reflection to add to those pleasant hours with your head in this book.<br />I do not really understand why humanity fights. Perhaps that is a lesson only those who have experienced it can really know. But as i reflect on what i learned from these few hours reading i sense that there is this awful imbalance. Of anger and hatred, fear of the other, the willingness to kill with just a thin veneir of civilization, love of neighbor, self-sacrifice to try to hold that evil in bay. From the moment the rage and insanity of war begin, to the walking shells of men dead to the world from their experiences, to the horror the survivors must feel when they see their burned and bombed out homes, the evil has the upper hand. A novel can drive these issues home in a way that history texts can not, for they enable you to try to feel what a character might have felt, to sympathize and identify to the point of being there. And that is the value of the time spent with a book like this, perhaps in some small way, we can see the horror of war and turn from the actuality of it in our real lives. I'd hope so.hbor, self-sacrifice to try to hold that evil in bay.

I am interested in China and in Christianity. The book struck me as shallow and superficial from the beginning and despite my best intention to believe it could be more never overcame that first impression. The author is too influenced by his newspaper training, for the book reads like a series of short newspaper articles, it leaves you wondering what it is that you learned and asking for more.<br />Now i don't know how much is available to the Western world concerning what is going on to Christians in China. As a glimpse into this world, via short biographies of the people involved it is just acceptable. He obviously travelled to places and saw people that i can only dream of and i can admire and wish to learn from that experience. But i wonder about the depth of the conversations or the critical judgement of the author if these snippets represent the meetings. They are like the small talk that takes place at a party rather than the deep sharing that ought to take place between brethren in the faith, trying to share the things closest to their hearts.<br />Several places the author leads into big questions: the role of women in the church, pentecostal character of the church, the role of house churches, the relationship of church and state etc. where there was good opportunity to tell us what the people he met thought. But he doesn't go very far, and leads to a complaint of shallowness and superficiality beyond the style of the book. Even with endnotes he doesn't continue the conversation with references or notes to the same phenomena in the west. I definitely feel that he drops the ball and really doesn't tell us very much about these people.<br />Frustrating, i'd love to learn more about what is going on there. I'd love to put down the book believing the church is exploding and will have a cultural influence. But the book doesn't leave me with such ideas, rather i feel like i read a travelogue that introduced me to a few heroic persecuted brethren in China. Now i appreciate this, perhaps as the first book to recommend to someone to pick up for an idea of the faith in China it is barely sufficient. Since it doesn't point to anything past itself, and it doesn't seem to interact with the people or theology at any but the most hello-how-are-you level i'd just have to pass on recommending it except as a newspaper level intro.c persecuted brethren in China.

US	53032953	R1XG74UOE1XNZ0	0425089517	640376978	The Tunnels of Cu Chi	Books	4	2	8	N	N	i write the review with tears in my eyes	The book is for me a followup on a long term interest. I was active in the anti-war movement in highschool and was in the US Army when the war ended in 1975. My uncle fought there for 3 years and i remember well his envelopes with the 'free' in the postage field.My father and i fought bitterly over the war and never mentioned it after i left home. But my memories can be only a dim shadow of those who were there, and it is to those to whom this book is addressed.<br /> It doesn't glorify war. Yet i come away from reading it with the firm conviction i felt when reading the _Pentagon Papers_ that the US had supported the wrong side in a civil war. The heroism of the tunnel dwellers is obvious from the facts. The book is organized by topic: women, doctors, American tunnel rats etc. It is not meant to be a complete story but a narrative to tell a story with a moral. The very ground sheltered the VietNamese in their war against: the Japanese, the French and lastly the Americans.<br />It is not an earthshaking must read like _Hell in a very small place_ nor as complete as Stanley Karnow _Vietnam_<br /> http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/030681157X/qid=1073331090//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/104-0425477-9047158?v=glance&s=books&n=507846<br />http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140265473/qid=1073331738/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-0425477-9047158?v=glance&s=books<br />two of the more important books i've seen on VietNam.	2004-01-05

M.Noll like G.Marsden has made my short list of i-must-read-them authors. This is perhaps my 5th book by him i've run across and looked at during my year's study of the issues in the creation-evolution-design(CED) debate. It is, to me, a rather important book for it puts together several issues i have been thinking about but had not related, in particular slavery and evolution being, in the conservative Christian community, similiar issues revolving around the interpretation of Scripture, i intend to follow up this idea. Furthermore, the very systematic way he goes about building a case for the influences of republican ideals on Reformed theology interests me as a very concrete example of the way the cultural matrix determines  religious thought. Noll doesn't use the term \\"American captivity of the Christian Church\\" but the critical ideas are presented to make such a case.<br />It's a rather long (450pages) book, with a complex structure and at times detailed arguments, so i find myself wondering to whom to recommend it. Because of it's historical nature and subject material, simply reading the chapters that most interest you is not as good an option as it would be in reading a collection of essays. So if you simply want to get a taste of the book i would read the first 20 or so pages which are the introduction to both the book, how Noll approaches his subject and what he intends to show with this scholarly research. I found chapters 18 and 19 the most interesting: chapter 18 \\"The 'Bible Alone' and a Reformed, Literal Hermeneutic\\", and<br />chapter 19 \\"The Bible and Slavery\\", i have several long quotes from these chapters on my extended review at: [...]<br />. I think if someone is adequately motivated that the book is accessible to anyone with an interest in history but if your knowledge of the time period or of the theologies discussed is inadequate you will wonder what the fuss is all about, perhaps many secular people will wonder that in any case.<br />The theme of the book is not hard to summarize. It is that forces of the political life of the US, in particular, republicanism, Whiggery, the demand for equality, had a very important influence on the evolution of each American Christian theology. So too did several cultural influences in the philosophic sphere: common sense moral reasoning via the Scottish enlightenment, an anti-authoritarianism that reached out to all authorities-kings, priests, intellectuals, elites, these too influenced the evolving theology. But the influence was not just a one-way street, but rather in the search for converts the churches became a dominant influence in the culture, not just themselves but the myriad voluntary organizations they gave rise to. So by the Civil War we have a voluntary church, disestablished where those in Europe were not, filled with republicans, certain that their common sense will rightly interpret the Bible, and their morality derived thusly will support a glorious city-on-the-hill that they envisioned for the US. But the devil is in the details, and this is where the book gets really interesting. How do these forces relate? How does theology evolve, why and who is doing what thinking and writing? All done with a scholarly professor's mind, tying together the years of research with a joy and exuberance that is catching. Thanks M. Noll for another most excellent read.......bout, perhaps many secular people will wonder that in any case. <br />The theme of the book is not hard to summarize.

US	53032953	R1309VV34INO93	0802805124	646322659	Perspectives on an Evolving Creation	Books	4	53	60	N	N	essay collection on Theistic evolution by orthodoxChristians	The book is a collection of essays (21) with a common theme-theistic evolution(TE), a common allegience-to orthodox Christianity, on the part of the writers. As such it is in a very small category, as TE tends to be beat up by both extremes on the issues- the young earth creationist(YEC) and secular evolutionary materialists, being orthodox complications the matter a lot as no one is happy with what you have to say. It is an introductory book, aimed at a general audience with at least a background on the issues. Its weaknesses are the general weaknesses of the essay collection genre itself, in particular, no sooner do you get into an essay then it is over and you must start the process of familarization and understanding an author all over again. The unevenness of different people's style and form makes going a little hard and continuity even harder. I suspect that the various authors had the other guys outlines in hand as they refer internally to the other essays, but no discussion or 2-way conversations are apparent, this helps a little bit to lighten the essay load but it is still a difficult straight through read. however i have no problem recommending the book, partly because i have little else to offer, partly because the bulk of the essays are above average and any reader can skip and choose what he/she desires to read.<br />The essays themselves are divided into 3 major groupings: &quot;Providing a Context&quot; &quot;Scientific Evidence and Theory&quot; and &quot;Theological Implications and Insights&quot;. For my own appraisal the book reached a peak early with the first two parts and really slumped in the last, with the exception of H. VanTill's essay &quot;Is the Universe Capable of Evolving?&quot;. I enjoyed the next essay &quot;Special Providence and Genetic Mutation&quot; but found it a little too choppy, i hope to read the longer essay that it is a summary of in order to see the fuller development. The material covered is the big questions in the field and offered little surprises overall except for chapter 5 &quot;Does Science Exclude God? Natural Law, chance, Miracles, and scientific practice&quot; which is good enough to be the one chapter that i would recommend reading if you wish to get a quick idea of the book and whether you wish to invest the time in reading the whole collection. The authors choosen are certainly the best in the field and their names are known to anyone with a familarity in the field. Conrad Hyers, Howard Van Till, Mark Noll, David Livingston, Keith B. Miller, are joined by Terry Gray who i wish the best in his search for answers in this discussion, as it has carried a very high personal cost to him and i admire how he has risen to this level in the discussion, congratulations.<br />The book suffers a little from no research notes or reference listing, although most of the footnotes will do for a start. A systematic introductory essay to each section outlining the issues and the past history of positions would have been helpful as well. In general however the authors are very aware of their audience and do a good job communicating their understanding with a minimum of jargon, in a fair and not-argumentative way.ld and offered little surprises overall except for chapter 5 &quot;Does Science Exclude God?

US	53032953	R39WB1FR6SOTWK	0801038707	788741613	Fit Bodies Fat Minds:  Why Evangelicals Don't Think and What to Do About It (Hourglass Books)	Books	4	38	46	N	N	form and style follow analysis and function	Reading this book is part of a deliberate effort to study the relationship of reason to the Christian faith. The current subtopic is why evangelicals seem to be so anti-intellectual, this book follows: The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind , and Love Your God with All Your Mind . There are two more in the TBR pile as well: Habits of the Mind by James Sire and The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship by George Marsden, so i am looking for more books with the same common theme, email me your favorites please.<br />I usually read for an hour or so each morning over coffee at a local fast food joint, i find if i don't get out of the house at this time, that i don't get out of the house at all. I was lamenting the slowness of my reading to a person i have gotten acquainted with while sitting in my favorite booth there. He told me my problem was that i am trying to reading books that are too long, i suspect he isn't much of a reader, but his point is well taken. So this very short, 150 pages book is my attempt to take his advice to heart. The trouble is that this book is not an easy read, not because it's topic is complex but because of its structure, i started the book and put it aside several times because it seems too disjointed and choppy. It wasn't until chapter 10 on advertising that i realized that the book's structure is deliberate and made to mirror the criticism he makes of the shallowness of Christian intellects, i know i am slow, but i eventually got it.<br />The average chapter is about 5 pages long, the book reads like a series of slogans strung out together on a clothes line, with cuteness in phrasing common. There is little complexity of thought with points then defense and analysis but rather a structure that mentally looks like an outline. I thought at first that it was a collection of essays written for serialization in a periodical hence the short, concise chapter length, but with the embedded advertisements in chapter 10, it became clear that the form was part of his message. Literally the book is written to those he is critical of, those majority of Christians that prefer TV to books, who desire style rather than substance, who are critical of the pastor if the sermon has more than 3 main points or goes over the allotted 30 minutes(45 in Reformed churches, we are just a little more intellectual). So he wrote the book in 3 sections, each with 8 points, none of the points with more than 2 levels of depth, chapters able to be read in 15 minutes or less (except the last, \\"Let My People Think\\", his prescription which is 21 pages long, an average sermon). Now this makes a cute point, but is really hard on a reader, who naturally expects a book not a collection of sermons, unless labelled and advertised as such. The cuteness is mnemonic, meant to be ear-some, witsome, memorable with turns of phrase to stick in the mind and become the central take home point to remain available in the reader to dredge up when he thinks about the topics covered.<br />Fit Bodies, Fat Minds<br />Introduction: A Scandal and a Sin<br />....\\"the greatest danger besetting American Evangelical Christianity is the danger of anti-intellectualism. The mind as to its greatest and deepest reaches is not cared for enough\\" Charles Malik (pg 11)<br />....\\"Without a genuinely critical position resting on Christain foundations and directed by a coherent theological vision that can deal with modern science and technology and the reality of foreign cultures, it is very likely that the evangelical voice in politics today will once again confuse the Christian faith with the American flag.\\" John Schaar (pg 13)<br />....Not surprisingly the disarray and frustration is deepest among evangelicals who think--whether those who do so for a living such as academics, or those who do so for the love of it, such as artists.\\",/i> (pg 15)<br />Part One: A Ghost Mind<br />....\\"But the real damage to evangelicals was self-inflicted...The true story of the evangelical mind in retreat is the story of the surrender, not the stealing of America.\\"<br />1.

US	53032953	R3J9Y2GCVOGNCX	1576830160	799449705	Love Your God with All Your Mind: The Role of Reason in the Life of the Soul	Books	4	27	31	N	N	Why and How to use your Mind to Serve Your God	Describing the book is easy enough. It is a competent Christian philosopher-educator trying to heal the anti-intellectualism in the modern Church. To that end the book is first a description of the problem with a little historical analysis. (&quot;How We lost the Christian Mind and Why We Must Recover It&quot;= chapter 1) Then an explanation of the role of reason in the spiritual transformation that is the historic orthodox Christian faith. This is part 1 = &quot;Why the Mind Matters in Christianity&quot;. The rest of the book is a two piece prescription, argued top down, from big principles to important particular and specific recommendations. But such simple descriptions don't do justice to such an important book, so i will expand, as he did into the details of the argument.<br />First, several motivations of the author are clearly seen and are important to understanding the way he writes and the structure of the arguments. One, he has a preacher-teacher's heart, concerned that people pick up this book, read and understand it, but most significantly internalize the ideas. To this end it is not a hard read, he uses the best techniques to involve the mind of the reader in the material. Uses clear language and argues point-by-point systematically building his book so that the average reader will walk away with the main points in his head, rather than leaving them, as is often done, still in the pages of the book. This alone recommends the book to Sunday School, high-school or college reading groups, or as he talks about in the book -- church libraries and study centers where the faithful are taught to think clearly about their faith. In fact, i'd propose that this book would be the required reading introduction to such study centers. Second, Moreland is concerned and worried about the condition of the average pew warmers mind and the skills he/she has acquired in this world concerning the faith and he desires to do something about it. That something is tied to vocation. Vocation, both types, the calling to walk in this world being ready to give an apologia, and the form of how to 'subdue the earth' with our own hands, ie our 'secular' job. This thread, slanted to college students looking for theirs, but applicable to all, prevades the book from the first page to the extensive list of resources in the back.<br />But what are the details? pg 39 &quot;If we are going to be wise, spiritual people prepared to meet the crises of our age, we must be a studying, learning community that values the life of the mind.&quot; He assumes that anyone reading past this point will be desirous of attaining such a lofty goal. Convinced of the need, we need help finding the way to achieve it. The way is to understand Romans 12:1-2 &quot;Paul puts his finger on the very essence of how we grow to become like Jesus: &quot;Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world.&quot; he tells us, &quot;but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.&quot; pg 65. But like any good preacher he doesn't stop at description but moves to prescription: &quot;More generally, by choosing to undertake a course of study, meditation, and reflection, I can put myself in a position to undergo a change in the content, strength, and centrality of my beliefs.&quot; These beliefs we undertake to change are part of the plausibility structures of both ourselves and of the greater society we are a part of. This is his big argument, unless Christians are prepared and competent in understanding their beliefs then they can not communicate the Gospel to others(apologetics), nor can they influence an increasingly secular society(being salt). Simply put, modification of society's plausibility structures means you need to first understand and build your own rightly.<br />This takes him to part 2= &quot; How to Develop a Christian Mind&quot;, which is mixture of top-down arguments like: &quot;commitment to truth and reason&quot; pg 99 and lower level details like: jog when you get tired to get out of a passive rut, pg 95. There is even a section on the elements of logic: &quot;Clearing the Cobwebs from My Mental Attic&quot; = chapter 5. It is this part that i found harder reading because of the changing levels, one part big issue analysis, then the next paragraph details on a conversation. The last part is application (typical sermon structure *grin*) with a very interesting section on &quot;Refurbishing the Local Church&quot; pg 190-200, where the details from his past ministries figures prominently in his recommendations. If you just want to read a few pages to get the best of the book, these 10 are them. Surprisely detailed, most certainly a big step for any local church, i'd love to move anywhere in the country where these ideas were put into practice.<br />Thanks for the opportunity to recommend the book to you, i hope you pick a copy up as a result of this review.t tired to get out of a passive rut, pg 95.

The problem is that it is a popular book directed at the common reader, nothing difficult, nothing particularly new or stimulating. It is right at the interface of evolutionary biology and abiogenesis, as such would be a good entry level book for a high school student who would like to learn more about the broad subject material without being bogged down in the details of the controversies. He seems to hit all the important issues in the topic, shows that he has thought deeply about the subject material and is really interested in the reader getting the gist of the debate elements. The big advantage is completeness of coverage, the drawback is the shallowness of each chapter, where you really want to know more about what Davies has thought about.	2003-12-01

At this point i am rereading some of his collections of essays in order to psych myself up for the week or more that his 'brick' _The Structure of Evolutionary Theory_ will take. I don't like baseball and had only skimmed this book previously, so for a couple of easy reading hours it occupied my mind.<br />It is basically about how to think about statistics. Summed up on pg 169ff. &quot;Life's necessary beginning at the left wall. This is a takehome message from the excellent example of the drunkard's walk, pg 149ff. Left wall's are 'no one can earn less than zero dollars', 'no one can live and weight less than 50 lbs'. but Bill Gates can make enough money to skew the income and wealth curves so they look like capital 'L's. &quot;Stability throughout time of the initial bacterial mode&quot;, most of the world's biomass is bacteria, no you or me. &quot;Life's successful expansion must form an increasingly right-skewed distribution&quot;, this is the reply to evolution as progressive complexity to eventually produce US, thinking, creative, human beings. We are the &gt;.400 baseball score, we are the very few that prove the rule that the masses are bacteria. &quot;The myopia of characterizing a full distribution by an extreme item at one end&quot;, &quot;Causality resides at the wall and in the spread of variation: the right tail is a consequence, not a cause&quot;, The only promising way to smuggle progress back into such a system is logically possible, but empirically false at high probability&quot; and &quot;Even a parochial decision to focus on the right tail alone will not yield the one, most truly desired conclusion, the psychological impetus to our yearning for general progress-that is, the predictable and sensible evolution to domination of a creature like us. endowed with consciousness.&quot;<br />It is not an earth-shaking book by any means, rather a collection of essays where the most interesting part is his explanation of dealing with cancer, which apparently is what he died from nearly 20 years after the first diagnosis, and the reasoning about statistics that started with his predicted death rates from it as he lay there in a hospital bed.<br />The drunkards walk could have been greatly enlarged, so for instance, by the addition of multiple drunkards bumping into each other, thus temporary right walls. Much like the biosphere is a changing mosaic of different species and different individuals.<br />But like all his essays, it is time well spent, not just to get a new example or more ways of handling data, but for the pleasant time with SJG and his excellent writing.an earth-shaking book by any means, rather a collection of essays where the most interesting part is his explanation of dealing with cancer, which apparently is what he died from nearly 20 years after the first diagnosis, and the reasoning about statistics that started with his predicted death rates from it as he lay there in a hospital bed. <br />The drunkards walk could have been greatly enlarged, so for instance, by the addition of multiple drunkards bumping into each other, thus temporary right walls.

But to get there the first 1/3 is a rather nice simple biographical sketch of Darwin and his times. One particularly good accent was on the Platonic essentialism that marked much of the historical thinking about biology up to Darwin's time. As such this part of the book would be a good first read for a high school student on Darwin.<br />The second half is his desire to convince people that Darwinian thinking is crucial for a good understanding of not just the natural biological world but for greater issues like sociobio to medicine. As such is a good general survey of an extremely polarized subject material without getting bogged down in the debate itself.	2003-12-01

My only regrets in reading the book are that (1)i am finished with it (2)that i didn't read it 30 years ago. Not because it is original or thought provoking as much as it is that ellusive puts-it-all-together broadly covering subjects that you know something about but just-couldn't-put-it-into-words type of book. That review article that gives you the needed perspective and points to a million places for further study, thus energizing what looked like an impossible task you were just about to abort.<br />The author is witty, interesting, well spoken and at points understatedly humorous. He has that professor's mind shaped by years of trying to convince students that what he finds fascinating is in fact something that ought to keep them awake in their lecture hall seats. The organizing principle is stated, restated, reshaped and appears in slightly different forms in every chapter and is an image that can be seen and reworked a million times in a learner's mind. This is the title, the arch of knowledge, up one side from the empirical via induction to general principles and down the other leg via deductive reasoning (this is just one of the incarnations of the arch), the whole thing is science, but the analysis of the arch is metascience(the author's word) and his book is meta-metascience(again his word) as it discusses the various way of constructing and understanding this analogy.<br />The organization is historical, starting with the &quot;Ancient Tradition&quot; with the Greeks, and proceeding chronologically via the careful analysis of individual's, their contribution to the architecture of the arch, and with particular attention to the problems they encountered and were desireous of solving. Contextualization, the putting into a great big picture of the march of science and of the flow of metascience in thinking about science, is always in the forefront of the author's intentions. There are times where he literally says that there is more interesting things to talk about here, that he is really interested personally in the topic, but it would interfere with the flow and learner's understanding if he were to pursue this topic. Along with this, both the individual chapter endnotes and the reference section at the book's end are treasures of 'where-to-go-from-here', but only complaint is that the book is dated 1986 and thus the references are dated and/or hard-to-find. But the book, being a historical survey could be updated by the addition of a new chapter or two, not necessarily a complete rewrite as is often needed in the sciences.<br />There have been many times in the recent past where i wished for such a book to be able to share the title with someone in an online discussion that just appeared to know nearly nothing about the big issues underlying the philosophy of science. Well now i have the book title to share. I am almost to the point that i would appreciate a comprehensive quiz or a required reading list in order to enter into discussion groups on technical or scientific topics. The pure bulk of garbage, of uneducated or foolish opinions, makes the noise to signal ratio so high that i contemplate leaving and sticking just to peer reviewed journals and published books. This book being read by a significant portion of those attempting to discuss issues in the creation-evolution-design CED debate, (which is the forum where i dwell of late, and what brought this book to my attention), would certainly uplift these discussions, to everyone's benefit. If you want to discuss evolutionary biology, or the relationship of science to religion as it impinges in this sphere, you simply must grasp the material presented in this book. Otherwise you are wasting time, rehashing, retracing, rebuilding the doomed, and generally not getting anywhere constructive. And that is the value of such a book: basic, learnable, systematic introduction to a rather complex twisting field that is of general interest to significant portions of the general public, who may be, and often are tempted to think that science is democratic in that even the uninformed opinion (that is their's) is of value. &quot;Everyone has a right to their opinion, but no one has a right to demand that i take their opinion seriously UNLESS they have done their homework.&quot; In general philosophy of science 101, this is the best book i have yet encountered. Go for it.her complex twisting field that is of general interest to significant portions of the general public, who may be, and often are tempted to think that science is democratic in that even the uninformed opinion (that is their's) is of value. &quot;Everyone has a right to their opinion, but no one has a right to demand that i take their opinion seriously UNLESS they have done their homework.&quot; In general philosophy of science 101, this is the best book i have yet encountered.

US	53032953	R3QEE6159A6SDI	0300096933	131276839	Jonathan Edwards: A Life	Books	5	20	21	N	N	biography plus theology of a serious and important man	First, this book confirms my earlier suspicion that anything written by George Marsden is extraordinary and a must read, simply because of the quality of the research and the writing. The book was a 'from the pulpit recommendation' and as such not on my usual list of suspects to be read, i am however grateful for the recommendation and thankful for the time spent reading this biography of a very important and interesting person.<br />Second, the purpose of the book is aptly summed up by the author in the last chapter, &quot;My belief is that one of the uses of being an historian, particularly if one is part of a community of faith, is to help persons of such communities better understand what they and their community might appropriate form the great mentors of the past and what is extraneous and nonessential. ... It should also be to help people see how to put things back together again. We need to use history for the guidance it offers, learning from great figures in the past-both in their brilliance and in their shortcomings. Otherwise we are stuck with only the wisdom of the present.&quot; pg 502<br />The book naturally breaks up into 3 pieces: the first, the much greater, is the biography of Edwards reaching a culmination in the church severing the pastoral relationship with Edwards that had been theirs for 26 years. The problems, both interpersonal and theological are summed up nicely in chapters 17 &quot;A House Divided&quot; and 18 &quot;A Model Town No More&quot;. If you only have a limited time to invest in this book, i would start with reading these two chapters first. The next piece is the rest of his life, upto chapter 25. The final part is the systematic presentation of his theology in an historical context with one eye on its influence for the next 100 years in America. If you are primarily interested in Edwards as a theologian i would start but reading 26 &quot;Against and 'Almost Inconceivably Pernicious' Doctrine&quot; to the end.<br />The major threads in the biography appear to be:<br />Edwards as smitten by the beauty of God and His universe. The fragility of life and the necessity of getting right with God now as a consequence of mortality. The importance of 3 big controversies in Edwards' life: Old versus New Light, or the meaning and significance of emotional/enthusiastic revival, discipline in the church as illustrated by the boys and the midwife manual, which lead up to his dismissal from the church, and the place of reason in the life of a very bright man with deeply held convictions.<br />I appreciated the book, it is not a hard read, slanted to the general reader with all the hard stuff and references in endnotes. It moves evenly throughout with none of the low boring spots you might expect in a work this long. I would recommend it to most anyone with an interest in either theology or pre-Revolutionary America.<br />I am on the lookout for followup material. please email to rwilliam2 at yahoo. i have _Theology in American_ by Holifield and _America's God_ by Noll in hand.<br />as well as: The Philosophical Theology of Jonathan Edwards<br />by Sang Hyun Lee<br />thanks for reading this short review. i hope you pick up the book on this recommendation.eads in the biography appear to be:<BR>Edwards as smitten by the beauty of God and His universe.

If you just have a chance to glance at the book, (1)read pg 150, this is the last page before the epilogue(and is a very concise summary of the book's topics), then read the (2)epilogue, then chapter 1 (3)&quot;the kingdom of God is at hand&quot;.(these will give you the best idea of the type of writing and whether it means with your interests) The meat of the book is chapter 6 &quot;the nature of nature&quot; which is an extended argument against Augustine's view of original sin as 1)carried by semen 2)at odds with the radical moralfreedom that the early church taught 3)at odds with natural science. 4)is primarily a cynical justification of the power of religious and political organizations<br />I really don't know who to recommend the book to. It is written not for scholars, although rebuttal of her points would require at least as good a scholar as she is, but rather at an undergrad level. Educated laymen, interested scholars from associated disciplines, people following an interest in Augustine, early church history particular the gnostics(her speciality) would be the natural audience. I read it as part of a deliberate study on Gen 1-3 and interpretations and found it most interesting and provocative with regards to this interest.<br />She is a good and competent writer, holding your attention and making effort to explain difficult and esoteric historical points not only clear but relevant. A noble and achievable goal in this book. As to the content, there are only a few points that i am particularly competent to analyze as they cross my interests or knowledge base. In several of these she had misread orthodox thinking and comes close to strawman arguments, however i am not sure if this stems from her committments in the field or from my lack of historical depth. But it doesn't demolish the arguments only make them not-persuasive to me.<br />The book is an extended historical and theological introduction to the exegesis of Genesis 1-3, in particular, the relationship of Adam-Eve-the serpent to the questions of freewill or moral competence-to-choose. She is most detailed and fact-based when she talks about Augustine in chapter 6, but most interesting as she outlines the 4 or 5 centuries of intellectual history in chapter 1. As a secondary, but certainly interesting theme, there is the interpenetration of religious with political thinking. Why doctrines are not hand delivered from God above but rather are often the result of backroom manipulations and intrigue. It is this tension between ideas as independent creatures, like Plato's forms, and as nothing more than justifications of power structures and hierarchical institutions that supplies a movement, a dynamic that makes the book readable and engaging.<br />I am, of course, aware of Prof. Pagels by reputation, however this is the first book of hers i have had the pleasure of reading and as a result will be interesting in finding more, particularing in her field of Gnostic studies and the Nag Hammadi manuscripts.nship of Adam-Eve-the serpent to the questions of freewill or moral competence-to-choose.

The book is balanced differently with the relationship of the Maori and nature via the whales as major theme and the young great-granddaughter's position as the descendent of the first WhaleRider the secondary theme.<br />Second, on the theme of women's supposed inferiority to men, see pg 82 where the author writes \\"'No, you sit down! I am a senior line to yours!' Not only that, but Mihi had then turned her back to him, bent over, lifted up her petticoats, and said, 'Anyway, here is the place where you come from!' That was Mihi's way of reminding the chief that all men are born of women.\\"<br />Third, in one of the very few diadactic paragraphs pg 116 \\"'But then,' he continued.'man assumed a cloak of arrogance and set himself up above the Gods. He even tried to defeat Death, but failed. As he grew in his arrogance, he started to drive a wedge through the original oneness of the world. In the passing of Time he divided that world into that half he could believe in and that half he could not believe in. The real and the unreal. The natural and the supernatural. The present and the past. The scientific and the fantastic. He put a barrier between both worlds, and everything on his side was called rational and everything on the other side was call irrational.  Belief in our Maori Gods.' he emphasized, 'has often been considered irrational.'\\" I think this is the author's way of explicitly outlining his theme of the book, his desire is that no one misses the point so he introduces it via this speech. This is the take home message of the book, we'd do well to read the whole book in the light of this short speech Koro Apirana.<br />The book, like the movie is a tear-jerker. The book would make a nice read outloud to younger kids, it's intended audience.	2003-11-06

I started the book, wishing him the best in the endeavor and hoping that he was successful. But the book is not persuasive and drags the last half so that really isn't even interesting.<br />Second, the old earth-young Adam position is very uncommon. Looking at his references his book is one of perhaps 5 in the last 400 years that strongly proposes this. Now this is not an argument against the ideas, i don't believe truth is accounted for by counting noses, but it is a point of concern and awareness. Why would this significant truth be lost, undiscovered, untaught for so long?<br />Third, his lack of depth is discouraging at several critical junctions, the chapter on theistic evolution is simply a straw man argument and an argument from personal incredulity. He misses all the big points in this position and his persuasiveness never got back the strength it had in the earlier chapters.<br />However he does attempt to systematically present both his position, starting about 1/2 through the book, the first half is a quick analysis of the debate and the major positions and themes within it. This first 1/2 is better than average, but doesn't help the last half which is his unique contribution to the discussion.<br />Those 'bad' things being said, i have no doubt as to his sincerity and strength of conviction. Of his desire to reconcile Scripture and Science while doing justice to both, his fundamental allegience to a conservative, however not a fundamentalist high view of Scripture and the orthodox Christian God. There are paragraphs to page length expositions that are excellent, clustered in the first half of the book, that are worth the reading; however of the last half, only the last few summary pages struck me as worth the time.<br />As to the position, that Adam was the progenitor not of the human race, but of the covenant line. I like the basic shape of the theme, his argument is pointing the way but not persuasive. I only wish i had access to several more of the authors who write similiarly. I appreciate the fact that Scripture can be interpreted along these lines without doing injustice to the text but i would have appreciated a theological discussion of the ramifications of the position to systematic theology, especially the idea of the federal headship of Adam. His writing on this was only a few pages, certainly not sufficent to overturn a doctrine with such magnitude and scope. But the potential is there for someone else to pickup the idea and run with it.<br />I think the old earth-young Adam position is getting more eyeball time on the net via discussion groups, which is how i was recommended the text. I think this book is a primary source of the idea but the proposition can probably be summed up in a short essay without the necessity of reading this entire book to get up to speed on it. So as far as a recommendation, just the very hard core, must know types will benefit for a reading, the rest of us can read their essays about the book online....<br />Thanks for reading this review, i would like to have thought higher of the book, however my respect for the integrity and thoughtfulness of the author is not diminished in the least, it is a good try.e.

US	53032953	REBNAGMZDQWP1	0834802058	26902052	Into China's Heart	Books	5	3	3	N	N	a little Gem of a travelog	I found the book in a little one room bookstore, in the basement of a very small country town's library. My wife insists she can't take me anywhere without stopping at every little used bookstore or thriftstore, she's undoubtably right. But this book assures that i will continue this practice for it is a gem of a book.<br />From the outside, the back cover, inside blurbs, random page meanderings, it looks like an Overseas Chinese returns to her birthplace with the idea of tracing &quot;China's Sorrow&quot;, the Yellow River. In itself this is a noble and interesting idea for a book and a travel. However in her capable and thoughtful hands this idea becomes something much more, a social commentary but an asute and careful observer of the human condition. So the form is a commentary on her travels and travails but it borders closely on travel essays outlining what makes the Chinese so Chinese, from kindof on the outside, born Chinese but Western in outlook and fundamental beliefs.<br />For it is these observations, not lengthy polemical pages but these little snippets as she thinks outloud about what she is seeing and experiencing, that make it an extraordinary and deeply likeable book. I've read whole books on the burden that 5000 years of history puts on the Chinese, but her sentences describing a man carrying a heavy carved for-export tablet make these ideas so real. I have read several good books on China and this rates with the best of them for the talent and insight that the author demonstrates while just talking about a young women who befriends her and their conflicts with the ever-observant government.<br />Her descriptions of train rides, bureaucrats, the eroded soil, the shifting sands, are persuasive and deserve a read by anyone interested in China or recent Chinese history(book dated 1985). It is an absorbing and nice read, accessible to anyone with the slightest care for history or social commentary. Thanks to the competent and people-aware author, i look forward to getting another book by her.k forward to getting another book by her.	2003-10-27
US	53032953	R3JNT99AXJ3X6R	0674854292	116036272	Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate over Science and Religion	Books	4	3	5	N	N	History as Myth, a careful reinterpretation	I come to the book as part of a self-directed study of the issues involved in the creation-evolution-design debate(CED). I deeply enjoy history and appreciate good historical writing. This book is such good, informative history. The author is a careful, balanced, objective-striving historian, and i like his writing. His intention is to dissipate the myths that have grown up around the Scopes trial via a careful reinterpretation of the events and personalities that were involved. To a very great extent he does so. My only sadness in reading the book is that it reaffirms my belief that very little has changed in the conservative/fundamentalist community since the trial, an unfortunate problem. For i continually hear the exact same arguments on the discussion boards, it seems no one is listening to books like this.<br />W.J.Bryan and C.Darrow are the primary characters involved in the trial. Their polarization of the issues as between religion and godless atheism on Bryan's part, and between science as reason and fundamentalism as unthinking faith are exactly the polarizing demands from their respective successors today. The real issues (like one line in the book pointed to epistemology), the problem of taking past each other, the radical 'emptying' of any compromise positions, these are still the issues people fight about. If you are interested in these things this book will be a gentle introduction to the historical and continuing character of them.<br />The book is history, it doesnt try to answer these perennial questions, but rather is trying to clear the field of misconceptions as in the movie &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. It has places that if the author had desired to could have been jumping off points for extended discussions, as in the introduction of the theistic evolutionist as expert witnesses. But this was not followed up, as it was not the author's intention to move past the history towards solutions, sadly for i think his ideas and research could help here. Maybe that is another book for him.<br />One real strength is the presentation of the trial as politically contrived, for the purpose of bringing people and money to Dayton. Contrived as a platform for the presentation of ideas or the playing to the crowd. I ended up with a greater respect for Bryan and a lesser one for Darrow, having read what their intentions were, and how they tried to accomplish them. Bryan ends up as an anomolous character, progressive in his politics, but holding to a somewhat childish faith with an inability to logically inform or express it. Sadly i feel that he died before he could begin to learn for the experiences of the trial and grow as a result of the troubles he had.<br />It's a good book, but i dont know who to recommend it to. Perhaps a history buff, or someone who liked Inherit the Wind and wants to learn the truth of the issues. It didnt really give me a lot of details about the issues in CED that i didnt already dig up myself, but it did confirm the fundamental correctness of several things i have thought about.ere.

The book is truely amazing.<br />Part of the amazement is that the topic can be worded so narrowly that you wonder how to write an essay on it, rather than a whole and interesting book.<br />For from the outset the book is about a note, passed from the hand of one-Zhang Xi to General Yue Zhongqi , in the city of Xi 'an, late October 1728 (western calendar of course). The emperor is Yongzheng, of the Qing dynasty, which has been in power since 1644. It is what Spence does with this event, how he unfolds and adds systematically to our knowledge of China, to our appreciation of the intricacies of Chinese society and its governance by the Manchurians, having replaced the Ming who were native Chinese, that makes this a great book. It reads like a detective novel, slowly introducing new facts as we need them, leading us by the hand to his deep and sympathic understanding of Chinese history, all the time using words and phrases that beguile and intertwine us with the unfolding events as they become real from the distant past. Spence found his calling by crossing from academic writing in his strict histories back and forth to this genre which is more accurate than historical novels yet shares in the attractiveness and readability of them. The qualities of respect for historical accuracy and a good storyteller are not commonly found inside one person's head and i am gratefully for their collusion in J.Spence for his writing makes us all much more aware and involved in the history of the Chinese.<br />From the last page:<br />&quot;Thus it can be said that both emperors got it wrong. One emperor thought that by airing all the negative facts against himself, he could purge the record of the noxious rumors, and because of his honesty posterity would revere his name. But his people remembered the rumors and forgot the disclaimers. The second emperor thought that by destroying the book he world lay his father's ghosts to rest. But his people thought that the reason he wanted to destroy the book was because so much of what it contained was true. &quot; pg 247<br />It is a good book, one of those pieces of history that in the writing and our reading of it, transcend the particular and cast light on the general condition of being human. Certainly there is much in this book particular to being Chinese in the early 1700's, much that is culture bound and as a result something i can read about but can never experience. But in sharing those particulars, Spence has shown, and often made us feel, what it means to live as human beings, striving to understand while trying to get enough to eat. Striving to honor parents, governmental authorities, Heaven itself, while exercising freedom of thought, and pushing the limits of acceptability to the greater classes to which they belong.<br />I put the book down with a greater respect for Confucian classics and the way they held China together for 2500 years, for the respect that the Chinese have for book knowledge, for calligraphy, for writing, for scholarship. I am left with a much better understanding of the problems of bureaucracy and governing a population of tens of millions before electronic means of communication and the instantaneousness we have come to demand and expect. All big ideas that Spence could have written a dry scholarly textbook on, say _the means of governance of China via Confucian classics and the literary bureaucracy_. but i know this imaginary book could have none of the emotional appeal and humanity that _Treason by the book_ does. Form does matter, some things do communicate better, more forcefully and easier, this book is one.

US	53032953	RV1Q8VUVK49YY	0395937582	646140056	Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age	Books	4	13	15	N	N	why did they fight?	read as part of online reading group on history and biography.<br />I can't recommend to highly to join and contribute to a book club, listening to other people talk about the books you've read and enjoy is a real treat.<br />The book is an unusual look at the spirit(geist) of European civilization and World War I. It is unusual not just because of the ideas he proposes, in particular, that WWI marks a turning point in history where a new spirit displaced the old, but in the very way he writes. For it is not history in a narrow sense of people, dates, and activities, but rather social criticism or commentary on the meaning of the events, on the big movements of ideas. Like H. Spenser or A. Toynbee, M. Eksteins is concerned with meaning, with significance, with ideology; these big powerful currents that dwarf the mere mortals that think them. This kind of writing appeals to some people and really disappoints many others, i suppose it has a lot to do with if the author sees the same big picture as you do, or if you constantly fight his analysis while reading the book.<br />It is his belief that technology, the growth of population in cities, contribute to a changing spirit of the age(geist) that found in the destruction and death of WWI, a sympathetic note and a turning point. He starts with art and artists as embodied ideology that represented a nihilism, a challenge to the 19thC bourgeois values that had dominated European culture up until this point in time. This is the ballet and music that give the book its name, ballet as art in rebellion, music as jarring noise to force people out of their normal paths of thinking. This and the details of the contention form chapter one-\\"Paris\\". He moves from there to \\"Berlin\\", chapter two, an analysis of the geist of Germany, its newness as a coherent unified state, and the problems of modernisation. \\"In Flander's Field\\" is about the war itself, and why men fight, in particular, why did the British and German fight? What principles pushed them, what ideals motivated them, and how they responded to the conditions of total war in the trenches. Chapter four, \\"Rites of War\\", feels almost like a paraphases, an explanation of some of the details of the war. \\"Reason in Madness\\" is why do men keep fighting even in such atroctious conditions. This chapter and seven, \\"Journey to the Interior\\" i believe are the best in the book, and are readable by themselves, i would browse these two in order to decide to buy and read the whole book. Seven is about the changing psyche of those involved in the battles, what they thought as primarily seen in journals and poems they kept or sent home. It is the climax of the book, and is the chapter most anchored to details, to primary documents, so that M. Eksteins ideas are supported better here then elsewhere in the book. The book winds down with a chapter each, on the Lindberg flight across the Atlantic, the book \\"Alls Quiet on the Western Front\\" and the rise of Hitler.<br />The big question for me was why did men go into the trenches? continue to stay there for 4 years? and most mysterious go over the top to certain death? He handles this multiple part question in terms of what ideas motivated people and continued to sustain them over the years. I found this of particular interest.<br />I am afraid that the book will have only a small natural audience, read \\"Journey to the Interior\\" to see if you fall into this class of people that like their history with grand views and social criticism, i do and appreciate what turned out to be an interesting and challenging read. I was disappointed at part 3, which starts with \\"Night Dancer\\" the story of Lindberg, i think i would have rather read more supporting data and how things tied together during the war. Then have the aftermath of the war be another book. This is the primary reason i gave the book 4 start rather than 5, he builds up to chapter 7 then it really drops in quality and intensity as it moves to analysis of the world after the trenches. He is best when dealing with a strand of thought, starting from a journal note or a poem, through the meaning of this to the writer, then switching levels to see how this is indicative of a geist that was shared among many troops and the folks back home. He is weak were he talks in sweeping generalities and tries to encompass too much with too little supportive data, especially when the data is art, ballet or music.world after the trenches.

US	53032953	RUW6GVHMF8W0R	0385504519	998837056	Into Africa: The Epic Adventures of Stanley and Livingstone	Books	4	91	104	N	N	a newspaper man's time and geographical slice	It's a breezy read, aimed at the general public at mid high school level writing. The author is a newspaper man, and one of the main characters- Stanley is likewise a newspaper man's newspaper man. The book reminds me of the kind i'd love to find as a high school student: fun, interesting, provocative- something to write a review about for extra credit.<br />Two form items deserve comment. First the chapters alternate: first Livingstone, then Stanley, nice and effective technique. Second, each chapter has a small sidebar where the distance between the two men is calculated. A neat way of doing it, builds the suspense, and makes the movement of the men towards each other all the more interesting.<br />One deeper thought that the book provoked was the humanness of history. The fact that it is made by men (yes, and women, men is generic here) who choose each day to do something, to challenge themselves. This book bears out this idea to the max, the people involved are human, sometimes heroes, often not. But both of the main characters are portrayed as human, and yet just a little superhuman, this class of people who just do above and beyond the call of duty. This is significant, and it makes the book worth the time to read. i publicly thank the person who recommended it to me for it is off my usual track. Plus i really need to practice my speedreading on something, and heavy science is not the right place, this book was.<br />So if you like history a little bit, dont want to be bogged down in heavy big-word writing, like reading newspaper accounts or journalistic writing, then this is a good book for you.<br />thanks for reading this review.	2003-10-06
US	53032953	R37PBPCMWVO2AZ	0830815295	828879389	The Battle of Beginnings: Why Neither Side Is Winning the Creation-Evolution Debate	Books	4	13	14	N	N	good intro to both sides, both science and philosophy	First it is addressed to the general reading public, slanted in tone(style, word choice, difficulty of expression) to high school or freshman college level, with a particular desire(on the author's part) to be read by young earth creationists(YEC) within the Christian community. It is a good, notable addition to the discussion and to anyone's library.<br />Second, the author's motivation is primarily to gently enlighten, by careful philosophic analysis. He is not argumentative, nor brash, so that the book ought not to insult or anger anyone who feels their cherished beliefs under attack. This alone is a unique characteristic of items in the creation-evolution-design debate(CED), and i would welcome the attitude in more literature or discussion in the field. It is not that he doesn't have strong feelings or convictions but rather that he is interested less in persuading people of the righteousness of his ideas, then to explain the problems with the positions taken in the field. There are several places that a strong materialistic anti-creationist darwinian will hit his personal beliefs and recoil, but even these people ought to acknowledge the general evenhandedness of the particulars.<br />I come to the book as a result of a self-directed study in the topics of CED, while i usually don't read introductory material, i was attracted to this, not only because i appreciate the author's work, but for one quote.<br />pg. 129 &quot;So our perceptions, theorizing and evaluations of theories all seem to have an inescapable human tinge to them. And given the significant interflow among those various components, human tinges in any one of the areas have at least the potential to seep into the other areas as well. Thus we cannot eliminate humanness from science (as inductivists wanted to do), nor can we quarantine that humanness in one small corner of science (as hypothetico-deductivists wanted to do). Science is done by humans, and it cannot escape what is inescapably human. Our science is limited to humanly available concepts, humanly available data, humanly available patterns of reasoning, humanly shaped notions of understanding and explanation, and humanly structured pictures of what the world must be like. How could it be otherwise? Science seems to have a serious and incurable case of the humans.&quot;<br />This chapter, 9, &quot;The Nature of Science: A contemporary perspective&quot;, is in fact the high point of the book for me, it is his field as a philosopher and science, and he introduces a term &quot;shaping principles&quot; which he defends and elaborates with great effect and substance. If you can read only this chapter, take the opportunity to do so, it doesn't presuppose a great deal and is worth your time.<br />I had only 1 other 2-starred passage in my highlighting, pg 131 &quot;One important implication of seeing science this way is that although the effects are quite indirect, if philosophical positions, value judgements and even theological doctrines are deeply embedded in science as shaping principles, then they too are subject to some degree of empirical risk and empirical correction as nature responds to the systems of which those principles are components.&quot; This is an extraordinary idea, not shaping principles themselves for this is a common idea in the philosophy of science, although under different names. It is the idea that science and philosophy/metaphysics/religion can have this point of contact, this relationship, this empirical feedback mechanism, whereby the goodness/rightness/correctness of metaphysical principles can be empirically tested. Neat. i will be sure to follow up on this in Del Ratzsch's more scholarly work.<br />The book covers well trod ground in the field, i don't see any surprises, but the two quotes above, but it is the delivery that makes this a good-to-be-recommended book. An easy evening read, without the tension and debate that often accompanies works that will challenge people'sviewpoints.iewpoints.	2003-09-23

It is simply extraordinary, i am at a loss for superlatives to describe it. Thanks to both of the authors for a very pleasant and challenging week spent reading this book.<br />That is the bad news, it is a very hard read. More than once i wanted to get out a large sheet of paper and begin to diagram the book's information rich structure. Who studied where and with whom? what set of principles did he have? what principles did he invent or significantly modify? what ideas was he principly interested in saving, which was he fighting with? on with words like: transmutation, preformationism, aristotelian embryology etc and names like: democritus, empedocles, von Faer, kant, newton etc etc and that is just 2 paragraphs of a random page. Information dense, detailed, insightful, principled ... again i am at a loss for words.<br />First, this is obviously not a book for beginners into the field of evolutionary biology, or for that matter, philosophy, history or even math. It presupposes a graduate level vocabulary, and an undergrad smattering of the sciences. Even then it is a joy to discover new words and new worlds, new friends and old acquaintances in new clothing. Simply one of the best books i've read. Or more precisely, the best 3 books i've read. For it is divided into 3 parts, with the common theme the treatment of the history of Darwinian thought and the separation is roughly something like but not quite as broad as a Kuhnian paradigm revolution.<br />So to reflect that division, i thought of writing 3 reviews. But figured that only those with the desire to read the book would finish even one. So to them i address the rest of this review, an unabased desire to encourage you to get and read this book.<br />The book is a historical analysis of Darwinian evolutionary biology's(EB) THEORY. &quot;this book is about the intellectual constructs by which discoveries about evolution are guided, assembled, and justified as contributions to knowledge.&quot; 1st page introduction.<br />What is the big picture?<br />Darwinism as (metaphysical) research program.<br />It begins with the idea of natural selection(NS) as the core concept of a research tradition that is to be judged on its explanatory power, fruitfulness, and dynamics. The secondary big issue is common descent, which doesnt play nearly as big a role as NS. Its history is to be understood in the scientific context of the day, and the changes that occur over the 150 years between us and Darwin. In particular what was the model science of Newtonian physics and its philosophic principles, to be emulated in EB, that was Darwin's big contribution, he built a system that was seen by the various factions in biology as a biology in the manner of Newton.<br />From there the authors take off running. A very complex but terribly interesting story emerges from Darwin's education, his family, his Voyage of the Beagle, his social and cultural milieu. Not in general hand-waving platitudes but in detailed, closely watched, carefully argued specifics. Something like the division of labor in Adam Smith and the relationship of it to adaptions of creatures into biological niches in the midst of a general construction of adaption and transformation takes 4 pages.With a whole chapter 5 &quot;The newton of a blade of grass: darwin and the political economists&quot;, my initial reason for picking up the book.<br />The three parts represent a watershed change(paradigm revolution?) in the way math fed into physics and then into EB. Newton and calculus for part 1, Boltzmann, and statistics for part 2, and chaos theory/non linear dynamics for part 3. (deterministic, probabilistic, chaotic)<br />The nicest thing about the book is to see the effect of the world on EB theory. Not just things like the analogy of capitalist competition compared to biological competition. But things like fruit flies to Russia, then Russia becoming a huge outdoors genetics lab contributor tothe world and sending people back to the US to carry on the insights and feed them back into biology theory. Just neat stuff, insightful, a human story of science that you don't often get from a textbook.<br />So get the book. just leave a week to read it....worth every minute. i ended up wishing i had diagrammed the book, or was a fraction as smart or as clever as these authors.world and sending people back to the US to carry on the insights and feed them back into biology theory.

US	53032953	R32C0ZHRBEK4XX	0226293742	823183999	Charles Darwin and the Problem of Creation	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Darwin as a thinking man relates to his world	The book's purpose is straightforward: using Foucault's epistemes and Kuhn's paradigms as organizing principles(chp 1) look at the life of Charles Darwin as an example of a man between worlds: the old episteme of creationism and the new biological paradigm of positivism. Asking himself the question &quot;why does C.Darwin spend so much time and effort rebuttalling the various arguments that the creationists present&quot; rather than a strict presentation of his views, the author walks through the intellectual life of Darwin as the first modern biologist who left one toe in the old theological-saturated world, that of a general theist.<br />From pg 3 &quot;The positivist limited scientific knowledge, which he saw as the only valid form of knowledge, to the laws of nature and to processes involving &quot;secondary&quot;, or natural, causes exclusively. The creationist, on the other hand, saw the world and everything in it as being the result of direct or indirect divine activity. His science was inseparable from his theology. His epistemology was closely geared to a metaphysics, and in metaphysics he tended to be an &quot;idealist&quot;. To comprehend nature fully, for a scientist of this persuasion, was to understand the workings of the mind of the Creator.&quot;<br />I liked the way he organizes around the epistemes/paradigms, in doing so he often presents the humanity of the scientists involved in the discussion, this makes the ideas so much more real as you realize that although the people are long dead, they are human in the conflicts and heart-break they went through to arrive at their beliefs, to write their books. Darwin especially comes across in the book as a human being, sympathetic but driven by the tenor of his times as much as he added to the pressure to switch epistemes with his thought. The consistent technique presented in the book revolved around his relationships with individuals whether through letters or reactions to books and the way his ideas and theirs fought, twisted together, or passed into oblivion depending upon the greater movement of ideological systems which emerged in the mid 19thC.<br />The big take home message of the book is simple enough. It was Darwin's desire to free science from the miracles that by necessity are attached to creationism. Underneath this is the idea that miracles are violations of natural law and as such elements of the capricious, the mysterious, the unpredictable that he wished to ban from science, if not as impossible then at least as unscientifically explainable. A second major theme, the topic of several chapters is the relationship of design and purpose as underlying the old creationist episteme and the consistent attempt by Darwin to eliminate this type of thinking all together from biological explanations.<br />Gillespie, as a historian, presents the ideas with an eye to the underlying forces that move people to certain ideas, this is akin to the &quot;ideas were in the air&quot; but more detailed. One push to change epistemes emerges in chpt 3 &quot;Darwin and positive science&quot; where he writes &quot;the new was asking question that the old could neither frame nor answer.&quot; pg 53 This is the effect on systematic thinking of the new data, the facts that flowed into Europe with the great voyages of discovery, Darwin's on the Beagle included. To much of the old thinking stopped with the &quot;God did it&quot; type of explanation, the utility of the new episteme was obvious in that it allowed, even drove deeper levels of explanation. It is these levels, this complex unification of disparagent facts where big important patterns emerge, where the new paradigm shines, it works to build laws and theories that have great explanatory and utilitarian power.<br />On the question of design, &quot;But in giving up Paley's simple and direct empiricism for an idealism which substituted an intuitively perceived plan behind the adaptations for the adaptations themselves, thedesign argument was, to the positivist, on less relevant ground scientifically. It had, by abandoning the empirical world, removed itself from the area of science and entered that of religion. When, eventually, belief in design became an act of faith in an incomprehensible divine wisdom and its ends, the idea of design, ceased to have any potential value as a scientific explanation: its assertions were unverifiable and hence useless.&quot; pg 85 The argument in biology was how to eliminate the purpose that came so naturally to discussions of living things, for it is obvious that living things move and act with a purpose, from Aristotle on in western thought, biology was literally saturated with this purposefulness. Darwin's proposed mechanism of random variation-natural selection(becomes RM-NS in 20thC) was the first fully mechanistic technique proposed to chop off the link between organisms and their adaptation to local environments as a result of God's intervention. Once this link was severed there was nothing to stop the emergence of a fully positivist mechanistic biology to replace the Aristotle-biblical amalgamate that held sway in Western thought.<br />I appreciated this book, a great deal of detail about how principles interact, how epistemes collide, how people work out ambiguities and intellectual paradoxes is included, especially using Darwin as an example. Access to historical information as in the details of letters passing between him and numerous thinkers with substantially different intellectual priorities, and how these conversations modified beliefs and moved people to think differently is excellent. We miss all this human touch when we read history textbooks were names never seem to be real people, this is perhaps the best personal satisfaction from this book.design argument was, to the positivist, on less relevant ground scientifically.

Expertly woven into this discussion is a good understanding of evolutionary processes, a nice description of how science really works and why, along with enough human interest that it captivates the reader's interest and rightfully garnered the book a pulitzer prize. It's structure is primarily chronological as we are introduced to the Grant's now 20 years plus research project, the people who did it and the science underlying the effort. Other research is introduced as necessary to make or expand the point, so you learn a little about guppies, Darwin's particular studies,  Hawaiian fruit flies, sticklebacks in BC; but mostly the details are taken from, are about the 13 species of Darwin's finches, what they eat, and the last 20 years of weather on these islands described as Nature's own biological laboratory: unique, simple enough to study, yet persuasive in the theories formed by people enchanted by their biological diversity stemming from just a few individuals lucky enough to cross the Pacific from South America.<br />The take home message is simple enough. Through 20 generations of finches, data has been carefully collected concerning the beaks, the food, the offspring, the blood and from this mass of data has emerged the proof that populations evolve in response to their environment; that is, natural selection(NS) is seen, not just in the propositions concerning fossils, but in the time frame of a PhD thesis, evolution happens. Like an often heard mantra, the phrase, &quot;speciation has never been seen to occur&quot; emerges from the writings of the Young Earth Creationists(YEC). This book is a direct reply to this idea, look and listen the author (and the Grants) seem to say to their most vocal opponents, evolution and NS happen all around us, it is just too complex to be clearly proven outside of the unique environment of the Galapagos.<br />If you have any interest in the topic of creation-evolution-design this ought to be one of the first 10 books on your to-be-read list.<br />thanks for reading this short review.<br />richard williamsthe phrase, &quot;speciation has never been seen to occur&quot; emerges from the writings of the Young Earth Creationists(YEC).

US	53032953	R1V4RHUUCTZFS1	0521590760	540976895	Religious Inventions: Four Essays	Books	5	3	3	N	N	systematic and interesting application of ideas	A short, smallish book, introduction, &quot;the diversity of revelations&quot;, &quot;the invention of Australian Aboriginal religions&quot;, &quot;Universal and local elements in religion&quot;, &quot;the making of a Christian ethics&quot;, and a conclusion. I had no problems with the structure as essays, they refer to each other, support each other's contentions and generally fit together just fine as a complete book. The author is a fine writer, interesting and logically thinking, i appreciated his writing and would recommend this book to anyone to who the ideas appeal. He is eminently quotable, something i will be glad to do in this essay.<br />pg 5<br />&quot;Of course, philosophical sceptics of various persuasions have argued that religions are 'mad-made' fantasies and, in this sense, are totally invented. On metaphysical grounds, the story goes, there really cannot be any supra-natural realm of reality and expericence, and religion is therefore an illusion. The world of empirical facts is the only reality there is, and scientific knowledge of those facts is the only valid form of human knowledge, and all claims that religion provides a supra-scientific mode of knowledge are mere obscurantism and superstition. We invent or make up or construct religions for our own purposes: to provide meaning and hope in a meaningless and indifferent universe ('a heart in a heartless world'), to cope with personal and social alienation and the prospect of death, to explain natural phenomena(such as chance events) that resist scientific explanation, and so on.<br />...<br />This story is a familiar one and, of course, still a powerful 'myth' in our coluture. But the kind of ideological secularism which is its source and which has held sway in western cultures since the eighteenth century, is showing signs of decay and exhaustion and has certainly lost a good deal of its force. Of course, scientism of various kinds (the philosophical theory that scientiffic knowledge is the sole valid form of knowledge) remains a potent influence. In particular, evolutionary biology has been pressed into service to produce a new scientistic 'worldview' which excludes any religious dimension.&quot;<br />from pg 10 comes the theme of the book<br />&quot;Religion then is, so to speak, what comes about when a disclosure or revelation of the 'divine'-- or whatever we may call it-- is gratuitously mode to human beings and human beings receive that revelation and actively respond to it in the same gratuitous spirit.&quot; It is this gratuitous reception of God's revelation by human beings where they make this revelation theirs, where they absorb and manipulate it, phrasing it in human terms, and passing it onto to their intellectual descendents in this faith, that is the constant reinterated theme of the book.<br />The first chapter is on the problem that the diversity of religious pose for people. Not just the common western notion of the denominations and subtypes of Christianity but the larger issue of all religious and how this diversity is to be approached by the thinking religious person. He handles this tricky problem very systematically, looking at the spectrum of the potential answers: absolutism/exclusion, syncretism/relativism these two at the edges of the lineup. His solution is on pg 38. &quot;The third position argues that, while Christianity is the paradigmatic religious and spiritual 'way', other spiritual ways also have their own value and cannot simply be rejected as false or as forms of superstition and idolatry.&quot; The rest of chapter 1 is to show the ways different religious traditions can fruitfully be in contact with each other, helping the implicit become explicit as the intersection between them activates new thinking within each community, a neat idea.<br />The second chapter starts with the way western anthropology looked at the Australian Aboriginal people over a period of nearly 200 years. The evolution of the viewpoint shows that&quot;western anthropological observations of non-western cultures are to some extent 'constructed', or 'invented', or are 'artefacts' of the anthropological method itself&quot;. He goes on to make the important observation that our common understanding of the Aboriginal culture is a 'gentleman's agreement' between the observer and the observed as to what is seen and the meaning of the observations. Akin to the modern quantum physics notion that the observer modifies the experiment, he points out that the history of anthropology modified the people watching as well as the people been watched. The details of Aboriginal religion and culture he presents are fascinating and i ordered 3 more books just from the footnotes, but the take home message of the chapter is: &quot;Australian Aboriginal religion is profoundly immanentist in that the primordial spiritual power is IN the cosmos-- in the land, in animate creatures and in human beings.&quot; This chapter itself is worth the time and worth to obtain the book.<br />The next two chapters are applications of his method and major ideas in the fields of Roman Catholic doctrine using first local versus universalist themes and second the field of ethics. Systematic and interesting are the best ways to summarize his writing.<br />thanks for reading this review<br />richard williams;western anthropological observations of non-western cultures are to some extent 'constructed', or 'invented', or are 'artefacts' of the anthropological method itself&quot;.

The author's specific interest in the field is experimental research into fear circuits in the brain, and the book shows this interest well and it forms the bulk of the examples. It is not the first book in the field that i would recommend to someone just getting interested, it is an &quot;advanced intro&quot; if that is possible, just a little hard going if you have no idea of the terminology or general structures. But it is written to the educated laymen, doesn't require a college degree to understand it, and is a welcome addition to my expanding library on the philosophy of the mind.<br />The book is well written, flows nicely until the near end,(drags a little just after chapter 6 however, that is why a 4 not a 5 rating) i'd recommend &quot;synaptic sickness&quot; be moved to an appendix if it couldn't be integrated into the body of the book better. The scholarly apparatus is kept to a minimum yet the push to ratify/justify the new knowledge via experimental data and reference to other scientists work is clearly evident and makes the book a good intro to the field, as further study is facilitated. I found the use of concrete experimental examples and the prolific use of diagrams (especially figures 6.4 - 6.6) particularly good(very superior), the book was always engrossing and a stimulating read, not common in books written by scientists who are not teachers as well.<br />As to particularly important ideas: i would point to chapter 6= &quot;small change&quot; and the systematic analysis of Hebbian plasticity and how long-term potentiation supplies the synaptic justification for memory and learning the key chapter in the whole book. The chapters before are introductory prologue to this idea, and the chapters subsequent are particular examples of how Hebbian plasticity and synaptic change unlie the circuits of the brain and hence become who we are.<br />And unusual emphasis(compared to the field as a whole) is on the emotional side of the triad: cognition, emotion, motivation, this is due to the author's interest and last book as a result of his professional research into fear circuitry. I appreciate the emphasis as a long overdue correction to neurology being somewhat, like philosophy of the mind, concentrated on the cognition part of the equation. With this emphasis and direction much of the book dedicated to showing fear circuits and like analysis means this ends up with teaching you a wider view of the brain than most introductory books. A good thing.<br />So i wholehearted recommend the book to anyone who had the patience and interest to finish reading this review. thanks./>And unusual emphasis(compared to the field as a whole) is on the emotional side of the triad: cognition, emotion, motivation, this is due to the author's interest and last book as a result of his professional research into fear circuitry.

What makes it a significant contribution to the creation-evolution-design(CED) debate is first, its polemical character and second, its very well done organization. It is a polemic, philosophic critic of Intelligent Design(ID) with Young Earth Creationism(YEC) always in the background as a secondary target. It is very philosophic, not particularly scientific except as examples, the author is a philosopher of science and a professor. This teaching background shows in the examples and in the quality of the structure. He is writing to be understood by the general audience, he is desirous of convincing people by the strength and coherence of his arguments. He is a subscriber to the KISS principle, that is keep it simple stupid, as simple as necessary to get the point across but not simpler. He also is a textbook example of good transition between chapters and major ideas, with the idea of: tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them----evident and greatly adds to the discussion and the memorability of the ideas. One quality that i did not appreciate which will detract from the ability to recommend this book to its natural audience---college students from fundamentalist church backgrounds where the 7 day YEC principle is taught as an element of the gospel--is a mild almost nastiness underneath part of the book. I believe it is debate fatigue, from several university examples(adam's rib) he displays the problem that a teacher must have after hearing the same old not-correct rebuttalled arguments coming from each new introductory class. But to allow it to show is bad teaching technique and only will turn off his audience.<br />It is not the first book i would recommend to a person with a desire to enter into the CED debate. It is not a general introduction, it is specific to a straightforward analysis of why ID is not science. As far as i can see he hits all the big issues that i am aware of, and he introduced me to several i was not aware of, and added new spin to several i had thought about. The are several very interesting analogies that he follows throughout the text that are worth mentioning. The first is a little jab at the YEC, in fact it comes from a cartoon, that is the image of the tower of creationism. First with the battles within its walls, and second with the evolution of the principles taught by those on the ramparts of it. The second is the use of the tower of babel as a window into the YEC mindset and hermeneutic, this being a less talked about piece of theology than either Genesis 1-2 (creation) or even the Noachic flood. This culminates in chapter 3, but is rather disappointing in some ways, i think if he was a linguist or even a philosopher of language he could have taken the example to a much more important and persuasive point. For instance, show how pidgin into creole demonstrates a universal grammar, and at the same time this example is counter to the structure of evolutionary thinking in terms of nested hierarchies. I'm surprised he didn't push the example of the tower of babel more in either the theological, philosophic, or scientific directions. (for amazon review readers see the review below entitled \\"quite a mix\\" by a linguist for more detail on why the linguistic model was lacking substance)<br />From the top most level the book is a scientists defense of several very important elements in the philosophy of science that the author deems absolutely essential for modern science, and proposes that YEC and its descendent ID directly attack these principles.<br />The first and biggest fight is over theistic science and its epistemological attack on methodological naturalism. He goes back to this issue time and again throughout the book, it is his take home message. In this way the structure of the book is much like a suburbanstreet, straight with just driveways off of it, you can always see where you are going, the side discussions are short and he gets back to the point quickly. This is a good thing in such a complex discussion where the general not specialized audience is in mind.<br />The second big point is that YEC and ID are not really about science, they are about morality. Specificially about the slippery slope to unbelief and societal problems. A related issue is the polarization and dichomotomization of the discussion into us and them, YEC and atheistic materialist evolutionary science. He discusses pieces at a time of these problems, done i think in a sympathic way with an eye towards convincing people not alienating them further from science and its underlying philosophy.<br />It is a good contribution to the literature, it achieves it's goals and demonstrates a teacher's heart, desiring that people think about the issues and maybe even by persuaded to believe as he does. I would read P. Johnson's _wedge of truth_ before this however, as the book really is a direct discussion with Johnson over his particular views on ID. You might loose some of the finer points if you are not acquainted with ID at all. Even if you are an old hand in the CED debate, you can find value in the book, not just for the organization but several of the extended examples (Raelians, SETI) are very thoughtfully done and bring up several angles on old issues that i have not seen elsewhere. So i hope this review encourages you to pick up the book, if you just want to skim the book, i would start with chapter 4 \\"of naturalism and negativity\\", where he is his best at philosophic discussions, and chapter 6 \\"deus ex machina\\" where his criticism of theistic science and defense of methodological naturalism reach a peak.et, straight with just driveways off of it, you can always see where you are going, the side discussions are short and he gets back to the point quickly.

US	53032953	R3D4LS9UO9VSLN	0684845091	798457954	Nature's Destiny: How the Laws of Biology Reveal Purpose in the Universe	Books	3	13	23	N	N	attempt to reintroduce purpose-teleology back into biology	It's an odd book, not at all what i expected. I only finished it the 3rd time i tried, after putting it to the bottom of the TBR pile as a waste of reading time. The reason i bought it was that recommendations had it being an important contribution to the Creation-Evolution-Design debate, being an account of purposefulness in the universe encoded in the very physical and biological laws of natural science. The first part, on physical constants(or constraints) and how little they can vary and still have a human being friendly universe, was tedious and boring. The reason i found it so was my expectations clashed with the books reality, i thought it was polemical, fast moving, directed at enemies near and far, in general combative. It's not, it is working through the details, especially the first half. So the reason i finished it is not the same reason as i bought it.<br />Secondly, it is a misused, misconstrued, misread book in the CEd debate. It is a testimony to the strength of the young earth creationists and their desire to completely polarize the conversation that this book is recommended as ID or even worse as creationist. Simply NOT TRUE, the author is a non-darwinian materialist evolutionist with several pages in the preface directed at this confusion. It is almost like the YEC believe the enemy of my enemies is my friend. Just like they jumped at punctuated evolution as a 'proof' of their thinking, they are jumping at this book.<br />This out of the way, what is the book about?<br />The first part, roughly half the book, is an extended, detailed account of physical things and how important their exact characteristics are to the presence of life on earth. This is really introduction to the second half, which are the particular characteristics of biological life are generative of the forms of life we see around us. Essentially the book is an argument against S.J.Gould's statement that if you replayed the video tape of life on earth it would be substantially different than it is because the driving forces are undirectional particularly the spontaneity of mutation.<br />To this argument the 12th chapter, &quot;the tree of life&quot; is, imho, the key point of the book. It is certainly possible to read it by itself and i would recommend this to anyone, the central themes of the chapter are not dependent upon the earlier material. The following chapters are the details of some pieces of the puzzle started in chapter 12, fleshed out, made into sections in their own right.<br />So i've reduced a 400+ page book to a careful reading of one chapter. So what is the point of &quot;the tree of life&quot;?<br />Taking the very old image of the tree of life, setting next to it the modern genetic idea of the investigation of DNA sequence space through time via evolution by creatures existing in morphological or phenotypic space. It is his idea that evolution 'fills', 'investigates', or 'explores' the tree of life in a directed, purposeful way. The chapter is a speculative look at the potential forces that could constraint, prune, force into channels this evolutionary force to literally build a tree where the main branches, the truck, maybe even the twigs, certainly the general form was implicit before hand in those laws and constraints. This looks very much like the Neoplatonic idea of forms updated to the world of PCR and Human Genomic Project.<br />It's speculative, often i wrote-argument from ignorance*- in the margin, as if he believed 'A' rather than 'B' because there was no 'C' on the horizon, and 'A' looked better than 'B'. The only example i really appreciated was the idea that Australia with it's extraordinary marsupial convergence towards placential animals elsewhere in the world, shows that Gould's tape has run a second time in the history of this world and produced much the same creatures, at least morphologically.<br />It's an interesting book, i would, if i could do the time over again, read chapter 12 to the end, then just skim the 1st half skipping the mass of uninteresting detail. It IS an important contribution to the CED debate but i am afraid from what i see written about it that people are not really reading it before they recommend it. One problem is that it will be attacked from both major sides in the debate. From the naturalistic darwinian evolutionists because not-teleology not-designed is a crucial element of their high level metaphysics and from the creationist side who can not conceive of a design without a designer or purpose without consciousness. The second problem is that it is not polemical, not convincing because it is so speculative and daring, more a putting out of new ideas to see how they fly then a fully mature consistent position.<br />*actually argument from personal incredulity....im the 1st half skipping the mass of uninteresting detail.

It's science, it's philosophy. The word pathfinder, speculative, thoughtful, leading-edge come to mind. The flipside of the book is lack of detail, lack of explicit substance and explanation. He defines new words, gives a hint about what he is thinking, then moves on in a few paragraphs, which leaves the reader gasping for breath and more. Yet you understand that here is a deep thinker, a considerable intellect that has something important to say, something i am interested in, yet it is hard to follow and even harder to grasp. Mostly due to lack of detail, lack of specificity, lack of metaphors and things that would lead the reader in a ever-tightening spiral around the ideas, to eventually get to the point that the writer has reached. Don't get my feeling of missing something put you off, the book is worth the reading.<br />But again what is it about?<br />He introduces several specific, but odd terms. The biggie is semiotics and a series of derivatives. All built on a triad of: primary sign, the object, the interpretant (pg20ff) to which he credits the philosopher Charles S. Pierce. The example he uses is that the fertilized egg takes DNA and uses it to create the &quot;ontogenetic trajectory&quot;; as he puts it, the machinery of the egg takes DNA and decipers or interprets it to form the being, the embryo. From here he builds a concept of a semiosphere which is the sum total of all the signs and the significance they represent for living things and their environment. One extended example from biochemistry is very good, and illustrates the value of his ideas, chapter 6 and the discussion of receptors on cell surfaces. He could easily write a whole book with this chapter as a guide, and signal theory and signal transduction and the main theme, as handled by his semiotic triads. But unfortunately he doesn't and leaves the reader, at least me, asking for more detail and specificity.<br />The second term he introduces is umwelt which he credits to Jakob von Uexhull, which he defends as ecological niche as the organism itself apprehends it. pg54 The two terms kindof dance through the book, covering especially the topic of the evolution of human beings with attention to human self-awareness and/or consciousness until he reaches the topic of ecology. This is his planned destination for the book, it becomes apparent that his major concern is to allow the reader to review his travels in the field and understand that the semiosphere is a way to introduce morality and responsibility into human affairs and our relationship with the biosphere and the creatures that inhabit it. This is neat, for it is historically his intellectual journey, from the first glimmer in Pierce's triad to the things that push the evolution of human beings, to the full blown human responsibility to living things. That is why the book seems so sketchy, so bare of detail and examples. He desires us to follow his adventure but not distracted by the particulars but in a position to see the big picture that the semiotic viewpoint can yield.<br />But all the while there are literally dozens of places where he starts topics that would make for another book in themselves. For example, he shows that DNA is digital, organisms are analogy, he calls this code duality and it is the topic of chapter 4. Another place i screamed for more detail was near the end of chapter 6 where he is talking about neuropeptides and the way the immunological system interacts with the nervous system, amazing and thought-provoking stuff, the basis for another really good book, i think.<br />Its a good book, buy it and get out your yellow highlighter, because you will need to review this book several more times before it really sinks in.unately he doesn't and leaves the reader, at least me, asking for more detail and specificity.<br />The second term he introduces is umwelt which he credits to Jakob von Uexhull, which he defends as ecological niche as the organism itself apprehends it. pg54 The two terms kindof dance through the book, covering especially the topic of the evolution of human beings with attention to human self-awareness and/or consciousness until he reaches the topic of ecology.

I have a hard time pointing out exactly what it is that makes this such a good book: partly he is an extraordinarily interesting writer, partly the book is chock full of absolute gems, i highlighted something on nearly every page. Partly the attentiveness to what lies underneath the surface, what isn't obvious about the topic in his hands becomes insight, the ah-ha experience that has you saying &quot;why didn't i see that before?&quot; But mostly, he is an addictive writer, drawing you into his comprehensive research, sharing his love of the ideas he presents, pulling you into his intellectual world more like a good novelist than the historian he is.<br />He spells out the topic on the first page of the preface:<br />&quot;What follows are six essays. They involve large, often cosmic issues. They involve a challengeable assumption--that the most foundational beliefs of Americans, almost all of which derive from the Judeo-Christian tradition, faced such an array of intellectual challenges in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as to amount to a major crisis of faith. This crisis first climaxed in the mid-1920's, but the issues have remained at the very center of cultural conflict. The crisis involved the credentials of age-old beliefs in the existence of a god, in a world that exhibits some extrinsic or intrinsic purpose, in the divine origin and special destiny of humans, and in moral values that have some transhuman sanction.&quot;<br />One feature of the book that is admirable is the accuracy he presents the beliefs of people he disagrees with. For instance, his portrait of J.Gresham Machen is one of the best i've ever read, even though the author is not a discipline of Machen's tradition. This desire to be a good responsible historian makes the book at places where a lesser author would distort the record. You instinctive trust the history presented because you know the places he could have fudged, he didn't/<br />One of his big conclusions, is i believe, the BIG issue in the current Creation-Evolution-Design debate. In his own words, pg 141--&quot;For many, the important issue was not which one of several competing gods fit reality, but whether a belief in either a supernatural or an immmanent god any longer made sense. Could anyone, in a post-Darwinian world, justify such a belief? Theism was now at stake. And those who felt themselves most attuned to the full implications of a Darwinian understanding of nature joined Darwin himself in rejecting any transcendent god (any god outside or beyond nature) and any purposeful divine mind or force within nature (and thus any cosmic teleology).&quot;<br />I deeply appreciated the book, it interested me enough in the short sketches of several thinkers that i will pursue studies of them. While at the same time it put several pieces into place for me because of the unique and systematic way the author built his case. I hope you find it as fruitful an afternoon with the book as did i.<br />thanks for reading this short review.you know the places he could have fudged, he didn't/<br />One of his big conclusions, is i believe, the BIG issue in the current Creation-Evolution-Design debate.

US	53032953	R1V9ICNH4PJVT7	0520226151	489179746	What it Means to be 98% Chimpanzee: Apes, People, and their Genes	Books	4	8	11	N	N	human nature, demarcation problem and culture meet genes	First a couple of structural observations before i look at the content.<br />It has the organization and transitional structure between chapters of independent essays written for other venues and later shaped into a book. I do not know this for a fact, but the absence of a strong theme which ties the chapters together into a coherent structured book is a hint at it's origin. This lack of coherency as a whole is the main reason i rated it a 4 and not a 5.<br />Second, i bought the book based on reviews and word of mouth recommendations that were wrong about the themes of the book. I thought it was going to be about what makes chimps and humans different. What it is, is an introduction to anthropologic genetics, behavioral genetics, simply the relationship of genetics to human nature. What i thought was the topic of the book is in fact the issue of chapter 11, titled &quot;is blood so really damn thick?&quot;. However it is opposed to sociobiology(evolutionary psychology) in a very consistent manner , so don't confuse the two.<br />In fact, i was mildly disappointed at this organization and what i thought was a misleading advertising, so much so that i put down the book in chapter 4 and it sank to the bottom of the to-be-read pile for several weeks. This was in addition to what seemed like an eternity spent talking about race. Sadly so because the 6th chapter &quot;folk heredity&quot; is very good on explaining several interesting and illuminating genetic principles:taxonomism, racism, hereditarianism, essentialism(i would have started with chapter 6 if i had known). Simply put i gave up too quickly, don't you make the same mistake. Likewise, since the chapters are not sequential in any particular learning curve way, you can jump and skip around in a manner usually reserved for not-technical non-scientific works, pick and choose what interests you, i expect that you will finish the book as i did, interested and stimulated in my thinking about these important issues.<br />So after this, what is the common threads that bring the author to create this book? One, is the demarcation problem in science(the author does not however use this philosophic term), that is the question of what is science versus what is not science and two what separates good science from poor. In the author's own words: &quot;We now recognize the need to define the boundaries of science in order to distinguish the authoritative voice of scientists speaking as scientists from the voice of scientists speaking as citizens.&quot;pg 94 He uses the term folk heredity, folk science, folk beliefs consistently to separate the science from the common sense general understanding of people. Using folk heredity as others would the term pseudoscience or unscientific common sense.<br />Along with the demarcation problem he is primarily concerned with the effects of science, with the humanistic concerns for people and how that is subverted or ignored by people claiming to be doing science. This is the topic of chapter 9 &quot;a human gene museum?&quot; where he tackles several sacred cows in science related to the human genome project and in chapter 10 &quot;identity and descent&quot; he tackles kennewick man and the controversy there. This principle is simply that science has as it's ultimate goal the betterment of human lives, and if the means to get there, the technics of science begin to subvert these humanistic goals then scientists better reexamine what they are doing and/or how they are doing it.<br />The third theme that binds the essays together is the relationship of the anthropology to the genetics in the science of anthropological genetics. To this end several of the beginning chapters, culminating with chapter 6 &quot;folk heredity&quot;(which i feel is the best chapter in the book) deal with the issue of race and genetics. The take home message is pretty simple, race is a cultural abstraction, a societal construction that has no basis in genetics. The variability of characteristics is larger within then it is between these racial groupings. but it takes several chapters to convince the reader that this long held, cherished view of human diversity is in fact not genetic but cultural, not nature but nuture.<br />Something else that solidifies and holds together the book is the author's passion for science. He protects it when it is under unjustified attack from outside, or being subverted from the inside and criticizes it when it doesn't live up to the high ideals that it proposes. this coupled with the interesting way he writes is reason enough to get the book and read a few of the chapters.

He protects it when it is under unjustified attack from outside, or being subverted from the inside and criticizes it when it doesn't live up to the high ideals that it proposes. this coupled with the interesting way he writes is reason enough to get the book and read a few of the chapters.

Keck from Washington, DC his review is chapter by chapter and sets the stage for my ideas about this book.<br />Second, the author is an atomic physicist who has thought deeply about these issues and for our benefit has organized and explained these ideas in a very sympathetic yet comprehensive way that deserves the widest possible audience. The writing is clear, interesting and of the highest possible caliber. I only wish more scientists wrote this well, not just their works for the laymen but for professional consumption as well, it would make the role of a student far more pleasurable.<br />So what is the book about? What are the big issues that this author wants us to remember and to use in our intellectual life?<br />First is the issue of materialism as a faith. This is chapter 1 and continues to be an explicit organizing principle throughout the book.<br />&quot;The fact of the matter is that there is a bitter intellectual battle going on, and it is about real issues. However, the conflict is not betwen religion and science, it is between religion and materialism. Materialism is a philosophical opinion that is closely connected with science. It grew up alongside of science, and many people have a hard time distingusihing it from science. But it is not science. It is merely a philosophical opinion. And not all scientists share it by any means. In fact, there seem to be more scientists who are religious than who are materialists.&quot; pg 1<br />This is what i term the &quot;like speaks to like issue&quot;. Materialism is the idea that all is matter in motion, sufficent to explain all phenomena in the universe. As he aptly points out this is philosophic opinion, or metaphysics. Christianity competes with a rival faith materialism not with science as technic of reading the book of nature.<br />The second big idea is the human mind. This is the issue that materialism is unable to explain the fact that we are conscious of ourselves as free, thinking, acting beings in a material world where consciousness appears to be limited to ourselves. These are the related topics of part 4, chapters 19-25. I word the issue a little bit differently than does he, i use the term methodological naturalism to explain how science investigates the things of this universe, and further believe that the MN breaks as it encounters the human consciousness. This is what stops MN from being philosophic materialism. It is not a sufficent principle to explain everything we experience. The introduction to chpt 19 contains one of the most concise explanations of the problem of the consciousness of man that i can remember reading. If you only have time to skim this book, read chpt 1 and 19.<br />It is truely an important and timely work, i deeply thank the author for the time, energy, sweat and tears that so evidently went into the writing of this excellent 5 star book. The clarity of thought, the organization and structure do justice to the loftiness and sophistication of the ideas he presents.<br />thanks for reading this review and if you encounter other books in the field of this importance i would be grateful for a quick email so that i can obtain and read them....books like this are gems to be treasured and shared with like minded readers.materialism is unable to explain the fact that we are conscious of ourselves as free, thinking, acting beings in a material world where consciousness appears to be limited to ourselves.

In particular the wars and the people who fight them in this region. the author is a very unusual man, extraordinary in several ways. first his english is journalist, fast paced, honed obviously to write pieces that compete for a newpaper readers attention. Pithy in using one word where another writer would use three. a very visual writer with an imagination and a view to vivid word descriptions that is very good. He would have been as good a novelist as he is a journalist. This really acts to the book and makes the reading a great pleasure.<br />The topic is a timely one, even given the 2000 date on the book, or the research dating back even longer.

This book i rate as one of the 5 most significant books for a conservative reformed Christian who wants to come to reasoned and faithful conclusions in the CED debate. It is conservative which i define to be conscious and considerate of the traditions of the past, to take them seriously, not simply accepting something because it is new. It is Biblical in the way the author is very careful to allow the Scripture's Words to speak for themselves, being very careful not to read into the words his own cherished beliefs, but to allow the Word to speak to him, authoritatively and reliably. To this end he is not infected by the liberal J-P-D documentary interpretation so often evident in exegesis or interpretation.<br />Second, the book is significant on two levels, the first is the exegetical level, the principles of understanding that the author explores in the first few chapters. Second is the line by line study that forms the bulk of the book, roughly chpt 3 on.<br />The structure of the book is that of Gen 1-3 but the way he writes is interesting and worth a moment of reflection here. The chapters are more like consistent essays than the usual exegesis bound to the text. He takes a major theme in the next section of Genesis then expands it to cover this issue through the past interpreters and links to other related Scripture. It roughly follows the systematic organization of reformed covenant theology.<br />pg 26 has what i think is the best analysis of the human writers relationship to Scripture. &quot;That rule follows from the humanity of Holy Scripture. In the act of inspiration God did not turn his sookesmen into robots; his Word became their word, under their signature and their responsiblility. Thus we have no right to go over their heads in order to set forth a 'divine' meaning which they would never possilby have imagined-even if those men did not grasp the whole import of what they attested God in his condescension has limited himself to their instrumentality; our interpretation must conform to the corresponding discipline.&quot;<br />If the church would hend this advice much of the CED debate would be solved, for we would cease to search Genesis for the equivalent of quarks, trying to query the first few chapters of the Bible and mine it for scientific truths. Rather we would, as this author does, submit to the authority of Scripture to speak to the way we do science, to the ideas that we bring to the universe as we question the master workmen's creation that we are a small part of.<br />The book is literary framework in its approach to Gen1-3, M. Kline being the best example of this in the english speaking world. Anyone familiar with the CED issues would be advised to read the first 2 chapters of this book simply to see a careful analysis of exegesis and the result of allowing Scripture to speak for itself rather than being pushed out of shape by young earth creationists whom would interpret the 7 days too literally. Or by scientific reconcilationists would would try to find modern science confirmed in the light appearing before the sun(ie the big bang).<br />The first principle he outlines carefully is to allow Scripture to speak to its first listeners, their culture, their history. His exegetical task doesn't end there but extends to teaching what these things mean to us in our place in space and time. But this application, this preaching follows critical-historical interpretation not prior to it as so many would desire.<br />Thanks to the author for this excellent book and i hope to read more from his pen.men did not grasp the whole import of what they attested God in his condescension has limited himself to their instrumentality; our interpretation must conform to the corresponding discipline.&quot;<br />If the church would hend this advice much of the CED debate would be solved, for we would cease to search Genesis for the equivalent of quarks, trying to query the first few chapters of the Bible and mine it for scientific truths.

US	53032953	R1SNP1FB7BVT9F	1566634210	993616762	A Short History of the World	Books	3	6	12	N	N	not engrossing but interesting enough	This is an odd one volume history book. Usually the best of the genre are compelling reads where the author is polemical, interested in convincing you that his new theory about why history moves in a certain direction is true. This is not such a book. The writing is best described as mediocre, predestrian, trying for variety in word order but failing. Then why did i finish it, i asked myself.<br />First it was an online book discussion group choice. But there was a interest that the author evoked that keep me reading, it was his choice of what to discuss. And for this reason alone it is an acceptable book to read as a small group. These things that he chooses to discuss, the topics of the sections of a few pages, these objects of interest in the overall view of history. These are what make it a readable, 3 star book and not a miss, a skip it, a bland textbook for high schoolers.<br />His choices are governed by 3 streams of thought. The first and most minor is geography. Physical geography plays an important role in history that DECREASES as time goes along. Earlier civilizations and cultures are more dependent on the local area for the resources that they need, likewise the rise of the river bases irrigated civilizations are by necessity and history located there. (idea of irrigation giving rise to empires due to requirement of cooperative effort to build and maintain water works). As the physical geography matters less, technology matters more, this is his second and major stream of ideas. The problem is that his linking and explanation is like a machine gun, stattaco, quick firing, without the big picture that something like _connections_ by burke is so very good at. It is as if he sees technology as the major driving force in world history but presents it as a disunifying force popping up in the world like prairie dogs popping up their heads, rather than making us aware of all the tunnels underground and out of view. This piecemeal, this disunity is noticable and greatly detracts for the overall character of the book.<br />The second stream is religious consciousness, not unrelated to the previous two, but he makes no real effort to unify the 3 ideas in any substantial way. More like he has a high interest level in religious consciousness and introduces it whenever appropriate in the discussion.<br />So i am back to my initial question of why did i finish a less than perfect book? Because it is an acceptable intro to history with enough continuity to be interesting, with an above average choice of what particulars to discuss. So now i am able to engage in the specifics of the discussion in the book club, to see how other people liked his choice of detail to illustrate the broader movement of human history. The only other recommendation would be to a interested sub-high school student who needed an easier text to be introduced to western history.d greatly detracts for the overall character of the book.<br />The second stream is religious consciousness, not unrelated to the previous two, but he makes no real effort to unify the 3 ideas in any substantial way.

From the top of a mountain, with broad brush strokes, showing the major streams and landmarks, the BIG picture. Spenser and Toynbee are such historians, so is this book. The other view is from the trenches, the pieces, the small connections that we find so fascinating and absorbing. I believe that the big picture view of this book is a result of how it came into being as an elaboration of a single constellation of ideas that the author discovered while working on _The Rise of the West_, he found they interesting and continued to build the structure around these ideas in this book.<br />The book is about a collection of related ideas:<br />Parasitism--as he defines two types macro and micro.<br />Micro is the form we are familiar with as disease, the times viruses, bacteria, protozoan begin to use us as their energy and food source, to our consternation. He further defines two flavors: epidemic and endemic. Epidemic is the form in bubonic plague that swept Europe for 500 years at regular intervals. endemic is the idea of a parasitic form like the liver flukes that effect irrigated agriculture the world over, or like the civilized childhood diseases that effect the body politic like measles, mumps, smallpox.<br />Macroparasitism is this author's contribution to the discussion, unique to him as far as i know. Those other human's that prey on the weaker, less organized, less mobile etc. Epidemic macro are the Mongols(which are the topic of what i think is the best chapter in the book) or those horseman like in the movie the &quot;Seventh Samari&quot; who sweep out of the steppes or mountains to seize the harvest. Endemic macro are the priests, kings, emperors, tax farmers, etc who take the hard earned food from the producers without adequate recompense.<br />Using these ideas he ventures to paint those broad strokes, those vistas in history to show how the major currents, the big pieces fit. To this end the book is very well done, always absorbing, always enough detail to support but not to overwhelm the reader. Yet pithy and curiosity arousing enough to drive you to look into his sources, the real mark of good history.<br />I was pleased enough to get _Rise of the West_ and will start it next.<br />thanks for reading the review, i hope you get as much out of the book as did i.<br />richard williamsdone, always absorbing, always enough detail to support but not to overwhelm the reader.

For this purpose it is excellent. for it doesn't require a degree in engineering or architecture to understand, is a short and straightforward narrative where the author avoids the problems associated with trying to tell to large a tale in too small a space.<br />It is a quick biography of the man responsible for the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence. There were several fact filled sentences i read to my wife but other than these few it was a quick breeze, painless read to acquire a simple knowledge of the times and tribulations involved in building what is still the large masonary dome in the world(according to the book).<br />I would have appreciated more diagrams of the dome as the text describes it. More sketches of the equipment and physical maps as the character travels. The word pictures at these points are not sufficent to fully disclose to the Italian-free unknowledgable among the readers what he is talking about.<br />A mildly interesting book although if i didn't already have an interest in architecture i don't believe it would have particularly stimulated one.<br />So overall a C+ book, but a rather good choice for a book group for dynamics of the group, not for the material.<br />thanks for reading this review<br />richard williams	2003-06-25

I have always been overweight and don't really know how to exercise and get fit. This is a good book, well written but it is not the kind of book i need right now.<br />It is scientific in tone and attitude, full of good facts and the kind of knowledge that is testable in a college classroom. Weak on motivation and push to get and keep going. The first half is a introduction to exercise physiology, with the chapter on the brain(6) especially well done. The second half is a introduction to several different outdoors sports to open up vistas to the already fit---skiing, swimming, running, walking, rowing. And that is the problem for me with the book, it is preaching to the choir, those who are already fit. Who exercised through their 40's rather than reading and playing with the computer as did i. So if you are in the targetted audience this is a very good book, but if not it is just ok....<br />Motivation, push, desire. These are the things needed by novice walkers, not provided by the book. It assumes you are already on the positive feedback curve where you feel better because you are fit and now need a variety of things to do with your body. Assuming this type of person the book is a very good buy as it will give you a few new facts and lots of choices to investigate.<br />So it is not directed to me, or the rest of us need to get fit bfore the fat kills us....But rather to the rest of you who approach 50 worrying that the best years are behind you. This is a good place for you to start.	2003-05-23

Books	3	6	6	N	N	collection of essays from symposium on ID	_Darwinism: Science or Philosophy?_<br />This is a collection of 25 essays in 13 questions with a thesis-rebuttal type of structure. The symposium that gave rise to the book had as a theme:<br />Darwinism and neo-darwinism as generally held and taught in our society carry with them an a priori commitment to metaphysical naturalism, which is essential to make a convincing case on their behalf.&quot;<br />quoted on pg 177<br />I classify the book as Intelligent Design (ID) despite the fact that about 1/2 the essays are rebuttals to the position, not it's support. The book is better than average in the quality of the writing and the authors presented. It is however specific enough that it is not a general work on the creation-evolution-design (CED) debate but rather an interesting contribution to a small facet of the field. That being said i sought out the book because it's topic sentence is my current interest in a self-directed study of the CED field. I was glad to have found 2 lines of thought in the book, those i would like to concentrate on now.<br />The first is the essay, &quot;Radical Intersubjectivity: Why Naturalism is an assumption necessary for doing Science&quot; by Frederick Grinnell, section *. It is simply a very concise introduction to the public nature of science and &quot;Only naturalistic explanations can become part of science because of the way in which scientific discoveries become credible.&quot; pg 100. And &quot;Individual scientists make discoveries; scientific communities make discoveries credible. That is, credibility is embedded in the social structure of science.&quot; I have struggled in vain for several weeks trying to reach this idea and i am indebted for the simple and persuasive way the he makes it. To be persuaded, to be convinced, to yield author to, these are all ideas the circulate within an ideology, any social organization. Some like governments, military or perhaps in families yield simply &quot;i told you so, therefore do it!&quot;. Others especially voluntary organizations which rely on the consent of the members are much more subtile in their demands so not to estrange potential converts. But science is as an institution, extraordinarily multi-cultural and multi-national. As such the recruitment and education of potential members is extremely important, just look at the complex of universities, research institutions both governmental and private which encircle our globe. An institution and an ideology like science based in large part on a radical skeptism and provisionalness that disturbs many people has developed an extraordinary way of accepting and confirming individual discoveries. In particular, the community makes new ideas credible not just by reproducing and disseminating these new discoveries but by incorporating them into the structure of the communities thinking. The object is to modify and incorporate long standing ideas with the new in a systematic way that will minimize errors getting by the process to become conventional scientific wisdom. Certainly the bar is very high, and stops good, true ideas sometimes, we only have to look at the currents ideas about ulcers and compare them to a medical textbook of 10 years ago to see this point.<br />The second set of essays i found particularly valuable was chapter 11 &quot;X Does not Entail Y: the Rhetorical Uses of Conflating levels of logic&quot; by Arthur M Shapiro. &quot;Here is argument in a nutshell: biological evolution (darwinism, neo-Darwinism) entails no particular position on the ultimate orgins of either life or the universe. Evolution is a subject studied by the methods of science. To conduct scientific investigation per se entails no claim to intellectual hegemony or ontological priority over other potential 'ways of knowing.' The contrary claims, implicit or explicit in the arguments of both theists and atheists, flow from a conflation of evolution with evolutionism or of science with scientism(or postiivism, ormaterialism, or some other ism).

I got the book as a result of reading a recent NYTimes article on sniper action in Iraq and i wanted to know more.<br />Like the famous speech scene in PATTON where he says make the other poor guy die for his country, this book has a central welcome to the sniper school speech, pg. 95ff.<br />\\"Your units selected each of you to become snipers because you are good Marines--men who are well disciplined... courageous...duty-bound...and loyal to your country and your Corps. You have been screened and found to be in top physical condition, mentally sound, and very patient. Each man here has demonstrated to his commander that he has good moral character and a strong sense of values, amony which he holds life sacred.<br />...<br />I know that as grunts, it was easy for you to feel justified in killing the enemy when he attacked you--he was trying to kill you. If you attacked him, he also had a choice to give up or surrender--you did not murder him, because he died trying to kill you. That's self-defences.<br />\\"As a sniper, you do not have that luxury. You will be killing the enemy when he is unaware of your presense. You will be assassinating him without giving him the option to run or fight, surrender or die. You will be, in a sense, committing murder on him--premediatated.\\"<br />I realize what Charles Henderson says about Carlos Hathcock tells me as much or even more about Henderson then it does about Hathcock but i finished the book admiring the both of them. Not seduced by action and adrenaline/testosterone-flow but grungingly respectful of the truely heroic which rises above the masses of men to distinction. Hathcock for his behavior and his committment to fundamental values and Henderson for the excellent writing without glorifying killing or blood lust.<br />It's a good book. Appears to stick to the facts with a minimum of exaggeration, it is thoughtful and underneath it is a desire to present the best in the military tradition of the Marines and the developing tradition of the sniper/scout. I ordered the next book in the series, something i had not intended to do when i bought this one.<br />Thanks for reading this short review. i hope you enjoy the book as much as i did.<br />richard williamsul and underneath it is a desire to present the best in the military tradition of the Marines and the developing tradition of the sniper/scout.

Although i could not read the legends i understood that the purpose of the drum and bell towers throughout China was to keep time in a very public way.<br />Now choosing this particular book was not an accident, i have wanted to get into the massive corpus of Needham's work on China, and this was an opportunity to have a minor need driven learning curve. I was not at all disappointed in the book. It is literally an excellent example of how to do science, how to investigate a historical question, how to marshall facts and prove a difficult point.<br />But the book is not for the faint of heart, or the mildly interested in horology, it is complete, tedious and not a Sunday afternoon light reading. Nor should it be, it is just as the author intended it, a scientific research book on the origin of clock building in China.<br />From the introduction: &quot; It is generally allowed that the invention of the mechanical clock was one of the most important turning-points in the history of science and technology. Not only was it the earliest complex device, heralding a whole age of machine-making, but also its regular imitation of the natural motion of the sun and heavens fascinated men and exerted no small influence on their philosophy and theology.&quot; The key text which is studied throughout is _New Design for a Mechanised Armillary Sphere and Celestial Globe_ written in 1090AD by Su Sung. The clock was built, a high astronomical clock-tower more than thirty feet high, with sky observation points, moving globes and rings that would be analogous to the same object in the movie &quot;Dark Crystal&quot; with the planets in their various orbits whizzing around the sun.<br />&quot;To sum up the matter, it is quite clear that one of the reasons why the early Jesuit missionaries were so much welcomed by the Chinese was for their interest in clocks and clock-making, hardly less indeed than for their skill as mathematicians and astronomers. ... In Ricci's time the Jesuit order was capable of attracting for its overseas mssions some of the best minds of Europe. It was a mobilisation of oecumenical idealism something like that which the League or the United Nations have now and then commanded in our own time.&quot; pg. 145<br />It is the 9th chapter: &quot;General History and Transmission of Astronomical Clocks&quot; that i personally found the most fasinating, where Needham takes the details and builds the connections to general thinking and social structures. &quot;Such devices of scientific technology have exercised not a little influnce on the idea that the universe was a great mathematical machine whose workings could be comprehended by exact reasoning. Since astronomy and graphic representation are two of the most ancient of man's arts, it is no wonder that he should want to hold the cosmos in his hand by making a model of it--&quot; pg 179 &quot;This is no accidental feature of mechanical design, but an inherent part of the format of Chinese astronomical theory.&quot;pg 180 &quot;The question is also linked closely with the different modes of astronomy in the Hellenistic and Chinese cultures. In the West, a series of happy accidents occurred soon after the arithmetically minded Babylonians had communicated their astronomy to the geometrically strongly-developed Hellenic scientists. These accidents of physical fact and mathematical structure had the effect of directing the best period of genius towards the mathematical analysis of planetary motions rather than to any other part of astronomy.&quot; pg 181<br />I understand that the big question for Needham was why did science develop in the West and not China, given the Chinese invention of all the pieces of what we consider the enabling technology. This book is my first study into the Needham body of writing and i look forward to working through the 12 volume set on Chinese science.<br />thanks for reading the review, and i hope it inspires you to at least skim the first chapter and chapter 9.ysis of planetary motions rather than to any other part of astronomy.&quot; pg 181<br />I understand that the big question for Needham was why did science develop in the West and not China, given the Chinese invention of all the pieces of what we consider the enabling technology.

Interestingly this little book enters into that discussion because it states clearly:&lt;i&gt; &quot;To summarize the claims in a nutshell: either science is irrational (in the way it judges theories and predictions probable) or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;<br />To be a priori makes it part of the axioms by which we judge science, these axioms are not part of science, but rather part of the metaphysics prior to and upon which science is built.<br />The best explanation:<br />What are the criteria for supposing one explanation is better than, is more true than another?<br />a posteriori types:<br />1. the one which satisfies the criteria best on the whole.<br />2. hypothesis which best fits our background knowledge.<br />a priori types:<br />1. the greater the content, the more it predicts or tries to explain the more likely it is FALSE.<br />2. and this book's topic: all others things equal, the theory that is simplest is more likely to be true.<br />So i saved you an hour or so, reading and rereading this little book. Glad i did it, simplicity is a key element in scientific theorizing. Plus it builds confidence to actually understand and finish one of his books.<br />thanks for reading this rather short review.	2003-04-25

An interesting example with the Okey sisters who had been successful &quot;in a Pentecostal congregation in a nearby church, where their glossolalic interventions had attracted admiring attention. The career of these two young women neatly illustrates the way in which the symptoms of serious personality disorders can be shaped and then reshaped, depending on the social intitution in which they manifest themselves. In a congregation which recognized and valued the notion of 'speaking in tongues' the sisters modulated their conduct until they were recognizable as Pentecostal prophets, whereas in the wards of the newly converted professor of medicine their repertoire changed under the influence of Elliotson's positive conditioning and they re-emerged as mesmeric shamans.&quot; pg 11<br />&quot;Ladders and Cones&quot; is S.J.Gould's contribution to the evolution discussion as he points out that the common pictures we all have in our minds as a result of their being published repeatedly.

Philosophic, religious with lots of history and science used to illustrate points. Well organized, very well argued, simply a joy to read. Forms, i believe the best introduction to the problems presented by a materialist naturalist science to the issues of the human soul. These issues revolve around what it means to be a person, to have a personality, to be rational, to love, to strive for justice. He takes several of these issues and wraps the arguments for their destruction by scientism in the ideas of particular people.<br />His theme is found near the end, pg 167. \\"For science has a fundamental faith, a faith in the rationality of the world, and in the capacity of human reason to discover the truth about the world by a combination of disciplined attention and thought. ... How can that resolute pursuit of truth, which has marked the natural sciences, have lead to the apparent rejection of purpose in the world, of objective value and of God?\\"<br />He answers the question in several pieces, each one associated with a particular individual who represents the attack from a different discipline and perspective.<br />Nietzsche is first, \\"The Gospel of False Freedom\\". Where Ward has him killing a particular distorted view of God in order to free humanity from bondage to an arbitary Judge and Ruler. This gospel of freedom from God ends up as slavery to passions. It undermines  the importance and dignity of human life by taking away all objective value and purpose from our lives. pg 30 Thus leaving us with nothing more than an empty shell devoid of meaning and significance thus individual purpose and energy for living.<br />Next is Charles Darwin and \\"The Elimination of Purpose from the Universe\\". The denial that our consciousness or moral activity is of a higher value, that it is the result of purposeful evolution towards great complexity. This is tied together with the sense of value, that human life and human thought is valuable. Purpose towards is effectively elimination by finding that evolution has as mechanism only randomness and \\"the drunkard's walk\\".<br />E.O.Wilson and _Sociobiology_ are discussed in the chapter on \\"The Reduction of Morals to Biology\\". It is in morality, where as thinking, acting, human beings we can transcend our animals natures and do something simply because it is rational and right to do so.<br />\\"The Attack on Conscious\\" is the chapter associated with Freud. His desire to bracket consciousness between the strict overlord of the superego and the animal nature of the id, leads modern science to deny the transcendent nature of consciousness. The rational understanding of value with the apprehension of moral claims are denied by this kind of thinking. pg 95 Thus making what ought to be a responsible and reflective self the object of nothing more than base instincts and sexual/power plays.<br />With \\"the Materialist Denial of the Soul\\" Ward takes on Marx and his reduction of ideology to no more than a superstructure of economic rationalization. What begins as a optimistic desire to free the subjugated classes ends up with nothing left but the will to power and control all with technic and manipulation.<br />\\"The Attack on Moral Obligation\\" and \\"The Soul and the Brain\\" round out the various fields that he sees are important to a \\"scientific objectivist\\" attack on traditional Christian notions of the ascepts of the soul.<br />This is perhaps the 4th book by Ward i have read of late, it confirms my early suspicions that he will one of the important authors to me in my understanding of the issues in the Creation-Evolution-Design debate. In particular, to understand where modern science has lost its bearings as it is extended into the philosophic realms of materialism, naturalism, physicalism by people with a anti-revealed religion agenda. This book is a excellent intro to thetopic, broken up naturally by the various types of science and the deeply contradictory nature of their claims.<br />I hope this review encourages you to pick up this book and avail yourself of a most excellent encounter with a deeply thoughtful and likewise deeply religious man who is concerned to uphold a rational realist full-body personality of human beings.the topic, broken up naturally by the various types of science and the deeply contradictory nature of their claims.<br />I hope this review encourages you to pick up this book and avail yourself of a most excellent encounter with a deeply thoughtful and likewise deeply religious man who is concerned to uphold a rational realist full-body personality of human beings.	2003-04-24

I found myself often re-reading and re-analyzing sections. Second, builds up slowly, reaches a peak in chapter 8 with \\"Brains and Consciousness\\" although it continues for 2 more rather redundant chapters, despite being a short book of 200 pages.<br />It is fundamentally a reply to two books: Peter Atkins _Creation Revisited_ and Richard Dawkins _Blind Watchmaker_, first half of the book directed towards Atkins, latter half is contra Dawkins.<br />The major theme is straightforward:<br />1-theism is a good explanation of the purpose, function, teleology of the universe as we see it, despite evolutionary denial of purpose in the universe.<br />2-theism is better than materialism as an explanation for the evolution of life, in particular for the evolution of us: thinking, conscious, believing, moral, responsible.<br />3-theism is a good answer for conscious of humans, materialism undermines consciousness by making it a random occurence without necessary justification other than the usual evolutionary natural selection mechanism for the differential survival of the survivors.<br />From the first page:<br />\\"To the majority of those who have reflected deeply and written about the origin and nature of the universe, it has seemed that it points beyond itself to a source which is non-physical and of great intelligence and power.\\"<br />To the last: \\"but, of course, really to believe in God is to have some experience of a being of transcendent power and value which is life-enhancing and value-transforming, and to trust the testimony of at least some of those who claim such experience to a pre-eminent degree.\\"<br />the book is written by a deeply thinking, deeply feeling Theistic Christian, who makes no apologies for his faith, but justifies it in logical, reasonable ways. But i see nothing in the book that will convince a naturalistic, materialistic atheist. Maybe such proofs exist, i don't know, but i do know they aren't in this book, despite the author's intentions and best attempt to present them. At best the arguments are carefully reasoned essays that point beyond themselves to the underlying ideas and books for further study on the readers part. Preliminary, exploratory, good beginnings, not final, or conclusive or something to grab and put into someone's hand, unfortunately.<br />But that said, the author puts his finger on a critical issue, that materialists like Atkins and Dawkins refuse to admit. Chapter 8, pg 147, \\"The mystery is how it comes about that the construction of brains, of complicated collections of purely physical particles, gives rise to something apparently non-physical: thoughts, feelings, dreams, images and intentions.' That materialist with a purely randomness underlying evolution end up denying the purposefulness of their own brains, of their own actions. This chapter is the key one in the book, the moral arguments that follow in the next two chapters are basically repetitions of the same ideas in different domains. His arguments are basically sound and derived from Scriptural foundations, yet for some reason the arguments do not appear to deflect the critical judgements of materialism in a significant way. But rather seem more like broad statements than actual 'battle-tested' formulations directed at the metaphysics of materialism. However i believe that the author has insights that i would like to follow up and i will read another newer book to see if he engages stronger, with more details than does this one.<br />Worth the time, if you are philosophically inclined. Not a book to recommend lightly to anyone, the topic is important and i will continue to look at this author and like books. Not to be discouraged, it is not a simple nor straightforward issue, this collision of two competing world and life views: modern evolutionary materialistic naturalistic atheism and traditional Scriptural Theistic Christianity.tic Christianity.	2003-03-21
US	53032953	R1EJLLV4279N1S	0521631440	705023368	Can a Darwinian be a Christian?: The Relationship between Science and Religion	Books	3	14	19	N	N	a very good try, worth the reading, but unconvincing	It is a surprising book. It is mild in tone, polite and nice to revealed religion. He obviously did his homework, understanding Christianity, probably better than the man in the pew, maybe without believing it. He doesn't have the anguished tortured sounds that a believer does when he encounters the conflicts in the faith or between the faith and the world. He make no profession of faith, nor does he profess no faith on the other hand, in the book, so i accept his words as an interested party, a friend of the court, amis curiae. What the book is not: it is not a poor substitute for either Darwinianism or Christianity, for he does justice to both positions, evenhanded throughout. It is not a wax nose for either position, pushing and pulling either to make it fit a preconceived position. He doesn't leave out the nasty bits, those little family secrets that everyone hides from company. But rather trots them out for inspection by all: determinism, freewill, the soul, theodicy. All in all the book is best seen as a nice introduction to several philosophic themes as handled by two different kinds of thought systems.<br />  I'm not convinced of anything in particular, the book doesn't strive to convert the borderline, nor does it preach to the choir, converting the already saved. Which is in itself interesting, how to approach a loaded gun subject and come off as a discussion amougst buddies rather than a bloodbath.<br />  quote----<br />  pg 59 &quot;Our powers of sense and of reason are given to us by God-they are crucially involved in what it means to say that humans are made in God's image- and to turn our back on such firmly established science is theologically unacceptable.<br />  Not just theologically unacceptable, of course, but also threatening to science, in the sense that if one's Christianity is such that one can disregard such strong science, &quot;<br />  The fact that he found and is sensitive to Plantinga is indicative of the scholarship that went into the book. Ruse did his homework.<br /><br />  I have of late read several secular books on the soul or on the mind-body problem and this is the first time i have seen the names: Augustinian, Aristotelian, Thomist not slighted in the least, but rather taken as heart felt and serious human endeavors to come to grips with the real world.<br />  In order to prove his points he doesn't water down either of the two systems, but rather lets the hard parts hit straight on.<br />  quote--<br />  pg 98 &quot; Not everyone will be happy with this synthesis or attempt at harmony. There are both Darwinians and Christians who argue that if one starts using law, becoming a naturalist, this is the slippery slope which ends at the bottom with materialism: meaning at this point that nothing supernatural at all exists, which means atheism, which means that Christianity is ruled out as false. Hence, Darwinism, as a supreme manifestation of the naturalistic philosophy, ends in the falsity of Christianity.&quot;<br />  Putting himself at certain risk of being hated by all is certainly brave, maybe stupid, except that he is knowledgable and smart enough to defend himself from both groups.<br /> It is to his benefit that Ruse was able to find 138 pages of complementary things to say about how Darwinianism and Christianity could fit together, before he hit theodicy on pg 139. But to his greater credit he realizes that faith must enter into the picture somewhere in the system and theodicy is a very good place to stop and let faith speak.<br />  This i believe will be Ruse's contribution to the ongoing debate, that a scientist can come to conclusions, like Plantinga's, that some people are making science into the metaphysics of scientism, a rival faith, that all Christians will rightfully deny is the proper role of reasoning in the world. But the book, as it stands between two competing faiths, will not be greeted nicely by either science. Sadly so, for Ruse is making a good and serious effort,not at compromise which will be the great label pinned upon it, but at reconciliation. For as Ruse apparently believes, although not stated in this book, God created two books: Scripture and general revelation, and as they derive from the words of a single God they will not contradict each other. If they appear to do so, either the theology is wrong or the science is wrong, or both. I think Ruse's answer is clear in the book, both need work, by workmen following the activities in the other system as they go about their efforts at fixing what is broken.Ruse is making a good and serious effort, not at compromise which will be the great label pinned upon it, but at reconciliation.

Of course it isn't, natural selection is a pruning tool, random mutation, in particular, gene duplication is the information enhancing mechanism proposed behind Darwinian evolution. Bad science, perhaps he is using the term NS in a broader sense, including RM; if so he needs to tell us, the distinction of NS-RM is a big one and he surely knows it. That's chapter 2- \\"information quandry\\". just skip it. bad science.<br /> Johnson assumes at every turn that the acceptance of the principle of naturalist or materialist methodological necessarily entails the logical acceptance of the corresponding metaphysics.pg89 And to prove his point he lowers the big guns at theistic evolutionists and fires away.<br /> on pg 90 he writes \\"As a rule, theistic modernists do not accept evolution grudgingly, nor do they dispute the Darwinian claim that evolution is undirected( at least as far as scientific evidence can determine). On the contrary they embrace evolution with all its randomness as much for its theological merits as for its scientific standing.\\"  Again he misses the big point, accept the science as method, reject the scientism as metaphysics, as an improper extension of method and principles, on Christian grounds.<br />However these two little points aside, he has an excellent illustration in the offensive and defensive teams in evolutionary world view team playing.<br />  But the issue of Gould's NOMA and science yielding up with one hand and removing under that table with the other is a good point. Johnson's point is well taken, that you can afford to yield an empty house to a fallen defended enemy, as long as you retain control of the ground it is on.<br />  The second half of the book is fully philosophically, chapter 5 is the secular evolutionary investigation of the human mind brain problem with the result that the mind doesn't exist except as electric pulsing through networks of neurons. Thus he contends eliminating the mind of man, and the mind of the scientists doing the work. This is a variation of my \\"how can i trust the mind of a monkey\\" problem.<br /><br />  One question that was solved for me rather late in the book, is what does he propose to replace secular science? The first hint i had at his answer is on page 123 with: \\" What makes the mind from the brain is not the neurons but the information that coordinates the neurons and uses them (and perhaps other entities as yet unknown) to produce the phenomena of our mental life.\\" He goes on later to introduce the key ID words on information: complex, aperiodic, specified. But other than the example of language: primitive people's do not have primitive languages, the genetic basis of language seems to allow for a wide variety of things to evolve within the linguistic field but stay language, he does not push the idea. However i believe this is a big part of ID and i know we will be hearing more about the information underlying the material world. This appears to be a way to introduce God without using the terms most common to a discussion of religion. The term information is bland and doesnt raise the watchdogs like: personality, being, thought etc, would. But this is the content that Johnson is giving to information; the personal, supernatural, putting into the material world from the supernatural world of the addendum it needs to move from one level to the next.<br />  A second question that i had was: why does he assume that methodological naturalism leds to philosophic naturalism? The simply answer is that he makes an assumption of materialism, evolutionism, naturalism, physicalism essential to science. An assumption, presupposition essential to the building of the structure from the very beginnning. His idea of naturalist methodology is that scientists fake it to the rest of us ignorant people, they know that it is materialism all the rest of the way down to the assumptions, but pretend it is methodology to the uninitiated. I am unconvinced. I believe i can use the methodology as a Christian, aware however that i expect the principle to break before it becomes metaphysics. Like Johnson, i believe it breaks on the mind-body problem. From that point, i switch sides, i can no longer walk with the consistent materialist towards philosophic materialism which destroys my mind, my purpose, my reasons for existence. He is welcome to approach and fall off the cliff of nihilism. I wont, I dont. I am a Christian at heart, not secular, not materialist, not naturalist. I believe that i might understand. Somehow the breath of God into Adam, and the image of God that he was created in, involve our minds. To reduce them to material in motion is a logical, social, scientific, disaster. But Johnson, despite the analysis from this point on, does not convince me to change my mind on the principle of naturalist methodology.presupposition essential to the building of the structure from the very beginnning.

To write the science column for Boston Globe, what i didn't know was he is also a college professor in physics and astronomy, his primary fields from which his examples are drawn. The writing's tone is: exuberent, visionary, pushy, colorful, short and choppy, all at once. It is meant to be rememberable, quick illustrations, pithy organizing principles repeated throughout the book, literally the best writing for newspapers, and maybe for college students. I suspect he is a very good prof, and well received by his students, his care, his devotion to science is obvious, deeply felt, and real.<br />&quot;A vital religious faith has three components: a shared cosmology (a story of the universe and our place in it), spirituality (personal response to the mystery of the world), and liturgy (public expression of awe and gratitude, including rites of passage). the apparent antagonism of science and religion centers mostly on cosmological questions. What is the universe? Where did it come from? Where is it going? What is the human self? Where do we fit in? What is our fate?&quot; p 2<br />This is his minor theme, repeated in different contexts, until the end where it becomes a major tying together motif. Quotable and useful organizing principle.<br />&quot; These two postures represent a fault line in our culture, and attitudinal chasm more profound than differences of politics or religious affiliation.<br />We are Skeptics or True Believers.&quot;<br />This is his major theme, obviously the book's title, he however, despite my initial misgivings does not align: religion=true believers, science=skeptics, he is much more subtle and as a result more convincing than this simple pairing would have been. For even science has its share of True Believers, although they are not as numerous as the 47% of the American population that are young earth creationists, the point of an entire chapter, seven.<br />His best illustration is the story of a ball of yarn, a student had used different lengths and different colors to represent the major geological eras. 450feet long=4.5 billion years of Earth history, and a single sheet of paper thickness is 10,000 years, the proposed young earth creationist time line. pg122-126 where he ends with:&quot;I sensed a frisson of fear in my audience.

Through the spectacles of scriptual exegesis, we Christians see the cosmos as Creation: we see where it stands in relationship to God the Creator,who is its Originator, Preserver, Governor, and Provider. Through the lens of scientific investigation, natural scientists are able to observe the internal affairs of the material world--its coherent properties, its lawful behavior, and its authentic history. Both views are integral parts of what I call the 'creationomic perspective,' the view of the cosmos that is gained when natural science is place in the framework of the biblical doctrine of creation.\\" preface pg ix<br />---end of quote---<br />The take home message is simple enough:<br />God is Creator, Sustainer, Law-Giver, and Provider.<br />The best way to read the book is to xerox the chart on pg 198 and keep it at your elbow. It summarizes the entire book!!!<br />To Scripture you address questions of external relationships:<br />Status Origin Goverance Value Purpose<br />To Science you address questions of internal affairs:<br />Properties Behavior History<br />This in a single table is the argument of the book, but to understand the critical component: the categories of questions you need to hear the example he uses.<br />Holding up a piece of paper, he asks you to describe it, one voice answers GREEN, another offers SQUARE. pg 204-5 The paper is in fact, both. Is these two pieces of information contradictory, of course not, it is complementary, coming from two different viewpoints. The extend the example in a way that the author does not, to which person do you address the questions concerning shape, to which do you address questions concerning color?<br />The first part concerns Scripture and how to build a correct hermeneutic to interpret it by. Again he introduces a good illustration, i suspect from his years of teaching this has proven to be a good memory technic and organizing principle: good illustrations. It is the vehicle model of Scripture, pg 14ff, a caravan of vehicles carrying packages with things inside the packages, think a bunch of UPS brown vans. (looks remarkably like the compiler theory train) The vehicle is the cultural historical context as expressed in the literary genre the passage is written in. The packages are the specific story, particular symbolism in a poem, specific cultural patterns. The contents are God's message to His people, in all places, throughout all time. And from pg 83, \\"In either case, if we attempt to consume both the content and the packaging, we may encounter significant difficulty in chewing, swallowing, and digesting the combination. Those who want to feed on the truths of Scripture must take care to differentiate between food and packaging.\\" The two cases to distinguish are a journalistic account of the actual events of creation(think video tape) from the primeval history account that we have in Genesis.(think metaphorical origins story- mythos)<br />Scientism and YEC(young earth creationists)- chapter 11, \\" more heat than light, the creation/evolution debate\\" and the real battle with unbelieving scientific naturalism as a religious doctrine. Van Till makes it clear throughout the book that the YEC position of apparent age is nothing more than bad science and bad theology, for it denies the coherence of creation. It denies that God created the universe with sufficent thought to have inside it the things it needs to build up the complexity we see around us. By more importantly it denies the value of creation as an arena for the providence of God, to operate through the use of physical means.<br />I finished the book with a touch of sadness. For the time, energy, and people the false debate of CED is consuming in the Christian community. While good frameworks like Van Till's are neglected for want of people to work on them. If AiG or ICR did not exist, and that energy and talent was used to advance Van Tills type of arguments the Church would be far along the way to competing with the real enemy. Scientism, the world and life view that we are nothing more than sophisticated machines, the result of mindless and random meanderings through the genetic space of living beings. This is a religious, a metaphysical battle, not scientific. For science rightfully limits itself to the things of this creation, the things we see and the forces we can theorize behind them. The YEC have diverted an enormous amount of energy into bad science, trying to fight a battle at the level of facts, denying the clear evidence for an old earth, while misinterpreting the preamble of the Great KIng of Genesis One as a scientific how-to-do book on the manufacture of us. Sadly we are all the weaker knowing that good ideas like this book have been around since 1986 and are yet to be discovered.<br />I hope you discover this book as a result of my review.

It is not a science book, it is a political education book. It is not a broad survey of evolutionary theory, it is a particularily narrow look at a few instances of science 'fraud' that can arm \\"true believers\\".  It is not an unanswered book, for all the problems of science in it have been talked about and deliberated for years, despite the author's contentions. Yes, there is fraud in science, deliberate? maybe, for a purpose, again maybe. Is that an argument to throw out theory-formation? or to throw out data gathering because all date is theory laden? no. it is an argument for better critical review, for careful analysis and reproducibility. For experimentation and the education of scientists in philosophy and metaphysics.<br />The book will not convince a knowledgable evolutionist of anything but that creationists are all political mechanism manipulators. It isn't meant to be convincing to them however, it is directed to 'true believers', the already convinced, maybe a few fence sitters who believe from their religious leaders that they ought to be creationists but are unconvinced by the creation science. What it is, is a political map on how to approach school boards to convince them that science has not proven evolutionary theory because there has been examples of fraudulent behavior on the side of atheistic scientists who desire to prove their materialist marxist freudian (yes he does!) evolutionary system.<br />Fundamentally it is an 'against the man' argument, since we have found these icons, these examples of misleading even fraudulent science, therefore all science is suspect. Especially since we know that the metaphysics of science is myth.<br />It is interesting to me that creationists and radical evolutionists seem to divide the world up similiarly. First is this radical dichomtomy which cuts the world into science and religion, then aligns reason with science and faith with religion. This kind of scientism then allows itself to be the only valid knowledge, while the religionists contend that faith alone will yield true knowledge of the universe. I call it the problem of unfaithful reason vs. unreasonable faith. I end up in the position of wishing a plague on both their houses, for it is a problem of how they divide the world, into US and THEM, sadly so. It seems true that science ought not make metaphysical pronouncements based on presuppositions that lead one to a particular view of mankind and our place in the world. Likewise it appears that religionists ought to be better thinkers about the general revelation that is in fact a creation of God.lf to be the only valid knowledge, while the religionists contend that faith alone will yield true knowledge of the universe.

I remember how unique and revolutionary it appeared. No one was saying anything like this. Well now, a decade later, lots of people are saying the same thing, and this book seems old and tired.<br />It is not a science book, it is a lawyer's argument on evolution in the dock. All you need to get an acquital is a little bit of reasonable doubt. In this case you are trying to throw out evolutionary theory as the only possible scientific explanation of life's origins, and let something else in. What exactly he wants to allow is not the point of the book, nor is it exactly specified, although subsequent history of the author is clear, intelligent design.<br />The book is at its worse when it tries to explain molecular evolutionary evidence and at its best in a chapter on the rules of science. Where Johnson is at his lawyerly best analyzing science and the metaphysical scientism, this chapter is worth a read. The rest of the book has been discredited since its publication and it worth reading only as an introduction to the history of ID, and to see how far the movement has come in 10 years. Johnson is a good writer, and the book justifiably upset the scientific world then, but it has adjusted and continues to resistent the bulk of his arguments.	2003-03-06

The overall structure of the book is particularly good as the author avoids the great temptation to stray from his point while he investigates weird and interesting behaviors, it is to his great credit that the book makes good sense and continues to hammer away at his main point. All the while exploring related avenues of information that might have derailed the study.<br />The book, at least for me with my limited background in the issues, is rather self authenticating. So i would like to share several very good quotes:<br />\\"The real and apparent casual sequences relating thought and action probably do tend to correspond with each other some proportion of the time. After all, people are pretty good information processors when given access to the right information. The occurrence of conscious intention prior to action is often wonderful information because it provides a fine clue as to how things that are on the person' mind might pertain to what the person does. In fact, the mental system that introduces throughts of action to mind and keeps them coordinated with the actions is itself an intriguing mechanism. However, if conscious will is an experience that arises from the interpretation of clues to cognitive casuality, then apparent mental causation is generated by an interpretive process that is fundamentally separate from the mechanistic process of real mental causation. The experience of will can be an indication that mind is causing action, especially if the person is a good self-interpreter, but it is not conclusive.\\" pg 96<br />\\"The phenomena of dissociative identity disorder reminds us that our familiar subjective sense of being and doing are open to remarkable transformations. The self is not locked into place somewhere an inch or so behind our eyes, a fixture in the mind. Rather, the agent self is a fabrication put in place by the mechanisms of thought, a virtual agent that has experiences and feels as though it is doing things but that could conceivably be replaced by some other virtual agent that is implemented in the same mind. The experience of consciously willing an action is something that happens in a virtual agent, not in a brain or mind. The sense of being an agent creates our sense of subjective self and identity.\\" pg 263<br />\\"Conscious will is the somatic marker of personal authorship, an emotion that authenticates the action's owner as the self. With the feeling of doing an act, we get a conscious sensation of will attached to the action. Often, this marker is quite correct. In many cases, we have intentions that preview our action, and we draw causal inferences linking our thoughts and actions in ways that track quite well our own psychological processes. Our experiences of will, in other words, often do correspond correctly with the empirical will--the actual casual connection between our thought and action. The experience of will then serves to mark the moment and in memory the actions that have been singled out in this way. We know them as ours, as authored by us, because we have felt ourselves doing them. This helps us to tell the difference between things we're doing and all the other things that are happening in and around us. In the melee of actions that occur in daily life, and in the social interaction of self with others, this body-based signature is a highly useful tool. We resonate with what we do, whereas we only notice what otherwisehappens or what others have done. Thus, we can keep track of our own contributions without pencils or tally sheets.\\" pg 327<br />And from the concluding page, 342, \\" Sometimes how things seem is more important than what they are. This is true in theater, in art, in used car sales, in economics, and -- it now turns out-- in the scientific analysis of conscious will. The fact is, it seems to each of us that we have conscious will . It seems we have selves. It seems we have minds. It seems we are agents. It seems we cause what we do. Although it is sobering and ultimately accurate to call all this an illusion, it is a mistake to conclude that the illusory is trivial.

The subtitle is &quot;The Molecular Evidence for Human Descent&quot;, don't be put off if you don't have a degree in biochemistry. Unlike most other technical and scientifically sophisticated books, in this one, the author holds your hand. He does it very well, introducing binominal and poisson distribution analysis both in the text and in appendices, for example. You are aware of his careful setting up the pieces that you need in order to understand the take home message of each chapter, and you are grateful, even if you already know the material, for the 'nice' way he does it. I finished the book wishing he would rewrite many biology and engineering textbooks i have been subjected to over the years by authors who assumed if you didn't know exactly what you were reading, then you shouldn't have bought and tried to read his book in the first place. For this characteristic alone the book is deeply and joyfully to be praised.<br />I am aware of the divisive character of the debate on human origins, this book will not settle it. But it will be a book that can be recommended to bring your reasonable intelligent but somewhat scientifically ignorant friend up to speed on the issues from a unabashed secular scientific viewpoint. It will, i would hope, set a standard for introductory books in the field. For if it can get a hearing, and even become popular then other authors will be forced to help people understand their arguments by giving them the tools to analyze and understand their positions, not just assume them.  Now this doesn't negate the need to do your homework in order to be a serious student in any field, many things will take lots of reading to get the basis for advanced arguments. Something that will never be done in one, or even a set of books. But as the authors prove a reasonable grasp of human evolutionary arguments from a biochemical/genetic point of view is not that sophisticated of a field to require volumes, just this one.<br />Lest i miss an important issue, i would like to state that the author, like most secular scientific people makes the mistake of drawing metaphysical conclusions from scientific data. This i belief to be the problem of scientism, the unjustified extension of method-science into metaphysics or religion. The authors would certainly disagree with me. In any case, their philosophic position is clearly stated, open and presented in a manner that is not belittling of a religious prespective. So even if you are a theist i believe that there is much to be gained from reading this book, don't let the scientism put you off.<br />thanks for reading this review, and please get the book, it is certainly a most important topic, whether you agree with evolutionary analysis or not, you must be informed.<br />richard williamsequire volumes, just this one.<br />Lest i miss an important issue, i would like to state that the author, like most secular scientific people makes the mistake of drawing metaphysical conclusions from scientific data.

Simply on the level of a very personal and thoughtful autobiography this is an excellent and to-be-recommended book.<br />But it is more than simply a discussion of one man's spiritual journey, it is a good introduction to process theology and the way creative and deeply centered humanism is taking ideas and weaving them with the idea of evolution and progress to build new theologies.<br />Now i do not share the authors viewpoint nor his basic theology, but the ideas he shares are clearly and forcible stated. Well backed up with current explanations interwoven with the authors own carefully analysed life experiences. The writing is presented as a dialogue, an offering to the reader of wisdom, hard won in struggles of the soul on dark nights. You sympathize, you understand, he shows you what he believes without trying to persuade or convince, this is the book's great strength.<br />The tone, the spiritual journey, the relevance to modern evolutionary thought, all make this a good recommendation for an introduction to evolutionary process theology, as explained in terms of a dance:<br />pg 46 chapter entitled &quot;darwin and the dance of tao&quot;. &quot;The best kind of dancing is when no one leads, when the leading is a back and forth sharing, when each party responds to the subtle movements, touches, gestures, and words of the other.... Dancing with no one leading, with no goal or purpose but the dance itself, is a good metaphor for portraying our contemporary scientific understanding fo evolution on our planet. If one follows strictly the philosophical implications of neo-Darwinian theory, there is no overall purpose to evolution.&quot;<br />Thanks for reading this review and i hope you enjoy the book as much as i did.<br />richard williams	2003-03-02

That is the process of reading in order to collect quotes, to get pieces of information to store or to use in other venues. I don't often fall into this mistake with books, i try to be careful and take the writing in a open spirit and grasp what the author is trying to say. This data mining breaks the connection between an author and a reader, i don't like it. Why it happened is the weakness of the book, it is truely preaching to the choir. It assumes such a relationship with the world that if you are unaware, or unable to practice the author's particular style of spiritual discipline that the book becomes disjoined.<br />Certainly he is not intending it that way. He tries carefully to set the groundwork for his spiritual practices, but like he says, they are things to be done, not things to be thought. And that's what makes the book an excellent place for data mining. He is aware of much spirituality and sees the interconnection of modern science, especially leading edge physics to this spiritual realm. So that you are able to get much information out of the book, without participating in the author's real desire, his real reason for writing the book.<br />The author desires, deeply and sensitively, for the reader to follow him into another realm of contemplative spiritual awareness. He has a well written chapter about the need for good competent guides into the field, so he knows a book is not sufficent, but he tries as this is really the only chance he has to help you into his world. And i am sorry to say that this is not enough to help me see or understand the deeper things he proposes in the book.<br />However that said, it is a good book, tone and stylistically superior to much in the field, dominated as it is by unreadable and unfollowable junk. Maybe it is simply that the spiritual, the comtemplative requires a guide who can interact and see where you are in the journey and tailor the message to you. There are many nuggets and pieces to held in the mind and added to your database of thought. For this alone it is worth the time, knowing that since your aren't a member of his choir you are really missing the true meaning and significance of the book.<br />thanks for reading this review, i hope you get more out of it than i did, but don't let my failure discourage you from trying. You perhaps are on a journey more like his and his words might very well inflame your contemplative passions, for i can see them in him, i just can't feel the heat of them.<br />richard williamsts and pieces to held in the mind and added to your database of thought.

The author has at least two high level motivations to write this book. The first is to demonstrate specifically how in a particular time and place, early 19thC America, a particular religious group, Old Princeton as heir of Reformation Calvinism, works to tie religion and culture together to solve societal intellectual problems. pg 174 &quot;It may be questioned whether religious leaders at any previous point in the nation's past ahd achievd a more unabashed union of gospel and culture than this.&quot;(this referring to the Presbyterian Old School baconist interpretation of both science and religion) Secondly, he desires as a historian to cast light on the thoughts of today by tracing their roots historically and philosophically. &quot;It is therefore feasible to suggest that the most important contemporary echo of Baconian biblicism in not to be heard within Presbyterianism as such, but within the huge party of conservative evangelicalism which has adherents within every denomination and which today perpetuates in varying degrees the essential theological tents of Fundamentalism, including biblical inerrancy.&quot; pg 173<br />We are used to the analogy of religion and science at war, we are less accustomed to the 19thC thinking of the two books of God; special revelation in the words of the Bible, and general revelation in the book of nature, as read by science. The two books, not warfare is the analogy that dominated American religious thought, especially the particular school represented by Princeton, until the rise of Darwinianism in 1870's. The contention that the two books, as written by the same reasonable God could not contradict each other is crucial to the theology as explained in the book.  The book develops the theme that a particular way of reading both books, Baconism developed as a reaction to the French Enlightment with its accent on the unfettered by religion rise of man's Reason to explain the world.<br />The best part of the book is what he calls the doxological relationship of theology to science. pg 78 &quot;More often, religious values were stated explicitly. Edward Everett, as usual, captured the full essence of current conceptions: 'the great end of all knowledge is to enlarge and purify the soul, to fill the mind with noble contemplations, to furnish a refined pleasure, and to lead our feeble reason from the works of nature up to its great Author,' Everett considered this 'as the ultimate aim of science.'&quot; Having grown up in a world dominated by materialist science the chapter on doxological science was reason enough to have spent the time reading this book. That our forefather's in the faith, at a crucial time in the development of the relationship of modern science and theology; saw science as anawe-inspiring, devotional subject is a breath of fresh cool air on a world presently seen by science as aloof, uninterested in humankind, random, and downright unfriendly, dominated by forces of impersonality certainly not a loving God.theology as explained in the book.

The first reflects an attitude evident throughout the book, he is himself evangelical, furthermore he is sympathetic with the goals and aspirations of the movement. The second quote is his reason for the book, to try to heighten the awareness of this community to its fundamental themes which mitigate against the scholarly world of the mind.<br />The book takes on the sacred cow of the young earth creationist in chapter 7 \\"thinking about science\\". He doesnt spare anyone's feelings in the process of analyzing the movement. from pg 196 \\"creation science has damaged evangelicalism by making it much more difficult to think clearly about human origins, the age of the earth, and mechanisms of geological or biological change. But it has done more profound damage by undermining the ability to look at the world God has made and to understand what we see when we do look.\\"<br />This argument alone will continue to polarize the evangelical community into YEC and non-YEC, a position to which organizations like CRI, AiG, etc would gladly push the church into a false dichomotomy where to be with their particularist interpretations is the only way to stand with God. It is certainly a chapter that the author thought long and hard over before committing himself to print. It is also a position that anyone with the understanding gained from reading this book will agree with. The book is not primarily a polemic against a particular way of treating science, it is a far wider and broader criticism than that. But under the current social and political pressure from these interest groups, this is what the book will be to many people. Sadly so, for the reaction of people demonstrates the strength of his arguments for following the quote above he labels the mindset as Manichaeanism. Those who see the whole world as a fight to the death between good and evil, no grays, no mixtures. Just God and the Devil.<br />The book is excellent, the topic timely and of crucial importance to anyone who would describe themselves as evangelical or conservative. but you only need to read the handful of reviews here on amazon, or search for book reviews on the net to realize that lots of people are reading this book with their minds completely madeup on the issue.  True learning requires a \\"suspension of disbelief\\", a mallability towards new thoughts, sadly the very people the book is addressed to are the very same ones who will not read it in the spirit it was written.<br />Additional, if you are thinking of a book for a college aged sunday school class, or a discussion group at a college where they are looking at these issues, this would rate my highest recommendation for a book to use. It is well organized and will guide thinking while exposing you to a variety of alternative paths if you dont like the one the author describes.<br />thanks for listening<br />richard williamsnd political pressure from these interest groups, this is what the book will be to many people.

After a few months of watching and participating in online debates i became interesting in what i saw to be a common element in the young earth creationist people. That was an elevation of the CED issue to one of a salvation issue. Frankly i was surprised and a little dismayed at this theological development. So i asked for help on trying to get a handle on fundamentalist theology. This was one of perhaps 5 books recommended by lots of people.<br />The book is unusual in the mix of tone and levels of sophistication between the chapters. It stems from the fact that this small volume is primarily a collection of essays from the author's much larger multiple volume work(_fundamentalism and the american culture) on the same topic. As a collection of essays, not particularly held together by design they are certainly representative of his thought, and probably the best of his work on the topic. But the chapters are not sequential or connected in a discernible way, other than the general chronological. In this case however this is not a criticism, the book flows fine anyhow. But what it does do is to make it possible to read chapters that you are primarily interested in, out-of-order, a nice feature.<br />What is the history of fundamentalism in america and why should i care? It's a big movement 25-45% of the population by most measurements. But more importantly it represents a criticism of modernism that is hard to miss. With abortion, evolution in the public schools, gay rights etc being just tip of a huge iceberg where the movement hits the political sphere, inescapable for any one with current issues interest.<br />The book is well written, the chapters are concise and gently lead you to see what the author sees in the movement. You know from the beginning that the author is sympathetic with the fundamentalist's but at the same time you don't feel that his religion is interfering with his studies. You can see places he is saddened by events, disappointed at roads not taken but at the same time he comes across as a feeling competent historian. So much so was i impressed at his abilities as a historian that i ordered his larger work despite it's 1980 copyright date.<br />The real strength to me is the 5th chapter on the \\"evangelical love affair with enlightment science\\". He presents two men, bb. warfield and abraham kuyer as evangelicals with very different ideas of the relationship of science to religion. Warfield's position is classic science yields truth in its researches of the real world and ought to be seen as the study of the general revelation in nature. Kuyer is far more sophisticated and sees Kuhian themes 75 years before, in his analysis that different types of people have very different presuppositions and these necessarily led to a different science.<br />This insight as well as an extended discussion about the origin of the science and religion at war metaphor is worth the time to read this book. If you have any interest in the field this is a good introduction plus a reference to point further down the road of study. Oftentimes scholarly apparatus detracts from the overall readability of books like this one, but in his case your eyes and mind are often drawn to the footnotes, i several times yellowed book titles which he interested me in reading to learn more about his arguments. This is a great asset and indicative of a very well argued book.<br />thanks for listening.<br />richard williamsthat the author is sympathetic with the fundamentalist's but at the same time you don't feel that his religion is interfering with his studies.

This book literally pushed its way from the bottom of my to-be-read list, and forced me to regret every minute i didn't read it. From the tone of concern, through the extraordinary well researched data, to the high level threads it is a must read book.<br />Two interrelated but distinct pairs of complementary ideas are at the center of the book. Everything else revolves around these most interesting ideas. First is the pair: conservative and liberal. She gives conservative the meaning of a person, rooted in the past when religion was part of an agrarian culture.  The key element is the binding of people's consciousness to a traditional way that would not out run the resources available to an agriculturally based pre industrial society. The thesis looks mildly Marxist with its superstructure of intellectual things build on the means of production. But i think it is just a recognization that how we make a living will greatly effect how we think. The liberal is defined as modern, future orientated, post industrial, built on the limitless abundancy of modern industrial-scientific materialist output.<br />The second pair is: logos and mythos. This is where her organization really shines. I dont think a page goes by where you are not aware of how she is intertwining and relating the story back to these ideas. Logos is reason, personified in science, mythos is the pre rational, deeply felt side of humanbeings that gives rise to stories, myths, scriptures which try to capture in words the passage of people into this supernatural world.<br />The organization is chronological, where the 3 monothesistic Abrahamic faiths are posed side by side in time, to show how their respective fundamentalist movements orginated and grew.<br />The insights are important, apropos to a world where polarization and the failure to communicate is a problem increasing almost daily. One particularly appropriate idea is that mythos translated into logos is a disaster, it yields bad religion and even worse science......<br />So. drop whatever you're reading and get ahold of this 5 star book and have at it. I used up an entire yellowing pen on it...*grin*worse science......<br />So. drop whatever you're reading and get ahold of this 5 star book and have at it.

It lived up to its expectations as an introductory study of the philosophy of science from a christian prespective. Del Ratzsch is a very competent philosopher, book is well written and strives for a balance not often seen it this field, i am sad to discover. He ends the books with the idea of \\"speak the truth in love\\", remarkably there are several reviews here on amazon concerning this book that apparently don't think this a principle to follow. again sadly.<br />as an example of a balanced passage: page 124<br />\\"the second reservation is that different parts of science operate in different ways, on different levels and must answer to different demands. consider the principle of the uniformity of nature. historically the underpinning of that principle is philosophical. it is not empirically testable-indeed, what test results might mean it itself determined in part in a context already defined by that very principle\\"<br />it certainly deserves a place in any thinking christian's bookshelf. it is not very doctrinaire and would be an asset to anyone interested in the topic of the philo of science, especially anyone who wants view conditioned by a particular perspective deeply involved in western culture.	2003-01-29

This is the reverse of my habit, which is to read the book before seeing the movie. The only thing in common between the movie and the book is the man, for they are very different, but unlike most combinations these two are both good. The movie is written to get people into the theaters and to tell their friends what a good movie they saw.  So it concentrates on the heroic parts of John Nash's life, the genius and the battle against it's flipside--the darkness of illusion brought on by mental illness.  While it neglects the sordid(first son and girlfriend he never married), the weird(king of Antarctica) and replaces the object of the mindless data collection and analysis with government involvement.<br />  I'd like to expand on the heroic, that part of both the book and the movie that we cheer for, tear up at, and generally find appealing.  Most of us do not identify with either genius or with madness, we can see people here and there, mostly in books and movies, that pass over the lines.  But we ourselves believe ourselves anchored in the plain, commonplace, ordinary so well that it is only at a distance that we can identify with characters like John Nash. We can feel sorry, and then joy with him but we can not feel like him, unless we have been through what he did. But we can identify with his heroic struggle, with his passion to have a unique and original thought, to be the very most creative in his chosen field. This is what builds the movie.  But not the book, for she shows him as a rat towards those who care for him. He is not very sympathetic a character, too often you can blame him for the bad choices, not his approaching storm of schizophrenia.  This is the genius of the book that the movie neglects, in order to fill the seats. For you cry with a man whose life is a shambles not because we can experience either genius or madness but because we can participate with him in the common lot of mankind through the ages in trying to conquer ourselves.  That battle with passions misdirected towards our destruction more often then towards our heroic challenges.

Or where he praises a commandant for his humanity being 100 years ahead of his time. He is on one basic level retelling the story of the convict founding of OZ, and yet showing constantly the larger issues of it's place in English intellectual and cultural history to the big picture of man's inhumanity to man.<br />  This placing of the pieces of the puzzle in several larger contexts is excellent and makes the book far more than just the recounting of a sad tale indeed.  It redeems the book from the world of facts and figures so common to historical writing and raises it to analysis and good commentary.<br />  The only critical thing i have towards the book is a somewhat disjointed structure, the chapters are not quite chronological, more organized around a single character, usually a commander of facilities.  Thus often backtracking between chapters, which leaves the newcomer to this country's history without good memory pegs to hang the facts onto.<br />  I'm glad i invested the several hours it took to get through the book with it's gore and extraordinary sadness permeating the story.  It's a good book and desires the wide circulation it is getting on the online bookclubs, which is how i found it.	2003-01-01

People so divorced from reality that they can walk down the street without even noticing that they forgot to put on their pants this morning. This book effectively challenges this viewpoint of philosophers, first by starting with a downright potentially violent confrontation between K. Popper and L. Wittgenstein, and from there by delving into each man's biography and professional studies to show how their rather opposing viewpoints interact. While involved in this endeavor they manage to sneak in a decent freshman introduction to modern Western philosophy, of course with special attention to the issues that directly involve the two men, particularly the philosophy of science and of language. For a book whose reason for writing- a short meeting where these two philosophers meet for first and only time in their lives, despite both being Viennian &eacute;migr&eacute;s- seems tenuous at best, it is rather surprisingly good. The issues discussed in philosophy are well presented, certainly better than most textbooks, the book is well written with a pace that keeps your attention and certainly helps keep your eyes on what is usually a rather dry subject. I'm not sure the average reader will be able to get through it but a person with some interest in philosophy will benefit from this quick read.	2002-12-30

I finished the book with great sadness for the men who died in this war. For the millions on both sides lead to their deaths by incompetent generals, who didn't understand that technology had changed warfare since the prussian-franco war. Hungry and without ammo to fight because their supply lines from the taxpayers who reluctantly footed the bills throughout the whole system where the stupid if not utterly corrupt ruled. (\\"now boys don't steal anything\\") I wholeheartedly agreed with the author who wrote on the last page, \\"when at last it was over, the war had many diverse results and one dominat one transcended all others, disillusionment.\\" Especially knowing that we are in many ways the disillusioned and cynical result of those lost generations who fought and died in Flanders field. The writing is excellent, the topic important and riveting even now 90 years after the event. You find yourself unable to put down the book, or to cease thinking about the issues, which is exactly what a superb author like Ms. Tuchman intended when she struggled to write the book for us, her readers. It is one of those often recommended books that I simply didn't get around to reading, now I wish I had done so years ago, given myself more time to read more about WWI. After all, that is the measure of a good book, one that inspires you to follow the author's footsteps and read some of her research material, immerse yourself in more tellings of the story she introduced you to. Thanks Ms. Tuchman. (d. 1989)	2002-12-30

The bookstore and his childhood interest in codes stand him in good stead for the job he does for England during WW2 working for the cryptographic center that communicates with England's spies and secret agents in Europe. His words are enchanting, humor is evident on every page, he opens up and shares his thoughts with us as a 22-25 year old, out-of-place in the military, code maker genius.

After reading it i was struck by the idea of relative poverty. This is the concept that it is not absolute dollar income that makes people feel poor, but rather how they compare themselves to their immediate neighbors. This is important because the author is the daughter of at-one-time one of the richest men in HongKong, yet she describes her childhood in terms of impoverishment that rivals street beggars. We feel her pain and the anguish of a sensitive soul, but the problem is that she lived in the midst of one of the poorest, most deprived populations on earth while going through some of the most horrific changes a society has ever seen. Yet she poignantly tells the story of not having eggs at the boarding school in HongKong, while millions died only a few hundred kilometers to the north.... Poor little rich girl complaining... but the quality of the writing and the heartfelt attachments to her grandfather and aunt certainly override these ideas while reading the book. It is only on reflection afterwards that these issues begin to creep up. Overall a good book and a contribution to the genre of women growing up in china, although i believe the best is still _wild swans_.	2002-12-30

This is an extension and elaboration of the major points in _becoming human_. Actually a little bit better given the looser construction of the essay format, so read this rather than _becoming human_. Either is a simple basic intro to human evolution with a big dose of Neanderthal history, which is tattersall's field. Short, to the point with a minimum extrapolation and speculation, recommended for a light informative afternoon spent with our closest relatives.	2002-11-30

The heart of the book is the last few chapters where he tries to show that the kind of rearguard, god-of-the-gaps reasoning is not the only path people of a biblical faith need take when confronting evolutionary theory.  His idea is that evolution allows us to see the radical separation of god and his creation for what it really is; an act of love and a grant of true freedom to creatures.  The universe is free from the manipulation of a supreme being, for evolution shows that life then consciousness (necessary for worship and to love god) evolved in a distinctly materialist fashion free from the miraculous.  i hope he is right for the gaps available for bible literalists to hide god in are getting rarer with every discovery. Soon religion ought to switch to the winning side and be a part of the light of scientific discovery rather than fearing it as so many do currently.  This book is a good start on this quest to realign religion alongside science rather than being such an adversary as the creationist would have it.  To anyone with a heart felt commitment to both science and a biblical faith this book is an extraordinary find.  Full of hope and faith it rises above most of this topic's dialogue to inspire and motivate the reader.  Certainly a book worth moving to the top of the current reading pile.  But i am afraid it will manage to turn off a lot of people since it takes science and faith seriously, and demands some intellectual exertion from it's readers, something people who want to hear comfortable and reassuring words don't normally do.  If evolution bothers your faith then this is a good book to start with.	2002-11-29

A few of the author's insights are very good: (1)Mao was a 19th century man trying to understand the 20th century and the problems of scientific development of his country, he was never really up to it. (2)Mao as a historian of chinese history modelled himself after some of the worse of the chinese emperors, consciously using people's feelings and grossly manipulating those around him to be loyal to him above all else.<br />As i reflect on the book i see it as a necklace of pearls, a group of personal encounters of the author with mao, strung together chronologically with very little analysis or self examination on the author's part to join them together or to put them into a greater context. Certainly he regretted his part in the government in his old age, he remarks as his feelings towards mao changes over the years to disillusionment, but the book is not about how Mao effected him personally. This, i believe is from how he must have written the book, for during the cultural revolution he burned 40 volumes of his notes and journals out of a well placed fear that they would incriminate him if they fell into the hands of the red guards. So what did he use to write the book, his memory over a 60 year period? I think this is why the book has the character of a stringing together of incidents, a pearl necklace of events where his life and that of mao intersected. I don't fault the writing, the facts are probably as true as memory can make them, but i wonder how much better the book would have been if he had gotten those burnt books to someplace safe. To later use them as primary reference to write this book. For history, truth and factuality is most important, therefore i would classify this as a well written memoir rather than coherent purposeful history....but whatever the genre you really ought to read this book, if only to glimpse the heart of a man responsible for the deaths of 60 million chinese...for the deaths of 60 million chinese...	2002-10-22

But to get to that point, he presents a very good, college level introduction to both the physics of quantum mechanics and biology as it is related to evolutionary theory. If you don't have a degree in biology and/or physics to understand his theory for the book fills in the details thus leading into his theorizing well. Quite an accomplishment in any field, to popularize leading edge science. All the more so impressive in a field, evolution and quantum mechanics, dominated by BIG controversy and extreme partisanship. This is one of the things that makes buying books like this one so difficult, they often suffer from a viewpoint so out of mainstream as to be useless, or worse yet so polemical to fill your head with the wrong information.  I liked the style of the writing and the presentation as scientifically accurate but at an educated layman's level, certainly an asset to sell books. As an introduction to the field and as a brief explanation of his theories I can think of no better book. The only disappointment was that I expected the book to start with the material in chapter 10, his theory, and therefore would appreciate him writing another book that takes the reading of this one for granted(like quantum evolution volume II) and really gets into the idea that quantum events can effect macroscopic events like evolution at more than just crucial breakthrough type of points.	2002-09-27

Like the author i can remember the books i read as a child (with great fondness), i have those books even today, and like her they are my old and familiar friends. But unlike her most of those books have been nonfiction, for i thought/think those were the way to see the real world. After reading this book i realize that the gap i thought existed between nonfiction and fiction isn't really important. For she sees books, like i imagine most readers do, as a funny kind of mirror which reflects the reader's inner world at the same time as displaying the author's world. I think the gap is between readers and nonreaders, who like those described this book as visual or picture people, identify with films rather than books.  The book is a memoir which asks the big question on our reading minds-- does it matter if i can't remember what is in the books? She answers it- \\"For in the end, even if all my books where to vanish, I would still have them somewhere, if I had read them attentively enough.  Maybe the words on the page are not even the true book, in the end only a gateway to the book which recreates in the mind and lasts as long as we do.\\"  The book is a real treat for anyone who like her, is often asked, \\"haven't you wasted your life, by reading rather than experiencing life?\\"  She answers this with the thought that her life is so intertwined with the books she has read and thereby experienced, and so made a part of her. That it doesn't matter, which is books and which is real life for they together make her, her. It's a good book, short, poignant with echoes and parallels apparent to any readers life. Go for it, spend a pleasant hour with this book.	2002-09-26

I mention this because it is certainly not available in China in Chinese, for it is very critical of the party and how it treats it's members. See the chapters about the author's father, his undying loyalty to the party and the years of mistreatment he received for his efforts. Told through the eyes of three generations of the author's family, from the footbound grandmother to the author herself, the first chinese woman to get a PhD in England. It mirrors the events of history in the tales told within her family. 'Soft' history, softened by family stories yet never mushy or overly sentimental, the book has my highest rating, for it simply pulls you into her family, into her Chinese culture. So that you really feel the history as it moves, at times literally over the bodies of it's victims. Unlike many biographies it doesn't have slow chapters where the author feels obligated to cover the years despite really having nothing to say. It is evenly written, with the best parts being how she matures through the cultural revolution to eventually getting a degree in English and going to England to study.<br /> Knowing that millions of Chinese have similar stories of sadness and heroism, deprivation and the desire to flourish, stupidity and education, all mixed up and awaiting someone to sort the stories out and share them with the world, I am certainly glad this one reached my hands. I hope that someday it will be a best seller in Chinese, in China......You don't have to be a lover of China or the Chinese to get something out of it, just a student of human behavior and history. Where people like the author overcome enormous obstacles to shine, to rise above their past, showing all the rest of us the humanity that we all share, and how motivation is the greater part of success in all endeavors.<br />[edit]	2002-09-22
