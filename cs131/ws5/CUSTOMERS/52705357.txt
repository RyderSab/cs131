With _Navigating World History_ Pat Manning helps to amend this failing by providing a concise, engaging, and erudite history of the field and also an analysis of its various paradigms, pitfalls and potentials.<br />Researchers, teachers and students who are new to the field will find Manning's work an invaluable guide to help locate their own efforts within the often overwhelming context that is World History.<br />Truly and outstanding work.  A doff of the cyber-cap to Prof. Manning!	2003-09-16

Heavy on &quot;who&quot; &quot;what&quot; and &quot;when&quot;, this text never offers the reader any explanation of &quot;why&quot; anything has happened in the Sudan.  The civil war in the Sudan is a result of a number of forces, not the least of which are colonial rule, economic strains, and ethnic and religious tensions.  O'Ballance's book does justice to none of these factors.  Historians often get annoyed with journalists because they don't take history into account.  This book is a prime example of that failing.	2002-01-22

Ginzburg's book makes the job easier by providing the instructor with primary documents with which to examine the phenomenon.  In particular, Ginzburg's collection is useful because it draws upon newspaper articles intended for a number of constituencies.  Some, directed at racist whites, cheer the lynchings.  Meanwhile, black newspapers and those directed at more progressive whites decry the practice.  As such, the collection is a perfect tool for examing the place of lynching within various US communities in the latter 19th and early 20th century.  Even more excellent when combined with the visual record of _No Sanctuary_.	2002-01-11

Not only is this book a comprehensive guide to all the twists, turns and pitfalls of making a living as a musician, but it is very user friendly, to boot.  Heck, even musicians can understand what he is talking about.  Passman might earn a bit of criticism for his 'pro-lawyer' bias, but he is also just being honest that without a good lawyer any reasonably successful musician is going to be eaten alive by record company contractual permutations.  Finally, Passman deserves credit for being such a smooth and downright funny author.  A rare thing in what appears to be a nuts-and-bolts guide.  Bottom line?  IF YOU ARE A MUSICIAN YOU NEED TO BUY THIS BOOK.	2001-01-22

Like most reviewers here, I agree that this book is a bit unballanced.  It is indeed biased to rock/pop.  More so, though, it is biased to British rock/pop.  Very little is said about US record production except when various Brit producers head to the US to &quot;learn American tricks&quot;.  Uhhhh... like what, exactly, guys?  Nonetheless, this book is full of great info about the (very influential) Anglo music scene.  More than anything else, it chronicals the increasing influence of studio technology on the way music is made and the rise of the studio itself as a musical instrument, and not simply as a passive tool for recording music.	2000-12-30

A long-running debate in the study of 20th Century African history has been whether there really was any substantive difference between French &quot;direct&quot; rule and British &quot;indirect&quot; rule in the colonial era.  Miles gives us a new perspective by focusing on the contemporary differences between two neighboring Hausa-speaking communities -- one in Niger (formerly a French Colony) and one in Nigeria (formerly under British rule).  By examining not only conteporary conditions but also the memories of the respective inhabitants, Mile's careful study provides scholars and interested readers with an insightful perspective into the impact of the past on the present. Well-written accessible, and smart.	2000-12-09

This book represents a shallow observation of African conditions in the mid-80's.  Far better introductions to Africa exist.  Try Davidson's _Black Man's Burden_ for example.	2000-10-25

The only drawback is the insight into the fact that it is more mystery than magic.  All too often Burgess says 'of course, you can never tell what will be a hit' -- this tells us all too much about the industry itself.  Still, the insight into how the biz works is more than worth the price of entry...	2000-10-25

I didn't notice and was a bit miffed when I opened my box.  Still, it stands alone just fine (though I still wonder what I'm missing).  It is not quite as advanced as I was hoping for, but is good for the beginner or intermediate studio operator.  The sound samples of different effects and settings are really quite helpful -- but listen on good headphones or monitors for the best benefit.	2000-10-25

This is a classic example of the worst stereotypes of Africa.  Africa is a desert.  Africa is full of Animals.  Africa is deadly.  Africans run around naked.  Heck, Ritts' presentation of Africans is EXACTLY THE SAME as his presentation of animals.  Whether accidental or intentional, it is insulting all the same.  SHAME SHAME SHAME.<br />Strangly, I have found this to be a USEFUL book.  I use it as an example during my lecture on &quot;Stereotypical Images of Africa&quot; in my African History Class.  Without this redeeming feature, I would probably use it as a backstop on the rifle range.	2000-10-12

I have traveled to  Africa seven times in the past ten years, and I have also undertaken  considerable overland driving... having driven a British Rally car most of  the way across the Sahara, among other trips.  Seeing Steven's book and the  positive reviews, I eagerly ordered it.  By the end of the first thirty  pages I was almost ill with anger and frustration.  I don't know about the  other reviewers, but this book reflects very little of the reality of the  Africa which I have experienced.  And heck, I lived in Nigeria, where  Stevens was 'afraid' to go.<br />Briefly put, this book is nothing more than a  conglomeration of negative stereotypes about Africa and Africans.  The  question is... where did Stevens  manage to go so wrong?  It is possible  that he is simply playing to popular stereotypes about Africa in order to  find a ready audience.  Alternately, he is very impressionable and took the  ramblings of his expatriate hosts as gospel and never really got to know  any Africans  All too often, he looks to expatriates for  &quot;explanations&quot; of African conditions and to Africans as a source  of comic anecdotes.  Don't read this book to learn about Africa.  Read this  book to learn just how vain, racist and isolated many (certainly not all)  expatriate communities are.  I know people who have lived for years in  Africa, but who have rarely traveled beyond their homes or out of the  circles of expats who sit in bars and make fun of Africans.  They generally  know very little about their new &quot;home.&quot;<br />Either way, this is a  truly abominable book -- right down there with David Lamb's _The Africans_  on the list of books by people who have been to Africa and not really come  to understand a thing.	2000-09-19
