I have never been so encouraged in my faith as I was after reading this book.  So many awesome points were made that it left me speechless!  I was so happy to finally found an evangelical teacher who agrees with the doctrine that seems to spring forth from the New Testament.  This book will uplift and encourage anyone who is unsure whether they are 'saved' or not.	2002-12-13

This biography is one of the most interesting I have ever read.  I found his story to be full of spiritual vitality and love for Jesus that passes all human understanding.  This man was a spiritual giant who left a legacy for all Christians to emulate.  Christ shone brightly in the life of this devout Messianic Jew.	2002-12-13

Wurmbrand is a man of many sufferings, tragedies, but also spiritual triumphs of the most amazing kind.  I have worn out my copy of this convicting, encouraging, and challenging spiritual masterpiece.  Wurmbrand has now passed away but his life and writings exist to carry on the message that even in severe suffering, Christ is with us.  This book reminds us that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus, not even Communist torturers and corrupt governments (which still abound).  This book has sustained me through difficult times, and read as a devotional it is a daily dose of comfort and compassion.	2002-12-13

The author writes with heartfelt pain about being obese.  Anyone who has struggled to lose more than 30 pounds knows how difficult it is and how temptations are lurking behind every door, particularly the refrigerator door!  I loved her sense of humor and her unwillingness to believe that \\"Big is Beautiful\\".  She emphasizes the right approach to losing weight, which is loving yourself patiently through the process.  I marvelled at her ability to take it one day at a time and to finally achieve the goals she set for herself.  She is an inspiration in every sense of the word, and not just for her loss of weight but for the beauty of her spirit which glows from every page.	2002-12-13

Some of the employment horror stories are funny but several chapters were quite honestly, vulgar.  This book is loaded with graphic, sexual content and strong language.

I read this book and couldn't put it down, nor could I get the images out of my head.  Some of the details are horrific and the atrocities that this man suffered for his faith in Christ are terrifying.  What is more amazing is how he found the courage to endure when most mortals would have given up altogether.  I have always been encouraged and inspired when reading books like this, a testimony to the power of God in a life given over in humble obedience to Him.

The author admits his Socialist bias at the beginning of the book and criticizes American medical care at every opportunity.  <br />He arrogantly portrays himself as having had more \\"hands-on\\" education than American surgeons and that Socialist medicine is far more advanced in the areas of research and general patient care.  I beg to differ!  Anyone who has lived in a Socialist or Communist nation knows that this is simply not true!

This book is poorly written and not worth the money.  Too much time spent on vague ideals and notions of death and dying not enough substance.

I got this book and literally followed her program step-by-step for 6 weeks and I have seen very little results.  She claims that her program is a fat-burning program (and weight-lifting can be) but this program should not be touted as such.  I have personally been on a strict diet and followed this book to the tee and gotten nowhere fast.  Don't let the air-brushed body on the cover deceive you, most people will not look like this in 10 minutes a day!  After following Joyce's program rigorously for 6 weeks, I can see no visible difference in the tone and shape of my flabby physique.  I also did not experience more energy.

This author claims a whole new definition of a disease that has ravaged so many lives.
