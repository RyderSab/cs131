Woodrow, now living with his grandparents, is driven to find his mother. Cousin Gypsy goes with him in the search.  Along the way they meet some interesting people.

His latest is no exception. The Culver family is one you wish you knew --- loving, wise, and irrepressible. Told by 15 year old, Russell, the story begins in August with the death of Myrt Arbuckle, the Hominy Ridge School teacher. When older sister Tansy gets the job, Russell knows that life will change. He plans to go to the Dakota Territory to find excitement. He finds it in Parke County, Indiana during 1904. You will laugh and cry at the stories and you will come to love the characters. This is a must for any teacher in Indiana to have on his/her classroom shelf.  And if you can get that Central Indiana accent going, it will make a terrific read aloud. <br /> <br />	2005-09-25

Knox Davis is a police investigator for the Pekesville, KY. in 2005.  A time capsule is mysteriously unearthed at the court house and no clues are left.  At the same time Nikita Stover comes to town, she is an FBI agent from 2207.  The two join forces to stop rogue agents from stealing the information left in the capsule.<br /><br />Too much is occurring in this story. Trying to cover the social and technological changes in 200 years, plus the mystery and romance, means that plot and characters are not fully developed. I have enjoyed Howard's Open Season, Mr. Perfect, & Dream Man but this one left me cold.  If you want to read a great time travel romance by Ms. Howard try Son of Morning.  You will become involved with the characters and the plot is exacting.	2005-07-23

She meets Ambrose Wells, one of the last members of Vanza, while trying to save her four young pupils. Together the two follow clues to the villians planning to use the young girls for nefarious deeds. A minor character from Quick's Vanza novel, I Thee Wed,is reintroduced as an older gentleman linking the earlier period novels to this one. The mystery is interesting, there is the humor, and the story is fast paced.  As always you will not be disappointed in this story. It makes a fun beach read.	2005-06-21

Adam Hardesty and Caroline Fordyce each have secrets that could cause problems with their families if they were to be told. Adam is being threatened by a medium to keep his secret. When the woman is discovered murdered, Adam has only one lead and it leads him to Caroline Fordyce, author of serials in the tabloid newspapers. The two join forces to find the murderer and to protect each other, when another medium is murdered. The characters are multi-dimensional (though I miss the humorous aspects of earlier Quick books) and plot intricate. The identity of the villian is not apparent until the end. Overall, Quick has written an entertaining romance and an intriguing mystery.	2005-02-16

Nancy only had a coupe. Trixie had horses plus mysteries.  In this the first of the series, Trixie, daughter of modest means family, meets her new neighbor Honey, whose father is a millionaire. The two girls discover a runaway boy, Jim, in the ruined mansion of an elderly miser. Excitement abounds with Bobby, Trixie's little brother, being bitten by a copperhead to Jim's brutal stepfather wanting Jim's inheritance. The ending is in serial form and you must read the next in order to find out what happens to Jim. <br /> <br />Trixie Belden is a feisty heroine, who is not afraid of taking a troubling situation in hand and finding a solution.  She is a character that young girls will be able to understand and want to emulate. Some might think that the series is for those of us who read them as pre-teens but I did have a 4th grader excitedly tell me about the old books she found in her aunt's basement. Yes, the Trixie Belden books.  It is great to see them back in print where another generation of girls will enjoy them.	2004-08-06

On the national front, the French are trying to keep King Edward from their shores and keep Henry Tudor safe.  Locally, the village of Walmer has a series of deaths by poison. Kathryn uses logic  to catch the murderers.  The author deftly weaves history and social life of the middle ages into an intricate plotted mystery.  If you like Candace Robb's Owen Archer mysteries this is one you will want to read.  The plot is strong, the characters multi-faceted, and a very strong heroine.	2004-07-29

The Douglasses are outsiders and not truly welcomed when they buy a house that had been in the Brewer family since 1774. Amy Douglass desperately wants a baby to the point that she already has a completed nursery. When the teenage helper is found murdered behind the barn, everyone becomes a suspect, including Maggie.  Will Brewer, also an antique seller, a member of the family who had once owned the house, and friend of Maggie's joins her in the search for the murderer. Maggie must determine who is making the wee hours hang-up calls and why do they hear a crying baby in the dead of the night.  Maybe a little too much information on antiques but if you are a fan of the Antiques Roadshow this is the mystery for you. The Antique Print series has possibilities but since the next one is in hardback, I'll wait for it in paperback. It is a fun read but not at hardback prices.	2004-06-27

Jane, with the help of her lover Detective Mel, tries to solve the various &quot;mysteries.&quot;  This just doesn't work. When 100 pages were read and there still hadn't been a murder, and never was one, I should have put the book aside. I'm glad I got this one from the public library rather than purchasing it.

The supporting characters are eccentric, the setting (northern Wisconsin in winter) adds spice.  I'm looking forward to reading others in the Loon Lake Fishing Mystery series.

The first chapter, which gives the book its title, will have you laughing until you cry.  In fact, this is too good for kids.
