Michael N Bastedo has written the defining treatise on this tragically underdiscussed topic in higher education.

Engaging, thoughtful, challenging, and most of all, readable...all of these things are true of this masterpiece.  No higher education library is complete without Dr. Bastedo's work.	2005-07-27

Seriously, Jane was neither interesting nor likable, which kind of killed half of the narration.  Desmond was more likable, but I felt like he was lacking in a lot of self-awareness, which was frustrating in and of itself.  The ending seemed sort of abrupt to boot.  Still, an engrossing read and again, a lot of great insight I appreciated.	2001-09-27

Anyway, this story about Claire's life and her attempts to balance her marriage, children, and career rings very true and doesn't resort to cliches or whiny behavior on her part.

The first half of the book is really good, with beautiful stories, particularly &quot;The Bath.&quot;  However, after &quot;Kissing in Manhattan,&quot; it seems like Schickler tries too hard to make a larger point and strays outside of his limits.  Kissing in Manhattan was an amazing story, and then to have the behavior explained in the next one sort of took away its mystique, as did the general march towards making Patrick a sympathetic character and insert some standard, cliched action.  I think the author has a ton of potential, though--I'll read whatever he does next.	2001-07-26

One, I didn't feel like the closeness between the sisters was really SHOWN to us--&quot;I called my sister three to four times a day, for wardrobe advice or a quick complaint to what she was having for dinner.&quot;  You did?  Why didn't we see more calls then, rather than just hearing about them after they stopped?  (Yes, she DID call her sister, but I didn't realize they happened all the time.) Two, if the point of the novel is that each sister is successful in different areas, forming one &quot;perfect&quot; person, perhaps that theme should've been a little more developed instead of consisting of one throwaway sentence that seemed to scream, &quot;Okay, I've got the title in, now what?&quot;  Third, if the point of the novel is the relationship between the two sisters, perhaps we should feel like we know the non-narrating sister better than anybody else in the book?  As it was, she was merely a person the narrator talked to; I had a better idea of the boyfriend than I did Bette.	2000-12-12

This book is a weird combination of dead-on details (the publishing parties!) and crashing boredom.  Nobody in the book is likable, it's true, but more importantly, nobody is even interesting.  The Stanley Flint as mentor seems to be totally random--when nothing's going on with the main characters, we'll bring him in to knock Bauman back down a few pegs.

The premise (a boy and an author chat on the phone and build a beautiful friendship) seems nauseating, but it goes beyond that it becomes a) a mystery and b) more about the author's mid-life crisis as a whole, which I liked.  I started this book on a Greyhound bus and didn't put it down until I arrived at my destination, at which point I read it until I was finished.  This is a prime example of someone who can mine his personal life for fictional details and make it work on a fictional level, not just a &quot;read for titillation purposes&quot; level.	2000-12-01

No characters were developed enough to make me particularly care about them, including Shannon, the narrator.   The dilemmas and problems she faced are familiar enough ground that to make  her book stand out, she needs to have something more than just a recitation  of life events, but alas, that's all this was.

Things are hinted at and then never returned to, built up conflicts end with a one-sentence  resolution, and the main subjects (Lennon and Yoko) are extreme cartoons.   Giuliano introduced this book by saying it was going to portray the  non-saintly version of John, but even as he's relating tales of John  beating May Pang, the next sentence will be, &quot;To his credit, John  wanted to change.&quot;  Yoko has an equally one-sided portrayal, this one  as the devil herself.

Yes, I guessed the &quot;secret&quot; about twenty seconds in.  But what really kills the book is the crashing symbolism (the thunderstorm crashing down  just as the climax approaches....he wants to run away, but his car won't  start, maybe because he doesn't REALLY want to go! etc.) and Andy's  incredibly irritating condescension towards Eden. Not to mention the fact  he fell in love with her based on what?  No conversations, nothing but  their past as TEENAGERS.  Whatever!<br />One flash of promise, though--the  friend TJ.  He could've easily fallen into a stereotype, what with his  &quot;Andy-boys&quot; and &quot;I work out, don't you?&quot;, but he showed  more insight and depth than that. I would've added 1/2 a star to the rating  for him, except Amazon doesn't accept decimals, and 2 stars is too generous  for what is essentially a gothic nightmare of a novel.  I'm so glad I  didn't read this one first, or I probably never would have tried Shreve  again!	1999-09-10

Second, the fundamental problem with this book is that it's pretty much unwritable.  If Dunne had written it as a straightforward account of the OJ trial, what could he really have  said that hadn't already been written?  However, he couldn't really write  the book in its current form as non-fiction, either, because too much of it  is gossip and rumor--it would've meant multiple trips to the courthouse as  he shelled out millions of dollars in libel suits.  So I respect the  dilemma Dunne was in; I just wish he'd reprinted his essays from Vanity  Fair as a collection instead.  In its current form, the book is vapid,  uninteresting, and basically a reprinting of Dunne's journal.  And the end?   Talk about a desperate way to link in the other hot topic of the year!   Whatever!	1999-05-17

Because it tried to portray Ted Bundy as a whole, complete individual? That's what makes this  book work--showing that a person who can be as genuine and kind as any  friend of ours can also secretly be one of the nation's worst serial  killers.  At any rate, in terms of the actual book, it's an engrossing  story of Ted Bundy's life, with the added bonus of it being by someone who  actually knew him.  The personal touch didn't really contribute to a  greater understanding of Ted, however; I don't think Ann Rule understands  him any more than the average reader.  What's most striking about this  story is that both times he was caught (in Colorado and then in Florida),  it was because he foolishly ran away whenever a cop happened along his  path.  It wasn't brilliant detective work that finally stopped him, it was  chance.  Pretty creepy!	1999-05-05

And there's something else--a sense of hope for their future.  Jen is  a basketball player with a horrible secret.  Dylan is an athlete training  to be an &quot;Ironman&quot; who witnessed his brother Preston's suicide.   Stacy was Preston's girlfriend with some surprising problems of her own.

I think Coupland owes me not only my $13, but the 3 hours of my life I spent on this nightmare of a novel. The main problem with this book can be summed up in the old debate of showing vs. telling--instead of TELLING us  (over and over and over again) what's wrong with today's world, he needs to  do a lot more SHOWING--through actions of the characters and even little  throwaway details, not through long, tedious passages of dialogue.  The  book starts promisingly enough with, natch, a girlfriend in a coma.  However, this promise quickly deteriorates into didactic speeches on the  part of Coupland, through the poor coma victim, on the decay of our society  into anarchy, decadence, and nihilistic behavior disguised as technological  advances.  I think Coupland intended it to be a call to arms for all of us  to start a revolution, but it just comes across as self-righteous and  hypocritical (I don't see DC doing much to change the world besides spew  out nightmares like this novel!).

Kerr was criticized for her unrealistic dialogue and portrayal of the black characters, but I still think this book is wonderful.  Its theme is, natch, love, and how it can change you so much  that people don't even know you (or, you become a missing person).  Suzy  watches everybody around her falling in and out of love, and how they  change as a result, from Miss Springer, her library supervisor, who has  nurtured her love for a man who left town thirty years ago, to her father,  falling in love with a woman only a few years older than Suzy herself, to  her sister Chicago, who breaks all taboos (this book was published in the  seventies) by falling in love with Suzy's co-worker's black boyfriend.   Some of them change for the better because of love (Chicago, for example,  develops a focus in life and becomes less reactionary just for the sake of  attention), some worse (Suzy's father treats his child bride like, well, a  child), but everybody becomes a missing person to Suzy.  I loved the theme,  and I think this book is really an underappreciated work of M.E. Kerr's!   Anyone wishing to dicuss M.E. Kerr with me, please feel free to email!	1999-03-04

I adored &quot;A Home at the End of the World,&quot; except for its ending that betrayed me.  And I was so impressed with the way Cunningham wrote from a woman's point of view in &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; (one of the  best contemporary male writers to do this, in my opinion). So when I saw a  new book by MC, all three main characters women, and paralleling Woolf's  novel Mrs. Dalloway, how could I not jump for joy? The plot(s) is/are  simple:  Clarissa, nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway, is having a party for one of  her dearest friends, who won a prestigious poetry prize (and is also  suffering from AIDS).  Meanwhile, Virginia Woolf is currently in the middle  of Mrs. Dalloway, plotting how it will end. Seemingly unrelated is the  story of Laura Brown, a housewife in the '40s (I guess I didn't read that  part carefully enough, or else it's a testament to MC's talent that I  didn't realize she wasn't living in the 90s), and her struggle to make  peace with her life.  Alas, I found the Clarissa character irritating,  self-centered, and generally a bore.  The Virginia Woolf character was at  first more interesting, but after awhile I realized all she ever did was  plot to kill Mrs. Dalloway and pine for the great London.  The most  fascinating (and well-written) of the three was Laura Brown, but the end of  her story just smacked of tying loose ends together.  I did enjoy trying to  put together how the book paralleled Mrs. Dalloway (down to Mrs.  D's/Clarissa's former lover Peter/Louis visiting her on the day of the  party, announcing he was in love, and bursting into tears), but all in all,  it was a grand disappointment.  If only Michael Cunningham would return to  the promise of his earliest (well, the earliest in-print) book!	1999-01-19

The end is a crashing disappointment, however, and I still feel betrayed in  retrospect (melodrama again), which is why it only gets 4 stars.

However, the first 2/3 reads beautifully, almost like a  great American tragedy, and the mysterious note on which the Dick/Perry  account ends pre-killing (&quot;Presently, the car crept forward.&quot;   Next chapter: finding the bodies) has stayed with me 10 years after my  first reading of the book.

I first read this book when I was 14 (what were my parents thinking?) and have read it generally once or twice a year for the past 11 years.  I think the reason this book is so fascinating, not just to me, but to so many  others, is because it combines so many elements:  1) A gruesome multiple  murder, 2) The victims were (mostly) famous, 3) The murderers were young,  and mostly women, 4) They took place in the &quot;make love, not war&quot;  hippie era, and 5) The murderers were part of a &quot;cult&quot; which  fascinated people--how could someone be ordered to kill, and actually do it  willingly, joyfully?  The last part of the book, which details the origins  of Manson's philosophy (Bugliosi speculates at least in part from a group  known as The Process), is a little boring, and I've since read other books  that suggest the motive is less fanciful than &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;  and more ordinary, like perhaps robbery, but hey, the book would be a lot  less incredible if it were something so everyday. Very absorbing and highly  recommended.	1999-01-14
