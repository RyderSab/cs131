It's like the author was trying a little too hard to make a group of unrelated short stories hang together. However, this shouldn't stop you from reading this book. It's phenomenal and the strengths more than make up for the weaknesses.<br />This is one of the books that once you read, you'll want everyone you know to read so you can have someone to talk about it with.	2004-07-13

Blech. The sisters were snotty, pretentious, brats who were butting their noses in a place they didn't belong. I had no sympathy for them at all, I didn't care what happened to them. It's hard to enjoy a book wheen the whole time you're shouting at the characters to stop being babies and start acting like adults.	2004-04-20

If you like the \\"Go Ask Alice\\" type of thing, this is the book for you. I didn't care for that one either. The whole time I was reading \\"The Torn Skirt\\" I kept thinking to myself, 'is this repetitive melodrama or is it just me?'	2003-09-21

I've loved Coupland since the Gen X/Shampoo Planet days, but was most underwhelmed by Ms. Wyoming and All Families. But Hey Nostradamus! is fabulous. Coupland gives us a handfull of characters, each one more imperfect than the next and all of them you can care about, especially Jason. This is one of his best.	2003-07-04

I found the jumpy narrative a little distracting-- why did Audrey and Slip get to talk in first person while Merit, Faith and Kari were left to third person? Often times the book fell into cliched sterotypes and some of it was pretty damn predicatble, but it's an entertaining read nonetheless.	2003-03-20

Vowell's voice is easy-going and fun, and it's like she's sitting on the couch telling you all about the lunchroom in the caves and teddy roosevelt and shooting hoops. This book's entertaining, if not neccessarily earth-shattering. Her essay about post-Sept 11th flag-waving is worth the price of admission.	2003-03-09

At first, I wasn't so sure. I finished the book awhile ago and now that I'm sitting here trying to recount it, my heart's pounding a little bit, I'm getting excited and I want to quickly and excitedly tell you all about all the good parts. About the Jumping People, and the old lady, and the taxi-cab chase, and the Rock You Like a Hurricane, and the Estonian, or was it Latvian?, hooker.<br />Read this book!<br />Read this book if for nothing else to listen to Eggers talk about dancing with girls at a junior high dance. Read the book so you can put into context the wonderful line, \\"Put that heave into a small Velcro pocket in the parachute pants of your soul.\\"<br />Read the book and ignore the fact that it seems to be about Eggers' own guilt over having made so much money off the tragedy of his life. Read the book and ignore that it probably could have been better edited. Read the book, please, so I can have someone to talk about it with.	2003-03-09

But as I read it, I grew increasingly disappointed. There was none of the captivating, imaginative magic that was all over Ella Minnow Pea.<br />Welcome to Higby is just OK. The charcaters are intersting, the plot horribly predictable. The whole book is surrounded by this sort of Fried Green Tomatoes feeling, but not as compelling.<br />I'd sum it up as a sit-com of a book. Interesting enough to capture your attention while it's in your hands, but once you finish it, it's gone from your memory.	2002-11-10

It plods a bit, but the characters are interesting. The characters are so good, you kind of wish they had more to do, more life in them. But not so. I'd suggest reading this if you were at the bottom of the reading pile.	2002-09-03

I fell for it and boy do I feel like a fool. The Nanny Diaries is boring, predictable tripe. If you're in the mood for a totally brainless read where you can predict each plot twist chapters before it happens, get this book. If you don't like heavy, ham-handed foreshadowing and cardboard, cookie-cutter characters, skip it and read something good like The Chesse Monkeys by Chip Kidd.	2002-08-17
