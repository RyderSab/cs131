The information is quite good, though not very in depth. The examples are good, as they explain, \\"See, this really *can* be used in 'real life'.\\" There is also some programming information, so for some parts (nothing critical, just program design), a knowledge of C is useful. Personally, this is my first book on steganography, so the technicality of the information was at a good level (informative, but not buried in jargon or advanced math). I have no programming background, but skipping the program designs was not a detriment in any way. <br /> <br />However... I think the editor should be bludgeoned once or twice with something heavy. I have written some documentation, and the editor did things that I know never to do. First, there are a few grammatical errors, which cause serious problems if you are not paying attention. (In one example, it is said the user (I don't have the book in front of me) \\"attaches her private PGP key, encrypts it with [the other's] public PGP key, and sends the email\\". This is after saying many times \\"NEVER EVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE PGP KEY!!!\\". Then, the example goes on to say the recipient \\"uses the public PGP key, which is attached...\\". (The first sentence should have read \\"public PGP key\\"). In addition to one or two other situations like this, there is also an issue with the inline images. They all appear only at the top and bottom of the page, while the author clearly intends for some to be in paragraphs. The author says things like \\"as seen in this image:\\", but the sentence continues, and \\"this image\\", the number of which is not given, is elsewhere on the page. Further, many images have the eight resize anchor points and thick border visible from screen shots; these should have been Photoshop'ed out (it's not that hard, I've done it with Paintbrush). <br /> <br />If you are looking for advanced work, skip this. For a basic work, I would give it five stars, but the editors errors are so bad....	2004-12-23

For someone familiar with the Windows or Mac OS, much of this book can be skimmed through. The authors assume you know how to turn on a computer, load a CD, and use a mouse, but not much else. For some users, this is perfect, though I do not know if users like this would be venturing into Linux-Land. The most important point in the first half of the book is &quot;WRITE DOWN THE ROOT PASSWORD; DO NOT LOOSE IT&quot;. That is the Golden Rule for all UNIX based OS's. Otherwise, the book's information is good. There are a few typographic errors, but nothing major. I was hoping for something a bit more advanced, but this is the only thing I could find. One very useful tidbit is you can set the Click-N-Run to save to the local drive, which for some reason (according to the book) is not on by default. This lets you download the CNR files once, which is a blessing if you use a modem.	2003-12-24

The book is an overflowing fountain of information about Polynesian, Austronesian, and Papauan languages. It is written in a similar style to the Cambridge Language Survey books, though it is shorter and written in a colloquial style designed for those with only a basic knowledge of linguistics. (This is not to say the information is simplistic. Lynch starts with rather basic explanations, and then jumps into a massive amount of comparative linguistic data.)<br />The book also goes beyond the scope of grammar sketches. It starts with a history of the Pacific region. It then discusses commonalities of the Pacific languages. Next come chapters dealing specifically with each of the three languages families (above). He then discusses the development and current use of pidgins, including Tok Pisin, Bislama, and Hiri Motu (including where the name \\"Hiri Motu\\" comes from). Following this is material on cultural use of language: politeness registers, gender registers, kinship terms, areas of social importance, etc. Lastly, he discusses language shift, death, and revival.<br />Overall, this is an excellent work for anyone who has any interest in Polynesian languages. As I said, I will probably read it again next year so more information can sink in.	2003-06-13

I found these books used, and bought them to start re-learning Latin. I am much more familiar with the first two books (they were the textbooks for years 1-3), but I looked through this one.<br />From what I could see, it is much lighter on grammar than years 1&amp;2. Year 1 is most of the fundamentals of grammar. Year 2 introduces the demonstratives, subjuntives, subordinate clause structures, etc. <br />In year three, hands-on translation is the focus. Most of the chapters start with long translations. While translations in years 1 &amp; 2 are usually a half page to a page, many of these are two or more pages. They are almost all classical Latin authors, being exceprts from the original texts. (Year 2 had a few exceprts from Pliny and Julius Caesar [&quot;Omnes Gaules sta in tres partes...&quot; Yeah, you know what I'm saying.], but not much.) The grammar is much lighter than before. Some things are explained, but the grammar is mostly unusual clause structures and poetic forms, along with lots of vocabulary. (A Latin&gt;English dictionary is HIGHLY recommended at this point.)	2003-05-08

I have very fond memories of the class (my first foreign language class), and learned quite a bit about grammar. I still remember some of the lessons.<br />The book is good. It is not always clear, and tries to explain things on the level of a high-school student. There are times that a linguistic explanation would be much simpler, but it's a school text book. It seems a bit slow at first, and I would order some things a bit differently. However, Latin is a *highly* inflected language, so there really isn't a simple place to start. The book does its job quite well, and I'm very happy I found it again to re-learn some of what I once knew.	2003-05-08

I have very fond memories of the class (my first foreign language class), and learned quite a bit about grammar. I still remember some of the lessons.<br />The book is good. It is not always clear, and tries to explain things on the level of a high-school student. There are times that a linguistic explanation would be much simpler, but it's a school text book. <br />The second book seems a bit more rushed than the first. Much more grammatical &quot;nitty-gritty&quot; is in the second book. I think the author assumes a level of familiarity after one works through the first book, and picks up the pace a bit. Sometimes this leaves things a bit &quot;less than excellently&quot; described. However, overall, I think the book did a good job. I was very happy to find the series so I could start re-learning Latin (eventually...).	2003-05-08

If you are a novice to linguistics or just curious, this book is excellent. It covers a broad range of subjects, avoids heavy use of technical jargon, and gives explanations that anyone can follow. The information is clear, well explained (not just &quot;It's like this because it is because I said so.&quot;), and entertaining.<BR>If you have already been doing some reading in linguistics, this book may be a bit simplistic. While I found parts interesting, much I already knew. In other cases, since similar arguments are in many works about linguistics (see &quot;Teach Yourself Linguistics 5e&quot; for much more detail than this book), as soon as the argument started, I could figure out the rest faster than it was explained. So, if you have some background in linguistics, this book is good for either (1) light reading, or (2) good explanations to use when people present the misconceptions described in the book.	2003-03-14

What I particularly liked was that each section was not just a dry listing of comparative morphosyntax between the different Germanic languages. Robinson starts each section with at least a few pages of history. This way, you can see what the people did, where they were, where they went, and with whom they interacted. He also treats each language as a dynamic construct in a dynamic environment, rather than something that just popped into existence in a vacuum. He makes a point at the end to discuss language features that occurred late due to social contact, or in some cases conquest.	2003-02-10

If you do not own \\"Inferno\\", this can be read alone. However, the two are part of the same vision of Hell.<BR>Third, while this book has slightly less content than \\"Inferno\\", it's still excellent. The artwork is inspired and haunting. The demons have an organic feel that makes them look real. They also have the remnants of their angelic heritage. Whereas \\"Inferno\\" is Barlowe's travels through Hell, focusing on people, places, and \\"beings\\", this book focuses on beings in the hierarchy of Hell, from officers to demons to fallen souls.	2003-01-28

It deals with very realistic issues, namely &quot;how do we communicate with an alien intelligence that is *truly* alien?&quot; It explores issues of humanity and sentience.<br />The story is quite different from the recent movie, by the way. While the movie ended up being a rather good love story, the book has more things to think about.<br />Perhaps the only problem with the book is that it's influenced by Russian literature. It is very &quot;deliberate&quot;, which to an American can sometimes seem to be &quot;plodding&quot;. There are a few slow parts. The book is not in a rush to reach its conclusion.

The first chapter is split between two people, while each of the other chapters is a “time in the life of” one of the characters. The chapter breaks sometimes feel a bit jarring, as the reader has to figure out how much time has passed since the last chapter. <BR>   The book is not gallant, romantic, or exciting. It’s simply real. It focuses on small details, like the loss from the death of cats or army ants on the ship. It also focuses on the psyche of each character, so that each character is eventually quite richly fleshed out.<BR>   The use of Esperanto is nice, and it was fun practice for me. <BR>While I would recommend it, my only two problems with the book were the sudden shifts in time, and the fact that the author sometimes focuses on very odd details. Otherwise, it’s probably one of the most realistic portrayals of life aboard a generation ship, and the psychological effects on the colonists, in print. (I think one of the most interesting parts was a dialogue about the sky.)	2002-12-26

It is packed full of information about Arabic verb conjugations and other grammatical information. The information is very spartan (the basic tenses, past and present, are pages 13-18), but it will show or remind the reader how things are supposed to work. It is an excellent companion to learning Arabic, or good for those with a background in languages who are curious &quot;how Arabic works&quot;. However, if you are just starting other books like &quot;The Arabic Alphabet&quot; or &quot;Teach Yourself Arabic Script&quot;, this book will go right over your head.

I read it twice the first month I had it. After lending it out to several people, I bought four additional copies as loaners and gifts about two years ago. I now have my original copy and one extra.<BR> I and everyone I have lent it to have found this book incredibly thought provoking and informative. It starts with the old testament, discussing old Judaic notions of love, marriage, family, inheritance rites (including an interesting section on the legal ramifications of adultery), and most importantly, the purity codes of Old Testament Kashrut Law. \\"Questionable\\" words are presented in the original Latin, Greek, and occasionally Hebrew, with notes on how nuances and meanings changed as words went from Hebrew and Jewish Aramaic to old Greek to Latin and then to English. It refers tothe original languages, and so points out things like a same-sex union makes a person just as unclean before God as eating shellfish, since the exact same phrase is used to condemn both.<BR> The new testament section deals with early Christians trying to find their own identity as a separate people from the Jews. Homosexuality was a relatively minor issue compared to keeping Kosher, circumcision, and if you had to become a Jew before becoming a Christian.	2001-10-22

A modern \\"abstract art\\" remake of Bantock, and not as good.

Very good if you just want to spell out Arabic signs, know a \\"little something\\" about Arabic (for those with an amateur interest in philology or linguistics), or you just think the script looks cool. Also very good as a companion to \\"Teach Yourself Arabic Script\\". I've had to put my study of Arabic on hold (unfortunately, but I'm going back to college for linguistics classes). I used both, and think this one should come first. It has some information on ligatures (I think it was one page) and bare minimal information on handwriting (two pages) and grammar (scattered about). However, it fulfils its goal in very little time and space with some good side information. You learn the alphabet, and most importantly, vowels and other markers (the no-vowel and double-consonant markers). Some other books don't bother with these markers since they are not used in normal print or handwriting. I found that I was able to remember pronunciations of vocabulary much more easily if I could add the vowels. There is also a respectable amount of vocabulary. It is mostly geared towards reading the Koran or newspaper. However, since there is almost no grammar, and therefore no grammatical exercises, one must resort to rote memorization (which I found rather difficult) if one wishes to retain any vocabulary. <BR>So, definitely start with this book. However, don't stop here if you want to know more than the basic script. \\"Teach Yourself Arabic Script\\" has more information on handwriting forms (some are a bit different), ligatures (common in handwriting), and enough basic grammar to make sense of signs and newspaper headlines.	2001-10-20

It was fascinating, and unlike &quot;Reading the Past&quot; (also very good), the information on various language families and regions of the world is interconnected. <BR>   My only criticism is that the book is in bad need of an editor. While Coulmas presents a great deal of information, he has a rather noteable tendancy of belabouring a point and rambling on and on. (He beats dead horses well past death and decomposition.) The untranslated quotes in French are a bit frustrating, and his penchant for quoting Greek seems a bit overdone. The book could easily be edited to two-thirds its size and not loose a single jewel of information.	2001-10-20

I was using this along with \\"The Arabic Alphabet\\" (by Awde and Samano). Personally, I'm finding it easier to go through the other book first, as Awde and Samano's book is very concise, and gives stroke direction. This book is useful, but the script (printed and handwritten) is very small, and the handwriting is a bit \\"simplified\\" and \\"spartan\\". The handwriting in the book is true to form for \\"real\\" Arabic handwriting. However, being an introductory book, I think the author should have made the print larger, and given large, clear examples for the student.<br />Another critique is that the author rarely uses vowels. The author does this because someone going to an Arabic-speaking nation or picking up an Arabic newspaper will never see these (except on foreign names). He does not want to make the student dependant on these.  However, from my experience, learning the pronunciation of the vocabulary was much easier if I could add in the vowels, and so I was able to learn words much faster.<br />The information seemed very good, but was quite basic. This is NOT a guide to speaking Arabic. It's goal is to familiarize the student enough to read common signs and warnings, tickets and schedules, bills and checks, and as the author puts it, \\"read a headline and get enough from the article to know what's going on.\\"  It's an introductory book, and as that, it serves its function well. It is also a good resource for understanding handwriting, which, as stated earlier, is a very \\"simplified and spartan\\" version of the formal script.	2001-10-20

It has some information on ligatures and bare minimal information on handwriting or grammar. However, it fufils its goal in very little time and space with some good side information.	2001-10-20

As others have said, this book really isn't a useful dictionary. However, as a phrase book, and quick language reference, it's great. If you plan on buying this, I highly recommend getting an actual translation dictionary to go with it. Still, the sample telephone answering machine recording is on my voice mail....<br />Tiel alioj diris, cxi tio libro ne-estas vere vortaro utila. Ankoraux, tiel fraz-libro, kaj tiel referenco rapida lingva, gxi estas belega. Se vi planus acxeti cxi tion, mi rekomendegas ankaux acxeti vortaron efektivan tradukan. Ankoraux, la provajxa telefona mesagxo estas uzata je mia vocx-posxto.	2001-05-03

I enjoy the blend of technology, religion, archetypes, and a ghost. While some elements, like the Vatican order, seemed a bit out of place or \\"thrown in\\", the character development is superb.	2000-09-29
