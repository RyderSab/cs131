US	51680733	RW61UUZ3CQPLZ	080214117X	981529853	Ten Little Indians	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A real gem!	All the stories in this book have Spokane Indians as main characters, but the stories are really about all of humanity, with its humor, tragedy, cruelty, and redemption.  Every story made me laugh at some point, and every story touched me deeply at some point.  The characters have to deal with poverty, others' preconceptions, their own deeply held stereotypes, good luck, bad luck, and just life in general.  One homeless man tries to find $1000 to buy back his grandmother's pow-wow regalia.  Another man honors one parent's death by giving up basketball and the other's death by taking it back up in middle life.  Every highly readable story grabbed me from beginning to end.  This is the first book I've read by Alexie, but it won't be my last.	2005-10-08

I'm a casual birdwatcher, but not very good at listening to their songs.  I learned how to really listen to birds and read sonograms, but I learned so much more.  The passion Kroodsma conveys for his field of studying birdsong is contagious.  He describes each set of experiments almost in memoir form, describing the scene and his feelings and posing the questions that pop into his mind even as his first questions are answered.  For a scientist to still have such a sense of wonder and poetry about his field after 30+ years of study is truly a gift.  We get a glimpse into how the scientific method works as well as what the method has shown us about birdsong over the years.   <br /> <br />I had only two problems with the book, but it was otherwise so overwhelmingly wonderful that I didn't dock it any stars.  I found the CD a little cumbersome to listen to as I read, so I read the book first and then listened, which was not ideal.  Also, he flubbed some easily-checked facts about the northern cardinal.  He left out my home state of Indiana and also Missouri (at least) when he listed the states that have the cardinal as their state bird.  And I'm quite sure that the Cardinals football team had already moved to Arizona by the time he wrote the statement that St. Louis' sports teams were named for the bird.  But then again, when you spend every morning (and sometimes all night) listening to birds, maybe you don't have time to check such trivia. <br /> <br />I wish I had more time to listen to the CD over and over and review the stories and experiments that go with each recording, but my book queue is long, and they all have due dates at the library.  This may just be one of those books I break down and buy.	2005-09-05

I picked this book up after reading a review of the 10th Stephanie Plum novel, and being a systematic person, I figured I needed to start at the beginning.  What a treat!  I'm so glad there are so many Plum books to look forward to! <br /> <br />Evanovich gets Plum's neighborhood just right: a blue-collar enclave where people stick around after growing up and where your old classmate's mother threatens to tell on you to your mother, even though you're quite grown up.  I grew up in such a neighborhood!  And Plum's character reflects the place she calls home: tenacious and sassy, but also naive and inept at the same time.  The other characters are well fleshed out and just as interesting. <br /> <br />The plot takes Ms. Plum from one unbelievably dangerous yet wacky situation to the next, as she learns the ropes of the bounty hunter business.  She meets obstacle after obstacle and mortal danger, but they just make her more determined to get her man.  Oh, her empty refrigerator and rusty car help motivate, too. <br /> <br />I am very much looking forward to seeing how Ms. Plum advances in her stumbled-into field of work!	2005-08-27

He claims that, as of the writing of this book, there have been four books on annuities, and he's written three of them.  Ugh. <br /> <br />First, the positive, because there's almost always something positive.  The green ink they used for the print is very easy on the eyes.  And I did manage to learn a little about the very confusing world of annuities. <br /> <br />But that's about it for the positive.  The book was not very clearly written or organized.  Some sections didn't seem to pertain to the chapter title.  The examples were mostly un-helpful.  So to make up for his lack of clarity, the author resorted to repetition, which only made matters worse. <br /> <br />The other thing that bothered me was how gung-ho the author was about annuities.  I almost felt like I was reading a sales pitch rather than an educational book. <br /> <br />Maybe annuities really are so confusing that no one can make them clear.  If that's the case, then maybe this author shouldn't have even bothered.  (He probably shouldn't have bothered regardless, because he's hopeless as a writer.)  You might get something from this book, but I'd advise against actually buying it.	2005-08-26

That's part of its problem, I think.  It's just too broad to be of much use.  Another problem is they've consulted various experts in each chapter and, inevitably, one person's advice contradict's another's (hang everything in your closet including sweaters to keep it neat; never hang sweaters -- they'll get those pointy things on the shoulders). <br /> <br />Some advice was kind of nifty, such as hints on how to use natural items for cleaning.  Some was rather obvious, such as suggesting you run cold water when you run your garbage disposal.  Some was just goofy:  I'm not going to put avocado in my hair and then rinse it down the drain!  I'd need the plumbing section to help me out of that mess! <br /> <br />Check the book out of the library if you're interested.  I found a couple of things I could use, but I mostly found it quaint.	2005-08-23

Otherwise, you might not find it very useful. <br /> <br />The book does have some hints that I found helpful, especially in the section on home remedies (the things you can do with vinegar!).  Also, some hints on saving money were sensible, if obvious (if you don't read a magazine, quit your subscription -- sounds obvious, right?  If only I could follow that advice...)   <br /> <br />But for the most part, I didn't find much I could use.  For example, instead of simply saying \\"have a garage sale and advertise for it\\" as an idea to make some cash, they give five or six ideas for advertising for a garage sale, some of which are just absurd (eg, painting footprints on the sidewalk leading to your house). <br /> <br />Some advice just seemed ill-advised to me, such as using your 401(k) as a savings vehicle for college or a first-time home.  Sure, you're allowed to tap it for those purposes, but you shouldn't plan it that way! <br /> <br />And a lot of the advice just seemed to lead you down the road to a more cluttered life, for example, the tip to fill a 5-gallon bucket with sand and motor oil to clean off the metal parts of your gardening tools.  How are you supposed to dispose of that properly?  Who's got space for a bucket of oily sand?  Ugh. <br /> <br />If all the examples I've cited really excite you, then by all means, buy this book.  Otherwise, just check it out of the library.  Or just check it off your to-read list altogether.	2005-08-18

What kind of person are you, and therefore, what kind of puppy is best for you?  What kind of care should you give your puppy (food, equipment, veterinary care, training, emotional care...)? <br /> <br />Unlike other books I've read recently on the subject, this one spends very few pages on training, and is rather vague in that area.  That's OK; the mission of this book seems to be different from the others.  The book spends lots of space discussing the temperaments of different breeds, which was interesting; the history of interaction of dogs with humans, which was probably not very scholarly; and how your life will have to change to take care of a puppy, which contained some good and some not-so-good advice, but which provided plenty of food for thought. <br /> <br />The advice was mixed; some of it seemed to be dated (for example, there is no longer any controversy about the usefulness of crates for housetraining and general staying-out-of-trouble) and some seemed to run counter to other experts' (for example, stating that in some cases, a dog might need to be tapped with the brush end of a broom to reprimand him!!!!).  But the style was easy-to-read and humorous in places.  Wouldn't be my top recommendation, but if you have no idea what life with a dog is like, it'd be worth a glance.	2005-08-11

It's basic, but probably something we don't always think about.  Essentially, what you can see is what sells.  So even if your wiring really needs updating, don't expect buyers to be wowed by that.  They expect it.  On the other hand, just cleaning up your yard (much cheaper) will result in much more of a \\"wow\\" factor. <br /> <br />Now for the various annoyances. <br /> <br />Grammar and usage:  I'm a word nerd, and when I see words used incorrectly or sentences constructed poorly, it kind of pokes me in the eye.  My eye got poked a lot in this book (affect for effect, it's for its, in to for into...).  Oh, and in his introduction, he doesn't even address the parts of the book in the correct order; he has Parts Two through Four completely goofed up. <br /> <br />Telling us how clever and wonderful he is:  we keep hearing how great his company is, and just what that company's name is, just in case we forgot it.  We hear how much experience he has in the business, just in case we forgot how he explained it in the introduction. <br /> <br />NOT giving us 101 ways to increase the value of our home:  As the previous reviewer noted, the book is divided into 101 sections, but not all of them deal with home improvements, per se.  Examples:  Pros and Cons of Using Subcontractors; Licensing, Insurance, and Bonding Requirements; Appraisal Method #1 through #3 (each listed as a separate \\"home improvement\\")... <br /> <br />Not even writing much of a new book:  He constantly quotes directly from his previous books, listing the title, publisher, and year each time he does, so we can rush out and buy it, I guess.  Sometimes his quotes last for more than a page!  I would say at least 10% of the book is just direct quotes from his other books.  I'm sure glad I didn't read them!  Now I don't have to! <br /> <br />And the worstannoyance... going on and on and on to explain something any moron could understand instantly:  On removing junky cars, boats, etc from your property, he goes into this ridiculous analogy of trying to sell a dirty car to illustrate why the cleanup is a good idea.  On cleaning up the inside of your house, he rambles for two pages about how he chose a tree nursery based on the cleanliness of the place, then writes one paragraph about cleaning up your house.  He uses a makeover analogy (two paragraphs about women getting made up) to tell us why we should paint the interior.  He gives the helpful advice of putting seldom-used items on the top shelves of very tall cabinets (after he pointed out that tall cabinets might be a disadvantage to shorter people -- really?).  And did you know that a dining table and chairs are the main pieces of furniture in a dining room?  Very revealing!  I could go on (I really could; there were examples on almost every page), but I won't. <br /> <br />This book could have been a pamphlet and would have been just as useful.  The one good thing it did do is present some things you might not have thought about when deciding to improve your home.  Unfortunately, it also presented plenty of things that everyone already knows.	2005-08-09

Then the book lists types of collectibles in alphabetical order, giving a short history of the company or collectible, with values of some of the more valuable examples of each type listed. <br /> <br />Of course, such a book can't be completely comprehensive, but this one does give lots of resources (both books and individuals) for further study in each type of collectible.  It seemed very heavy on pottery and dinnerware companies, but did have a good mix of other items (toys, Coca-Cola items, political buttons...).  It's not really the type of book you should browse through from front to back, as I did, because it's just so overwhelming!  But I did learn a little that probably stuck with me. <br /> <br />The word nerd in me had to smile at all the misspellings and bad grammar throughout the book, but it's a minor point. <br /> <br />If you're into the collectible scene, but just starting out, this would be a good starting point for you.	2005-08-07

The author is careful to tell us that the many anecdotes he tells about his own dogs should be interpreted with caution, but that anecdotes can lead to careful scientific experimentation, which can give more substantial information. <br /> <br />The work is largely pretty scholarly and goes into the way other animals, including humans, Alex the parrot and the clever Hans (a counting horse), think and reason.  The author makes compelling arguments, using both anecdotes and experiments, for dogs' being able to show empathy, ask questions, respond, and perform several other high-order cognitive functions normally associated with only humans.  This makes sense when you realize that among all animals, dogs are the species that has been most influenced by human tinkering.  Dogs truly are adapted to living with us and being true companions. <br /> <br />And that was all well and good and very interesting.  But sometimes, the author makes some pretty wild stretches in interpreting his dogs' actions, for example, and states his interpretations as unambiguous, when they really didn't seem that way to me.  For a scientist, he doesn't always seem all that rigorous when it comes to his own dogs (who, by the way, as he himself admits, are ill-mannered). <br /> <br />Then right at the end he goes off on a wild tangent of how breeders should intentionally breed hybrid dogs from purebred stock (I'm a fan of the mixed breeds, but I've never heard anyone propose such a deliberate program to breed them) and even proposes developing talking dogs.  He didn't seem to be kidding!   <br /> <br />At the very end, he goes on a rant about using dogs in laboratory experiments.  I don't like it much myself, but he makes several misstatements about the practice.  Maybe in Hungary laboratories use dogs from shelters or stolen from loving families, butin the developed world, dogs for experimentation are bred for that purpose. <br /> <br />Finally, the translation from the Hungarian was often a bit stilted and odd.  Still, there was a lot of interesting information among the flakiness.	2005-08-04

This book is a collection of gaffes, puns (mostly unintentional), unfortunate typos, syntactical snafus, kids' use of language, and translational traps.  Some of the examples are riotously funny; others are just so-so.  Sometimes the number of examples overwhelms the brain's ability to appreciate them.  The introductions by Lederer before each chapter are cleverly written, but sometimes too much so.  (Example:  \\"Here's a sampling of English terrors and tinglish errors, the blood and thunder and thud and blunder...\\")  Ugh. <br /> <br />Finally, if you're going to make fun of English gaffes you find elsewhere, you'd better have a cadre of editors to make sure none of your prose contains errors.  This sentence, written by Lederer, poked me right in the eye:  \\"It is sometimes said that if something is perfectly true, then it's exact opposite must also be perfectly true.\\"  Apostrophe abuse! <br /> <br />Still, it was a very funny book, especially for a word nerd such as myself.  I definitely intend to look for Lederer's earlier works.  I love this stuff!	2005-07-24

This book contains short works by over 50 authors -- works that for whatever reason, they consider their best.  The choice of authors is very varied, from Scott Adams to Scott Turow to Arther Miller to Barbara Kingsolver to Anne Tyler.  Some authors I had heard of, others not.  The selections ranged from poems to cartoons to short stories to excerpts from novels.<br /><br />While the quality of the entries was uniformly good, I personally didn't like every selection, but that's only natural, of course.  Some favorites:  Scott Adams' Dilbert selection, T. Coraghessan Boyle's short story about a couple with acquisition disorders, Laurie Garrett's poignant and fascinating tale of Tay-Sachs disease in Cajun country, and Dan Rhodes' weird paragraph-long stories about fictional former girlfriends.<br /><br />I liked many of the other stories, too, so much so that the authors who wrote them are now on my to-read list.<br /><br />Almost as interesting as the selections themselves were the forewords to each selection by the author explaining why he or she selected the piece.<br /><br />If you don't want to expand your horizons and your to-read list, definitely pass this book up.  But if you do, read it and enjoy it as you would a sampler platter at your favorite restaurant.  It is truly a collection to be savored.	2005-07-23

I've read a couple of her books already, and those had non-overlapping information.  While this book has some new information because it was written later, it travels some of the same ground as the other books, albeit in a question-and-answer format. <br /> <br />Still, it's comprehensive and sensible advice.  The book covers everything from getting out of debt to investing in stocks, bonds, and annuities to what kind of insurance you need to making a will.  You might not agree with everything she says, but most of it makes sense to me.  If I read enough of her books, I might actually take some action on some parts of our financial plan.  The q-and-a format makes it easy to pick and choose what sections you need to read.  And there are little bits and pieces of advice that are not in the other books. <br /> <br />My advice would be to get this book out of the library, if you've already read some of Ms. Orman's other books.	2005-07-23

They all have slightly different advice, but many commonalities:  concentrate on praise, understand why your dog does what he does, take responsibility for your own mistakes instead of blaming the dog, give a command once and then teach/enforce/expect it -- the list goes on. <br /> <br />This book is very complete and very detailed.  It's written in a style easy to understand.  The advice is all very sound, including teaching you to know when you're in over your head. <br /> <br />What I liked:  the above-mentioned commonalities with other books, the advice to not make a big deal of certain things (encouraging fear by comforting your dog, for example), the assurance that it'll all work out OK if you do the right things (particularly useful to me as I'm working with a 12-week-old smart and headstrong furball), the advice to work obedience commands to focus your dog's behavior (tried this yesterday -- it was like a miracle!), and many other wonderful suggestions. <br /> <br />What I was less crazy about:  all the leash-popping.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll use it when our puppy gets older, but it just seems kind of excessive.  Also, I really don't see anything wrong with using food to motivate a puppy, especially one as active as ours, but Kilcommons discourages it, while not banning it outright. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great book and gave me much insight into my little puppy and much wonderful advice on how to turn her into a citizen of the world.  Read it along with several others (see my other reviews for more ideas) to tailor your lifelong training plan to your own dog's needs.	2005-07-13

She's smart and sometimes sweet, but very mouthy right now and very dominant.  After performing a muzzle grab on her, as described by Ms. Marlo, she quit biting and started licking.  It was like a miracle had occurred!  Yeah, I've had to repeat the lesson a few times, but it seems that our little puppy is finally accepting that we're the pack leaders. <br /> <br />Ms. Marlo's other advice on training puppies and dogs also seems very sound.  For example, it makes sense to me to use food as a motivator, at least at first, whereas other trainers say to use the dog's desire to please you as a motivator.  I like her advice on using crates for housetraining and generally keeping your new pup out of trouble.  Most of her tips on how to teach the basic commands seem right on.  Even her suggestion that you use instructive commands instead of \\"no\\" all the time (eg, leave it, off, sit...) makes sense, although I find myself using \\"no\\" frequently. <br /> <br />I especially like her insights into dog behavior, based on their natural pack roles, and how you can use these insights to communicate with your dog her role in your pack. <br /> <br />I'm not sure I agree with everything she suggests, however.  But I've read a number of books on dog training and dog behavior, and none agrees completely with another, and some disagree with each other vehemently.  Folks, just read several sources and use your own common sense with your own situation.  Be kind, be firm, and be consistent.  I would suggest this book as one of several you should read.	2005-07-10

Apparently some of the other books actually go into the history of the sin and some background.  This book is mostly tongue-in-cheek and is written in the form of a self-help book.  It is designed for you to become slothful yourself.  I found it very amusing and witty.  I especially like the digs Wasserstein gets in at self-help books, play-writing, and even the Oxford University Press.  Some of the humor is over-the-top, but the best gems are the sly ones, of which there are many. <br /> <br />I look forward to reading the rest of the books in the series.	2005-07-08

She's also very bright and is on her way, I believe, to becoming a lovely dog.  I've been reading a lot of dog training books recently, and they all have slightly different methods and angles.  But they all seem to have some common ground:  take time to bond with your pup; correct quickly and firmly and only when the pup is caught in the act; praise lavishly; know your pup's temperament; make it fun for the pup.  What this book also does is remind us all why we get a dog in the first place, what the pup experiences early in life, and how much of a commitment it is to allow that dog to become what we want her to.  What they might have said is that their methods work oh, maybe the 5000th time they're applied...  Patience and understanding must rule the day.  Whew.  Anyway, read this and many other sources (as the monks themselves recommend) and then use your own powers of observation to learn what approach will work best for your pup.  I'm still trying to figure that one out!	2005-07-07

Well, if you tell people lies, the FTC is going to step in.  The whole book is a paranoid rant about corporations, drug companies, the medical community, and government.  Oh, and as other reviewers have noted, the real juicy so-called \\"cures\\" are for sale on his website, not in the book.  (It's that darned FTC again!  Honest!) <br /> <br />Among the loonier statements in the book:  humans don't acquire body mass from the mass in their food; they get it from energy and sunshine, like plants.  Now it's been a long time since I took biology, but I'm pretty sure we don't photosynthesize.  Here's another:  the loving energy put into cooking your own food causes the electrons to spin in the opposite direction, giving the food a good energy.  Again, a long time since physics class...  OK, just one more:  All the statements of medical fact in this book are really opinion. <br /> <br />Other statements are more subtly crazy.  Some contradict one another.  Some are just misleading; others are downright dangerous.  He never cites sources on any of the so-called studies he claims prove the efficacy of the natural cures you never read about in this book. <br /> <br />His slant is so one-sided, you just know he's got an agenda.  Or more than one.  He's been wronged by the government, so he's lashing out in complete hate.  He's been cut off from ripping people off one way, so he's got to do it another way.  After all, as he says at least a hundred times in his book in reference to those he's attacking, it's all about the money.  Indeed.	2005-06-30

From reading this collection of his columns, I now know where he gets many of his ideas for characters and ridiculous plotlines.  Truth is truly stranger than fiction in South Florida!  Developers run amok, politicians are on the take from everyone, criminals of all stripes don't even bother to hide what they're doing.  Hiaasen exposes it all in his inimitably sarcastic way.  I did enjoy many of the columns and appreciated Hiaasen's skill.  However, most of the columns were from several years ago, with many of them being from the 80s.

This means lots of \\"cute\\" dialogue between Uncle Matty and the dog owners he's trying to help.  They even write in \\"stage directions,\\" that is, what's happening at the time. <br /> <br />And the instructions Uncle Matty gives us for the basic commands -- sit, stay, down, come, etc. -- are so complicated and convoluted, I'm not sure anyone could follow them!  \\"Here's how you hold the leash; here's how you do your feet; don't say the dog's name; say the dog's name...\\"  For crying out loud! <br /> <br />After I spent a couple days slugging through this book, I read \\"Good Dog:  Positive Dog Training Techniques\\" by Deborah Wolfe in a couple hours.  Her philosophy differs a bit from Uncle Matty -- no high falsetto, but lots of praise nonetheless, for example -- but the basics are there:  punish only if the dog understands and is caught in the act; follow it up with praise; state commands only once...  Her book was much more business-like and straightforward. <br /> <br />If you like Uncle Matty and want to read his cute-lame repartee wtih his guests, go ahead and read this book.  But if you just want to get down to the business of actually training your dog, look elsewhere.	2005-06-18

Her advice is clearly written and illustrated, with no unnecessary nonsense in between (as opposed to the Uncle Matty book I recently read -- see my review on that). <br /> <br />I've read several books on dog training recently (we had to put our dear old [and almost-perfectly behaved] dog down two months ago, and, yes, today we got a puppy, so I felt I needed a refresher), and I've noticed all have slightly different philosophies:  never say no; say no a lot; use treats; don't use treats...  But they all emphasize some basic premises:  don't say the command more than once, use the dog's name with the command only when it involves motion (heel and come), correct a dog only if he understands the command, be prepared to enforce a command every time you give it...  So I figure you should take those basic commonalities, and the rest doesn't matter as much. <br /> <br />Most of the things Ms. Wolfe advises I can accept.  I have to disagree with her on one point:  using isolation in the kennel as a means of correcting bad behavior.  The kennel shouldn't be associated with punishment in any way.  Although she compares it with sending a kid to his room -- and a kid's room is not an unpleasant place -- I think it might make the dog not like his kennel after a while. <br /> <br />Of course, this is me on the first day of a new puppy.  My tune might change later...  In any case, this is a really good book with good, solid advice, presented clearly and succinctly.  Maybe I'll report back when we've trained our own Wonder Dog.	2005-06-18

The authors give clear instructions and reasons for their practices.  For example, don't say \\"no\\" to your dog; tell him what you want him to do instead.  If he's jumping, say sit, for example.  Be consistent.  Reinforce commands.  Say commands only once.  I could give more examples, but you get the idea: sound, sane, and humane advice.  The advanced training sections started to lose me a bit.  I found them tedious after a while. <br /> <br />Although the authors are very experienced with all aspects of caring for dogs, I thought they were reaching a bit with their nutritional and medical advice.  They talked about homeopathic remedies as though they're proven treatments.  They're not.  Anecdotal evidence is not the same as statistically significant results from controlled studies.  Their opinion on vaccines seemed dangerous and unbalanced.  They have too much confidence in their alternative nutrition and treatment methods -- maybe they have some effect, but they're not perfect.  A well-fed dog could still get fleas and infections and communicable diseases.  After a while, they sounded like shills for the company that makes the supplements they use.  Finally -- and I hope you'll excuse the e-shouting, but I cannot emphasize this enough -- DO NOT FEED YOUR DOG RAISINS, EVEN FOR A TREAT!  Scientists haven't yet identified what it is about grapes and raisins, but they've been implicated in acute toxicity and even death in some dogs. <br /> <br />And as someone who makes a living from the written word, I have to say it seemed to me that the copy editor gave up on this book around Page 200.  The text in the last half of the book is full of typos, errors, and repetitive writing -- not repetitive as in emphasizing a point, but repetitive as in restating the content of one paragraph in the next.  Ugh. <br /> <br />The training advice was sound.  Read this book for that, and disregard the rest.	2005-06-17

Some of their off-the-cuff humor is actually funny, but much of it just gets in the way. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, they've compiled a decent collection of all the things we boomers need to think about as we near the end of our regular working days.  They ask us to think about why we want to \\"retire\\" (while shunning the word as sounding too much like withdrawing, which is not what a good retirement is about); they help us figure out how much we'll need; they remind us about such topics as health care, long-term care, caring for our parents, and estate planning. <br /> <br />Although much of the information was a bit vague (mainly because no one book can describe the best plan for everyone), I found many useful tips and resources (I've bookmarked dozens of websites) in every chapter, including the chapter on saving for your kid's college education, despite the fact that I have no children.  (I do, however, have nieces and nephews, who might just benefit from one of the tips...) <br /> <br />If you read this book, you should make sure you read other financial-type books too (Suze Orman and Jean Chatzky are two authors whose books I've liked, and I have one from Money Magazine in my queue), as differing viewpoints will empower you to discover what's right for you in your situation.	2005-06-12

The style was clear and breezy.  It read almost like a seminar.  The advice is clear and wise and sound. <br /> <br />However, what Bach tells us is so basic it's hard for me to believe that not everyone knows it:  enroll in a 401(k) plan if you can, in other retirement plans if you can't (or even if you can, in the case of also maxing out a Roth IRA); stay out of debt except your house; pay off your house early; make everything automatic.  What I've just written is the essence of the whole book.  He didn't need 200-some pages to tell us this! <br /> <br />Although the book is breezily written (making it easy to read in one day), Bach seems to have a superior attitude bordering on contempt for \\"most people.\\"  As in, \\"If you've read this far, congratulations!  Most people would have bought this book and never read it.\\"  Or, \\"Make it automatic or you'll never (write the check, pay off the house early, contribute to the 401(k))...\\"  Give us a *little* credit, OK? <br /> <br />But despite the fact that the book could have been much shorter and sometimes condescended to us, it contained plenty of inspiring examples of what investing just a little can do over the long term.  If it gets people started saving for retirement, then it's a fine thing.  But several aspects of financial health still need to be examined to have a complete picture:  estate planning, health care (including long-term care), life insurance... <br /> <br />So read this book to get you started if you haven't saved for retirement yet, even if you think you're too young to think about it (maybe check it out of the library...).  But read other sources to get a more complete picture.	2005-06-10

These five aspects are:  breakdown of communities, the tendency of universities to credential rather than educate, abandonment of the principles of science, distancing of taxing bodies from the people they serve, and breakdown in self-regulation and self-policing of learned professions. <br /> <br />Ms. Jacobs says that others might have picked five different aspects, and that these are just the ones that seemed important to her.  Although she does explain why repairing each aspect is important in preventing a new dark age, much of the book seems to be about things that seem important to her or empirical observations she personally has made.  There is little attempt to prove or substantiate any of her claims or to justify extrapolating her little observations to society at large.  She seems to ignore the scientific rigor she says is so vital.  After a while, she just kind of sounds like the elderly lady on the block who constantly says, \\"Back when I was a kid...\\" <br /> <br />Besides a lack of scholarly rigor, this book also seems to have a lack of crisp organization.  The book is divided into chapters, but Ms. Jacobs regularly colors outside the lines.  Combine that with her oddly punctuated, rambling sentences, and you do not have a recipe for readability. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, she does bring up some good points, particularly about not accepting commonly held notions at face value, about cherishing community, and about remembering where we all came from.  For that, she gets a couple stars.	2005-06-09

We readers learn all sorts of fun facts:  Rene Descartes had a thing for cross-eyed women; certain bugs pull in their legs when threatened so they resemble caterpillar poop; and so much more, some of it even useful.  And we also get to hear about what's going on in Jacobs' life:  his and his wife's attempt to conceive a child, his lame attempts to impress others with his new-found knowledge, his experience on a big game show, and all the people he met as a result of reading the encyclopedia.  Jacobs also throws in some stories about the dynamic between him and his father, he reflects on what true intelligence is, and wonders what his legacy will be.  Finally, he comes up with some dandy over-arching wisdoms he's learned from reading 44 million words, including the main theme from Ecclesiastes. <br /> <br />What a fun, funny, uplifting work!

The rest was unnecessary repetition and excrutiating detail of each step outlined in the first few chapters.  I agree with the reviewer who said this could have been a much shorter book.<br /><br />Also, maybe I'm just not the organizing type, but if I had all my lists with me so I could use every spare moment to do my next action items, I'd want someone to shoot me.  Sure, I usually drag a book or magazine along somewhere in case I'm stuck waiting, but just as often I'll daydream, watch people, or smell the roses (sometimes literally).  In a way, I believe this down time makes me a more productive person than someone who's always riding herd on his PDA (see Carl Honore's book In Praise of Slowness).<br /><br />Of course, I'm also not exactly an executive, nor do I aspire to be.

This book has more of the older poems by some cowboys who have long ago ridden off into the proverbial sunset, but also contains poems by some contemporary ranchers and cowhands. <br /> <br />What I like about this genre is that the folks who write the poetry are working ranchers, farmers, and cowboys.  Their poetry, therefore, is straightforward and rings true.  Reading some, you can almost taste the dust.  These folks have a hard life, yet one they love.  Yet they express themselves so beautifully that it sometimes brings a tear to my eye.  I'll take this kind of poetry over some of the weirdness you read in so-called literary magazines any day!	2005-05-23

This book begins and ends with the challenge issued by Frederick the Great of Prussia to Johann Sebastian Bach:  a 21-note theme designed to resist having the rules of counterpoint applied to it.  Bach was to improvise a three-part fugue on the theme.  When he accomplished this to the astonishment of all gathered, Frederick upped the ante:  make it six-part.  Well, that took a little longer -- two weeks -- and became the Musical Offering, a thirteen-movement rebuke-in-music to the king.<br /><br />The book probes deeply into the events leading to the challenge.  Bach, to the author Gaines, represents the Age of Faith, while Frederick represents the Age of Reason.  We learn all about the history behind these two ways of thinking about the world as well as each man's individual history.<br /><br />Besides being a book about Bach and about Frederick, this book delves into the structure of Bach's music and what he was trying to say with it.  It also explores the history of the Germanic states around the time of Frederick.  Toss in the influence of the church, philosophers of the time, scientists, thinkers, and musicians (including Bach's sons), and you have a rich story that goes beyond music, or rather, one that infuses music into every aspect of the universe (indeed, one of the theories of Bach's time was that the universe resonated with a perfect harmony).<br /><br />It's a book about the clash between two men who represented two different worlds, but it's so much more than that.  It's easy to read, impeccably researched, and even witty, and touched on so many topics -- religious, geopolitical, philosophical, as well as musical -- that I couldn't imagine just one book covering.<br /><br />I'm a musician myself (though somewhat of a hack).  I've played some of Bach's pieces, but never really appreciated what he was trying to say in them.  I'm looking forward to approaching them again with this new information.  My personal recording collection doesn't currently contain much Bach, but with the selective discography at the back of this book, you can bet that'll be changing!<br /><br />I've also visited Sanssouci (Frederick's palace in Potsdam, which is just as over-the-top as the book describes).

What makes her advice valuable is just how simple it is.  She doesn't ask you to go into a zone or count carbs or eat only one type of food.  If you eat less and move around more, you'll lose weight.  It's simple physics.  And if you do it in a way that doesn't seem like punishment, you're more likely to keep it up!  Simple. <br /> <br />The other valuable notion she writes about is that of mindfulness.  We need to pay attention to what we're eating and enjoy every bite.  And we should seek out quality foods, because the more we enjoy eating something, the more likely we are to be satisfied by it sooner. <br /> <br />I'll probably use some of the recipes in the book, too, as they do seem very simple and delightful. <br /> <br />My one problem with the book is the whole \\"French women this, French women that\\" theme, as though all French women have it all figured out and all American women are without a clue.  I know that's not the intent, but that's how it comes across after about 150 pages. <br /> <br />All in all, though, Mme Guiliano made me think about my own relationship with food, and for this I thank her.	2005-05-07

Barry Schwartz carefully lays out the argument that the number of choices we have today (from flexibility in where to live to how many types of jeans there are to the dizzying array of crackers in the supermarket) detracts from our enjoyment of the decision we actually make, for many reasons. <br /> <br />Many assertions made in the book are supported by well-regarded studies.  And we learn interesting concepts about types of decision-makers (maximizers versus satisficers -- those who must have the best versus those who know their criteria and stop their search when something meets those criteria), effects of making decisions (for example, the novelty of what we decide to do or get wears off, so the longer we took to make the choice, the more we're likely to regret it), and the effects of the number of choices presented to us on how, or even whether, we make a choice.  Everything is presented in a more or less easy-to-read style. <br /> <br />After a while, however, it seemed that I was reading the same thesis presented over and over, but in a slightly different context.  I was glad that he cut the manuscript down from the original (as he stated in the acknowledgements), because to me it still seemed unnecessarily long. <br /> <br />And then he makes kind of a blanket statement that our overabundance of choices is the root cause of our growing dissatisfaction with our lives.  While he admits that this is merely what he thinks, based on his review of studies on the subject, and while the thesis does make some sense, I think it's a little simplistic to lay the blame for all the malaise in our society at the feet of overchoice. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, it's an interesting concept that reinforces the old notion that you should want what you have rather than have what you want.	2005-05-04

I found the whole sad story very interesting. <br /> <br />A lot of reviewers of this book have written at length about Schlosser's scary descriptions of what goes on in fast food restaurants, at the slaughterhouses, and on the ranches in the preparation of food that over 90% of Americans (and much of the rest of the world) eat each week. <br /> <br />Sure, the stomach-churning truths of fecal contamination of ground beef, fast-food workers picking food up off the floor, and beef extract in the french fries are already enough to make a horrifying but fascinating narrative.  But for me, the more frightening story is how the fast food chains dehumanize us all:  the ranchers and farmers who get swallowed by conglomerates, the kids who are relentlessly marketed to, the workers in the meat-packing plants and the chains themselves, the cities ruined by sprawl, and even the franchisees of some of the chains. <br /> <br />My one contention with the book was how overtly Schlosser blames right-wing conservatives for most of this.  It's true -- they did push through much of the legislation that allowed the current state of affairs, but better to just present the facts and let us come to that conclusion ourselves. <br /> <br />What I liked about this book were the thoroughness of documentation in the 50-plus page Notes section of almost all statements made, and the suggestions on how we can fight back against the faceless megacorporations that, having lost their own souls, are trying to steal ours.  Presenting a problem is of little use if you don't also propose solutions. <br /> <br />Will I ever eat fast food again?  Oh, probably, if I must.  Will I always seek out other options first?  Even more than I already do, you betcha.	2005-04-30

Then I let it sink in, and it sort of inhabited all my cells and my whole psyche.  Reading it was pleasurable, but the delayed effects were even nicer.	2005-04-26

Books	2	27	48	N	N	How about you give us a break, John?	This book outlines John Stossel's journey from tireless consumer advocate to hard-core libertarian.  As someone with ideas that seem to run contrary to most folks', he seems to be used to the ridicule and resistance he encounters.  I'm usually very open to hearing all different points of view, but only when they're supported by convincing data.  Stossel largely fails to do that in this book.    If I cited every example of faulty logic, cherry-picking of data, contradictions, oversimplification, and sweeping generalizations, this review would be almost as long as the book.  Here are a few examples:    Stossel rails against junk science, but he seems to think it's bad only if it supports ideas he disagrees with.  If dioxin kills animals, well, it's never been shown to kill people, so how bad could it be?  And pesticides?  He says that farm workers and their families are exposed to very high levels without any problems.  I'm not sure all farm workers would agree with him, but I wouldn't know, as he doesn't cite any of the sources he seems to be quoting.  He says that tens of thousands of scientists have signed some document saying that there's no evidence of global warming, but he never says who they are.  Yet when he cites the \\"conclusion\\" of the EPA report of Ground Zero air quality (that the air is safe) to support his contention that asbestos isn't so bad, he never mentions that scientists originally concluded the air was not safe, and several quit in protest after being pressured to \\"soften up\\" their conclusions!    Stossel makes several \\"always\\" and \\"never\\" statements, as in privatization always works better than the government.  Then he picks out a couple of examples to support his statement, ignoring such examples as deregulation of energy in California, where the free market failed miserably.  In one part, he says we don't need all the regulations the government imposes on us, that in a free market, companies will self-regulate (naive, if you ask me), but in the section on lawsuits, he says that changes in policy (for example, that coffee shouldn't be so hot) should be made by legislation.    He devotes a couple of chapters to welfare, and how people should just go get jobs.  But he doesn't support paying a living wage to all workers; he thinks the market should sort all that out, and people should pay their dues in low-wage jobs and work their way up. Well, that's easy enough for Mr Smarty-Pants Journalist to say, but I'll bet he never had to try to support a family of four on Wal-Mart's meager dime and miserable benefits!  Furthermore, he doesn't even practice what he preaches!  He admitted, with some pride, to taking advantage of the federal flood insurance program when he built an oceanfront house.  He said he knew it was foolish to build there, but rationalized that if the government was stupid enough to offer a program of cheap flood insurance, he'd be stupid not to take advantage of it!  I always believed that if you weren't part of the solution, you were part of the problem...    Finally, when he says that free speech is being curtailed, it's only from the viewpoint of the left doing the censoring, in the name of political correctness.  Well, the right does plenty of censoring, too.  He should have seen the brouhaha here in Utah when Utah Valley State College invited Michael Moore to come speak.    I could go on, but I won't.  The tone of the whole book was very confrontational and nasty.  The complete lack of footnotes, the circular logic, the cherry-picking, and the absolutist attitude Stossel takes made most of his arguments very unconvincing.    To be fair, I did find his discussion on the drug war (and our miserable failure in it so far) compelling.    At the very end of the book, he redeemed himself somewhat, coming up with some fairly sane and reasoned solutions to the problems he sees.  Too bad it took him 270-some pages to finally start making some sense.	2005-04-25

Chagall was such a prolific artist that of course any book that is a complete catalog of anything he did, let alone lithography, would have to have small pictures or require a forklift.  Nonetheless, it's a pity that so many of the lithographs in this book are reproduced in a size not much bigger than a postage stamp. <br /> <br />And while I found the text and interviews at the front somewhat interesting, I thought parts of the interviews seemed like name-dropping exercises.  The book was originally written in French, I believe, and some of the translation throughout was unevenly done, if at all. <br /> <br />But hey -- it's Chagall!  To see page after page of his brilliant works is still a pure joy, even if you suffer eyestrain as a result.  And the many page-size reproductions were certainly treats for the eye.

She does give some useful advice to all, mostly women, but not only women, who have unexplained symptoms.  She reminds us that doctors are not gods, and we need to be active participants in our own health care.  Ask questions, get information, speak up!  For this, the book is very useful.    Drescher also does an adequate job describing her feelings as she goes through getting a diagnosis, undergoing surgery, and trying to recover.  This is also useful, especially when she tells women that recovering from a hysterectomy is a Big Deal!    Her writing is mostly breezy and entertaining; however, I found it at times whiny and self-serving.  She lapses into psychoanalysis a lot, which seemed a bit out of place.  She sometimes goes into way more detail than I think she needed to.  Some of her prose is a little rambling.  And she spends many pages saying, \\"Look at me -- I'm The Nanny!\\"    Nonetheless, she has written a very honest account of her brush with cancer.  It was brave of her to put herself out there, especially knowing that reviewers such as myself might find her a bit whiny.  Even if she's trying to remind us how fabulous she is, she seems sincerely to be trying to help people.  And for that, she gets three stars!	2005-04-20

Portuguese Irregular Verbs introduces us to Professor Dr Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, his colleagues, and the wonderful world of Romance philology.  This book is a collection of stories that have little to do with one another besides the fact that they're all light-hearted fun. <br /> <br />Dr von Igelfeld is always searching for the recognition he believes he deserves for writing the Very Important Work, Portuguese Irregular Verbs, which weighs in at some 1200 pages.  Along the way, he and his colleagues believe they can learn tennis by reading a book on it; he sets up a colleague in a fencing duel; he suffers great indignity at the hands of a less-deserving colleague; and he discovers why the Venetians keep making strange and mysterious references to the water. <br /> <br />Maybe none of this sounds funny on the surface, but it is, mainly because of the inner dialogue of the fussy academic.  It made me laugh out loud, and I wasn't even in a particularly jolly mood when I read this book. <br /> <br />It's a short book that can be knocked out in a long evening, which will give you plenty of time to read the other Professor Dr von Igelfeld Entertainments:  \\"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs\\" and \\"At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances.\\"  I recommend you read all three, in that order.	2005-04-19

Perhaps it's because there are only two stories in the novella, so each must be sustained over sixty pages or so.  Maybe it's the stories' length that makes them seem so much more improbable than the improbable stories in the other volumes. <br /> <br />Still, the misadventures of Dr von Igelfeld, once again experienced as a result of searching for that elusive recognition he believes he deserves (Did you know he wrote the master work, Portuguese Irregular Verbs?  It's the most important philological work of the last one hundred years, you know.), are very amusing.  He accepts a visiting fellowship at Cambridge, where a shadowy plot to overthrow the faculty government is brewing, as if worries over his (less-deserving) colleague taking over his office in his absence were not enough.  After that, he visits Columbia (the country), where he stumbles into yet another revolutionary plot. <br /> <br />Although I found this book the least amusing of the three Professor Dr von Igelfeld Entertainments, I still laughed out loud.  It's light-hearted.  It's short.  It's just fun.	2005-04-19

The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs picks up where Portuguese Irregular Verbs leaves off.  The books are not so much self-contained stories as they are collections of stories.  Hilarious stories about our protagonist, the Romance philologist Professor Dr Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, his colleagues, and their adventures in the arcane world of Romance philology. <br /> <br />Dr von Igelfeld finagles a visit to the US as a guest lecturer, as always, in search of the recognition he so ardently desires.  Unfortunately, the exchange program he worked with got him mixed up with a Dr Igelfold, who is in quite a different field of study.  Von Igelfeld bluffs his way through his lecture, but is then forced to operate on a sausage dog, with pretty gruesome results.  The dog becomes a main player in another story, this one of shadow and intrigue in the Coptic Church under the watchful \\"ten thousand eyes\\" of Rome. <br /> <br />And so it goes as we follow Dr von Igelfeld around the globe on misadventure after misadventure, as he tries to handle each sticky situation with Teutonic aplomb. <br /> <br />I laughed out loud, and I wasn't even feeling like laughing when I picked the book up.  Like the other books in this series (At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances is the third), \\"Sausage Dogs\\" is very short and light to read.  Make sure you read all three!	2005-04-19

The old man knows he will not see his young son grow up and hopes to impart in these letters all the wisdom he would have over the years as his son grew. <br /> <br />The preacher writes about love and grace, existence and theology.  But he also writes about his fears and weaknesses, his family history, how he came to marry such a young woman as the boy's mother, baseball on radio, how Gilead Iowa came to be, his concern over the friendship emerging between the boy's mother and the prodigal son of a fellow preacher.  In between the profound and existential, he also riffs on radio preachers and molded gelatin salads. <br /> <br />Marilynne Robinson's writing is once again lush yet spare, revealing her skill by not making a show of it.  She truly seems to have inhabited the soul of a Midwest preacher, showing us both his outer and inner life.  As I read this book, sometimes right before bedtime, I found myself dreaming about it.  Read it and it will become a part of you.	2005-04-17

It isn't.  Frances Kuffel examines instead her attitudes toward herself and others as she loses the weight, and how those attitudes shift, but don't really change, after she loses the weight.  She realizes that the one thing she thought would make her happy -- being thin -- is really only the start.  The whole self needs to be examined for true happiness to reside there.  I think that at the writing of the book, Ms. Kuffel was part way there -- realizing, for instance, that she has to love herself as well as others -- but she clearly still has a way to go. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have observed, Ms. Kuffel is not the most sympathetic character.  She looks down on others, but it's just a function of how she's looked down on herself all her life.  She's vain, but you try to be humble when you're a Size 10 for the first time in your life!  She doesn't know how to be with people, but it's partly because she'd been hiding behind her weight.  I think she'll get there, but what we read about in her memoir is a work in progress, with all the faults of a sad character.  I think Frances Kuffel was very brave to write such an unsparing memoir, and I hope it helps her as she continues her path to self-awareness.	2005-04-11
US	51680733	R22GX1SI4UAK4O	0060746874	829392802	Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and His Corporate Pals Are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy	Books	3	25	43	N	N	Would've been more effective without the name-calling	To me, much of this book sounded like what Robert Kennedy would like to say in his court cases against the \\"polluters\\" but can't.  Much of the time he just sounds like he's venting.  And that's too bad.  Because I do believe the Bush administration has done more to harm the world than any other administration.  I just don't believe that you make a compelling argument when you're hating on your opponents. <br /> <br />Kennedy's loathing of the administration and the corporations that line its pockets comes out in such terms as \\"polluter,\\" \\"lackey,\\" and \\"industry goon.\\"  He even calls right-wing radio hosts \\"hate jocks,\\" seemingly believing that it's hate speech only if the other side is using it.  I sure hope his courtroom arguments are more elegant!   <br /> <br />Another problem is the holier-than-thou stance he takes against those who would oppose him.  Scientists (funded by industry) who come up with findings that contradict global warming and other environmental woes are peddling \\"junk science.\\"  But the only way to refute junk science is with good science, and I don't see very much cited here.  Kennedy uses the old \\"everybody knows global warming is true/the glaciers are melting/all family farmers love the earth/whatever\\" argument, which isn't going to convince anyone on the other side of the fence.  Refute studies with other studies and tell us why the \\"junk\\" studies are flawed!  Also, cite sources other than those from NRDC or Sierra Club or other like-minded groups.  Otherwise, you sound like the cartoon character enviros from Michael Crichton's novel State of Fear, who blindly believe everything they're told (and, by the way, whose scientists are asked to change conclusions of studies when those conclusions seem to refute global warming!). <br /> <br />However, as I plowed through the book (and I almost did quit reading after the first 50 pages of bile, something I *never* do), I found that the tone settled to more of a rational listing of all the sins of the current administration:  filling agencies with former industry lobbyists, some of whom were still taking money from clients; forcing scientists to rewrite reports (Very Bad in my book); undoing 30 or more years of progress in cleaning up the environment; leaving chemical and nuclear power plants vulnerable to attack...  <br /> <br />The list goes on and on and is enough in itself to raise the ire of anyone.  What is happening now is truly nothing less than the highjacking of our democracy.  Should we be mad?  You bet.  Did we really need Kennedy to get mad to show us we needed to get mad?  Nope.  Just the facts would have been enough and would, in fact, have been more effective.  Still, get through the bile and the bias, and you'll find enough irrefutable facts to get you going, too.	2005-04-07
US	51680733	R3FWN5ZUQ4IHHW	0553375067	559651636	Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ	Books	2	16	19	N	N	Kind of interesting, but also disjointed and dubious	I read this book because it's one of those you hear a lot about and so you think you'd like to see what all the fuss is.  Daniel Goleman explores the differences in how people respond to their emotions:  whether they show empathy toward others or hostility; seek others' points of view or talk only about themselves; are outgoing or shy. <br /> <br />He then postulates that the reason some people seem to have more success in life is that they function more highly in these emotional (or as some reviewers have preferred, social) skills.  He says that these skills may have even more impact on how successful one is in life than one's IQ. <br /> <br />This is all well and good and seems to make sense.  But then the book devolves into reciting results from case studies and larger studies, with a lot of repetition and no real attention to the topic of the chapter.  Chapter titles seemed to be there only to let the reader know when it was OK to get a drink of water or turn out the light and go to sleep. <br /> <br />I also had problems with the descriptions of the studies.  How were group assignments made?  Did subjects choose whether to participate in a remediation program, for example, or were they randomly assigned?  The answer could point to bias.  What were the sample sizes?  Were the differences statistically significant, or just numerically different? <br /> <br />Finally, Goleman seemed to contradict himself at times.  For example, at one point he says that SAT scores are highly correlated with IQ.  Then he says that students who have high anxiety and cannot soothe themselves (thus signaling a deficit in emotional intelligence) do more poorly on SATs.  Well, which is it?  Also, he says that SAT scores do not correlate well with success in college, yet some of the same emotional skills that get you higher scores on your SAT should carry over to college, right?  When describing a state of flow -- the ability to focus so intensely on a task that you lose track of time and everything else; something he categorizes as a good skill -- he uses as an example young people who immerse themselves in studying music or chess or excelling at a sport.  However, some of these poor souls are very socially inept, except for their uncanny ability to focus on improving at their chosen passion.  I'm just not sure they should necessarily be held up as paragons of emotional intelligence. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, he brings up an interesting point.  We need to pay attention to the instant and emotional responses we have to situations.  We need to teach our kids that same self-awareness.  And then we need to respond from a place of empathy and kindness, rather than impulse and hostility.  I just wish he could have made his point in a more concise and convincing way.	2005-04-03

The basic story line of Sick Puppy is the series of events that occur after a relentless eco-terrorist pursues a serial litterbug (never mind that the hundreds of miles he puts on his black pickup truck in his pursuit have done more damage to the environment than the litter -- such is the intensity of his rage).  The litterbug turns out to be a slimy lobbyist trying to get a bridge approved.  The bridge will allow cement trucks and so forth to bring \\"progress\\" -- ie, high-rise resorts and golf courses -- to an unspoiled island. <br /> <br />Twilly Spree, the eco-terrorist, comes by his obsession honestly: his father was a ruthless coastal developer.  He's so over-the-top that you don't really find his lectures on the environment as annoying as you would if the character were earnest and virtuous.  The other characters are at least his equals as nutjobs: the former governor who wears nothing but a checkered-flag kilt and a shower cap; the hit man who favors seldom-laundered houndstooth suits and 911 dispatch tapes; the developer with a Barbie fetish... <br /> <br />The plot is even more twisted than the characters.  Twilly kidnaps the lobbyist's dog and wife (although the latter was the wife's idea) in an attempt to get the slob to stop littering.  When he gets wind of the bridge to Toad Island, his rage only grows.  Several people are out to get him, with characters crossing and double-crossing each other. <br /> <br />Sure, Carl Hiaasen does lecture us about the tragedy of the disappearing unspoiled land in Florida, and sure, his lectures border on sanctimonious.  But he feels passionately about the subject, and really, who can blame him?  And as I said, when the lectures are delivered by nutjobs, the medicine is easier to take.  This book was a laugh riot and will not be the last Hiaasen book I read!	2005-04-03

I could just stare at each one for many minutes and get more out of it with each minute!  The man was a genius.  And the plates are pretty high-quality, so it's easy to really enjoy them. <br /> <br />The only reason I did not give this book five stars was I thought it was a little short, considering the scope of Chagall's work.  It would be difficult, indeed, to produce a book that would be completely comprehensive, and maybe the author had a page limitation because of the series he was writing for, but I sure would have liked to see more works presented.   <br /> <br />I have some other books on Chagall in the queue:  one on watercolors and gouaches, and two books of lithographs.  I'll report back on those once I've read and gazed at them.	2005-03-31

What I like about this book and the other I read is how Suze tries to get at the root cause of how we think about money, talk about money, and act with our money.  Then we need to see whether these attitudes make us richer or poorer.  Do we need to adjust the way we think about money and about ourselves?  Because our thoughts influence our words, which influence our actions.  Do we need to de-clutter our physical and financial and emotional lives? <br /> <br />The second part of the book has lots of good practical advice and information on many things financial, from whittling down debt to everything you need to know about bonds, IRAs, and other things. <br /> <br />Finally, Suze wraps up by reminding us that respectful giving (that is, respect to both the causes we support and to our own needs) makes us much richer.  I consider myself pretty financially clever, and I've read quite a lot on the subject, but I still learned quite a bit, both on a practical and a spiritual level. <br /> <br />I thought there might be a lot of overlap between the two books, but there is not.  This is good and bad.  Good, in that if you did read all the books, you'd learn something new in each (she even refers to past books where subjects are covered more thoroughly).  Bad, in that if you buy the books, and want to get all she has to offer, you've got to buy them all.  I, of course, checked the books out of the library, which is something I'm sure Ms. Orman would approve of, even if it means she didn't make a sale.	2005-03-29

This book celebrates last year's 20th anniversary of that gathering, which, in 2000, was named by the US Senate \\"The National Cowboy Poetry Gathering.\\" <br /> <br />Contained between the book's two covers are some of the most eloquent, emotional, humorous poems you'd care to read.  Ranchers and cowboys (and cowgirls) write with an honesty and straightforwardness that's hard to resist. <br /> <br />The book is divided in six sections:  Hosses, Jest fer the Fun of It, Reflections of a Lifestyle, Family & the Community of Cowboys, Lookin' Back Down the Trail, and Characters.  I cried real tears over some, and laughed out loud over others.  All of them sang with the sounds of the range.  In some poems, I could hear hoofbeats and feel the rocking lope of a cow pony.  In others, I could smell the campfire where the tall tales were told. <br /> <br />In searching for this book's title to write my review, I saw that there were lots of other collections of cowboy poems.  This book has made me want to read more of the gems these gritty and witty folks have to offer.  These poems are truly national (and international -- some of the writers wrote of Australia and other lands) treasures.	2005-03-26

For example, I'm not sure what Dr. Peale means by the word \\"scientific,\\" for he uses it in a sense that seems to have little to do with real science.  His stories use quotes from people he's met, but they all speak with his voice.  Chapters blend into each other, as they're somewhat repetitive (How to Have Constant Energy/Relax for Easy Power; Expect the Best and Get It/I Don't Believe in Defeat). <br /> <br />Nonetheless, there is wisdom there.  What you think about your lot in life determines how you react to it, and in turn, determines your lot in life.  You can choose to be positive and tap into the power available to you (whether you believe that power comes from God or from within), or you can declare defeat and descend into a spiral of misery. <br /> <br />So go ahead and read this book, for historical and entertainment value, but also for the wisdom in the quaintness.	2005-03-24

I consider myself pretty financially savvy, so I wasn't expecting to pick up much I could really use from this book. <br /> <br />But I was wrong.  The first two of the nine steps ask us to examine our first impressions of money from our childhood and then our fears about money.  The third step asks us to really look at where our money is going, by looking at two years' worth of bills, credit card statements, and other papers.  These seemed pretty basic to me. <br /> <br />Then we get to Steps Four through Six, where the more practical advice is given.  I found it interesting that estate planning was before anything else, but when Ms. Orman explained why, it made perfect sense (people before money -- take care of those you love).  Step Five is learning to make your money work harder, and Step Six asks you to trust yourself more than you trust others.  I got real actionable advice from each of these chapters. <br /> <br />Steps Seven through Nine are where some people might tune out; they have to do with the spiritual aspects of money, including the benefits of giving.  Even if they sound kind of woo-woo at first, if you think about them, they do make sense.  If you regularly give money to worthy causes, for example, you are connected to something bigger than yourself.  This will make you more engaged in general, and could conceivably affect your own bottom line in a positive way. <br /> <br />I liked both the practical and the spiritual aspects of this book.  Of course, when making your own financial plan, you should heed Ms. Orman's advice:  do your homework, consult experts, and then listen to your own voice.	2005-03-17
US	51680733	R2OBN7CW9D9J7K	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	2	4	9	N	N	We GET it, already!	This book is basically a 600-page rant.  The premise is that the enviros are running amok:  fudging data, creating climate disasters, orchestrating media campaigns, all to keep the fear of global warming and drastic climate change alive.  The story is a basic action thriller -- a decent young lawyer is taken on a whirlwind trip around the world to try to stop the damage the environmental extremists are planning to wreak.  His partners in this adventure are a shadowy scientist/agent, the agent's sidekick, a missing philanthropist's assistant, and a representative of the group the philanthropist supports.  As far as it goes, it's an OK story, definitely, as other reviewers have described, a page turner. <br /> <br />However, I have several problems with this book. <br /> <br />First, and perhaps least importantly, \\"data\\" is the plural of \\"datum,\\" and, as such, takes a plural verb.  That is, it's not \\"the data is complicated,\\" but \\"the data are complicated.\\"  I know I'm fighting a losing battle here, but it still drives me nuts. <br /> <br />Second, characters.  The characters in this book are pretty much cardboard cutouts, with no complexity or nuance.  The ones who support global warming are shown as blind believers who won't listen to reason.  The ones on the side of truth (whatever that is) are reasoned and clever. <br /> <br />Third, dialogue, both inner and outer.  It's much nicer to tell a story in subtleties:  facial expressions, gestures, postures.  Doesn't happen here.  Just in case we don't get that this character is jealous of the attention that character is getting, for example, it's all spelled out for us. <br /> <br />Fourth, foreshadowing.  This literary (and I use the term loosely) device should be, once again, subtle, delivered with a feather.  Crichton delivers with a sledgehammer.  Criminy man, let us figure *something* out for ourselves! <br /> <br />Fifth, more bludgeoning.  I might have been more disposed to consider Crichton's point of view hadit been delivered, once again, subtly.  But he uses the same sledgehammer to pound his message home.  And then, just in case we didn't get it in the first 570-some pages, he writes a summary called Author's Message.  No, Mike, really -- we got it already. <br /> <br />Sixth, the science.  I can never tell when Crichton is giving us real science or making things up (or slanting them somehow) for his own purposes.  It is a work of fiction, after all.  I get the sneaking suspicion that just as the villains in his story use only the data that support global warming, he has used only the data that refute it. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, it was kind of fun to read.  I mean, you *had* to read the whole thing to see what happened!  And plenty happens.  The bibliography also has some interesting selections that might make my list.  And at least, being a page turner, it doesn't take very long to read.	2005-03-15

The story is told from the point of view of Jack Tagger, once a hotshot investigative reporter, who got busted down to obituary writing after a dustup with the Big Boss. <br /> <br />Jack sees the death notice of one James Stomarti, whom he recognizes is Jimmy Stoma, of the group Jimmy and the Slut Puppies.  Being a big fan, Jack naturally wants to write the obit.  After following up with the Widow Stoma, one Cindy Zigler (from my hometown, by the way), aka Cleo Rio, a pitiful wannabe pop star, he senses something might be amiss. <br /> <br />And we're off and running with a zany cast of characters (the deceased's sister, who is a website stripper; a wannabe record producer who has given himself the name of a hair-care product; and let us not forget the monitor lizard who sleeps with the Dove Bars) and a plot you think you can predict, but just wait...   <br /> <br />Hiaasen seems to be so full of funny lines that they burst from every page.  For example, the protagonist explains to us that the traffic jam that makes him late for an appointment is caused by two motorists drawing weapons on each other.  And then he moves on, because he clearly has more important things to think about. <br /> <br />What a riot!  Even though this book will never be called high art, it is written artfully, and was just an awful lot of fun to read.	2005-03-13

This is the first book by Carl Hiaasen I've read, but it won't be the last (in fact, Basket Case is next in my queue).  It's got elements of classic noir, crime, and mystery novels, all wrapped up in the bright colors of South Florida. <br /> <br />Joey Perrone is shocked to be hurled overboard by her husband, Chaz, a not-very-good biologist who is supposedly trying to save the Everglades, on their anniversary cruise.  Chaz apparently forgot his lovely wife was a champion swimmer in college -- Joey clings to life (and later to an amusing flotation device) and is rescued by Mick Stranahan, who lives on an island.  What bothers Joey most is she doesn't even know why her husband tried to kill her.  She and Mick conspire to try to figure it out, in the meantime also trying to make Chaz go mad. <br /> <br />They're not the only ones on Chaz's back.  The detective who interviewed Chaz after his wife \\"fell\\" overboard has his own suspicions.  There are also the shady farm owner, his goon, and Chaz's mistress. <br /> <br />The characters are far too colorful to blend into any background but garish, sun-drenched, pastel-touched South Florida, where they all seem right at home.  Hiaasen fleshes out both character and place in bitingly satirical style.  He also gets in his subtle and not-so-subtle commentary on the environment.  This book was a wickedly fun read.  Gonna go start reading Basket Case now.	2005-03-10
US	51680733	RVZGLRBON5DE4	0805070966	428081766	Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age	Books	3	12	16	N	N	Is the sky falling?	Bill McKibben has written a thoroughly researched book that highlights what kind of developments are now taking place and are expected to take place in the fields of genetics, computer technology, and nanotechnology. He then argues that we should voluntarily put the brakes on this kind of research, when it comes to redefining what it means to be human.  McKibben seems genuinely frightened at what is on the horizon. <br /> <br />And when I read some of the quotes from highly respected scientists, I'm frightened, too.  They seem to have tunnel vision when it comes to their research, just plowing ahead just because they can, without thinking too hard about consequences, intended or otherwise. <br /> <br />But I have some problems with the book.  First, many of the developments that scientists think they can accomplish will be very difficult, if not impossible, and the fallout may or may not be as bad as McKibben suggests.  I can see no way to identify all genes connected with certain personality traits, for example, nor can I see that inserting those genes guarantee that you'll get the desired outcome (environment does play a role in a person's temperment, after all). <br /> <br />Second, McKibben's arguments are spurious, at best, based on sort of a gut revulsion to some of this research.  I share his revulsion to many of these developments, but I also recognize that to convince most people, you can't just talk about something as squishy as meaning and expect them to give up what seems like a good thing.  His statement that things are good enough as they are is almost comical, when you think of all the times through history when people declared that everything that could be invented already has, or that a new technology was dangerous (people once thought riding on \\"fast-moving\\" trains -- 25 mph or so -- would result in death).  And thinking that everyone will voluntarily restrain himself from human-altering research is even more comical.  As I said, I don't disagree necessarily, but I'd like to have seen him argue more compellingly and offer more feasible solutions. <br /> <br />Another problem I had was simply with the way the book was written.  Sentence fragments can be very effective, but when overused, they just become annoying.  Ditto for ellipses.  Comma splices are just inexcusable.  And let's not put quotation marks around technical terms, shall we? <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I found the information on what scientists are doing and hope to accomplish fascinating (and yes, a little scary).  When scientists are speaking to \\"true believers\\" they make some statements that make me want to keep a very close eye on them.  And we should.	2005-03-08

It took me more years than I care to acknowledge to realize that I am, and always have been, pretty much Slow in my ways, and to just stop trying to be otherwise. <br /> <br />So I was already in the \\"slow is beautiful\\" camp when I picked up this book.  Carl Honore's well-researched and balanced look at slowing down merely confirmed what I already know:  taking time to enjoy the moment, take care of one's self, nourish relationships, and just simply be still is the key to happiness and health, at least for me. <br /> <br />Honore starts by discussing the real downside of the Fast life:  stress-related illnesses, sleep deprivation, feeling out of control, feeling rage.  He then discusses the benefits of the Slow life:  feeling more creative and satisfied with life, just for starters.  Then he describes how people are slowing down in different aspects of life:  cooking and eating, work, leisure time...  Finally, he wraps it all up by asking us to evaluate ways we can slow down.  The back of the book contains lots of resources to get us started. <br /> <br />I liked many things about this book, besides agreeing completely with the premise:  Honore emphasizes balance -- that there are times when we should be Fast, and, for example, there is nothing wrong with working lots of hours if you really like to; his arguments are well-supported by his research and are not extreme; he acknowledges that making changes is not easy, yet gives us many practical examples of ways we can slow down; and the book was so well written and logically laid out that, much as I tried to, I couldn't read it slowly! <br /> <br />If you like this book, you might also check out Take Back YourTime, edited by John De Graaf; Affluenza, also by De Graaf; and Work to Live by Joe Robinson.  I have read the first, a collection of essays by time experts, and have the other two on my list.	2005-03-03

By the time I had finished Bridget Jones's Diary, I decided that I rather liked Bridget Jones, despite her endless shallow, self-centered, annoying whining about how horrible her life was. <br /> <br />So when I read this book, I was fully involved in her life, once again rooting for everything to come out OK, or at least not too badly. <br /> <br />This book is in a somewhat similar style to the first -- that is, like a diary -- however it is far more narrative.  Because there is a lot more to narrate, quite honestly! <br /> <br />Bridget finds herself right in the middle of a classic farce, complete with misunderstandings, miscommunications, missing letters, missed planes, and plenty of misadventures.  It was all great fun, while also being very soap-opera-like, in that you couldn't wait to start the next chapter because the last one ended with a cliffhanger. <br /> <br />I almost couldn't put the book down until I'd found out what happens to our poor heroine.  Does she finally find the man of her dreams, or at least inner poise?  How about spiritual epiphany?  Well, I'm not telling; you'll have to read for yourself.	2005-02-24

Much has been written about both this book and the movie it spawned, but briefly, the book is a glimpse into a year in the life of Bridget Jones, as revealed by her diary.  She starts the year, as so many of us do, by listing her New Year's resolutions, and then uses her diary to track her progress.  Her weight and alcohol, cigarette, and calorie consumption begin each entry, along with number of obsessive thoughts, times she dialed 1471 (Brit equivalent of *69 to see who last rang you), etc. <br /> <br />I started off thinking how shallow, ridiculous, insecure, irritating, and immature Bridget and her friends were.  They seemed to earn my disdain on every page: wailing about being thirty-something and single, how men are beasts, and yet also how dull the Smug Marrieds are.  And yet, as I went through Bridget's year with her, I started to almost kind of like her.  And I even saw myself in her sometimes (though was loath to admit it).  And I definitely started to root for her. <br /> <br />The diary style lets you hear a character in a natural voice, with abbreviations, slang, and cussing.  It's also a good primer for British slang, though you have to get most of it from context, which was kind of fun. <br /> <br />In the end, it's just a silly, fun book about a character who, if you look past the high exaggeration of her flaws, is not that different from any of us. <br /> <br />I liked Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination, also by Fielding, a little better, mainly because the main character had a bit more depth and a bit less whining to her.	2005-02-23

Olivia Joules, the heroine of this novel, is a smart, capable, and fashionable journalist who usually writes fluff pieces but aspires to oh, so much more.  Her aspirations often combine with her overactive imagination to let her see too much into things sometimes, resulting in not a little embarrassment.  And yet, there is certainly something amiss with the supposedly French supposed film producer she meets at a party in Miami... <br /> <br />Soon Olivia is relying on her wits, overactive imagination, survival tin, and Rules for Living to get herself out of jam after jam in every part of the globe. <br /> <br />Fielding's descriptions of places seem to be spot-on (at least the ones I've visited), and her voicing of Olivia's thoughts are hilariously funny.  The plot is quite imaginitive, too. <br /> <br />I flew through this book, giggling all the way.	2005-02-22

She lays down some ground rules for herself:  she cannot rely on her higher education; she will not allow herself to become homeless; and she will take the highest-paying job. <br /> <br />It's an intriguing project, and the stories that come out of the project are equally intriguing.  I could feel her desperation as she sought affordable housing, decent food, and a way of life that wouldn't break her, physically or mentally.  Her stories about her co-workers were equally poignant. <br /> <br />This book definitely made me think more (than I already do, which is considerably) about the folks upon whose backs the middle and upper classes have made their fortunes:  the low-wage workers who allow us to have cheap clothing, cheap meals, and cheap lodging.  I was reminded of an exercise in a church group where we role-played and tried to balance transportation to and from job or day-care, rent, food, and health care on an inadequate income source.  We were only role-playing, and I was nearly brought to tears out of frustration. <br /> <br />What surprised me a little (but perhaps shouldn't have) is how much pride people take in these jobs that seem designed to break their spirits, and how much hope they still have for the future.  This makes it all the more sad to see how these people are used and exploited and broken by their employers and by oppressive company \\"rules.\\" <br /> <br />While people in low-wage jobs do not have an easy life, and often find themselves living out of vehicles, for example, I think Dr. Ehrenreich made things more difficult on herself than she needed to.  For example, while she describes frustration at dealing with charitable organizations, she never sought out any kind of community, such as a church or support group.  She never tried to find someone seeking a roommate.  She didn't interact with her co-workers off the job.  She'd work her job(s) and go back to her skeevy motel room to write notes.  While I'm sure some people find themselves isolated in a new town, I would think most in the same situation would seek out some sort of human support system.  Also, I think Dr. Ehrenreich broke her own rule in Minneapolis when she turned down the superior pay at Menards to become a Wal-Martian. <br /> <br />But problems aside, the author proves a very good point.  We really have to think about what kind of America we're supporting with our dollars and what kind of public policy we support with our votes.	2005-02-19

This book, compiled by the folks who bring you (but not me -- no cable) the Daily Show, is set up like a civics textbook, complete with sidebars, essays, \\"classroom\\" activities, and copious illustrations (where you need to read all the little captions, because they're all hysterically funny). <br /> <br />The authors do actually explain quite a lot about the workings of our democracy.  Then they tell us what they think is wrong with it.  Then they pull our legs.  A lot.  Part of the fun is sifting fact from nonsense. <br /> <br />I giggled so much at this book that I practically read the whole thing to my husband aloud, from the fake foreword by Thomas Jefferson to the fake blurb on the back by Abraham Lincoln,  because he'd keep asking me what was funny.  Do be warned, though, the book does have some salty language in it (and then there are those pictures of the Supreme Court Justices on p 99).  And no matter what group you claim identity with, you'll probably find it made fun of here. <br /> <br />But to me, pointing out what's wrong with our democracy is the mark of a *true* patriot, not the kind that blindly waves a flag or supports a politician \\"right or wrong.\\"  And by the end of the book, it's clear that the authors do love the good ol' US of A very much, even as they air their gripes in no uncertain terms.  Read it for the laughs but also for the thoughtful bits (if you can find them).	2005-02-17

Do the math.  Each subject is treated at a pretty high level, unless it's something limited in scope, such as tying a Windsor knot. <br /> <br />The brevity made the book fun to read.  I did find some useful gems: Manage Your Time by Stephen Covey, Swim by Summer Sanders, Make a Toast by Carley Roney, among many others.  Other essays were cheeky and amusing:  Tell a Story (Ira Glass), Tell a Joke (Howie Mandel), Tie a Bow Tie (Tucker Carlson). <br /> <br />Some essays could have used illustrations (or for those that had illustrations, better ones):  Do Push-Ups and Sit Ups, Hold a Baby, Fly a Flag.  Others were just not helpful:  for Swing a Golf Club, Jim McLean tells us to take lessons; for Conduct a Background Investigation, Terry Lenzner says we should hire a pro.  Huh? <br /> <br />Finally, there were the essays that might describe the best way to do something, but it's a process I know I'll never follow.  For example, I'll just have to go through life never applying lipstick correctly, because I just have better things to do with my time. <br /> <br />Despite (or maybe because of) its unevenness, the book was fun to read.  Because all the essays were short, I got through it pretty quickly, too (especially after reading the essay on speed-reading). <br /> <br />If you're looking for a little amusement where you might actually learn a few things, you won't be disappointed.	2005-02-14

After their mother abandons them on their grandmother's doorstep, they are raised by the grandmother, then by her two sisters-in-law, and finally by their Aunt Sylvie, who always seems about to join up with her mind, which is always somewhere else. <br /> <br />The plot of the book is hardly the point, however.  The words are.  Reading this book was like looking at an impressionist painting or living inside someone's dream or reading her mind.  Words and sentences on their own don't seem to make much sense, but in the context of the larger work, they swirl to form feelings, images, dreams, fears, and thoughts, bouncing from one to another to form a narrative whole.  The resulting picture is utterly stunning, dripping with metaphor and stacked in layers. <br /> <br />This is one of the most skillfully written books I've ever read.  Aside from a couple passages I found hard to get through, the book captivated me completely from beginning to end.  Read it slowly to enjoy every word.	2005-02-08

No surprise -- beyond a certain income level that provides the basics, money doesn't really make us happy.  In fact, stress over money -- even if we have more than enough -- can make us miserable. <br /> <br />She encourages us to take control of our money, which will help us take control of our lives.  Many of her suggestions are simple, but practical:  organize your papers, pay your bills when they come in, don't buy things you don't need, track your spending...  But she frames them all in the discussion of finding happiness in your life, melding the practical with the philosophical. <br /> <br />It's true; this book will be more useful to people whose finances are way out of control.  But I still learned a couple of things:  some guidelines for portfolio composition, that I could probably track my spending more closely, and that I should do some estate planning. <br /> <br />If you're not sure you need this book, live one of Ms. Chatzky's mottoes and don't buy it:  check it out of the library instead!	2005-02-01

The proximate causes are easy to see, but the ultimate causes are the subject of this book. <br /> <br />The author looks at many factors in all parts of the world:  food production (why it was developed in some places and not in others), aggregation of populations, centralization of governments, development of technology, and so forth.  His basic thesis is that development in the cultures of the world was subject to the various climatic, geographical, and ecological properties of the places they lived.  He expands on this thesis and provides many compelling examples. <br /> <br />And then he beats all his points to death, using many examples over and over and over and over again.  He repeats statements he made earlier, not as a review, but as though he were writing them for the first time.  He condescends to us readers (for example, feeling like he has to tell us that honeybees give honey and silkworms silk).  And he has made some sloppy errors (having carbon-14 decay to nitrogen-14 and carbon-12 in the same paragraph; mixing up aardwolves and aardvarks).  His writing style is often clunky and stilted. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I fought my way through the book to the end.  And despite the obstacles thrown in my path to Page 420-something, I found the experience very interesting.  Because the events he talks about happened in the distant past, it's hard to know whether he's right or not, but he does make a compelling argument for these physical factors making the difference in the development of different cultures. <br /> <br />So if you decide to read this book, skim when you get bored, but try to read it to the end.	2005-01-30

And yet these men, like the women, lay it all out there for all to read. In between the giggles and guffaws, I got a heck of a lot of insight into these men (and perhaps, by extension, other men).  I'd have to name as my favorite essay \\"Men in Houses\\" by Ron Carlson, because it was so wry and sweet.  But I enjoyed all the essays, even those by men I'm not sure I'd like to meet. <br /> <br />If you decide to read this and haven't yet read \\"Bitch in the House,\\" I strongly suggest you read it as well, to keep the world in balance.	2005-01-22

This collection of essays by extremely articulate and thoughtful women hits so many nails on the head they could have built a house by the end!  Many express their anger with their partners, whom they see as not contributing enough.  Some explore the frustrations and joys of motherhood.  Others just explain feelings that have little to do with pairing up.  But then they explore the source of their anger, frustration, and loneliness, and see that they must often look within.  We hear about the frustration of trying to live the feminist ideal, and how some women consider just scrapping it.  I don't have children, but I could relate personally to many of the essays, and certainly gained understanding from those by women whose experience was not like mine. <br /> <br />One criticism of the book is that the authors are just a bunch of whining by women who have it much better than most.  That may be true, but this bunch of women sure does lay everything bare.  And in so doing, maybe they help the rest of us understand ourselves a little better. <br /> <br />I think that after reading this book, you should pick up the male response, \\"The Bastard on the Couch.\\"  I'll be reviewing that in a minute.	2005-01-22

He then cites several different sources to describe the current mess we're in -- namely, the imminent (though not immediate) depletion of carbon-based fuels and, at least as alarming and probably more immediate, the result of our centuries of releasing so much stored carbon into the atmosphere, namely global warming. <br /> <br />Although Mr. Roberts clearly has an opinion on the topic (that we must do something about all this, and fast), he arrives at this opinion after careful consideration of information from all sides of the debate.  He also offers a combination of actions, all within the realm of possibility, that could lead to a solution. <br /> <br />I like that the arguments arrived at by the last chapter were so well supported by interviews of countless experts.  I appreciated that Mr. Roberts' tone, while urgent, was not shrill.  And I especially liked that he offered a set of solutions that were actionable and were based on the realities of economic systems and the needs of the developing world. <br /> <br />But we must get on these solutions right away!  So please read this book, write your legislators (because apparently they take our silence on the matter for apathy), and do what you can to help out (quite easy, as one of the three parts of the solution is conservation, which doesn't have to be painful)!	2005-01-10

Some of my favorites:  everything from Abraham Lincoln, Churchill's treatise on the unintended consequences of praying for rain, Bush The Elder's letter to the chairman of the Roach Bowl in Hawaii, Lewis Carroll's over-the-top apology for missing an appointment, everything by Mark Twain, groaners by Dorothy Parker and Carl Sandburg, and the exchange between Eddie Cantor and Florenz Ziegfeld. <br /> <br />Some letters are laugh-out-loud funny, but many are more subtle, understated, and dry.  All display the wit and expressiveness of their authors.

I picked it up because I read a favorable review of Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2, and thought I ought to start with the first collection. <br /> <br />The stories are slices of life of all sorts of people who live mainly in solitude in Wyoming and include some darkly funny tall tales among the more realistic-seeming ones. <br /> <br />I've never lived in Wyoming, although I now live close to it.  I know only a couple of people who live there, and they don't really seem to fit the profile of any of the hard-luck, hard-bitten characters in these stories.  However, I have driven the dirty, dusty, nameless dirt-and-gravel roads that criss-cross the lonely state.  I have seen the landscape, from the endless dry high plains to the majesty of the Medicine Bow and Teton Mountains to the downright bizarreness of Yellowstone Park.  As I've bumped along these roads, I've seen lonely outposts -- ranches, shacks, trailers, lean-tos, resort homes -- and have wondered what sort of person tries to scratch out a living in such dusty loneliness.  The stories in this book are ones I would have made up driving by those outposts if I were only a little more clever.  The characters are drawn simply but sharply by Ms. Proulx's amazing gift of metaphor.  This gift extends to her description of the real star of all the stories -- the land.  While I may not know Wyoming folks well, I know enough about their land to know that the descriptions of it in this book are spot-on and beautiful. <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly (but maybe not to those with very weak stomachs), and I'm really looking forward to reading more of Ms. Proulx's work.	2005-01-05

US	51680733	R3ODZ1IN7UPHX6	0061015725	245555180	Prey	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A real page-turner	This is the first Crichton book I've read, though I've seen Jurassic Park.  I found it very entertaining and a quick read.  (Well, OK, I simply couldn't put it down.) <br /> <br />The main character's wife works at a company that is developing nanoparticles -- tiny robots that have very little intelligence programmed in them individually, but that can display the advanced sort of group intelligence that flocks or swarms of animals do, such as ant colonies or bee swarms.  It turns out that this company has used some artificial life programming developed at the former company of the now-unemployed main character (Jack). <br /> <br />As with those who work on many new technologies, those who work on this project let their passion for science get ahead of their common sense.  Soon nanobots are running amok in the Nevada desert, reproducing, evolving, and getting collectively smarter and nastier, and it's up to Jack to figure out how to make everything right again.  Much intrigue, explaining of science, and thrilling action ensue. <br /> <br />I was riveted by this book, but I have two minor complaints.  While Crichton did an admirable job explaining what's known about nanotechnology, artificial life programming, population biology, and microbiology, he does play fast and loose with the science when it suits his needs.  Second, many of the mysteries to be solved later in the book were hinted at pretty obviously early on.  On the other hand, it does make one feel pretty smart to figure out what's going on before the characters do. <br /> <br />I recommend this for a light, quick read that will educate (a little) while it entertains.  It also serves as a cautionary tale to consider the unintended consequences of our rapidly evolving technologies.   <br /> <br />Other reviewers have cited Crichton books they liked better than this one; I'll look forward to reading those as well.	2004-10-16

Maher challenges us to think about how we have not been asked to sacrifice or step forward in the war on terrorism as citizens were in other wars in our country's past.  He also challenges the administration's actions (or lack thereof) on several fronts. <br /> <br />I didn't agree with every essay, but I did find each one thought-provoking.  Wouldn't it be grand if such a book could spur discussion and action on levels from local to international?	2004-09-19
US	51680733	R2SYSBQH9XITYP	0679463038	896829839	The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse	Books	2	7	9	N	N	Got its stars only for having its heart in the right place	I agree with the premises of this book: that life is materially pretty sweet in the US, that we must look for happiness from within, that having more things can actually isolate us from our community, that we should be grateful for our lives, that an ability to forgive can make us happier people, and that helping those less fortunate than ourselves is a good thing to do. <br /> <br />However, I did not agree with most of the pretzel logic used to arrive at these notions.  The author bombards us with data and statistics, but some of them do not really support his arguments, especially his arguments that life is \\"better.\\"  In fact, sometimes he revisits the same arguments to argue the opposite point that we should help make the world a better place (implying that it's not so \\"better\\" after all).  Some examples: <br /> <br />     * Some examples struck me as not necessarily being better:  people having larger houses and more cars and living out in the suburbs and having way too much to eat... <br />     * Some examples seemed not to illustrate the point at all: <br />       -- Test scores go up, so our kids must be better-educated.  What if the tests are getting easier, as many believe? <br />       -- Deer populations are way up, with deer in suburban backyards being quite common; therefore, forests are healthier.  Um, couldn't this be from lack of predators and erosion of habitat? <br />       -- We have plenty of resources, except for maybe fresh water in certain parts of the world (oh, just that).  One figure he cites in support of this is that we have at least 40 years of oil left, at current consumption, with maybe twice that if we develop better extraction technologies.  Not exactly comforting. <br /> <br />Also, I have to disagree with his notion that the developed world needn't conserve resources, but that the developing world should be encouraged to use more.  Even if you believe that we are not resource-poor, the suggestion that we do not need to cut down onour awful waste seems foolish. <br /> <br />But I agree fundamentally with most of the rest of Mr Easterbrook's arguments.  I kept rooting for him to support them more convincingly, but he let me down.  Besides that, his writing is repetitive and circular, and his punctuation style would give Lynne Truss (Eats, Shoots & Leaves) fits. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I slugged my way through the book.  It was a good exercise in recognizing lapses in logic, even in the face of lots of fancy and well-cited data.  And it reaffirmed my desire to live a meaningful life.  I can give it a couple of stars for that.	2004-09-13

I had read Horse Heaven and was impressed at how much research Jane Smiley must have done to get the tone of the horse racing world just right.  I did not know until seeing this book that she owned horses, both for racing and for her own riding efforts. <br /> <br />Ms Smiley relates her adventures in horse racing, breeding, and coming back to riding after many years away from it.  She gives tidbits from horse experts of all disciplines and training philosophies, as well as from human psychologists and sociologists.  Then she proposes her own theories from her voracious reading of all viewpoints and from her own astute observations. <br /> <br />She writes all of this in an easy and witty style that allowed me to gallop through the book.  I was especially amused by the wryness of her horses as expressed through their horse communicator.  Whether you believe such things or not, it's still great fun to imagine horses making suggestions on what they should be named, for example. <br /> <br />If you like horses and like to ponder the nature of their relationship with humans, you'll enjoy this book.	2004-09-10
US	51680733	R3B6LBN3QHONA7	0971394202	70373676	Everything You Know Is Wrong: The Disinformation Guide to Secrets and Lies	Books	2	26	32	N	N	Food for thought, but some of it is junk food	The format of this book is interesting -- a collection of essays by people who might have nothing else in common besides being in this book.  In that, you read about a diverse group of topics by people who hold diverse opinions.  Unfortunately, they also have a diversity of credibility.  I found some lapses in essays on topics I know a bit about, so it made me wonder what lapses there were in essays on topics I knew little about.  The result was I found it hard to fully believe anything in the book. <br /> <br />For example, an essay by Arianna Huffington on how evil drug companies are and how they're in cahoots with FDA to get their drugs approved was laughable.  She cited no references to back up her assertions.  FDA analyzes the data submitted and only then sees if the conclusion they come up with on their own matches the conclusion of the company.  They cannot be pushed around by anyone.  And while it's true that some drugs that have been marketed have later been recalled for safety issues, it's awfully hard to identify rare adverse effects in the limited numbers of patients that go through clinical trials. <br /> <br />Much later in the book, the editor has a short essay on a compound that he claims cures cancer.  His evidence is based on test-tube assays and some anecdotal data in animals.  Oh, and it's a natural herbal product used in Chinese medicine for centuries.  His gripe?  That FDA (the same one so easily pushed around, according to Ms Huffington) won't let sellers of this herb put the anti-cancer claim on the label.  Well, FDA likes to see well-controlled, prospective trials that demonstrate a drug (or substance) is safe and effective.  They don't accept the \\"a billion Chinese people can't be wrong\\" argument, unfortunately.  They also need to inspect your manufacturing plant and to see your methods of producing the herb so that they can ensure the product is consistent.  If a company doesn't want to go through that cost and effort for an herb they can't patent, well, that's their decision, but FDA can't let them make a claim they haven't proven. <br /> <br />And a final example is the essay on veganism.  The author is clearly very passionate about living a life free of animal products or exploitation of animals in any other way.  However, his argument might have been more compelling if the literature he cited were from sources other than animal rights writings.  Furthermore, he makes a couple of errors:  he claims that humans cannot manufacture vitamin D (we do, in sunlight, of course), and he neglects to mention the problem of vitamin B12, stating that we can get all we need from plant material.  There is no vitamin B12 in plants at all, so vegans need to get it from somewhere.  Most supplements come from an animal source, so unless vegans eat lots of yeast extract, they're kind of stuck. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the book does provide a lot of viewpoints and information you would certainly not read in the newspaper or hear on the nightly news.  So read it, but remain connected to your inner skeptic.	2004-09-10
US	51680733	R2EVSGABNJL3SK	0874807875	599471330	Grace Notes	Books	5	11	14	N	N	An eloquent story of an examined life	Socrates said that the unexamined life is not worth living.  This book is a memoir from a woman who has thoroughly examined her life, her passions, and her spirituality.  Reading her story has reawakened my desire to make music and to become more aware of how I'm leading my own life.<br /><br />Before I go further, I want to tell you that it is not a chronological memoir.  I heard the author speak in a panel here in Salt Lake City, and she told us why she wrote non-chronologically: to show what memories were brought back to her at different times and how they helped her on her journey.  Knowing that helped me forget about timelines and really enjoy experiencing the author's thought process as she describes her search for her voice.<br /><br />Although this book is in prose, the writing reads like poetry or music, both of which are passions of the author.  She sets scenes, goes backward to memories and forward to the future, and speaks in metaphor to guide us through the process that took her on her journey from a Mormon wife and mother, questioning her religion, lost and alone, with no voice (literally and figuratively) to a vibrant, questioning, alive woman who sings with a genuine voice, repairs broken relationships, and reconciles her need to leave the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints with her family's need to remain in it.<br /><br />Along the way, Ms Hart provides us music nerds with all sorts of tantalizing tidbits of trivia.  For extra credit, watch Cold Mountain, or at least listen to the soundtrack.<br /><br />This book touched me on many levels.  It'll touch you, too.	2004-09-07

When I finished this book last night, I began to think of what, besides voting, I needed to do to help ensure that President Bush becomes the next former president this November.<br />Ivins and Dubose certainly make their opinions known, but those opinions are backed up by facts, with sources cited.  They relate the policies of the Bush administration on education, the environment, energy, the appointment of justices, labor, taxes, food safety, and much more.  They remind us just how much Bush and Co. are beholden to &quot;big bidness,&quot; as they put it.  And then they tell the stories of ordinary people -- people who don't give big campaign contributions -- and how those people are affected by these policies.<br />In the meantime, of course, they do poke some fun at Bush and his crew.  But mostly, what they have to say is quite serious and quite scary and often quite sad.<br />They finish by reminding us that we are the government and that we need to get involved and pay attention and then demand that they serve we, the people, and not just their major contributors.  The information and commentary they provide are not something you see on the evening news, because most folks would rather find out what star has just checked in to rehab.  But we can find this information if only we look and pay attention.  They've made me want to pay more attention to what our &quot;elected&quot; officials are doing.<br />So this is one thing I can do before the next election:  urge you to read this book.  Read books by conservative authors, too.  Seek out news from sources other than network news.  Get informed.  Get mad.  Then make up your own mind, and, for heaven's sake, get out and vote!	2004-07-01
