US	50345497	R19RPVVL3WAM40	0670034118	289140196	The Wonder Spot	Books	2	9	14	N	N	Retread!	Pretty much the same book as Melissa Bank's earlier novel \\"Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\", only with the names changed. So if you liked that one, you will probably enjoy this -- otherwise, it's pretty dull stuff. Ms. Bank is a witty writer, who occasionally seems to be enjoying her own wit too much...sort of like someone laughing at their own jokes. Funny to them, maybe sort of redundant to us. <br /> <br />When an author reworks the same characters and situations more than once, the suspicion arises that she is simply writing about her own life but changing the names. I don't know much of anything about Ms. Bank, but if she is indeed a non-practicing Jew from the suburbs of Philadelphia and worked during her post-college years as an editorial assistant in Manhattan...well, let's just say I would not be shocked. I'll bet she had a prestigious dad (doctor/judge), a stay-at-home mom, hyper-critical grandmother, lady-killer brother and lots and lots and lots of dreary, neurotic, dead-end romantic entanglements. <br /> <br />Just like \\"Girl's Guide\\", \\"Wonder Spot\\" is arranged in a series of short stories of varying length. Of course, they are all about the protagonist (Sophie Applebaum...could we be laying the Jewish thing on any thicker than the choice of this name?), a neurotic, self-pitying slacker with no particular strong opinons or ideas or goals in life...she merely drifts from school to job, and man to man...often sabotaging any possible happiness by repeatedly making lame, inexplicable choices (oversleeping and coming into work late, dumping nice guys but relentless pursuing jerky losers). At the end of the book, we find her at 37 or so, dating a guy in his 20s (good luck there)and pretty much still drifting. Along the way, numerous characters and introduced and discarded without informing the reader -- suddenly, in the second last story, we hear that Sophie had a fiance (!) who was killed in a car crash. Before that, one story ends with her deeply involved with a serious and loving Dr. boyfriend. Next story, he's disappeared without mention of what happened to him. <br /> <br />This is simply poor writing and structure. If Ms. Banks, like her characters, worked in publishing, she didn't learn much about editing and discipline. A novel is more than a series of witty quips, or a character who carps relentlessly about her situation. <br /> <br />It's also possible, even admirable, to try and write about something outside of your personal, individual experience. There are other jobs besides those in publishing, other cultural upbringings besides that of \\"non-practicing Jew\\", and other places to live besides Manhattan. (Just for the record, entirely too many books and movies today are set in either Manhattan or Los Angeles...someone from 200 years in the future, reading late 20th cent. literature would be likely to think that 80% of the US population lived in either of those two places, which is obviously untrue.) I know that creative writing teachers often tell students to \\"write about what you know\\", but in this case Melissa Bank is taking that advice far too literally. She has talent and humor, but is as reluctant to take the next step into decisive, imaginative work as her characters are to commit to relationships. <br /> <br />(BTW: for the record, Curtis Sittenfeld's review of \\"Wonder Spot\\" in the NYTimes Review of Books -- which is referenced in the Melissa Bank interview here on Amazon.com -- was NOT a take-down in any way...if anything, it was a kind and respectful review, but honest, and if she calls the book \\"chick-lit\\", she was not remotely off-base.)	2005-10-13
US	50345497	RV85CKGAF0GCT	159337285X	328834946	So That's What They're For!: The Definitive Breastfeeding Guide 3rd edition	Books	1	14	75	N	N	uber-creepy and fanatical	If you are already committed to breastfeeding a baby, this book probably has some practical advice and some cute \\"anecdotes\\" devoted to making you feel good about your choice to breast feed instead of using baby formula. <br /> <br />However,if you are NOT...if you are on the fence or ambivalent (or,like me, just reading the book out of curiousity), this is creepy and fanatical. When did breast feeding become so rigid and compulsory? Probably more than half of all the people you know were NOT breastfeed as babies (depending on your age, maybe as many as 75%)and they turned out absolutely fine. Baby formula is not some Nazi-generated, genocidal poison. <br /> <br />Some women simply don't want to breast feed. Some are sensitive about their breasts, or fear the very likely result that their once-attractive breasts will become ugly and shapeless. Many new moms need to work full-time in offices, factories or retail establishments where trying to pump and store breast milk would be a logistical nightmare (and is it really the milk itself that is so important? or the close contact and nuturing?). Some families want to be able to share the cuddling/feeding/nuturing duties with dad or grandparents or older siblings. <br /> <br />The obsessive need to demonize the above situations and needs is what makes fanatical breast feeding advocates so creepy and Ms. Tamaro fits into that mold. I am all for HER right to breastfeed,but not for her insistance that every do exactly what she does in a rigid, lock-step manner. This is reminiscent of fantaical health food or vegetarian gurus who insist that you eat exactly the way they do (or die!)...or religious fanatics who demand you worship as they do, or face an eternity burning in hellfire! <br /> <br />I also think the gals who feel the need to breastfeed children as old as 2 or 3 (and I have heard of even older children continuing to feed this way!), desperately need a reality check. This kind of extended feeding might make sense fora primitive tribeswoman in the equatorial Amazon...for a modern woman who presumably has some kind of job or other responsiblities as a full-time homemaker, it smacks of obsessive compulsive disorder. Children who are walking, talking, going potty by themselves, and have full sets of teeth do NOT require, need or even want breastfeeding...unless they are simply accustomed to it by a fanatically over-attached \\"smother mommy\\" who is working out some of her own issues...issues that probably surround wanting to avoid the emptiness that can and will exist when her children eventually grow up, as they must. <br /> <br />All I can suggest and I know I am blowing smoke into the wind here, is that you gals read something like Betty Friedan's \\"The Feminine Mystique\\" and get a grip on why you feel you need to expand a simple natural body function into a full-blown fanatical, guilt-inducing movement.	2005-10-10

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	2	24	40	N	N	Overrated and under-researched	I began this book with enthusiasm, because as a moderately liberal Democrat I was heartbroken at the results of the last two elections. Basically I agree with the premise that Republicans have exploited social issues like abortion to get working class voters to support tax cuts for the wealthy and other issues that are against their own self-interest. <br /> <br />However, this book is very poorly researched and entirely lacking in footnotes or any kind of background for the situations that Mr. Frank describes. He is basically preaching to the converted here -- to liberals who just don't understand why they fail repeatedly to capture the hearts and minds of the American public. <br /> <br />Some of the issues explored in the book, in and of themselves (like the abortion issue as it applies to conservative voters) deserve very much to be thoroughly researched and discussed. WHY is this a hot button issue? Why has it exploded in controversy when for most Americans this kind of sexual privacy issue was settled decades ago? Why is it a linchpin issue for conservative voters,when it doesn't even remotely apply to most of their lives? However,\\"What's The Matter With Kansas\\" doesn't do much more than skate over the issue, although correctly identifying it as a major stumbling block. <br /> <br />There IS a cultural divide in this country and it IS getting worse, with the sides more polarized than any time I recall since the Vietnam War left us in camps designated \\"Hawks\\" or \\"Doves\\" and never would the twain meet. Enlightened politicans like Hillary Clinton appear to be actively working to bridge this gap and make meaningful dialogue, even with those on the opposite political pole. Unlike Mr. Frank, who seems to merely want to flail around, angrily denouncing anyone who doesn't see things his own (sometimes rather myopic and one-sided)way. <br /> <br />It is pretty much worthless in any political discussion to simply label the opposition \\"stupid\\" or blind. I think ordinarypeople are generally quite intelligent about what really matters to them the most. If Democrats and liberals have failed, they have failed because they are not truly listening to the public and seeing how they might SERVE and not merely lead. <br /> <br />The present political situation (Oct. '05),with a war in Iraq spiraling out of control, crisis domestic situations, sky-rocketing utility costs, White House scandals and so on, present a unique opportunity for Democratic leadership to come forward. However, so far, I have not seen this happen. A better subject for a book by Thomas Frank might be \\"What Happened to Democratic Leadership?\\", rather than worrying about Kansas.	2005-10-10
US	50345497	R3T1QJP9QHD862	0765310236	444956769	Agyar	Books	2	3	12	N	N	Well written, but ultimately unsuccessful premise	Steven Brust, an author I have not encountered before, has written an off-beat, but utlimately unsuccessful vampire novel, with the gimmick that he does not use the word \\"vampire\\" in the text. This book caught my attention because of it's setting in Ohio's rural Ashatabula County, which is about 40 miles from where I live in Cleveland (for the geographically challenged, Ashatabula County abutts the Ohio/Pennsylvannia border to the North). The settiing of Lakota, however, is entirely fictional and to the best of my knowledge there is no major college or university in this area. <br /> <br />Janos \\"Jack\\" Agyar first appears to us as wandering, itinerant loner and womanizer, who seems to move from sexual relationship to sexual relationship in a Casanova-like fashion. Only VERY gradually do we realize that he is actually feeding on the blood of his female victims and not having sex with them. It is oddly unclear whether he EVER has sex with any of the victims or is even capable of doing so (in the normal vampire mythology, the answer would be \\"no\\"). This is one of the shortcomings of the novel: along with the conceit that the word \\"vampire\\" will not be mentioned, there is also no physical description of sex. Jack is always leaving his victims sleeping or something like that. The net result of this is rather coy -- it's an adult novel presumably and it's confusing not to know this. His lover Susan seems to believe they are making love; however when she talks about the experience, it's all mist and red dreams. The unfortunate effect of all this is basically just confusion. <br /> <br />If I had read \\"Agyar\\" 25 years ago, I would have been more impressed with the concept of an offbeat, unusual vampire love story and the metaphor of drinking blood and sexual intercourse. However, writers like Anne Rice and others have traveled that path rather extensively, along with a number of films. It's not only NOT a new idea, it's actually a rather tired idea. (The film \\"The Addiction\\", with Lili Taylor, which depicts vampirism as a kind of drug addiction was far more original.)  <br /> <br />Along with some very sloppy copy-editing (noted in great detail by another reviewer), the novel drops a number of what I call \\"fact bombs\\"...this is where a pertinent piece of information is just lobbed at the reader and hasn't even been hinted at earlier. For example, Jack takes Susan on a take to the cineplex, where they see the 1990 film \\"Another 48 Hours\\". There is nothing else in the text to suggest that the setting is 15 yrs in the past. Is there a particular reason for this date, such as setting the story at a time before the internet or cell phones or DNA testing? I have no idea and I suspect neither does the author. Another \\"fact bomb\\" is dropped when we are told that Jack is 5'6\\" and about 130 lbs. There is nothing in the text previously to suggest he is such a small guy, and it made me laugh -- a Casanova that short? It seems unlikely in a world where male attractiveness is often considered to corelate directly to height (as women's does with weight). <br /> <br />Another peculiarity is that Jack is given the \\"super-power\\" of being able to directly influence people's behavior by suggestion, even against their will (think Obi-wan Kenobi and \\"The Force\\"). This makes it very unclear whether he is really this amazing seducer of women, because of his looks, charm and wit, or if he is just abusing his \\"vampire powers\\". Yet another textual oddity is how Susan (Jack's great love) is bi-sexual or perhaps a lesbian...a sexual sideline she cheerfully gives up when she decides she loves him. <br /> <br />The love affair between Susan and Jack is the weakest part of the book. I can only think that the novel was imagined as \\"womanizing vampire reforms when he falls in love for the first time in centuries\\", but it doesn't come off that way. Since Susan has a female lover and there is considerable doubt as to whether she is actually having sexual intercouse withJack, you wonder if she's with him out of genuine romance or if she is just under his vampire hoodoo spell. Susan is completely flat and lifeless as presented by author Brust, and this considerably weakens the dramatic thrust of the tale...when she ends up as narrator at the end, it's very anti-climatic. <br /> <br />In conclusion, a weak and derivative book, short on originality and piggybacking on the current literary craze for romantic vampire lit (vamp lit?) Mr. Brust has some very strong writing gifts, which I hope are developed or evident in his other work, and I'd enjoy reading something of his that was more mainstream and less gimmicky. And...get a better proofreader...some of these grammatical errors would be embarassing in a highschool writing project.	2005-09-29
US	50345497	RI8J5KF0M1GHT	0452281768	40670064	The Kid: What Happened After My Boyfriend and I Decided to Go Get Pregnant	Books	1	32	203	N	N	Possibly a permanent setback to other potential gay adoptive parents	It's hard to believe the other reviewers here read the same book that I did! On the VERY FIRST PAGE, Mr. Savage expouses his contention that any time now he be unfaithful to his \\"partner\\", the poor unfortunate house husband and Mr. Mom, Terry -- literally, he states \\"he will have another man's c___k in his mouth\\". I'm sorry -- in what way does this qualify their relationship as the equivalent of a marriage suitable for the raising of a child? Having read Mr. Savage's column's in the local tabloids and also his book \\"Slouching Towards Gomorroah\\", I thought I was pretty hardened to his coarse sexualization of virtually everything, but even I was taken aback by the cruelty of anouncing on the first page of a book about your adopted child that you intend to cheat on your partner -- can you imagine how poor Terry feels about it? <br /> <br />The title is meant to be provocative and offensive to the Moral Majority (which I am decidedly not), but it shows some of the underlying problems here -- Dan and Terry obviously don't \\"get pregant\\", that's a biological impossibility. Neither was the birth of their adopted son \\"planned\\" . Language is an interesting thing, we can twist it to mean whatever we feel like. Both Dan and Terry are biologically normal, fertile, young men, and either could have easily concieved a biological child with a surrogate or a lesbian partner. They choose instead so-called \\"Open Adoption\\", and end up with the child of what they like to call througout the book \\"a street punk\\". In fact, the mother of the child is a mentally ill homeless woman, incapable of taking care of herself or even bathing, wearing clean clothes, etc. A lot of flapdoodle in the book is presented as Dan and Terry seem to struggle with the fact that the mom used some alcohol and drugs early in the pregnancy and if this presented a danger of fetal alcohol syndrome -- HELLO! this is the child of a severely mentally ill homeless person! What about hereditary mental illness? Apparently noone knows or cares or even calls this into question. After all, Dan and Terry have achieved the plum prize that every infertile straight couple drool over -- not merely a healthy child, but a BLOND BLUE-EYED BOY. How they gloat over THAT. <br /> <br />Even worse is humorist Savage's inability to talk seriously about the choice to become a parent at all. He insists that he only wants a child to have a \\"really expensive hobby\\" and so that he doesn't end up in old age as one of those lonely, ancient gay couples in South Beach surrounded by expensive antiques . (NOTE: if you think that children guarantee you will be treasured and cared for in old age, you have some serious disappointment awaiting you.) In the final analysis, it seems more that Dan Savage particpated in the adoptation because it was partner Terry's heartfelt wish to raise children...and indeed, it appears that Terry is the one staying at home and doing the \\"hands on\\" work of parenting. <br /> <br />It is worth knowing that Dan and Terry have relocated to Seattle, from Portland where the adoption was conducted. Could this be because the child's mentally ill, homeless, destitute mother will find it impossible to visit another state 4 times a year (as she is technically entitled)? So much for the lipservice of \\"open adoption\\". This is just more self-serving psychobabble and double-speak for \\"stealing the adoptable children of poor, helpless, homeless women.\\" It doesn't make anything better that the thieves are gay rather than straight. <br /> <br />I went into this book with a generally accepting attitude towards gay adoption, and the feeling that anyone willing to buck a generally unsympathetic system must want very badly to have and raise children, and would therefore make good parents. This book has COMPLETELY changed my mind. I know that there are good, loving gay adoptive parents, but clearly the system is unable to screen out wealthy, manipulative, sleazy individuals like Dan Savage. This is a man who should not be allowed to adopt a pet, let alone a human child. My judgement has nothing to do with his homosexuality, and everything to do with his materialism, selfishness, sleazy morals, inability to comitt to a faithful relationship with a partner, open cruelty, and not least of all, his willingness to exploit both his partner and his adoptive child to make money from a sympathetic gay community.	2005-09-14

By the time these girls have \\"aged out\\" to their 20s, they are virtually worthless and must in turn raise their own daughters to be prostitutes. Without any ability to earn money from anything but sex (with the very youngest girls), this degradation carries on from generation to generation, often with grandmother, mother and daugther all prostituted to the same depraved wealthy men. <br /> <br />With a absurdly exaggerated \\"cult of virginity\\" and a tradition of polygamy, men are able to not only accumlate several wives but keep mistresses who are a kind of second-class wife or concubine. They are also able to marry women on a \\"short term, renewable\\" contract, which is accepted as a kind of marriage and legitimacy for children, while enabling the men to continuously disgard women as they age into their 30s. Under this arrangement, children concieved this way must be supported by their fathers, leading to families comprised of children who are all treated very diffently based on the status of their fathers...the lowest caste children being horrifyingly neglected, even to the point of dying of easily treatable medical problems. Virtually all the women and children are entirely illiterate, with no way out of their situation. <br /> <br />This excellent, no-holds-barred book raises a lot of questions about Islamic tradition and Pakistani society in particular. Why does this go on? Why is nothing being done about it? Where are the missionaries and social agencies while all this is going on? <br /> <br />It also calls for us to take a closer look at our own culture -- don't we have some of the same source problems, with our obsession with youth and physical perfection? the way we dismiss women when they are no longer young and beautiful? the way \\"no fault\\" divorce allows men to enjoy \\"sequential monogamay\\" with progressively younger and younger partners throughout their lifetime? <br /> <br />A treasure trove of fascinating ideas and arguments here...a fabulous book which demands more than one reading, and discussion if at all possible in a group. HIGHLY recommended for book clubs!!!!!	2005-08-13
US	50345497	R1YJZ06G89EHYE	1400043395	813354201	Never Let Me Go	Books	1	124	182	N	N	Disappointing and unconvincing sci fi novel	(Spoilers below; please do not continue if you do not wish to read them.)    Kazuo Ishiguro is clearly a master writer, but he has chosen a subject here that is way, way out of his expertise. Although beautifully written, the basic story behind \\"Never Let me Go\\" is dull, and goes over a sci fi subject (cloning) that was done to death 40 years ago. Yes, even the idea of adult clones going willingly to their death for the benefit of mankind.     Presumably Mr. Ishiguro was inspired by the cloning of Dolly the sheep to try his hand at something like this. It's notable that when Americans attack this sort of subject, you get a result like the current movie, \\"The Island\\", which focuses less on introspection than on the rebellion of the clones. It says a lot about the difference in national character! LOL! Plus I see many commenters here are the most disturbed at the passivity of the characters.    I certainly see that as a flaw in the structure of the novel (what would prevent any of the clones from simply walking away from Hailsham or the Cottages? After all, they don't look any different than an ordinary person), however I think there are much more serious flaws in the construct.    The ideal age for a \\"clone\\" to donate organs would be late teens, not their 30s. That's when all your internal organs are at their healthiest, and you have reached adult proportions. That wouldn't leave time for \\"carers\\" to develop. And what's with the concept of \\"carers\\"? They aren't even properly trained as nurses or even orderlies. Transplant/donor patients require skilled nursing, not \\"pals\\".    Then there is the problem of the idea that the clones donate approximately 4 times (if they survive) and then \\"complete\\" (die). What the heck are they donating to accomplish this? You can live with only one kidney, and you can survive with a partial liver...or lose your pancreas, and survive on insulin. But you certainly can't survive without a heart or lungs, which are among the most desirabletransplant organs. Maintaining a donor clone on dialysis (assuming both his kidneys were transplanted) would render him too weak to donate any of his other organs. From a strictly medical point of view, it would make more sense to kill the clones and harvest ALL the desirable organs, rather than taking one at a time and risking the clone dying from one of those procedures. Or is the idea that the clone is donating only to the individual he was cloned FROM, as that individual has various organs fail? That doesn't make sense either -- nobodies organs fail exactly in a certain order.    Furthermore, the implication is that harvesting cloned organs will cure cancer. I am hard pressed to think of a cancer that could be cured by transplantation -- it would certainly be rare. The problem with cancer is that it spreads all throughout the body, and transplanting organ after organ would be useless.    This is just a few of the examples of why this is a patently stupid idea for a novel. I don't think Mr. Ishiguro has read much genuine sci fi that explores these ideas, or he'd understand how out of date and out of his depth he really is here. As far as the story exploring the way people passively accept their fate, no matter what it is, without fighting back -- well, if he's revealing an inside look at British culture, that's the scariest part of all.	2005-07-20
US	50345497	R3A6GBRM6BHGQ8	1400060737	595261029	The Birth of Venus	Books	2	20	24	N	N	Uneven historical romance with too many modern intrusions...	A romance novel set in the late 15th century of Florence, Italy, \\"The Birth of Venus\\" is an uneven and only particially successfully story that compares to \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\", \\"The Ruby Ring\\" and several books and films about the real female Renaissance artist, Artemisia Gentileschi. (As usual, truth is far more fascinating that made-up fiction.) Sarah Dunant is a very capable writer and she's done a wealth of research here, but the drive to write a feminist novel set in the past drags the book down. As much as it frustrates our present cultural belief systems, the past was not awash with feminist types or politically correct situations. People simply believed different things -- really believed them, not just lip service -- such as the role of women in society and the dominance of the Catholic faith over every aspect of society. <br /> <br />The character of the \\"feisty female character\\" is a bit overdone in all of literature, anyways. It makes you wonder a bit about all the millions of women who lead ordinary lives and why we fail entirely to identify with THEM. Alessandra Cecchi is a wealthy 15 year old Florentine girl with artistic aspirations, who has an arranged marriage with an older, homosexual man...who has previously been sexually involved with her brother. She falls in love with an artist, and has an affair with him. <br /> <br />Some readers apparently feel that the title \\"The Birth of Venus\\" refers to the actual classical myth, as depicted in the very famous Botticelli painting of this period. However, it's very obvious to me that the title is an allusion to the heroine's sexual awakening at the hands of the artist, and a graphic reference to the female genitalia. <br /> <br />Other readers have wondered about the symbolism of the snake tatoo that Alessandra (trapped in convent at the end) painstaking creates on her body. I think it's pretty obvious that this is a graphic reference to the oral sexual pleasure that her lover has given her, and it's importance in her life -- i.e., he has fulfilled her in ways that obviously her gay husband wasn't able to. <br /> <br />Lastly, it seems like no one even wants to hazard a guess as to the identity of the painter that Ms. Dunant chooses to shroud in mystery. (It's CERTAINLY not Michelangelo.) As a former art student, I'd like to suggest that she is thinking of the German artist, Hans Holbein (the Younger). He was definitely from the North, and from a city that had a rich trading history with Italy. Art historians believe he studied in Italy to develop his astonishing techniques, although there is no actual historical proof of this. He painted many famous religious triptychs. Also, like the character in the novel, Holbein eventually moved to England and became the court painter of Henry VIII (every famous portrait you have ever seen of Henry VIII or his wives is by Holbein). Although Holbein technically was born a little late for the story (in 1497), he had a famous father, Hans Holbein the Elder, and the author here might have been using a little creative license by merging the two...it would also explain why she refuses to identify him, even in an afterword. I would be extremely interested in any readers who either agree or disagree with my theory and in any other artists they might have come up with!!! <br /> <br />In conclusion, this would have been a better book without all the PC feminist and gay posturing, and without the overly modern spin on sexuality. Ms. Dunant is a good writer, and certainly had the potential here to write a historically accurate novel -- it's a shame she did not fulfill that potential.	2005-07-16
US	50345497	R23E3IERLAP84A	1400051738	575323718	The Ruby Ring: A Novel	Books	1	10	14	N	N	Tiresome historical piffle	If this is your cup of tea, then it's none of my business to tell you otherwise. However, if you are looking for a serious historical novel, then this is piffle....the sort of book where characters routinely say things like \\"you are a cruel vixen\\" and every surface is jewel-encrusted and every character draped in velvet. <br /> <br />This novel (noteable for being released only as a trade paperback and not apparently in hardcover) compares poorly to the very similar \\"Birth of Venus\\", which is substantially better written and more historically accurate. Diane Haeger has probably done a decent amount of research -- the novel feels like she kept an art history text close at hand for dates and names -- but she has no feeling at all for the cultural norms of the Renaissance period she writes about. For example, it was pretty common and accepted at the time for a wealthy man (or a famous artist) to keep a mistress -- nothing very shocking about it and certainly nothing that would prevent that wealthy man or famous artist from MARRYING.  <br /> <br />Marriage in the medieval or Renaissance periods (in fact, almost anytime up to the present) was a social/political/financial arrangement that had virtually nothing to do with romantic love. People expected to find what romance they could through extramarital relationships. So \\"The Ruby Ring\\" seems predicatd on a lot of phony feeling stuff about th heroine (Margherita) being a \\"nice girl\\" who doesn't want to put out for the worldly painter (Raphael) who is obsessed with her, and in turn he can't make a politically advantageous marriage...because he's not \\"in love\\" with the girl he is betrothed to. This is simply not convincing. <br /> <br />The quality of the writing here is definitely of the old-style bodice ripper -- if not for the historical allusions, it would be a straight-up Harlequin paperback. For those who care about such stuff, be aware that the sex scenes are extremely tame, in a gauze-y soft-focus way. <br /> <br />The 16th century artist Raphael probably does deserve a good novel (the way Michaelangelo got \\"The Agony and The Ectasy\\"), but this isn't it.\\"The Ruby Ring\\" is reading for the mass market bodice-ripper set, not for anyone interested in intelligent historical romance.	2005-07-16

Curtis Sittenfeld (a woman) writes circles around Tom Wolfe here, especially in creating a believable and authentic sounding heroine. Both books (which share the flaw of being overly long and in dire need of rigorous copy editing) take a long time to get around the main point, which is the phenomena of \\"hooking up\\" -- very casual, male-oriented sex that has largely taken the place of traditional dating. <br /> <br />Ms. Sittenfeld has an edge here because she's a woman and closer in age to her heroine, and also because she is a product of elite private education (she's the daughter of a private school educator, and attended Groton). \\"Prep\\" has the distinctive feel of a thinly disguised memoir, even though the author denies it and has taken pains to change the location and economic background of the heroine from her own. Still, the sheer mounds of detail and lack of action give the novel the feeling of an autobiography. <br /> <br />Lee Fiora is a bright and high-achieving student at a public school in her hometown of South Bend, Indiana when she independently applies for a scholarship to the prestigious Ault School. This is about the last really assertive action the heroine takes, and technically it occurs before the novel even begins. After arriving at Ault, she quickly realizes that her academic skills are far from outstanding at this selective private school, and she is neither beautiful nor athletic nor popular. This causes her to lag into a wallflowerish, mildly depressive state for her entire four years. While this makes for some dull stretches, it's a very realistic look at the world of a teenager and certainly convinces as a look inside the snobby status conscious world of prep school academies. (You can't help but wonder what Lee's experience might have been had she stayed in public school in South Bend, where she would have been a stand-out academic star, rather than a \\"nobody\\", and if this was truly a worthwhile trade off for her.) <br /> <br />Eventually as a senior, Lee gets together with the handsome blonde athelete, Cross, she has been crushing on since freshman year and they embark on a graphically described \\"hooking up\\" relationship -- in other words, casual no-strings sex in the dorm. Lee is in love with Cross, but he's a cad who is basically screwing most of the girls at school and barely acknowledges her in public. I found this to be a brutally honest picture of this type of relationship, which is increasing common, as so many low-self-esteem young women feel they have nothing to offer to the young men they desire except \\"free sex\\", especially oral sex., and sadly this situation only ensures that the young men involved develop little caring or respect for the women they encounter this way. <br /> <br />In this respect, \\"Prep\\" is possibly a bit too racy (although bluntly honest) for a junior high or high school audience of readers, and yet it's precisely these readers who would be most interested in the story and to whom it would offer the most value. Prep school is not exactly a compelling interest to adults over 25 (whether they went or not), and Ms. Sittenfeld's story mostly wraps up at graduation (with a few footnotes as to what happened to some of the supporting characters). Personally, I would have liked more development as far as what happened to Lee, not just after high school, but how she developed as an adult woman after her initial romantic experience was so demeaning. <br /> <br />On balance, this novel is very well written and certainly many parts of it are interesting and authentic in feeling. I do wonder if Ms. Sittenfeld, with her all-prep-school background (she even teaches today, at a prep school!) has anything else in her repetoir to write about. It's fine to have a catharctic release of all the frustration, loneliness and pettiness that make up high school (for everyone, rich and poor), but eventually we must move on into adulthood, where frankly nobody cares much where you went to high school.	2005-07-12

I have to say that I have the strong gut feeling that this book is fiction, and only loosely based on a few facts from author James Frey's personal life (his addiction, rehab and prison time, etc.) Which is to say, I think that the character of \\"Leonard\\" is completely invented. It feel fake, especially the final act \\"revelation\\", which I won't give away but which is very phony in feeling. Not that a gangster could not have the personal trait that Leonard is revealed to have, but the overall fakiness of the writing and lack of believability of his \\"confession\\". <br /> <br />The whole way that Leonard is introduced and how he decides to call James \\"his son\\", although no particular prior friendship is established. (Plus if he really had the personality trait described above, his friendship with the much younger James would seem highly suspect and manipulative.) <br /> <br />I think all of us fantastize about a magical, powerful friend who will do us favors, introduce us to a glamorous lifestyle, loan us huge sums of money (at one point right out of jail, Leonard simply GIVES James $30,000 for no reason) and take us to fabulous restaurants...I imagine for a drug addict who has ruined his life and is in prison, the temptation to fantasize this kind of powerful friend (when you are being beaten up) is terribly tempting. I also don't believe that Leonard figures at all in Frey's earlier book about prison, even though he would have had to been an inmate at the time. <br /> <br />Enjoy this, if you want, as a creative if preposterous work of fiction. But don't take it too seriously. And if you can't stand James Frey's pretentious   <br />stream-of-counsciousness and run-on sentences (there is little BUT run-on sentences here), then trust me -- you are not alone.	2005-06-30

While I deeply respect the right of other reviewers to disagree with my personal assessment of a book, I think what we have here is a bunch of people who barely read or skimmed \\"Glass Castle\\" for the highlights and have utterly missed the message of the book.<br /><br />This is NOT a harrowing account of an impoverished family, ala \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" The following is so important that I wish I could boldface it, or put stars around it:<br /><br />Jeanette Wall's family was WEALTHY -- they were MILLIONAIRES. They were NOT poor....they were, however severely mentally ill.<br /><br />I wish I could somehow emphasize that. Despite living in squalor and abusing their children, the Walls family had a great deal of inherited wealth -- money that was still around when Rose Mary Walls (the mother) was an older woman living as a squatter in a hovel in New York City. I believe a great deal of Rose Mary's \\"ditsiness\\", and her apalling insensitivity sprang from a priviledged life where she never had to deal with ordinary problems such as taking care of children, obtaining safe housing or clean food. This, combined with a severe mental illness and a husband who was lost early on to severe alcoholism, lead to the tragedies described in the book.<br /><br />It is a little difficult to tell, therefore, how much of the book is factually true and how much of it is embellished by daughter Jeanette, who apparently escaped nearly unscathed by her experiences to a college education and immensely successful career. I don't believe that the entire story is fabricated, but I think there has been a certain amount of \\"creative license\\" employed here to make the story more dramatic.<br /><br />One particular problem I have is that after the adult Jeanette becomes educated and wealthy (she lives on Park Avenue, and has a career as a society gossip columnist), she fails utterly to recognize her parents mental illness and incompetence to live an even minimally decent life. As an adult, I feel that Jeanette had a legal and moral responsiblity to have her parents declared incompetent, and use their multi-million dollar assetts to have them treated medically for their illnesses (probably some kind of psychosis for the mother, obviously severe alcoholism for her dad). There was no lack of funds, either in her parents extensive wealth or her own lavish Park Avenue existence -- it is terribly hard to believe that she just \\"allowed\\" them to live homeless on the streets for years (and still does).<br /><br />I have a few other problems such as the fact that Jeanette describes being filthy and wearing rags as a child, yet her school pictures show a clean, well-dressed and apparently normal little girl. It does make me think that she has exaggerated things a bit -- perhaps because mental illness (which can be inherited) is so much scarier than just have parents who are \\"hippies\\" or \\"colorful\\" or simply incompetent at living a normal life.<br /><br />Still and all, you cannot evaluate this memoir properly unless you acknowledge the above FACTS...to describe this as a book about a child surviving poverty is so incorrect as to render the book meaningless.feel that Jeanette had a legal and moral responsiblity to have her parents declared incompetent, and use their multi-million dollar assetts to have them treated medically for their illnesses (probably some kind of psychosis for the mother, obviously severe alcoholism for her dad).

I got this book because it was so extravagantly praised in reviews. Ms. Moore is a very gifted writer, but this highly personal memoir is more like an expose of her deep seated psychological problems than anything illuminating about the lives of overweight women in modern society. <br /> <br />Clearly, Judith Moore had a very difficult childhood, marred by her parents divorce and her lack of contact with her father...her mother and grandmother were harsh (if not outright abusive), and she was molested as a youngster in a movie theatre. HOWEVER...as I read her intense descriptions of her revolting obesity and monstrously ugly body, I was expecting that she was a HUGELY overweight person -- 350-400 lbs or more and unable to climb stairs, put on pantyhose and so forth. In reality, Ms. Moore is a 60 year old woman of average height, who weighs well under 200 lbs and has never been more than about 40 lbs overweight!!! This info doesn't come out until you are nearly done with this extremely short book, and it's startling. <br /> <br />Obviously, some psychological problems and image disorder have rendered her incapable of seeing what she really is -- a moderately overweight, plump middle aged lady and not a huge monster. Her body dismorphia extends to others around her, as she claims her father is grossly obese but then goes on to tell us he is 6 ft tall and weighs about 200 lbs (in other words, perfectly average). <br /> <br />Other reviewers have mentioned the secondary issue in this book beyond obesity, which is Ms. Moore's obsession with SMELLS...she belives that she exudes a \\"meaty\\" chicken soup body odor despite regular bathing and normal hygiene. Other people smell too -- especially women and their genitalia. Frankly, this isn't true...it is an abnormal and fairly sick thing to believe (like a racist who thinks all black people \\"smell funny\\").  <br /> <br />Obviously poor Judith Moore is so emotionally frail and mentally traumitized that she can no longer picture reality...caught in a lifelong spiral of self hatred that extends far beyond society's well documented cruelity to the REALLY overweight. It's especially sad when you realize that she is well into her sixties, and still has failed to make peace with the fact that she is just a full figured (and probably NOT obese) woman. <br /> <br />My biggest issue with the book is that many truly large size readers will buy this (and it's expensive for a very short book) thinking they will learn something \\"deep\\" about obesity or the problems of the overweight in society etc., only to find that Ms. Moore is far more predjudiced and hateful towards the overweight than the worst \\"fattie hater\\" out there. If you ARE large size or overweight, this book will surely make you feel hopeless and depressed...if you HATE the large and overweight, it will make you feel smug and justified (see how awful they are? They even smell bad!). <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Judith Moore's severe emotional issues drown out whatever she has to say about the condition of the overweight, and this diminishes her fine writing abilities here. For that reason, I can't really recommend this book...but I can recommend that Judith Moore use her profits from the book to find a really good therapist and talk out her childhood issues....	2005-06-13
US	50345497	R1TRVIB712SVFO	0764321722	691858351	Vintage Wedding Cake Toppers	Books	1	4	14	N	N	Disappointing and EXPENSIVE paperback on collecting..	I was thrilled to find a book dedicated to wedding cake toppers, which I have collected for years, thinking it a relatively obscure hobby. I ordered this right away, sight unseen, and boy was I disappointed! For almost $30, you get only a slim paperback (not a hardcover) that seems at most to be photographs of Ms. Henderson's personal collection, supplemented by perhaps a few of her collecting buddies. This is not a comprehensive study of the field, nor are there examples from a wide variety of sources, such as museums or culinary schools or experts in the field of weddings. <br /> <br />Ms. Henderson does have a sumptuous collection, especially of rare toppers constructed of frosting and/or marzipan...astonishing in that they survived 100 years or more, let alone did so in nearly flawless condition. However, this only accounts for a few pages of the book. <br /> <br />More than a dozen pages are dedicated to \\"wedding fashions over the ages\\", with drawings by a rank amateur artist (not a professional illustrator by the most generous consideration), almost as if a child did them. Furthermore, it's impossible to really gain an understanding of wedding fashions from such rough sketches...nor is it really clear that even a encyclopaedic knowledge of wedding clothing would help you to understand or identify these often tiny figurines, which are reproduced often for decades in clothing (long white dresses!) that doesn't really change as much as everyday clothing. <br /> <br />The other thing I hoped for was some detailed idenfication of commonly found modern (last 50 years) wedding cake toppers, as one often sees the same ones over and over, with clearly identifiable style markers for the different manufacturers (Bakery Crafts, Mellillo, Pfiel and Holing, Venice and others), but Ms. Henderson is no help here. She clearly prefers her pricey Victorian pieces and has little interest in the modern, plastic items which are more commonly found and collected by the ordinary collector. <br /> <br />Lastly, I would have liked to hear from people talking about THEIR own wedding cake toppers...if they were saved or not...how they were chosen...what meaning they have for the individual whose wedding they represent. I have found in collecting these toppers that there is a virtual treasure trove of information out there about this, if one could only tap into it. Wedding cake toppers are unique in that they are often the sole surviving decorative element from a deeply important life event...an event that might cost many thousands of dollars to stage, and of immeasurable importance to those individuals involved...and yet decades later, these fragile little \\"icons of romance\\" are all that is left! Simply the fact that they are treasured and preserved despite their fragility is a testament to the meaning that they symbolize! <br /> <br />How many other decorations in life stand for romantic love and lifelong commitment? <br /> <br />As the granddaughter of a pastry chef, who created many thousands of wedding cakes in his career, these decorative figurines have always fascinated me! I think this field of collecting truly deserves an in-depth cultural study...more than simply a price guide, but a real exploration of the beauty and cultural meaning of these delicate and fascinating items. \\"Vintage Wedding Cake Toppers\\" is FAR FAR from that exploration. At the most it affords the moderate level collector a glimpse at what splendid Victorian examples one could possibly collect, if you had an nearly unlimited budget. At the worst, it's just a series of rather poorly composed and lit samples, with quickly outdated price information gleaned from ebay. At $30, this is vastly overpriced and of extremely limited usefulness.	2005-05-28

Ignore customers who are dissing reviewer Eileen Pollack -- she's right on the money. (Thank you, Eileen.) This book is absolutely fraudulent...the author, a \\"professional matchmaker\\" on the island of Manhattan has parlayed a NYTimes article into a profit center. Ms. Spindel does her matchmaking soley for the super-affluent, and her advice might have some slight relevance for those living in the stratosphere, but it's utterly stupid and sometimes even degrading for those ordinary folks who live in flyover country (i.e., \\"the real world\\"). <br />Janis Spindel is captilizing on the misfortunes of the over-35, never-married women who fill big cities like NYC and LA.This is a vulnerable group and they can be milked to buy every fad and self-help book, blaming themselves for their failure to get married. This is hyper-consumerism, driven by fear, at it's worst. For some women (especially the over 50s): Wake up! there is a reason you avoided marriage all this time. You probably have significant reason to be single, and maybe you are better off this way. Any women who are never-married at 55 and still thinking wistfully about HAVING A BABY (past menopause!) need a serious reality check and THERAPY, not a self-help book. <br />Most of Ms. Spindel's advice is pathetic and ridiculous, like something out of a 1950s fashion magazine -- get a haircut! wear makeup! shave your legs! (If these basics are your problem, then you have a lot more issues than simply not finding a husband.) <br />Most of the single, mature professional women I know are well-heeled, nicely dressed and polished -- the picture of sophistication. They hardly need this kind of basic advice. <br />Other suggestions border on crazy: no short haircuts! don't wear pants! What is this, the 19th century? What if you look better in short hair or it suits your lifestyle? What women these days DOESN'T wear pants? Do you seriously think that your married friends DON'T WEAR slacks or jeans? <br />There is an idiot assumption in this book that in order to get married you must \\"fool\\" an older, wealthier male and that is the only way to get married -- RUBBISH. There are lots of terrific, single men OF ALL AGES, sizes, income levels, races, religions, etc. in EVERY part of the country (not just the bigger cities, as Ms. Spindel claims) -- ever heard of a little thing called divorce? There are huge numbers of divorced men out there, plus plenty of never-married singles. Anyone who tells women differently is an out-and-out liar...preying on their insecurities and fears. SHAME! <br />The worst part is the constant harping and shame-mongering about weight -- the book constantly slams the overweight, insisting that there are no men available for anyone bigger than a size 6. The most painful aspect of this is that most of the single women I know who are avoiding dating are doing it BECAUSE they feel inadequate over their weight -- waiting to start dating when they feel \\"thin enough\\". Meanwhile the years go by, and the opportunties diminish. THIS IS INSANE. There are men of all sizes, and men of all different tastes...look around any mall or large public arena and you will see men with women of ALL SIZES and SHAPES. <br />Shame and fear and hyper-consumerism are no way to impower women, or help them find happy, fulfilling relationships. This is the worst kind of mean-spirited, bigoted, subversive salesmanship -- to make women feel terrible about themselves and then turn around and sell them tooth-bleaching, image consultants, overpriced clothing and makeup...all selling them a pathetic dream...when the reality is that there are plenty of men out there available to any woman who feels happiness, self-respect and pride in herself THE WAY SHE IS, not some sterilized version of a Madison Avenue advertisement. <br />Sick, self-hating and demeaning. Fortunately for single women, none of this is true. DON'T BUY OR READ THIS BOOK, unless you want to feel very, very bad about yourself!!!!!	2005-04-29
US	50345497	R3MY0BDYPV12M4	0743238281	11753879	My Old Man	Books	1	14	20	N	N	Sleazy picaresque drivel	I picked this book up because of the charming John Currin painting on the cover, but was very disappointed. Ms. Sohn is a sex columnist for the New York Press and New York Magazine, and I guess that makes her feel that she is the 2000's version of Erica Jong. \\"My Old Man\\" is supposed to be a picaresque, sexy romp but it comes across as cheap and the sex is both graphic and unerotic at the same time.    Main character Rachel Block is unconvincing depicted as a drop-out rabbinical student, whose lack of compassion has actually caused dying man to keel over dead (because she has failed to console him in anything approaching an appropriate manner). Unsure of what to do at this point in her career, she turns to bartending in the Brooklyn neighborhood she grew up in. Having a chance to meet the famous indie filmmaker, Hank Powell, she throws herself at him and they begin a coarse, entirely sexual affair devoid of any tenderness or romance.    Ms. Sohn name drops so much throughout the book (famous filmmakers, painters, actors), that I am certain Power is supposed to be a particular individual (or composite) but I couldn't tell who. His background of indie films sounds very like Woody Allen's, but the character is much younger. Unfortunately, Ms. Sohn chooses to write his dialogue IN DIALECT, which is one of the most irritating things in the entire book -- why Powell and not the other New Yawkers? -- but I guess it's to underscore his crudeness. If so, it works but only on that level -- Powell is so repugnant (ugly, fat, bald, rude, abusive) that no normal woman would ever be remotely attracted to him.    The character of Rachel is so poorly drawn that we have no idea at all why she ever wanted to be a rabbi, nor does she tell us about her feelings about giving up a career in the clergy -- she doesn't even seem to feel particularly bad about the patient she practically \\"depressed to death\\". In fact, she has no spiritual leaning at all, which seems odd in someone who went to all the time and expense to attend rabbinical school. This feels like a detail added to the story just to raise the titillation level -- she's not just a typical Brooklyn Jewess but a FORMER RABBINICAL STUDENT, so her descent into meaningless sex will seem all that more \\"shocking\\".    Well...it's not. The sex feels really gratuitous and designed to shock or gross out. I can tell the general theme of the book is to be breezy and funny, but it the desperation in it makes it depressing. None of the characters undergo any self knowledge or transformation...it's just crudely linked chapters that veer from one sexual encounter to another.    I don't think that erotic novels need to cover all the basics of safe sex, but I can honestly state I have never read a book, in this age of AIDS and STDs, that apparently comes out in favor of the \\"withdrawal method\\" (coitus interruptus) and non-use of condoms! This seems unbelievably irresponsible -- it's one thing if characters are depicted doing something self-destructive, but the author herself seems to be blandly endorsing this. [...]    I could say more, but am demurring due to space considerations. This was one of the more depressing and discouraging books I have read recently -- the kind that makes you want to take a bath afterwards and wash your hands with santizer. And never have sex again.	2005-03-21
US	50345497	R2Y2QVDTNT886V	0743247949	355621222	Firethorn	Books	2	43	77	N	N	Decent freshman effort could use more originality	\\"Firethorn\\" is the first novel by Sarah Micklem, and as such it is a better than average effort for a new writer. Ms. Micklem definitely has some writing talent, although it will need some work and discipline to come to full maturity. <br /> <br />I wish new writers in the Fantasy field did not feel that every single work has to be part of a trilogy, or multi-volume epic. It is a rare work, like LOTR, that needs a canvas that big and when a more minor story is spun out to such a length, it becomes overblown and draggy. This is only the first volume of what is planned as a Firethorn trilogy, and although I can't know where Ms. Micklem is headed, there is nothing in the first volume to suggest that this could not have been a decent length, single novel. For starters, there are not nearly enough secondary characters for a trilogy, nor is there any alternative storyline to the very personal one told by the heroine. <br /> <br />Ms. Micklem is very much in debt here to Tanith Lee and Miriam Zimmer Bradley, among others. I have never understood why so many Fantasy novels are set in a quasi-British/Scottish/Irish medieval setting (why not Moorish Spain? Or Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica?). This is an overused and tired-out milieu, and the lack of historical context allows too much cobbling together of \\"been there, done that\\" elements such as Knights in Shining Armor, etc. It relies on our movie-fed psuedo knowledge of such things as nobles, knights, royalty, peasants, etc., and thereby doesn't require the author to come up with much that is original. Magic, spells and powers take the place of character development or believable plot resolution. <br /> <br />Ms. Micklem is making a sincere effort to acknowledge the inequality of female/male relationships, and the empowerment of the female lead. However, she undercuts much of this with trite elements from romance novels. (There are about a hundred too many references to pricks, pricksheaths, quims and \\"sheaths\\" -- as a euphemismfor mistress or camp follower -- and these come off as very strained and awkward.) The main character, teenaged Firethorn is brutally raped...yet very shortly later, she is tapped on the shoulder by the handsome hero, Sire Galan, and hops into bed with him...without the slightest qualm or hesitation. The storyline is marred by far too many references (in gauzy, romantic language) of their many, many MANY sexual encounters. I don't say this because I am prudish -- just the opposite actually -- this is just too heavily weighted on the side of perfect, fantasy sex to be convincing, and after a while, the sheer number of sexual encounters (and positions) becomes embarassing in a Playboy channel sort of way. OK, Ms. Micklem -- we all get it....Galan and Firethorn have a very satisfying sex life. Now tell us something new. <br /> <br />Two things stood out as bothering me -- one is the simplistic inclusion of perfect, reliable birth control (\\"childbane\\") in the form of an easily obtainable type of berry. This is a bit much, even for a fantasy, and it's WAY too convenient as a plot device. Plus it completely undercuts Ms. Micklems theme of male domination -- women who have complete control of their fertility are not easily dominated, as the 20th century easily attests. <br /> <br />The second is all the violence against horses. This is not the most violent book I have ever read, by a long shot, and the level of violence is not inappropriate or badly written. However, I have never read anything where more violence is directed at EQUINES. Some of the scenes were almost too disturbing to read. Does Ms. Micklem have some unresolved horse issues? Again, like the overabundance of sex scenes, the overabundance of butchered and brutalized horses take your attention away from the plot, which is a little weak...perhaps because Ms. Micklem did not have the discipline to wrap her story up in one volume. <br /> <br />I hope in time Sarah Micklem tries her hand at a more original, standalone novel. She does indeed have talent...but talent without discipline is just wheels spinning in the dust.	2004-11-27

But \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" certainly isn't that kind of novel. It's overly long and painfully simplistic, and it sounds and feels like an easily shocked old man writing about those AWFUL young people nowadays....which sadly, is pretty much the sum total of it. <br /> <br />To some extent, \\"Charlotte Simmons\\" is Mr. Wolfe's sincere attempt to write in the voice of an 18 year old girl (when he himself is a 74 year old man). Certainly this could theoretically be done, but it just does not come off here. Mr. Wolfe just has no grasp on what it's like to be a woman, let alone a teenager in the early 21st century. He gets a lot of the sublte little details wrong -- college freshman who listen to Britney Spears? -- but mostly he just doesn't understand the inner workings of the female mind. <br /> <br />This novel would make more sense set in the 1950s, a period that Tom Wolfe probably knows a whole lot better. The plot is centered around Charlotte losing her virginity, a hopelessly quaint theme for a book...it reminded me of Herman Wouk's \\"Marjorie Morningstar\\", with it's old-fashioned concepts of virginity vs. sophistication. (BTW: dear readers, this event doesn't occur until 500 plus pages into the book.) This is just painfully out of touch with the realities of the present day -- most studies show that girls lose their virginity in their mid-teens. The \\"hooking up\\" that Mr. Wolfe describes with such horrified fascination is only a shocking phenonema in junior high school....it's standard operating procedure every place else. <br /> <br />He also has some loony, New York sophisticates idea of what life might be like in a small town in Rural Red State USA (Charlotte is from Sparta, North Carolina). Apparently, Mr.Wolfe doesn't realize that even the smallest burg in podunkiest state has television, MTV, movies (like, say \\"American Pie\\" or \\"There's Something about Mary\\"), fashion/gossip/advice magazines and so on. For better or worse, there is no one anymore who is this naive and unworldly. <br /> <br />I finished reading this with a profound sense of embarassment for the author. There is nothing sadder than seeing someone with the great talent and abilities of Tom Wolfe reduced to writing this kind of hyperbolic twaddle.	2004-11-09

Homes is an otherwise respected fiction novelist, and National Geographic magazine asked her to particpate in a series of non-fiction books, each one being an author's take on a particular city around the world. Ms. Homes requested Los Angeles. <br /> <br />In all fairness, I have not read the other books in the series (there are about 20 or so). But \\"Los Angeles: People, Places, and the Castle on the Hill\\" is a thin book (175 pages, in a small format) and is thinly written. It smacks of something written because the author had already accepted an advance and furthermore, was living high on the hog in the lavishly expensive Chateau Marmont hotel, so she had to produce SOMETHING. This is a pretty poor excuse for SOMETHING. <br /> <br />Ms. Homes has relied pretty heavily on the far better book about the Chateau, \\"Life at the Marmont\\", although she does not credit that book. (She does manage to...errr...capture numerous stories and quotes directly from it.) Although the Marmont is an interesting hotel, steeped in Hollywood history, A.M. Homes has nothing very interesting to say about it except how utterly comfy she was staying there....imagine how truly dull it would be to read about someone's vacation, and have the entire story be about the Holiday Inn or Ramada that they stayed in. Now just adjust the daily room rate upwards by about 10 times. <br /> <br />Bored and disinterested in LA (making the reader puzzled as to why she chose it as a subject), Ms. Homes narrative wanders and stumbles. At leat a dozen pages are devoted to why the author doesn't like flying...how choosy she is about what hotels she is willing to stay at (she often picks up and leaves if the \\"ambience\\" isn't just perfect) and so on. None of this is remotely related to the topic of Los Angeles. <br /> <br />Apparently unwilling to leave the comforts of the secluded Chateau Marmont, most of the book is contained in five genuinely dull first person interviews: one with a Beverly Hills mailman,another with a Beverly Hills mohel (rabbi who performs ritual circumsision), etc. For Ms. Homes, there is apparently no Los Angeles that exists outside of a few very well known zip codes, immediately adjacent to (yes, again) the fabulous Chateau Marmont. <br /> <br />If attempting to be a travelogue or a snapshot of an interesting and unique US city, this book is an embarassing failure. If I were the editor at the National Geographic, I would be pretty ashamed of handing this author cart blanche to laze around the pool, ordering room service and then turning out this kind of drivel.  <br /> <br />In conclusion: thin, boring fluff. And how can I get the National Geographic to underwrite my next vacation????	2004-11-08
US	50345497	RDY57DQ7N5IWN	0805076123	579116737	The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll: The Search for Dare Wright	Books	5	46	53	N	N	Compelling and remarkable book on an unusual subject	I was interested in this book, because I am a doll collector and like the author Jean Nathan, I recall \\"Edith The Lonely Doll\\" from my childhood. I had no inkling of the strange and bizarre life of the author, Dare Wright -- presumably no one outside her small circle of friends and family could have known anything much about her. Without Ms. Nathan's interest -- remarkably she began investigating book and author just before Ms.Wright passed away enabling her to get photos and personal reminiscences that otherwise would have disappeared -- this would be a lost chapter in the history of children's literature. Bravo to Ms. Nathan for discovering and exploring this. <br /> <br />I simply could not put the book down.  If Dare Wright's life were fiction, you would dismiss it out of hand as overblown, exaggerated and unbelievable. A beautiful model and gifted photographer, she lived in the shadow of her dominating mother (herself a hugely successful society painter) and was incapable of having a normal relationship with a man....excepting her obsessive, almost incestuous relationship with her brother Blaine. <br /> <br />As a child, I was fascinated by the Lonely Doll books although I never was given one to own. I must have read them at the library or book store, though, because I recall them very clearly. (Dare Wright produced sequels right up into the early 80s.) I was particularly fascinated by the concept of photographing dolls with props, which Ms. Wright accomplished with rare feeling and subtlety in black and white. I know as a youngster I tried to do the same with my Barbie's -- not an easy task! Ms. Wright had an very large and especially beautiful and photographic Lenci doll from her childhood to work with. Hearing the details of Dare Wright's astonishing and disturbing life makes the story of \\"The Lonely Doll\\" incredibly haunting and meaningful in a way I could have never seen it before. <br /> <br />There are a couple of books I recommend if you share my fascination with this: Lois Gould's \\"Mommy Dressing\\" about a very similar mother whose obsession with fashion and role playing was so destructive to the mother/child relationship. Anyone fascinated with dolls will also want to read Kate Summerscale's \\"Queen of Whale Cay\\", which is also about an eccentric woman who had an obsessive relationship with a large doll, who she dressed up and photographed much as Dare Wright did with her Lenci doll. <br /> <br />In addition, the remarkable and astonishing photographs that accompany the text in \\"Secret Life of the Lonely Doll\\" reminded me that the image of Edith the doll haunted me so much that at the age of 18 -- with my first earned money from a part time job -- I purchased not a stereo or concert tickets or clothes, but a Sasha Morgenthaler doll. Although no relation to Lenci, Dare Wright or Edith, the resemblance of these \\"Sasha\\" dolls to \\"The Lonely Doll\\" is astonishing -- same size, same hairdo, same gingham dress. I have never seen this resemblance commented on and I never even noticed it myself until I read this book....yet I feel quite certain that my purchase was spurred (like Ms. Nathan's of her literary subject) by some ancient memory of reading \\"Edith The Lonely Doll\\"!	2004-09-29
US	50345497	RC9GA8PVHIBXX	1594200165	954255446	Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier	Books	2	178	202	N	N	Sadistic and confusing	I was very unclear about how to rate this book. It's brilliantly written and about a subject -- the brutality of the war in Rhodesia and the human fallout from it -- that we don't know much about in the US. It's an amazing, up-close picture of a desolate part of Africa, that is nonetheless teeming with life and interesting individuals. <br /> <br />But there is a kind of patent dishonesty going on here that clouds the book's best intentions and the author's considerable storytelling gifts. The story is straightforwardly presented as authobiographical, but Ms. Fuller is incredibly stingy with revealing herself (while she virtually guts her subject, the former White Rhodesian soldier she calls \\"K\\"). In order to get \\"K\\" to open up to her and tell his absolutely wrenching, devasting story, Ms. Fuller manipulates him in an unusually cruel way -- she allows him to fall in love with her (even though she is a married woman with two children back in the US) and continues her deception throughout a long road trip, during which he confides his darkest secrets to her, believing that she is \\"the one\\" -- the perfect mate sent to him by God to heal his loneliness and his pain. <br /> <br />Although the stories of military violence, racism and horrific African poverty are deeply affecting, I was profoundly disturbed at the way Alexandra Fuller obtained K's life story. In many respects, she hurt and victimized this terribly damaged man in ways that are psychologically worse than violence -- by betraying his trust. (When I was in high school, there was a not-very-nice term for women who use their sexuality to keep men on a string.) Furthermore, Ms. Fuller is coy enough not to let us know if the attraction was at all mutual or what the state of her marriage was. After all, she has left her husband and children back in Wyoming...it matters a great deal to the reader if she is purely a writer in search of a story (however manipulative) or if she is actually a unhappy wife looking for apotential lover. This unspoken story nagged at me, especially the last part of the book where Ms. Fuller actively begins a flirtacious relationship with ANOTHER ex-soldier...basically trivializing not only her mysterious marriage but her confusing relationship to \\"K\\". <br /> <br />The last time I was so distracted from the content of a non-fiction book by the actions of the author was Kathryn Harrison's \\"The Kiss\\", about that author's adult love affair with her own biological father. As bad as incest is, somehow Alexandra Fuller's deceptive and cruel manipulation of \\"K\\" to get a clever and unusual story bothers me even more. Certainly it should make the reader think about just how far it is reasonable or moral for a writer to go to obtain material for a book...does the fact that \\"K\\" had a truly fascinating story to tell mean that it was OK to use him and to break his heart? <br /> <br />In conclusion, I found this story to be sadistic and disturbing, although the author is a fine writer and superb storyteller, she has a lot of work to do in developing a conscience.	2004-08-18
US	50345497	R2LEUW2RZLZFND	0525947671	7966085	The Lady and the Unicorn	Books	1	25	38	N	N	Choppy, uneven, disappointing...	It's easy to imagine that &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; sounded better as a proposal to Ms. Chevalier's publishers than it actually turned out. After all, Tracy Chevalier scored a fabulous hole-in-one with her &quot;Girl with A Pearl Earring&quot;, an interesting look at the obscure painter Vermeer through the eyes of his servant girl.<br /><br /> Once again, the author has picked a piece of famous art familar to anyone who ever took a college art history class and come up with a background story about how it might have been created. Almost nothing is known about the &quot;Unicorn&quot; tapestries, except the name of the family that commissioned them in the late 15th century, so there was little to restrict the direction of the story.<br /><br /> But this is a choppy and boring tale, with many anachronisms that are jarring. Unable to focus in on a particular character (like Griet in &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring), Ms. Chevalier jumps between six different characters, making it hard to follow. There is little the writing to distinguish which of the characters is &quot;speaking&quot; and I found I had to continually skip back to see whose chapter it was (the typesetting could have included headers with the names of the characters, which would have been very helpful, but alas not). The main character SEEMS to be Nicolas Des Innocentes, a Renaissance painter of miniatures who designs the tapestries and who is a notorious womanizer, but he is drawn so vapidly that I couldn't even figure out how old he was supposed to be -- young horndog or middle-aged lecher?<br /><br /> There is a family of weavers, including a blind young girl who improbably is able to WEAVE and distinguish colors by feel (I have a hard time accepting this) and a noblewoman and her 14-year old daughter. There is a feeling throughout the book that the author wants to show how lustful the female characters are -- to counterbalance the seductiveness of Nicholas -- but this comes off as much too contemporary. The book fails to address the sheltered, deeply religious society that existed in the 1400s and also fails to deal with the serious ramifications of illegitmacy. Because we accept female sexuality today and happily embrace children born out of wedlock, that does NOT mean this was the case hundreds of years ago. Political correctness does not make for a good or convincing historical novel.<br /><br /> The least I would have wanted from &quot;Lady and the Unicorn&quot; would have been a detailed introduction to the intricacies of tapestry weaving and the lives of the people who did this incredibly detailed work, day in and day out, for generations. But the book falls flat on this account...the description of the actual weaving is so vague that I wondered if the author was describing WEAVING or embroidery.<br /><br /> There are about dozen too many references to the sexual iconography of the Unicorn (his &quot;horn&quot; being a symbolic penis) and the euphemism &quot; to plow&quot; is used far too often to describe sexual intercourse. I didn't find the book as coarse as some other reviewers did -- I thought the actual love scenes were pretty tame stuff -- but they are emphasized over and above character development or even the story of the making of the tapestry.<br /><br /> I think one flaw as compared to the far better &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is that Vermeer, for all his mystery, was a real person. Nicholas Des Innocents is an obvious, one-note invention. As a real human being, Vermeer had a home, wife, children...not just his paintings. Nicholas doesn't convince us as a painter or artist, and doesn't seem multi-faceted enough to keep us intrigued in his story. He's like a caricature of the artist as a horny reprobate, a social outsider without ties to the larger community. Actually, that is another pretty modern concept -- the artist as outsider -- and not particularly true in the Renaissance, when an artist was as likely to be married and have a family as a carpenter or other craftsman.<br /><br /> The worst flaw that just kept nagging at me though was this -- the young noblewoman, Claude (who is so sexually precocious you'd think she was from Beverly Hills and not 15th century France) refers to her pet bird as a &quot;parakeet&quot;. Parakeets are indigenous to Australia. I am pretty certain they did not exist in Europe until the 19th century. This is an annoying piece of very poor research on the author's part, and indicative of the poor scholarship and historical feel of the whole book.<br /><br /> In conclusion: not recommended...there are much better historical books about this period out there.kely to be married and have a family as a carpenter or other craftsman. <br />  <br /> The worst flaw that just kept nagging at me though was this -- the young noblewoman, Claude (who is so sexually precocious you'd think she was from Beverly Hills and not 15th century France) refers to her pet bird as a &quot;parakeet&quot;.

US	50345497	R1KMF0RYM0XO8U	0345447603	459337150	Trading in Danger	Books	1	11	23	N	N	Very bland and unoriginal space opera	I am not familiar with Elizabeth Moon, although I see from amazon.com that she has written numerous books and won a Nebula. So I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that this is not her best effort. I hope not.<br />Some commercial reviewers seem to suggest that this is a book for junior high or high school students, rather than adults, and to some degree the unchallenging plot and simplistic characters would indicate this. But I think \\"Trading in Danger\\" is far too dull for teens raised on sci fi like \\"Star Wars\\", \\"The Matrix\\" and video games. It harkens back to the simple early militaristic fiction of Heinlein (but not remotely as good). Ms. Moon seems very obviously to be influenced by Lois McMaster Bujold and her Vorkosigan series, only with a female heroine. <br />But if intended for an adult reader, this book is not nearly challenging, sophisticated or adult enough. (For one thing, it is utterly devoid of any sexual content.) Many very conventional elements of space travel, a space-based military and space-based merchant marine -- things that might have come over as snappy and clever in the 50s -- are now completely tame and accepted components of such familiar stuff as \\"Star Trek\\". This is ground that has been very thoroughly gone over by much better writers and filmmakers.<br />The only possible way to overcome this would be through A.) a wonderful, engaging protagonist and excellent supporting characters, B.) witty and clever dialogue, or C.) unusually well developed and surprsing plot points. Nothing like that here. All the characters are stock denizens of a thousand other books. Kylara Vatta, the heroine, is a one dimensional and unconvincing creation. If I didn't know for a fact that Elizabeth Moon is a woman, I'd imagine this was the half-baked effort of a man trying to write a woman character. Kylara's career ambitions, family relations, even her out-of-the-plot boyfriend simply don't ring true.<br />For what ever reason, this feels like a tired re-tread that someone has produced to fulfill a contract (3 more books or whatever) since she is indeed an award winner, and not something that comes from the heart or the imagination.<br />I'd like to say for the record that when I was a youngster, reading the classic sci fi of the period (and watching Star Trek on TV), I wanted most desperately female heroines who were main characters and who were clever, strong and active. I so wanted to see female starship captains and leaders. It's quite ironic that the feminism of the 70s and 80s produced such fiction, and that in fact, it's a hundred times more boring, predictable, flat, lifeless and dry than all the \\"macho\\" fiction I had to sit through as a youngster. THIS SHOULDN'T BE SO. Certainly in mainstream literature there is no problem with female heroines -- why in sci fi? And why is it that the women writers are the worst of the pack in this regard?<br />A book like \\"Trading in Danger\\" should have never be put in print. The author or her publisher should have recognized it for the boring re-tread that it is, and started over....	2004-06-08
US	50345497	RGWYWA8N0CQSC	0671578286	644110908	Cordelia's Honor	Books	2	32	94	N	N	Space Soap Opera	I know that Lois McMaster Bujold has many fans and nothing I can say here would remotely change their opinion. \\"Cordelia's Honor\\" is a trade paperback combo of her books \\"Shards of Honor\\" ('86) and \\"Barrayar\\" ('91); the latter being a Hugo Award winner.<br />Of the two books, \\"Shards of Honor\\" is considerably better although both books are badly flawed. For readers under 40, it's helpful to know than in the late 70s/early 80s, there was a real push for more feminism in Sci Fi, women starship captains, active women characters, political correctness...all of which was needed to counteract the old Sci Fi of the 50s and 60s which was written by, for and about men. And don't think I wasn't in favor of all this...I was as rabid on this issue as a Women's Studies professor at Berkeley, LOL! But most books that came out of this political/feminist agenda are just not very good and these two by Lois Bujold are an excellent example of why.<br />For starters, this just barely qualifies as Sci Fi due to the presence of other planets, starships, faster than light travel and so on. Clearly the thrust of the books is the conflict between the modern sterile society of Beta Colony (Cordelia's home planet -- read as \\"USA\\") and the backwards, violant society of Barrayar (Vorkosigan's home planet -- read as Russia, pre-Soviet). There is next to nothing about other worlds in this imaginary universe or even how far in the future it is supposed to be taking place. Ms. Bujold is stolidly uninterested in sci fi technology, science or gadgetry (even though Cordelia is nominally a scientist), so there is virtually nothing here that is speculative about a possible future society. In fact, the whole thing reads as more of a New World/Old World clash, and by that I don't mean planets, I mean the words as they define America vs. Europe.<br />Barrayar is impossible to see as anything but a conventional, Old World European society (circa pre-WWI), what with its Emperor, castles, courtiers, and nobility. The WORST thing I feel Ms. Bujold does in this whole series is the adaptation of the pre-fix \\"Vor\\" to all the noble Barrayaran surnames. It is all too painfully obvious that this reads as the word \\"War\\" as pronounced by someone with a very heavy Eastern European accent -- you know, someone who prounces all the \\"w's\\" like \\"v's\\". It's just plain embarassing. Furthermore, it makes sorting out the characters -- at least half have \\"Vor-\\" names -- unusally difficult.<br />While a good love story in a Sci Fi setting would be very welcome, and Cordelia and Vorkosigan are appealingly written, their romance comes off as a standard Harlequin model. Vorkosigan in particular seems cut from a very familar bolt of cloth...the one marked \\"Mr. Rochester (Jane Eyre\\". He's gruff but deeply romantic, and falls in love with the heroine (who is a plain Jane) almost instantly, asking for her hand in marriage before they ever make love or even kiss. Don't forget his flashing grey eyes because they are mentioned every few chapters.<br />While the first book is so clean and non-sexual (with one exception I will get to later) it is suitable for 12 year old readers, in the second book Ms. Bujold attempts to tackle more adult relationships with very weak results. The worst of it is a romance between two servants, called improbably Drou (DROO) and Kou (KOO)...just try saying that aloud. It's full of all kinds of cute misunderstandings right out of a TV sitcom. (And ends happily in a wedding of course.)<br />The descriptions of artificial wombs -- very critical to the plot -- is handled so poorly that you can hardly imagine how they work...and how would you end up having something that sophisticated in a universe where the 33 year old heroine is seriously worried about having a baby because she feels she's \\"getting too old\\"? Lots of reproductive tech on one hand...none on the other.<br />That brings me to the factor that annoyed me the most. Ms. Bujold, working in every hip, PC plot thread she could, has the hero Vorkosigan being bisexual...sort of. He has an early arranged marriage, and when his wife cheats on him with two lovers, he challenges the two lovers to duels and kills them. Subsequently, his wife commits suicide (?). But then, very inexplicably, he enters into a long term homosexual relationship with an older, powerful man. Because of his grief over his wife's suicide or his upset over her infidelity or both. Then when he meets the heroine, it's back to heterosexuality for him, without a look back!<br />I can only think that the author felt she was being very cool, sophisticated and up-to-the-minute (in '86) with this detail. It's referenced once in each book and then not really gone into, although I think in REAL LIFE, this would be AWFULLY important. Trust me, people who flip back and forth between sexual preferences are usually confused and very troubled. And there is nothing romantic about that. We hear nothing at all to explain why Vorkosigan wanted a male lover, or what the heck made him decide he liked women better after all (besides how terrific Cordelia is). It also plays into a dangerous and untrue stereotype that homosexuality isn't \\"real\\" and all it takes it the \\"right\\" woman to put a guy back on the track. Just very, very disturbing and I see that none of the other reviewers here even mention it.<br />Beyond that, despite some decent adventure scenes, you are in familar territory here that has been well mined (one might say \\"strip mined) by Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. Lots of ball gowns, dinner dances, horseback riding, swords that sounds like light sabers and gibberish about politics. Whenever anyone in any Sci Fi starts talking about \\"emperors\\" or \\"high council meetings\\", my eyelids get very heavy.<br />I find these books just terribly overrated. There are some good stories still to be told about strong women in Sci Fi -- and these are NOT them. In a couple of decades, this kind of writing will be very dated to the 80s period because of the tired references and sexual attitudes.	2004-05-26
US	50345497	R2AP3DG2GK379	0786247088	71899998	Fallen From Grace	Books	2	5	19	N	N	Romance novel misleading packaged as mainstream	I picked this up at the library because it was shelved with the mainstream fiction...was quite surprised a few pages into it to discover it was just a Romance novel. The publisher must think it's pretty nifty stuff to believe it can find an audience outside of the traditional paperback Romance market...it does tackle a bit more unusual story (a male prostitute and his 9 yrs older girlfriend) than a standard Romance, but unfortunately the quality of the actual writing and characterization are woefully lacking.<br />I am giving two stars only because I think it IS commendable to at least try to write Romance novels for women readers that are \\"outside the box\\", i.e., not so trite and corny and predictable. Ms. Leone has the most success with main character Ryan, who although perfect looking and perfect in temperment, has an unusual profession and personal history. She falls painfully flat, however, with the female protagonist -- Sara is acutely one dimensional and unbelievable as a Jewish novelist in her mid-thirties. I can't figure out why this would present a problem to the author, as she is apparently writing about someone quite similar to herself and this can't be very difficult and yet Sara is far less fully developed than Ryan, and it's not possible to really care about this character or worry if she and Ryan will get together at the end.<br />Unlike most traditional Romances, this one (again probably the reason for marketing it as mainstream) has more than the average sexual situations, graphic love scenes and use of the F-word. However, it quickly reverts to standard formula as the characters fall effortlessly in love, have awesome sex, and all problems melt away as they plan their wedding.<br />There was some real potential here if the author had had the courage to really write a honest story about male prostitution -- unfortunatly most of the data about the phenomena seems to be gleamed from the 70s movie \\"American Gigolo\\", i.e., phony as a three dollar bill-- and it's aftereffects, and been less consumed by the need to create the perfect love story.<br />The neat resolution of all problems -- prostitution, lesbianism, older woman/younger man, interrelgious marriage -- into a tidy package also throws things well into that ABC After School special category, which is about as Romantic or sexy as orthopedic shoes.<br />Packaging this as a mainstream, serious novel was misleading! I doubt I would have ever picked this up if it had been properly identified as a Romance novel.	2004-03-03

This book comes off as clear cut, out-and-out rip- off of the show. It's set in Las Vegas, about the Police Crime Lab (forensics) and features as the protagonist a single mom with a cute six year old daughter...hmmm, sound familar, anybody?<br />Even if Ms. Jaffe honestly came up with this idea BEFORE the TV series was created, some changes should have been made to the book at the editorial state to avoid the obvious comparisons and the overwhelming sense that it's just a &quot;rip off&quot;. <br />Ms. Jaffe is a better writer than this and should be embarrassed! &quot;Bad Girl&quot; reads like a piece of fan fiction with just the names changed. When the No. 1 TV series in the US is about the Las Vegas Forensics lab, you really have to excercise more judgement than this if you choose to write about the same topic.<br />In short: embarrassing.	2004-02-10

Remember the old &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine and how they used to do articles about how various women had a &quot;click&quot; moment where their sensibilities about feminism snapped into place? Well, PODKAYNE OF MARS was my click moment. It made me a feminist. The year was 1963, and this was a brand new book by one of my favorite sci fi authors and it was about a girl! A girl who wanted to be a starship captain! I had to wait weeks for the book to come in, and rushed home to read it.<br />Imagine my disappointment! I could literally spend all day just pointing out the bad spots -- the lame characterizations, dull expository, lecturing, etc. But of course the worst thing here is that the book is utterly demeaning to young women. Poddy is a painful charicture of a teenager, with all kinds of agonizingly cute mannerisms. She actually thinks of herself as &quot;an astonished kitten&quot;, and never interacts with a man, not even her elderly great uncle without knowingly flirting. <br />I have absolutely nothing against a book about a young woman who wishes to become a mother or raise children -- it's a perfeclty noble ambition. But why set us up for an adventurous tale about a girl starship captain and then have her be this simpering little priss?<br />Obviously Heinlein was bored with Poddy by the end of the first chapter and really wanted to tell the story of her bratty brother. Did some editor press him into writing a story for girls, when he really had no interest? (He never did write female characters particularly well, and we are all aware of his atavistic attitudes towards women in general.)<br />The story is plenty bad in other ways...there is no real plot or conflict. Mainly, Poddy, Clark and Uncle Tom travel to Venus on a luxury starship reminiscent of the QEII and mainly full of dull, rich elderly people. When she isn't flirting with older men (yeeccch) the &quot;astonished kitten&quot; is looking after babies in a nursery mainly for the &quot;lower class&quot; steerage type passengers. This activity is what causes her to change her mind about being a space pilot -- after &quot;who would hire a female pilot, even if you were four times better than a man?&quot; -- and decide maybe she will be a pediactric nurse instead. (God forbid, she think about being an actual PEDIATRICIAN.) Or maybe she will get into space travel by MARRYING a pilot.<br />On top of all this, there is little that is interesting in a sci fi context -- the ship seems like an ordinary ocean liner, the Venusville setting doesn't seem much different than contemporary Las Vegas.<br />So what is the point? Just to slam the ambitions of young female readers and point them firmly towards motherhood? Even worse is the treatment of Poddy's parents, who get a firm talking-to, courtesy of Uncle Tom (as mouthpiece for Heinlein himself), letting them know they are awful parents because they allow a 16 year old girl to travel with her brother and uncle and presumably don't keep her at home with a full time mom. Clearly they are the cause of her death (or awful accident)!!! Poddy's mom's wonderful career is built up and then largely made fun of or dismissed.<br />The whole &quot;ending&quot; controversy is blown out of proportion. So Poddy is either dead...or in a vegative coma. So what? If she wasn't, we'd have to gang up and kill her ourselves.<br />One of the rare books that really ought to be burnt in your basement incinerator. Not suitable for anyone of any age.	2003-12-05

It's nothing special in terms of the writing, characterization, etc. but would appeal to a young girl who is horse crazy. The heroine, Sandra, does lots of riding and has numerous adventures crossing the terrain of the modern West (including things like state parks and highways) and gets to deliver a foal. The flaws are that the characters are very flat and dialogue unexceptional. The author, a middle-aged man, doesn't have the skill to write in the authentic voice of a 19 year old girl or even make us feel her love of horses, the beautiful scenery etc. But as someone who adored horses as a young girl, any horse story would have captured my interest, so this might well appeal to a girl (or even a boy) ages about 10-14. There is a OOP 1979 film version of this book called &quot;Wild Horse Hank&quot;, starring Linda Blair, but it's very hard to find.	2003-11-02

They had more of a place years ago when people did automatically buy videos or DVDs, and once your favorite film left the cineplex, you might not see it again for years...so the novelization would let you &quot;relive&quot; the film. That's not necessary anymore, so the only function they can have is to fill-in information that might have been left on the cutting room floor.<br />A.C. Crispin makes a sincere effort with &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, and it doesn't read too badly. It does fall short of a real novel in it's dramatic structure and characterization. She makes a token attempt to fill in backgrounds, even first names, for characters who in the film often are killed off before we get a chance to know them. (Personally, I think this is a flaw in the movie, as we can't possibly care about the death of a character we have barely been introduced to.)<br />Since the novelization came out at virtually the same time as the film was released, I am guessing that it had to be written before viewing the finished film and that it is largely based on older versions of the script and maybe rough cuts of the movie. There are numerous deviations from the finished film, none of them cosmically important but if you enjoy certain bits of dialogue -- especially some of the very humorous throw-away lines -- it is disconcerting to see them stated differently or clipped or just dropped entirely.<br />What I was hoping for WAS that the novelization would fill in some of the critical information gaps in the film -- especially Call's motivation in joining the smuggler crew of the Betty and heading out to the Auriga to destroy the alien breeding experiment. This is confusingly told in the film. If Call is so concerned about the Betty crew, why doesn't she do something to prevent them from ever kidnapping the cryo-sleepers BEFORE they reach the Auriga? Why does she allow all the cryo-sleepers to be impregated and killed? Wouldn't it have been simpler for her to have joined the crew of the Auriga and sabotaged the experiement from within the military? Anyways, I will have to live with the ambivalence (or Joss Whedon's slightly wobbly, undercooked script) because the novelization provides no real answers.<br />Still, most novelizations I have read are complete and utter dreck and this one definitely is not. I think it's a serious attempt to create a companion piece to the film. I just wish the author had stuck with the details a little more clearly.	2003-10-14
US	50345497	R27I0SITCVYS2V	0743444043	812381526	Double Dealer (CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION)	Books	2	3	5	N	N	Fair but nothing special	I got this at the library book sale, so I don't feel as bad as if I had paid full price. It's not a bad effort to capture the essence of the TV show -- Max Collins is a real author and he's taken the time to get the details of how each character speaks and the basic personality traits. (Although there are some odd details...for example, he insists that Grissom dresses entirely and always in black, something which my color TV set completely refutes!)<br />However, this particular novel (I have read all three)has a particularly absurd ending. I won't give it away, but it shows a complete lack of undertstanding about the division in our country of responsibility between state and federal government, and implies that our CSIs are so wonderful that they can bend and twist these laws to their will. It's really dumb and spoils what the rest of the book has -- a plot that otherwise so comforms to the series, it could easily be filmed as an actual script.<br />The downside is that this is a NOVEL not a script. I had hoped for a little more, i.e., an inside look at maybe some history behind the characters, inner thoughts and motivation, background etc. The novel format demands more of a writer than a screenplay for a 45 minute TV episode, and the reader has a right to EXPECT more. All Mr. Collins manages here is that the characters occasionally use a four letter word not permitted on network TV.<br />If you absolutely love CSI, then any of these three books will &quot;feed your need&quot; as they do read like extra unfilmed episodes. But don't expect anything richer or more complex, and definitely don't buy them expecting the weight and complexity of a real novel.	2003-09-14
US	50345497	R2SZ3XWOHTTI4H	0679730338	894042294	Keep the Change	Books	3	8	10	N	N	Quirky, well written book worth a look	I picked this up at yard sale for a quarter, so my expectations were pretty low. At first, I thought it was flaky, but after I got into it, it's really quite funny with very sharp dialogue and memorable characters. An interesting view of the modern West, without sentimentality. Joe Starling is a womanizing artist, who can't keep out of trouble with women or his pants zipped so to speak. He returns home to Montana imagining getting back to his roots, but women problems and family problems derrail his plans. <br />If there is a flaw, it's that Joe is completely unbelievable as a painter -- it just seems like a device to work into the story. He doesn't talk or act like an artist, nor does the beauty of Big Sky country cause him to do as much as break out a pencil to sketch all through the novel. The author  might just as well have made him a used car salesman.<br />But the dialogue is sharp and funny, and his raunchy misadventures with old girlfriend Ellen and live-in lover Astrid have a nice sexy charge to them.<br />A different kind of novel and one I would probably re-read just to enjoy the quality of the writing.	2003-09-07
US	50345497	R1WOVQU3V3NRJA	067174433X	981922185	Domestic Life: A Novel in Parts	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Confusing and undisciplined first novel	I guess Ms. Webb had (or knew someone closely who had) a \\"bad seed\\" stepdaughter, and this novel was her therapy in working it out. Not that it isn't a real problem, but this book reads like it was written by someone who had never lived in Houston or Texas, or maybe even Planet Earth and definitely was NEVER an artist, painter or worked in a museum!!!<br /> On a low-paying museum job, the heroine Ellen manages to collect valuable antiques, travel to Italy, own priceless oriental rugs and pottery, drive a recent model Jaguar and live in a 4000 square foot mansion. Her  lazy musician boyfriend suddenly straightens up after a lifetime of slacking at the age of about 39 and gets a high paying \\"straight job\\" so she can stay at home with their baby and \\"paint\\". HA!<br />The real rancor and bitterness of the stepmom-stepkid-original wife triad is certainly there, although it never achieves any understanding or depth, just catalogues the many indignities and frustrations that Ellen endures from Kenny's wife Raylene. (Imagine! Raylene dares to park in their driveway when dropping off her daughter for visitation!)<br />Dumbest angle by far is the idea that a mean-minded wife could prevent a divorce by the stubborn-but-stupid tactics that Raylene uses to frustrate Ellen and laid back Kenny. Sorry, that stuff hasn't been true in decades. Hasn't the author heard of no-fault divorce? You can get divorced and still continue haggling over child custody afterwords, as many do. Apparently among the real-life experiences the author has never dealt with is a real-life divorce.<br />The ending is especially dumb and frustrating...after years of living together unmarried because of the bad seed stepdaughter...Ellen's patient attorney's (running up what would be a crippling mountain of fees in real life) finally trick Raylene into signing for a divorce, and then little Tenny Lou immediately decides she doesn't want any part of Dad and Step-mom and never sees them again! SO what was the point of all that sturm and drang and suffering anyways?<br />Also the book is frustrating because it is written aimless out of sequence...it's very hard to figure out what is happening when, how old the children are and where things are going or have gone already? Too bad, there is a real point here about stepparenting and stepkids and it's lost in the sloppy execution of this book.	2003-09-01

What a disapointment! I have read the first two books, and thought they were OK but you can see the material (mostly fresh in the first book) getting staler and more tired with each outing.<BR>Same old characters...Ms. Trigiani kills off one character per book, I guess. She doesn't introduce any new or challenging characters. Everyone -- Iva Lou, Spec, Pearl, Jack Mac -- make an appearance with absolutely nothing new to say. Many old scenes are revisited to no point (Ave Maria and Pete headed back to the blue bell field).<BR>I think this is just a money machine now for the author. Anything charming or authentic to the locale has been sucked dry. The characters seem old and tired, without nothing new about them to explore.<BR>One thing nobody talks about with this series, which I think is a real cheat, is how in each book Ave Maria and family get to take, not one, but several incredibly long, expensive Italian vacations.<BR>In the real world, in the REAL Big Stone Gap, about how often do you think this happens? Most of the people in this region live modestly. Even a pharmacist wouldn't be rich by any means (and Ave gave up ownership of her store and house -- improbably in my view -- in the first book). Even with relatives, just the plane fare for all these trips would be a fortune and that's not taking into consideration that they aren't normal two week vacations but whole summers.<BR>Honestly, the only people who can do this -- time AND moneywise -- are...rich authors and screenwriters, like say...Adriana Trigiani.<BR>It certainly tells us NOTHING about real life in Southwestern Virginia, to hear that these lucky individuals get to take mindbending shopping trips in the Italian Alps every few pages.<BR>In the first book, it was maybe excusable as Ave had just reconnected with her Italian family. But to incorporate into every book seems forced, improbable and more like Ms. Trigiani is bragging about her own luxurious lifestyle than telling us anything remotely believeable about life in a unique and distinctive part of the US.<BR>Yes, I get it...it's a fantasy. But the charm of the first book was that it was a sweet fantasy that incorporated a very real and distinctive view of the Big Stone Gap region. If the characters flounce off to New York and the Italian Alps all the time, you might as well be reading Jackie Collins.<BR>Adrianna Trigianni, it's time to move on. You have some writing talent, now give up Ave and write about something else for a change.	2003-04-03
US	50345497	RBQH92E5UGS0A	0618164723	392143634	Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World	Books	1	61	90	N	N	Prejudiced, one-sided and utterly lacking in compassion	Lo and behold, when I sat down to write this, I looked up and saw Mr. Critser on tv being interviewed for the Today show! Strange coincidence. However, it served to remind me that Mr. Critser's \\"epiphany\\" occured when, as a sedentary middled aged white guy, a rude bystander called him \\"fatso.\\" He was humiliated, and this spurred him to diet...the kind of simple low-carb, no-beer-and-snacks diet that works very well for most MEN (but not women) producing a quick weight loss that returned the author to a normal weight.<br />Like the typical fanatical convert, he is now empowered to criticize and look down on ALL overweight people no matter what their circumstances, and judge them as lazy and gluttonous. (He pays scant lip service to the idea that genetics might somehow and in some way be involved.) He jumps on the popular current bandwagon that most American obesity can be traced to supersized meals at McDonald's --- as if everybody ate there all the time!<br />His very valuable information on the inclusion of Palm Oil and High Fructose Corn syrup in the American diet starting in the early 70s and poor government policy regarding corn production get buried under the tons of jibes against ordinary people who happen to have a weight problem. Mr. Critser apparently believes that the overweight don't even deserve to have clothing that fits, because they should be in a maximum state of embarassment and humilation at all times until they lose weight (after all, Mr. Critser didn't lose weight until HE was humiliated).<br />Much blame is laid at the feet of the self esteem movement. Obviously all overweight people should be called names, embarassed in public places and discriminated against...it will get them motivated to diet! Bullies, are you listening? It's open season to call fat people names and insult them PLUS you can feel good about yourself because you are only encouraging them to diet!<br />THe reality is that bariatic science (the real medical research into obesity) is still so new that scientists and doctors don't even know how normal-weight individuals maintain their size, let alone why some people get fat and others stay slender. Clearly genes AND environment play a role, but it is very unclear what that role is.<br />Nobody needs to reinforce how utterly miserable the obese are. The biggest point that I take with Mr. Critser is that he seems to feel that obese people LIKE being heavy and want to continue this way if only they aren't picked on. WRONG WRONG WRONG! I have never known an overweight individual who wasn't terribly unhappy being fat. The social stigmatism...lack of opportunities for dating and romantic relationships...discrimination at jobs etc. Despite what Mr. Critser seems to see, no fat woman really has the choice to either BUY or WEAR really attractive, fashionable clothing (although the situation is improved since the grim old days -- that he wants to return to -- where a fat woman was pretty much forced to sew all her own clothing.)<br />Along with the large fast food portions, we also live in a culture which constantly shows us extremely thin, anorexic models and actresses and holds them up as a role model. This has also changed since the 70s. Just look at a re-run of any common TV show from the 60s on Nickelodeon. The \\"good looking\\" women featured are positively PLUMP by today's standards! Today they could never even get an audition! The present standard for extreme thinness makes even normal-sized women feel fat and inadequate and sends them on crackpot diets. HOw much does this failure to measure up to an artifically thin standard of beauty contribute to many women descending into a cycle of extreme dieting and binge eating? with the end result a weight problem? not to mention self-hatred? <br />This is a selfish and self-serving book, mostly written to make Mr. Critser feel better about his own weight loss and freeing him to ridicule those that can't lose weight the way he did. You won't understand the obesity problem any better after having read this and there is a serious risk that those already lacking in compassion will be encouraged to be more prejudiced, to ridicule more, to call names and feel Ok about their mean spirited behavior. Shame on you, Greg Critser!!!	2003-01-18
US	50345497	R1RPUHMAPFFL6Y	0345445848	287871634	Big Cherry Holler: A Novel (Big Stone Gap)	Books	2	8	14	N	N	Sappy and VERY disapointing	I have to admit I have not read BIG STONE GAP, which sounds like the superior of the two books. I saw Ms. Trigiani on the Today show, and she seemed charming and articulate, so when I was on a long drive through W. Va and Virginia recently, I took along the audio version of BIG CHERRY HOLLER.<br />I hardly know where to begin with my disillusionment...FIRST, very sloppy. Just read the reviews...was Ave married 8 years? 10 years? or what? Sometimes Etta is 8 and sometimes she is ten and wearing lip gloss. (The action of the book takes place over about 6 months.)<br />How can Ave have been a spinster (in this day and age), when at the time of Big Cherry Holler, she says she is 42, and ten years earlier when she married Jack Mac she would have been all of 32? Huh? Since when does being only 32 make you a spinster? (Don't any of these hicks get HBO and watch Sex in the City?)<br />Although losing a child IS an awful tragedy, in this book it feels like it was just stuck in to give some motivation for the estrangement of Jack Mac and Ave. It doesn't feel authentic. It seems like a cheat, also, because all the action involved with the loss of their son has happened years before the book opens, yet Ave doesn't refer to it until quite late in the novel. (I might add, it's awful convenient that their son got sick and died in only six days, instead of what usually happens with a sick child, i.e., years of doctors and hospitals.)<br />I can hardly bear to detail the other awful cliches and corniness -- Ave gets a hair cut and it turns her from a plain Jane ex-spinster into an Italian sexpot who instantly finds a handsome admirer. (Get me that hairdresser!) Instead of boring and unimpressive parents, Ave has a fantasy birth-father who is a rich Italian living near the Alps, who lavishes her with love and attention after not being in her life for 35 years -- fortunately he has never married or had another family in that time! Her long vacation in Italy comes after chapter& chapters of how Jack Mac was laid off and she has to go back to work, money troubles etc. and yet she can whiz off to Italy for months!<br />But the absolute WORST is that (with her super hair cut and some INCREDIBLE lipstick), Ave finds a flirtacious relationship in Italy with a handsome American. But she is overwhelmed with guilt, even though nothing is ever consumated. Her husband clearly has an affair during this time with a colleague...but it's AVE who is guilty and must make amends.<br />Anyone who finds the sullen, incommunicative Jack Mac appealing and romantic needs some serious therapy. If this was a real world relationship, the stone-faced Jack Mac and live-wire Ave would have never hooked up, or they would be long since divorced!<br />Corny, boring, overly \\"cute\\", and with attitudes towards women (spinsters! I mean, really!) that belong in the Middle Ages, the worst horror was when I finished the audio tapes, put them back into the box (after about 9 hours of listening) and read: \\"This is an ABRIDGED version of the book!\\"  ARRRGGHH. Read at your own risk.	2002-07-27
US	50345497	R3GS2782TWHTKT	0451202503	251893357	The Songcatcher	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Try the audio version to hear the song &quot;Rowan Stave&quot;	Firstly, readers should know that this is NOT the book that the recent movie &quot;Songcatcher&quot; is based on. That's what I thought when I picked up the audio version, and boy was I confused for the first couple hours.<br />Secondly, the audio version contains lovely sung versions of the pivotal song &quot;The Rowan Stave&quot;, which is not a real vintage song but instead a facsimile created by the author and some musician friends. (It's available along with other period music from the book on CD.) However, it's so beautifully done that it is very convincing as a genuine 18th century folk ballad.<br />The audio version also includes an afterword by Sharyn McCrumb that explains that the story of Malcolm McQuarry is an actual history of her own distant relative coming to the Appalachians in the mid-1800s. It's such an incredible story that during the reading, I had dismissed it as somewhat fantastic, which shows you that truth is often stranger than fiction.<br />I had the priviledge of hearing this tape during a long drive through W. Virginia and Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. A perfect setting! Although somewhat overlong and possibly 2-3 too many characters and plot strings to be a real classic, it's still a &quot;good read&quot; and the music very haunting. A part of our history and cultural heritage that is much overlooked by those of us who live in other parts of the US. It definitely made me want to know more about this area and it's history, and I was sorry when it ended.	2002-07-21
US	50345497	RXDIHWQ3OJ8AI	037540600X	68389017	Horse Heaven	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Read the abridged audio book and am confused...	After reading the reviews here from others, I have to warn off anybody from listening to the ABRIDGED audio book (read by Mary Beth Hurt). I recently took this along on a lengthy car trip. I also took another audio book that was not abridged. Both audiobooks were read from novels that were about 500-600 pages. The unabridged book was 11 audio cassettes long and took 2 days to listen to.<br />On the other hand, HORSE HEAVEN I was surprised to see on only 4 audio cassettes. I listened to them in about one afternoon. <br />Although Mary Beth Hurt does quite a good job reading, the book must have been cut very drastically. I see reviewers here on Amazon talking about characters and situations that mystify me (and I finished the book one day ago). Just a Bob? A psychic? Not in the audio version.<br />I guess I have to read the actual book to see just how much I missed, but it sounds like half or me of the book was edited out...that's not  merely \\"abridged\\" in my opinion, but a book cut down to merely a sampler of the real thing.<br />I feel cheated...also confused. The book I heard was mostly about Rosalind and Al Maybrick, a bit about horse training and very little racing and almost nothing from the horses' perspective. Based on that (which isn't quite fair to the author), I found it very insiderish and confusing, and it ends abruptly without wrapping up any of the plots.<br />I will know HAVE to get the hard cover and read it, but I still find this abridged audio version a real cheat!	2002-03-08
US	50345497	R3ARJEC64AK14I	1580081827	797105625	A Marriage Made in Heaven : A Love Story in Letters	Books	4	13	21	N	N	Read between the lines...(back to pre-feminist dark ages)	I just finished reading this book (like some other reviewers, I also couldn't put it down and stayed up til 2AM to finish), but I am more troubled by it. <br />Firstly, it is hardly a exchange of letters between two people because the vast majority of letters were written by B. R. Vatsala (note: it is never explained in the book what B.R. stands for). It is truly her story and she is an extraordinary woman -- it is a real pleasure to meet this thoughtful, charming, sensitive individual whom anyone would treasure as a friend. However, the same cannot be said about her domineering and bombastic fiance, Ehud Sperling (who likes to be called &quot;Boss&quot; or &quot;Captain&quot;). It isn't even certain he has written all of his own letters, as he has a loyal female employee who reads and monitors his correspondence with Vatsala (some of which is quite intimate)!<br />I hope SOME other readers are troubled by the idea of a rich, white American who peruses the world's available females and picks which country's supply of ladies he will dip into. India is choosen because of it is a backwater of so-called traditional values (i.e., men rule). Mr. Sperling (whose first wife wisely beat feet to get away from his snot-nosed bullying) decides a few months after his divorce that instead of a demanding independent American wife, he wants a subservient foreign bride from a poor 3rd world country. He has the undeserved good fortune to link up with Ms. Vatsala, and I feel richly sorry for this utterly wonderful lady. I can only hope after she gets fed up with his big shot, &quot;alpha dog&quot; mentality she can make a good life for herself in the US.<br />It is a sad comment on contemporary India that truly beautiful women like Vatsala, finding themselves over 30 and not so desirable in the marriage market, are forced to look in the paper for the equivalent of our &quot;personal ads&quot;, only here it is not for just a coffee date but a marriage arranged without any meeting or time to truly get to know another person. I can not blame Vatsala, who despite her Ph.D. in Microbiology, is a very trusting and naive girl with a deep romantic streak nutured on Hindu love stories, for falling for the sophisticated prattle dished-out by the manipulative Ehud. How many of us could face the offer of marriage, an escape from spinsterism, a ticket to the highly desirable US, and wealth (everything from a paid-for wedding with Maharaji's emeralds to a trust fund that will let Vatsala make charitable donations to any cause she wants)? This would turn the head of many an American woman from a much more sophisticated background. Clearly Ehud is used to getting exactly what he wants as a millionaire publishing magnate, and a subservient foreign bride seems to be what he wants.<br />For those who find this story &quot;romantic&quot;, I caution that the idea that a man gets to have sexual adventures, live-in relationships, world travels and then settles down at age 40-something with an innocent &amp;  inexperienced virgin is a very old one, and one that has been wisely rejected by most modern women throughout the world who want to live their own lives and not just be a shadow of someone else's.<br />The story ends on an oddly grim note as the couple arrive &quot;home&quot; at Ehud's isolated Vermont home in the dead of winter, where his poor bride is left at home all day (God forbid a microbiologist with a Ph.D. WORK) with only the company of a huge unneutered german shepherd dog who terrifies her and far, far from the warmth &amp; companionship of her large Indian family. The only glimmer that things may turn out well is a tiny photo on the back inside dusk jacket of Vatsala holding what appears to be a baby son. The other photos of this lovely Indian woman, huddled in heavy winter gear and clearly miserable in the cold, are too depressing to contemplate.<br />Dear Vatsala: Please smarten up here in American. Read lots of books! Watch films and even TV. Most of all, please make friends with some nice normal American women, and see how NORMAL couples live together here -- without philisophical mumbo-jumbo or &quot;BOSS men&quot; to order them around. You deserve a lot better and I hope you find it.	2001-01-29
US	50345497	R37DBLRITLQPM1	0689832117	9483240	Eloise in Moscow	Books	1	3	9	N	N	Hugely disapointing	I hate to dump rain on this parade but....&quot;Eloise in Moscow&quot; is a really terrible book. A big disapointment after the original &quot;Eloise&quot;, which is one of my favorite books of all time.    I rediscovered &quot;Eloise&quot; some years back when I heard that Ivana Trump was re-decorating the Plaza Hotel and called illustrator Hillary Knight out of semi-retirement to decorate the lobby with murals from the book. I was so charmed by this idea that I dug up the book, which I hadn't read since grade school and re-read it -- and found &quot;Eloise&quot; to be that rare children's book that really stands up to an adult reading. Charming, funny, original and delightful -- plus Hillary Knight's enchanting illustrations.     A search at the public library turned up the sequels of Eloise in Moscow/Paris/At Xmas, and I was burning with desire to read them all. This was about ten years ago and they were most definitely out -of-print and very hard to find. Book dealers quoted me outlandish prices, so I embarked on a six month library search all over my state until I finally tracked down the full set.     Was I ever crushed and disillusioned! Kay Thompson must have gotten mighty sick of her little creation, because the sequels are lifeless, cynical and unfunny. Eloise quickly deteriorates into a sitcom-like character. The Moscow and Paris settings are hackneyed (with appearances from contemporary celebrities), the dialogue leaden. Instead of seeming precocius and charming, Eloise becomes somewhat pschotic and even disturbing.     It would have been nicer to watch her grow up slightly in each book, to deal with the fact of her missing parents (cute in the first book, but troubling when continued in the sequels without explanation) or to show some growing consciousness of her extreme wealth and opulent lifestyle (and  yes, even young children have an awareness of these things). I was not expecting the Eloise sequels were going to be socially conscious/politically correct books of the 80s or 90s -- they were written in the 50s after all -- but that there be a little depth in them.    The original &quot;Eloise&quot; definitely has a delicate underlying melancholy about a little girl who is lonely and neglected and puts on a brave front of being a little hell-raiser. This tone is completely lost in the later three books and Eloise becomes a shallow charicature.   Forget the sequels and stick with the delightful original. The expanded version, with notes from the illustrator, is a worthwhile addition, but otherwise -- forget it.	2000-11-17
