I was so enthralled with this book on my flight from Honolulu to Portland, Oregon that I had completely lost track of time. I would have guessed that we still had two hours to go before touchdown in Portland.  While I'm always anxious to escape the cramped confines of the plane, I was disappointed at the announcement because I didn't want to put the book down.<br /><br />  The book is filled with dozens of fascinating stories about patients who have seemingly communicated with deceased friends and loved ones by means of the induced after death communication method (IADC) developed by author Allan Botkin, Psy.D.  As I understand it, this is an offshoot of EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) therapy discovered by Francine Shapiro, Ph.D.  While focusing on the therapist's hand, the patient is asked to move the eyes left or right rhythmically and focus on a disturbing thought.  For those people grieving the death of someone or otherwise disturbed by someone's death, the patient is asked to focus on that sadness.  It was hard for me to believe, but Botkin claims a 98% success ratio with his first 84 cases of IADC.<br /><br />  The typical IADC involves the patient reporting having seen a deceased person and that deceased person having told him or her that everything is OK and not to grieve. In a number of cases, the deceased person relates information previously unknown to the patient.  The patients included atheists and skeptics as well as believers and religious.<br /><br />  The authors are quick to point out that the technique does not involve hypnosis.  While hypnosis slows down information processing, EMDR accelerates it. \\"Nearly all of those who experience IADCs assert that these experiences are markedly different from dreams, imagination, or fantasy,\\" the authors state.  \\"Most insist that they actually saw, heard, touched, or smelled things with their senses, but that the sensation was not physical.\\"  Nor are they, the authors tell us, hallucinations, even though one medical doctor who experienced the process and could come up with no other explanation insisted he must have been hallucinating.<br /><br />  The authors sit on the fence when it comes to stating whether the patients are actually communicating with the dead. They say their concern is the healing aspect, not offering evidence of life after death.  Reading between the lines, I gather that they are taking this position to protect themselves from mainstream science and its many arrogant pseudoskeptics.<br /><br />  I should have been able to finish this book during the five hour flight, but I found myself rereading many things, not because they were difficult to understand but because I was in such awe of the cases reported by the authors.  It was one Wow! after another.that the sensation was not physical.\\"  Nor are they, the authors tell us, hallucinations, even though one medical doctor who experienced the process and could come up with no other explanation insisted he must have been hallucinating.

But decades of research by Drs. J.B. and Louis Rhine at Duke University provided ample evidence that it is a sixth sense, of sorts, more available to some than others.<br /><br />  Author Sally Rhine Feather is the daughter of the Rhines and is director of the Rhine Research Center in Durham, NC.  Michael Schmicker, an investigative journalist, is the author of Best Evidence, a book which explores evidence for psychic phenomena and survival of consciousness at death.  The two have collaborated on this book in offering dozens of stories from the Rhine Research Center's database. \\"Our efforts today no longer focus on whether ESP exists; we have strong evidence that it does,\\" Feather states in the preface. \\"Instead, we are studying how ESP works, by examining how personality, emotional relationship, mental and physical states, education, gender, and other variables may affect ESP experiences.\\"<br /><br />  The authors are quick to point out that the many cases in this book, taken from more 14,000 in the database, are not intended as scientific proof of ESP.  While anecdotal, the great number of them must lead any open-minded person to consider that the explanation for them goes beyond fraud, delusion, or coincidence.  Consider the case of a bank president who, during World War II, became very depressed while on a fishing trip, feeling strongly that his son, Bill, was the cause of it.  A few nights later a telegram was received saying Bill had been critically wounded.  The distraught father had no indication as to what the wounds were, but he began to visualize a head wound, right behind the ear, as well as some kind of arm wound.  As it turned out, the actual injuries were almost exactly as seen by the father.<br /><br />  Many cases are of precognition - seeing events before they actually happen - such as the case of a woman driving toward the Pentagon with her husband and suddenly seeing huge clouds of smoke rising into the sky over the building.  She became very emotional and began hyperventilating. Two weeks later, on September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 77 smashed into the Pentagon.<br /><br />  Children have many ESP experiences that are often ignored by adults, who assume that they are the result of overactive imaginations.  That apparently wasn't the case with a four-year-old child asked his parents if Aunt Myrtle and Uncle Charles were in a train wreck. \\"I see'd they did,\\" the child told the confused parents.  The next day, word reached the parents that the aunt and uncle had stalled on train tracks and their car was hit by a train.  As far as could be determined, it happened almost the same time as the child's remarks.<br /><br />  A very interesting chapter deals with messages from the dead, such as deceased loved ones appearing to children before word had reached the family of the death of the person. In one case, a woman and her teenaged daughter traveled from Washington, D.C. to California and were greeted by the woman's father, whom they had left in Washington, D.C.  As the father/grandfather greeted them, he slowly faded away.  Soon thereafter, they received word that he had died.<br /><br />  The final chapter gives advice on recognizing and dealing with personally experienced ESP, the goal being to help the person accept, understand, and embrace the experience rather than fear it or pass it off as a trick of the mind.<br /><br />  This book is interesting, informative, intriguing, and inspiring. With 100 or so cases detailed, it offers plenty of variety and can be read in bits and pieces.  Many of the experiences are simple enough to be shared with children as stories to enlighten rather than to frighten.of smoke rising into the sky over the building.

US	52580842	R3PDIP7FZ3BOTF	1903816904	100012356	Is There An Afterlife?: A Comprehensive Overview of the Evidence	Books	5	86	92	N	Y	a long overdue book	Since becoming interested in psychical research some 15 years ago, I have accumulated a library of more than 1,000 books dealing with mediumship, channeling, near-death experiences, death-bed visions, apparations, past-life regressions, and every other aspect of the paranormal. This book is without a doubt the most comprehensive overview of the entire field that I have encountered.<br /><br />  The author is a professor of Transpersonal Psychology at Liverpool John Moores University in Great Britain and a past president as well as current vice-president of the Society for Psychical Research. Professor Fontana examines everything from the mediumship of the Fox Sisters of the 1800s to the recent<br /><br />Scole experiments, including such famous cases as Patience Worth, Margery, the R-101 disaster, the cross-correspondences, to name just a few.  He looks at the mediumship of Leonore Piper, Gladys Osborne Leonard, Eileen Garrett, Geraldine Cummins and many others.<br /><br />So many of the earlier books present a one-sided view of various phenomena, but Fontana presents both sides, turning the evidence inside out and upside down,leaving no stone unturned. I had just recently reread a book about the mediumship of Mina Crandon, the medium in the sensational \\"Margery\\" mediumship of 1920s.  I finished the book not knowing what to believe as there was strong evidence for Crandon being a gifted medium, but there was also some evidence suggesting fraud. The fact that the distinguished researcher, Dr. J.B. Rhine, was one of those concluding she was a charlatan made me lean toward that conclusion, even though I was mystified as to how so many other scientific examiners could have been duped.  After reading Fontana's thoughts on the case, I am now back to believing that Crandon was a true medium, although she might have been a mixed-medium, i.e., one who occasionally cheated to please her audience when no phenomena manifested.  There also seems to be the possibility that many of the mediums deemed cheaters were in fact sabotaged by malevolent spirits.<br /><br />As Professor Fontana says, the question of whether or not our consciousness survives bodily death is without a doubt the most important facing us. For most religions, faith alone is seemingly all that is necessary. Perhaps that is the reason we have so much turmoil in the world today. Faith is not enough. We need conviction.  That is what this book offers.many of the mediums deemed cheaters were in fact sabotaged by malevolent spirits.  <br /> <br />As Professor Fontana says, the question of whether or not our consciousness survives bodily death is without a doubt the most important facing us.

It is the story of Catherine Donna Amiss, killed in an auto accident on December 23, 2001, communicating with her mother by means of a computer and other electronic equipment.<br /><br />  \\"I'm still here\\" were the first words received from Cathy as her voice came over a computer to her cousin, Rachel, who was experimenting after reading something about EVP on the Internet.<br /><br />\\"How do you know they can hear?\\" a male voice was then recorded, followed by a sigh from Cathy.<br /><br />  Upon hearing the taped message, author Copeland, Cathy's mother, began reading about and experimenting with EVP.  After a number of failures, she also made contact with Cathy on various recording equipment.<br /><br />  Tom and Lisa Butler, co-directors of the American Association of  Electronic Voice Phenomena (AA-EVP), wrote the foreword to the book.  \\"We feel that Martha and Cathy's story, which is also the story of many others who are participating in this grand experience, is an illustration of the truth about `death' which we all must learn,\\" they state. \\"We will survive the end of our physical body and continue to live in a different aspect of reality.  And, if we try, we will be able to tell about it to those who remain in the physical.\\"<br /><br />  The beginning chapters provide background family information.  Interestingly, Cathy, who was a passenger in the fatal accident, seems to have been presciently aware of her premature death, discussing it with family members and even telling her mother that she wanted to be cremated.<br /><br />  Prior to discovering EVP, Copeland sat with George Anderson, one of the best known mediums in this country, and received some very comforting and veridical information.  Her success in communicating with Cathy by EVP brought further comfort.  \\"I have learned many things about spiritual work from my contacts with Cathy,\\" Copeland offers. \\"When I have asked her what her new world was like, her reply was, `Like living but better'.''<br /><br />  As a result of her success in communicating with her daughter, other members of AA-EVP began e-mailing Copeland. She decided to form a group - Recording Circle - Bridge to the Afterlife - to facilitate contact with \\"The Big Circle\\" (departed loved ones) as well as to share experiences.  A number of those contacts are shared in the book.<br /><br />  \\"The discovery of EVP has indeed created and maintained an opportunity for me to feel her around me, to hear Cathy speak, often and clearly,\\" Copeland ends.  \\"And it is indeed the deep stillness that sends to me her voice much as it was when she was alive.\\"<br /><br />  For those already familiar with EVP, this book should give additional validity to what they have learned elsewhere about this amazing phenomenon.  For the open-minded reader unfamiliar with EVP, it should be a real eye-opener.  Familiar or not, the reader should find it both enlightening and comforting.eland offers. \\"When I have asked her what her new world was like, her reply was, `Like living but better'.''  <br />      <br />      As a result of her success in communicating with her daughter, other members of AA-EVP began e-mailing Copeland.

He calls upon many well-known names, including Jesus, Tolstoy, Goethe, Gandhi, Eisenhower, Thoreau, Daisaku Ikeda, Walt Whitman, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Karl Jaspers, to name just a few, to support his views.<br /><br />  Hilgendorf begins by discussing the unseen currents affecting us. While most people sense the chaos, he sees new roots, new sprouts, new leaves, an emerging spirit blossoming forth.  He tells us of his own personal struggles and how he found new meaning and new beginnings in life.  \\"During those early days of practice of Buddhism, it was, above all else, a sense of connecting my life to a life greater than my own that kept me practicing,\\" he explains. \\"I was moving to a new rhythm - the rhythm of the vast universe itself.  I was awakening to the greater self within.\\"<br /><br />  The basic problem, as the author sees it, is one of identity. We do not know who we truly are.  We thus identify with religion and nationality, thereby creating an identity that divides us and results in hatred and war. We hunger for a sense of purpose.  We strive to gather more material goods, but there is never enough.<br /><br />  \\"What is needed,\\" Hilgendorf says, \\"is a human revolution, a raising in consciousness and state of life, and this can only come about in the spiritual realm. Mankind needs to open its eyes and heart.  This is the true function of religion; and it will be the function of the new religion ushering in the coming new civilization.\\"<br /><br />  He sees Nichiren Buddhism as the emerging global religion, one that offers solutions to the most difficult problems of our times. \\"It is a religion offering solutions to the age-old sufferings of birth, sickness, old age, and even death,\\" Hilgendorf stresses.  It's a practice accessible to everyone and can begin with simple chanting.  By chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, he tells us, our mind and life gradually expand from the small, self-centered ego to the larger ego, embracing all of life.<br /><br />  As with his earlier book, Hilgendorf offers much food for thought.  The crux of the book, as I see it, is that Eastern practices and Western ideals can be reconciled and result in a better world.ting.

Atwater in this 158-page book.<br /><br />All those old philosophers do is discuss whether God exists or whether He, She, ot It is a product of the need to believe in something greater, how God can permit evil, etc., etc. They rarely get to the root of the problem and address whether consciousness survives physical death.  It is necessary to deal with that for everything else to unfold.  Knowing that there is a Higher Intelligence, Creator, God, Cosmic Force, whatever name we choose to give to Him, Her, or It doesn't in itself help us understand the purpose of our lives or give real meaning to them. To put it another way, we have to first look for survival of the consciousness and let God emerge from that.  If we look for God first, we never get off the ground, because God is beyond our comprehension. And so all those old philosophers just went around in circles searching for God and meaning in life.<br /><br />The near-death experience (NDE) is one phenomenon that helps us better understand what happens after death.  While NDEs were taking place well before Drs. Raymond Moody and Elisabeth Kubler-Ross started writing about them 30 or so years ago, there was no significant research before them. The author had three NDEs and tells us what she learned from them as well as from extensive research she has done with the NDE phenomenon. God, the meaning of life, and the afterlife were all revealed to her, much as they were to other near-death experiencers. \\"Instintively, I knew the middle was the centerpoint of creation, God's portal,\\" she writes. \\"As I moved toward it, I was engulfed by a force that I knew, I absolutely knew.was the presence of God.  I have no words to describe what happened to me in that presence, except to say that the memory of it still causes me to weep.  Instantaneously, I felt as if I knew all things.  Yet even more was revealed about the inner workings of creation and consciousness, until it seemed as if I would surely burst fromt he sheer immensity of the knowledge pouring into me.\\"<br /><br />While Atwater may not have been able to find words to describe what happened to her in the presence of \\"God,\\" she finds ample words to describe what she otherwise learned during her three NDEs as well as what happened to other experiencers she has interviewed. It makes for a fascinating read and there is much more substance to it than you can find in the writings of any of those old philosophers. This book should be the first book offered in Philosophy 101.<br /><br />I have read a number of other books by the author, but they were before I started reviewing books at this site. However, I would give them all five stars.cept to say that the memory of it still causes me to weep.  Instantaneously, I felt as if I knew all things.

He examines the \\"programming\\" we are subjected to in the pursuit of self-awareness, with special focus on the meaning of words, including the different translations and interpretations of words in the Bible.  As Vincent sees it, most of us are like lopsided ships, resulting from improper cargo loading or shifting, and our goal becomes one of righting the \\"ship of the soul.\\"<br /><br />  The first seven chapters pretty much deal with who we are and how we got there.  Beginning with the eighth chapter and continuing through the remaining eight chapters,  Vincent explores the psychic realms, discussing various forms of mediumship, near-death experiences, meditation, astral projection, remote viewing, psychometry, apports, spiritual healing, materialization, and other related subjects.  It soon becomes clear that Vincent has had considerable experience with psychics and mediums, both charlatans and the truly gifted.  In fact, I made e-mail contact with Vincent and learned that he once operated a 160-acre spiritual retreat in British Columbia and sat in a physical circle for some 15 years, three times a week.  He added that he is a clairaudient, often receiving messages that leave him dazzled. \\"I'm just a simple guy with a tiny grip on what seems to me to be the simple truth,\\" he offered by e-mail.<br /><br />  As a \\"psychic primer,\\" the book has much to offer the beginning student, but even the advanced student will find much food for thought. One of the most intriguing sections to me was that dealing with \\"fragmented parts\\" of spirits.  \\"An earthbound spirit is not a spirit at all, at least in the strict sense of the word,\\" Vincent writes.  \\"It is simply a part that was left behind upon the death of the physical host.\\"  While I had heard this theory (theory to me, fact to Vincent), I had not seen it explained as well as it is in this book.<br /><br />  I also found Vincent's discussion of various degrees of trance enlightening.  \\"Light trance is akin to inspirational speech, in that the medium puts his mouth in gear and his mind in neutral,\\" he explains, going on to discuss various aspects of trance mediumship.<br /><br />  Overall, the book is an excellent comprehensive guide and reference book for both beginning and advanced students of psychic phenomena and spiritual truth.f the most intriguing sections to me was that dealing with \\"fragmented parts\\" of spirits.  \\"An earthbound spirit is not a spirit at all, at least in the strict sense of the word,\\" Vincent writes.  \\"It is simply a part that was left behind upon the death of the physical host.\\"  While I had heard this theory (theory to me, fact to Vincent), I had not seen it explained as well as it is in this book. <br /> <br />      I also found Vincent's discussion of various degrees of trance enlightening.  \\"Light trance is akin to inspirational speech, in that the medium puts his mouth in gear and his mind in neutral,\\" he explains, going on to discuss various aspects of trance mediumship. <br /> <br />      Overall, the book is an excellent comprehensive guide and reference book for both beginning and advanced students of psychic phenomena and spiritual truth. <br />	2005-01-27

These stories, coming from patients, associates, and friends, involve near-death experiences, death-bed visions, apparitions, and meaningful dreams. \\"Some of the things I have heard from their loved ones and some of my own experiences have caused me to believe that there is more to this life than meets the eye, and that gives me hope and helps me to do this job,\\" Dr. Amatuzio writes.<br /><br />Perhaps the most intriguing story is that of a man who had a near-death experience while in the recovery room following surgery.  He recalled leaving his body through the top of his head and then watching doctors and nurses attempt resuscitation.  He remembered being able to read all their thoughts, including those of a nurse who was upset that she had to stay and help because she had a date after work.  At the same time, a patient next to him had a cardiac arrest and left his body.  The two men began communicating by means of telepathy while observing the confusion below them. The two men ventured through the wall and outside, where they saw a dazzling light.  After seeing his deceased mother, father, and aunt, he realized he had to go back.  The other man continued on and did not reunite with his earthly body.<br /><br />This book would make a great gift for a terminal patient or someone grieving the loss of a loved one.

I knew she would be grieving and that this book would be of great help to her.<br /><br />The book is about dealing with grief, loss, and transformation. \\"Each one of us can travel the road of transformation with awareness and choice,\\" the author, a grief counselor, states in the Introduction.  \\"So many of us make an unconscious choice to be a victim to its ups and downs.\\"  The author's objective is to show a way to respond \\"empowered\\" to all life's changes and challenges, not just death.<br /><br />\\"It is how we look at these losses and changes that can make a difference between becoming a victim of change and grief energy, or learning to channel this energy to higher purpose,\\" she continues, going on to offer a six-step program or \\"journey\\" by which to face the challenge.  Woven through the six steps, are 13 affirmations designed to punctuate the journey and serve as day-to-day reminders.  There are also a number of \\"reflections,\\" pertinent verbiage extracted from the text to highlight the messages, while also serving as day-to-day lessons for those who find themselves struggling and in need of reinforcement. A very big bonus to the written word is a CD offering music which touches the heart and soul.  I found the music very comforting as I drove the 600 miles to my friend's funeral.<br /><br />The author explains how she has met some of her own challenges as well as describing how others have dealt with the adversity accompanying change and loss.<br /><br />The book is about transformation.  It is about healing the soul and allowing it to become whole again.  It would be a great gift to give someone who is experiencing a difficult change or loss.	2004-11-27

She introduced \\"John of God\\" to the world through an earlier book, \\"Spiritual Alliance:  Discovering the Roots of health at the Casa de Dom In&aacute;cio,\\" published in 2002.  She is the author of two other books, \\"The Call of Spiritual Emergency\\" and \\"A Sourcebook for Helping People with Spiritual Problems.\\"<br /><br />Brazilians, according to Bragdon, look upon Spiritism more as \\"a way of life\\" than a religion.  It evolved from Kardec's research with mediums.  Sometime around 1850, Kardec (a nom de plume for Leon-Denizarth-Hippolyte Rivail, a French educator) began investigating two sisters with mediumistic abilities.  While the messages coming through the two young women were generally in harmony with their worldly and somewhat frivolous dispositions, the communication turned to very serious matters when Kardec was present.  He was informed that spirits of a much higher order were communicating expressly for him and that he was to put the teachings in book form.  \\"Even though they were written one hundred and fifty years ago, Kardec's writings are still very relevant today,\\" Bragdon offers.  \\"They reflect universal and timeless truths.\\"<br /><br />The primary difference between Kardec's Spiritism and the Spiritualism of Great Britain and the United States, Bragdon points out, is that Spiritism openly embraces reincarnation and is more unified and action oriented.  \\"The philosophy of Kardec's Spiritism was built on the laws of cause and effect, and reincarnation,\\" Bragdon states, calling it \\"a path of practical Christian Spirituality.\\"  The appendix to the book gives a detailed account of how reincarnation was expunged from Christian dogma and doctrine, offering quite a bit more than the oft-cited Council of Nicea and Justinian history.<br /><br />The author discusses the history of Spiritism in Brazil, including many of the prime movers, such as Chico Xavier, Hernani Guimaraes Andrade, and Elsie Dubugras. She explains the nature of energy healing, as practiced in various Kardecist centers, and presents a number of cases in which patients were healed.  \\"Energy healing is only one part,\\" she writes, pointing out that the nurturing community with its positive environment and brotherhood must certainly be part of the success she has observed during her trips to Brazil.<br /><br />The organizational structure of Kardecist centers, the training of mediums and healers, the education of patients, models of Spiritist centers, and the first steps toward creating a center in your town, as well as suggestions for implementation are also discussed.<br /><br />Before reading this excellent book, I had imagined Kardecist Spiritism as being not much more than a simple faith healing practice appealing to the uneducated and impoverished, but Bragdon paints a very different picture.  It appears to be a sophisticated, well-organized, and effective energy medicine model, one that alternative medicine leaders in the United States might do well to consider.ppealing to the uneducated and impoverished, but Bragdon paints a very different picture.

Books	5	65	68	N	N	Mystifying	Bill Sweet, the author of this book, probably greeted the recent news about medical researchers at Duke and Harvard collaborating with popular spiritual author Deepak Chopra and Unity president Tom Zender to form a center for prayer research with a bewildered but satisfying smile and shake of the head.  Such a reaction would have resulted from the fact that the article, which appeared in the Christian Science Monitor, ignored the pioneering research concerning the effectiveness of prayer carried out by Bruce and John Klingbeil, the father-son team founders of the Spindrift organization, beginning in 1969 and continuing until their strange deaths in 1993.  Sweet's book is about the Klingbeils and Spindrift.<br /><br />  As Sweet, a former president of Spindrift, explains, it is now politically correct to research prayer, but it wasn't politically correct when the Klingbeils were conducting their research, between 1969 and their strange deaths in 1993.<br />  The two men had become full-time researchers in 1975 and found little financial support in their endeavor. For lack of financial support, they were forced to move from Illinois to Salem, Oregon.  But it wasn't only a lack of financial support that frustrated and depressed the Klingbeils.  According to Sweet, Bruce Klingbeil's name was removed from the Christian Science Journal listing of practitioners in late 1983, devastating him and putting him out of work.  He had been a full-time practitioner, his primary duty being to pray for people to heal.  His motivation to pursue prayer research was a result of seeing people drift away from the spiritual approach to healing and life in general.  Meanwhile, John Klingbeil was so dedicated to his father's work in prayer research that he passed up a full math scholarship to Northwestern University so he could devote full time to working with his father.<br />  \\"With few exceptions, theologians and laity alike have felt Spindrift's prayer testing was irreverent, and some even thought it was anti-Christian,\\" Sweet explains, going on to opine that even spiritual people become your enemy when laboratory science is offered to support the anecdotal evidence underlying faith.<br /><br />  The Klingbeils developed some 70 different tests of thought and prayer, many of which strongly suggested that prayer forms \\"subtle mental imprints\\" on the physical world and creates a certain order in the physical universe.  Their objective was to prove and explain the relationship between prayer and healing.  Their focus was botanical experiments, as praying for plants did not involve the conscious or subconscious variables that might influence results with humans.<br />  Sweet saves a summary of the experiments for the appendix of the book.  The main body of the book is more about the dedication and devotion along with the trials and tribulations of the Klingbeils.  As their research successes mounted, so did their frustrations, eventually leading to a double suicide.  As it was definitely contrary to their deep religious and spiritual beliefs, the suicides were particularly mysterious.  While foul play was ruled out, Sweet concludes that some kind of negative energy was behind the suicides.<br /><br />  The Spindrift story is a very interesting, informative, and intriguing read, especially with regard to the negative reaction of religion in a pursuit that supposedly lends itself to its cause.  The book does not offer organized religion an opportunity to directly voice its opposition, and we are left to conclude, as Sweet puts it, that \\"what made the Klingbeils so controversial was that they actually tested some sacred powers in the laboratory.\\"nd some even thought it was anti-Christian,\\" Sweet explains, going on to opine that even spiritual people become your enemy when laboratory science is offered to support the anecdotal evidence underlying faith. <BR>  <BR>      The Klingbeils developed some 70 different tests of thought and prayer, many of which strongly suggested that prayer forms \\"subtle mental imprints\\" on the physical world and creates a certain order in the physical universe.

He remembers thinking he was about to die and wondering why it felt so wonderful.  \\"Space seemed warm, comfortable, full of light, even though there were no visible objects,\\" he writes.  In a later NDE, during an expedition in s Tierra del Fuego, he recalls another part of himself watching his freezing physical body as if from a telescope in another universe.<br />  Because his NDEs and experiences of synchronicity, precognition, and telekinesis were life-altering, Hart began struggling with the materialistic ways of life, finding his jobs meaningless and boring while lacking the motivation to rise through the ranks of academia.  Thus, he began a lifelong quest to understand the nature of consciousness.  He encounters two gurus, one a Sherpa tribesman named Chombi and, while working in India, a yoga teacher named Guruji, both of whom help him make sense out of his experiences. Among other things, Chombi explains to him that the world we see, even time itself, is an illusion projected by the lower self and that if we are to experience the higher world, the lower self must be subdued.  Guruji informs him that consciousness is composed of vibrations and that all matter is to some degree conscious.  \\"We and the stars are part of the same field of vibrations,\\" Guruji explains. \\"Separation is only an illusion.\\"<br />  An Indian physicist, Goswami, provids further enlightenment, helping Hart apply the lessons of quantum physics to the NDE.  Hart, who seems to have a good grasp of quantum physics,  has a number of \\"eureka moments\\" in which his experiences and observations begin to make real sense to him.  One not well versed in quantum physics will likely struggle with his interpretations and explanations, but nearly everyone should get the gist of it.<br />  \\"I am not the first person to realize that the mind survives the body, or that the reality of the universe is a marvelous field of information and infinite potentials, or that we ourselves create time by opening static time capsules in the field of information,\\" Hart states. \\"But I had the joy of discovering these ideas independently before I was exposed to them by others.\\"  His discoveries make for a fascinating read.good grasp of quantum physics,  has a number of \\"eureka moments\\" in which his experiences and observations begin to make real sense to him.

As Dr. Sheldon Stoff, the primary author of the book, states, most of us live in a cave seeing little but shadows.  Stoff, professor emeritus from Delphi University, offers good advice on how to get out of the cave.<br />  The four pillars of Stoff's work with Kabbalah are studying; praying; meditating and chanting; and doing or fulfilling Mitzvot (good deeds).  He explains how best to approach these four pillars. \\"By pursuing these four pillars with love and responsibility our self-centered egos shrink and our spiritual consciousness expands,\\" Stoff offers.  He  likens expansion of consciousness to coming out of a dark theater into broad daylight.<br />  Other subjects include the Tree of Life, reincarnation, male-female relationships, the soul, Jesus, the Sefirot, and forgiveness and compassion, to name just a few.  Much of Dr. Stoff's wisdom has been obtained through deep meditation. It seems to be consistent with that of other seemingly enlightened teachers.<br />  The second section of the book has to do with Kabbalistic medicine and is by Jesse Stoff, a medical doctor as well as a naturopathic and homeopathic physician. His discussion of the part played by mind on physical health is informative and interesting.<br />  This book has much to offer the seeker as well as those well along the spiritual path.	2004-01-17

In fact, he enthusiastically put down people who made such claims.  \\"But it suddenly occurred to me one day that this negative attitude on my part toward the paranormal is wholly contrary to the very spirit of rational, scientific inquiry - that one is not to make a pronouncement on matters one has not taken the trouble to objectively and systematically investigate,\\" he writes.<br />  While sitting in his study and reading one night in 1978, von Denmarc turned around and saw a figure resembling a human in the mirror.  It disappeared, reappeared, and then disappeared again.  About two months later, the figure reappeared and began a conversation with von Denmarc.  The \\"ghost\\" told him that he had once lived in von Denmarc's house.  He gave details, including his name, occupation, and when and how he died, details which von Denmarc investigated and confirmed.  Over the next seven years, the physicist and the ghost carried on a number of conversations in which they discussed such matters as the nature of reality, karma, rebirth, religion, possession, death, cloning, and science.<br /><br />  What von Denmarc had discovered, it seems, is the mirror-gazing technique of contacting those on in other realms of existence discussed by pioneering NDE researcher Raymond Moody, M.D.in his 1993 book, &quot;Reunions.&quot;  A chapter is devoted to the technique.<br /> The author used the technique to contact a recently-deceased friend, who also provides much wisdom from the Other Side.  Transcripts of a number of conversations with David, the original ghost, and Steven, the friend, are set forth in the book.<br />  The preponderance of information provided by David and Steven is consistent with other seemingly credible spirit communication.  However, David, who is \\"earthbound\\" because of the attachment to his wife and wants to wait for her to join him on the Other Side, seems much too enlightened for an earthbound spirit, while Steven has  become very wise in a short period of time.  This might be explained by the revelation that both men were very spiritual during their earthly lives, each with a guru or teacher from an Eastern philosophy.  Thus, they apparently crossed over as relatively enlightened spirits.<br />  Overall, the book is interesting, informative, intriguing, and inspiring, even if some aspects of it are a bit puzzling and perplexing.<br /><br />  \\"There is no denying that science has brought us many blessings,\\" the author concludes, \\"but it also has made us blind, dogmatic, and close-minded; it is time we realize our situation and begin systematically studying ancient and time-honored techniques and disciplines and forging new ones for the investigation of the more subtle and refined dimensions of the world and the human being.\\"nication.

However, Seabiscuit was not in Citation's class.<br />As a long-time follower of the &quot;sport of kings,&quot; I consider Citation as the greatest thoroughbred ever.  Had Citation been retired at the end of his three-year-old season, as were Man o'War and Secretariat, he would have had a record of 27 wins in 29 races, the two second-places losses easily explained. That record is more impressive than those of Man o' War and Secretariat, the two horses usually rated higher than Mighty Cy in polls of racing experts.  Unfortunately, Mighty Cy's owner wanted to make him the first million dollar winner and brought him back as a five-year-old, after more than a year's layoff.  Clearly, the horse lost something in that long layoff and was the not the competitor he was as a two- and three-year-old, winning only five of his next 16 races before finally going over the million dollar mark. When comparing Cy with Man o' War and Secretariat, it seems only reasonable to consider only his two- and three-year-old seasons.  Who knows what those two horses might have done as five- and six-year-olds?<br />Author Georgeff captures the greatness of Citation, appropriately referring to him as &quot;the greatest thoroughbred in modern history&quot; and &quot;in a class by himself.&quot; I couldn't put the book down once I started on it.	2003-12-16

Seelig recalled going through a tunnel, seeing deceased relatives speaking to him in \\"wordless language,\\" then encountering a light being who communicated with him in the most loving way.  \\"[The experience] completely shattered my outlook on life, consciousness, religion...\\" Seelig is quoted.<br />While many mental health professionals look askance at such experiences and avoid discussing them, Wills-Brandon, a family therapist, has discovered that by helping the patient explore his or her STE and then embrace it, the patient often adopts a more positive, more accepting, and more loving outlook on life.<br />&quot;Regardless of this,&quot; Wills-Brandon states, referring to the criticism by both mainstream science and orthodox religion, &quot;when an STE brings comfort and healing, it is difficult to keep tightlipped, no matter who is doing the ridiculing&quot;<br />Wills-Brandon makes a strong case for fully examining, exploring, and embracing spiritual experiences.	2003-12-16

Our culture is so engrossed in materialism that few people stop to think how negatively it has affected us and how it has drawn us further away from the real world, i.e., the spiritual world.  Philip Yancey does an excellent job of putting things in perspective, showing how people have been led astray in their values, especially by the media.  The only hope for the world, as Yancey points out, is to recognize that the world we live in is not the real world.  Faith in a larger world is necessary. Yancey tells of his own tests of faith, the same tests that many of us go through and which so many fail. This book should cause some people to more closely examine their behavior and actions, perhaps allowing them to pass future tests of faith.	2003-10-27

As they say, they take the &quot;strong meat&quot; of spiritual truth preserved within the often symbolic and allegorical languages of the Bible and tell the reader in what way it should be understood.  For example, Leviticus 17:11, which states that the life of the flesh is in the blood, refers, we are told, to the fact that the physical body is the product of scaled down angelic energy manifested through natural laws via the soul's seven spiritual vortices.  These vortices interface with the seven major nerve ganglia, including the seven major ductless glands of the endocrine system, including the blood.<br />It quickly becomes clear that the authors are not giving their interpretations.  They are giving elucidations.  They are telling us the TRUTH of it.  Exactly how they came upon this truth is not entirely clear, other than that it in some way came &quot;through spirit.&quot; What is clear is that their explanations, or elucidations, make sense, i.e., they appeal to reason.<br />Without a clear-cut source for the authors' elucidations, I had reservations about finishing the book.

This evidence exceeds the \\"boggle threshold\\" of most people, including orthodox science and the mainstream media, but the evidence is there nonetheless for anyone wanting to open his or her mind to it.<br />  You might start with this excellent book, which summarizes much of the work done by credible scientists over the past 50 years in the areas of Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) and Instrumental TransCommunication (ITC) and tells about ongoing research in the field.  We're talking about tape-recorded voices of entities from other realms of existence, phone messages from them, and television images, to name just some of the phenomena.  \\"From EVP messages that we received, we quickly satisfied ourselves that the voices were not stray sounds in the environment or stray radio broadcasts,\\" authors Tom and Lisa Butler write.  \\"In fact, with deceased relatives giving us messages on our audio tape, we came to realize that EVP was the most important proof of survival that we had ever experienced.\\"<br /><br />  When the Butlers first heard about EVP, they considered it \\"outlandish, even improbable,\\" just as most people who are not familiar with it are likely to conclude.

The boy becomes an invalid and Dr. Rosner is sued by his parents.  As the damages appear to go well beyond his professional liability insurance limits, Dr. Rosner faces bankruptcy if he is found legally liable for the  boy's condition.  Dr. Rosner's defense rests on a pre-existing medical condition of the boy that was not disclosed to him by the parents.  Dr. Mark Procter, Rosner's associate, has some suggestions as to how things might be manipulated to strengthen the defense. Dr. Rosner is unsure whether he should go along with the scheme that would put the blame on the dental equipment company.  Meanwhile Dr. Procter becomes involved in a romance with his new medical assistant.<br /><br />  Initially, the reader is concerned with the outcome of the trial, but the judgment is handed down just half way through the book.  Then the real intrigue begins.  It is no longer a matter of the insurance policy limits but the limits people will go to when driven by greed.  You wonder what will happen next and it is difficult to put down the book.  You know a big surprise is coming, but it's hard to imagine what it might be.<br /><br />  The author is a retired Temple University professor with degrees in dentisty, microbiology, psychology, and nutrition.

Of course, the fundamentalist view would be that it was inspired by demons. But then the problem is explaining why everything is so consistent with an all-just and all-loving God.<br />The book contains profound discourses on seemingly every subject relating to spirituality -- creation, evolution, free will, love, virtue, prayer, worship, suffering, sin, judgment, vengeance, false prophets, forgiveness, healing, death, transition, the spirit body, karma, just to name some.

They include everything from an Egyptian healer and an American Zen priest to a psychic warrior and a horse whisperer.<br />  The author, a retired college professor of religious studies, calls them mystic souls.  They all appear to have experienced some degree of enlightenment beyond the ordinary.  There is a common thread running through most of the experiences. Many of the 19 have experienced the Kundalini awakening and quite a few of them talk about the dangers involved if not properly approached.  Many also talk of their out-of-body travel.<br />  I have read numerous accounts of people having abilities similar to those of the 19 mystics interviewed for this book, but I have always tended to think that they are all part of paranormal history and that they are no longer with us.

When he returned to the United States, he no longer found it necessary to supress his talents as he now understood how to use them.<br /><br />  Holland relates a number of very interesting, informative, intriguing, and inspirational stories.  As an example, there is the story of Dick, a skeptical but open-minded East Coast radio announcer.  Dick's deceased father came through with his name, Carl.  As evidence, Carl mentioned to his son how they once enjoyed listening to Al Jolson phonograph records together.  Later in the reading, Carl told his son to give his love to his girlfriend.  Dick laughed, unaware of any girlfriend.  The father then explained that the woman lived in the apartment above him.  Dick later investigated and confirmed that his father had had a romantic relationship with the woman in the apartment above, but had kept it to himself because he wasn't sure his children would approve. Such evidence as this, information unknown to the sitter, seemingly rules out telepathy or mind reading on the part of the medium.<br />In the final chapters, the author explains how things come to him in his clairvoyance and clairaudience.  He also answers a number of questions about mediumship and the spirit world.<br />The open-minded reader should find this a fascinating read.reader should find this a fascinating read.	2003-05-11

If you don't understand it, you'll still appreciate it, assuming you have an open mind and want to understand. If you are closed-minded, don't bother.  You'll be wasting your money.<br />  The author is an experienced British clairvoyant medium, apparently being to Great Britain what John Edward and James Van Praagh are to the United States.  In fact, both Edward and Van Praagh endorse the book with words of praise.<br />  Brown begins by explaining how he was transformed from a skeptical teenager to a professional medium.  He went along with a friend to a clairvoyant demonstration in London, believing he would be able to expose the medium as a charlatan.  However, when a deceased uncle came through with very evidential information, some of which Brown didn't know until confirming it with his mother, he began to believe there might be something to it.  He continued to investigate and soon realized that he had clairvoyant abilities.  He attended classes and developed his ability to communicate with the spirit world.<br /><br />  Brown relates much of what he has learned from the spirit world about such things as suicide, premature deaths, the physically challenged, religion, pets, and various aspects of the afterlife.  He explains many aspects of mediumship, including the difference between objective and subjective clairvoyance. &quot;The key word for all mediums is vibration,&quot; Brown offers.  &quot;Essentially, a medium is one who changes the vibration of his or her beta body.&quot;  He goes on to explain how mediums can train themselves to adjust their frequency and tune into the spirit world like a radio signal looking for a signal.<br /><br />  One question often put to Brown has to do with the location of the spirit world.  &quot;Where is the Internet?&quot; is his usual reply.<br />  The book concludes with two interesting first-person accounts of sittings with Brown.  The appendix gives advice on how readers can attempt to tune in to the spirit world.<br />  I've read the books by Edward, Van Praagh, and George Anderson.

All of these television personalities who fancy themselves \\"survivors\\" for having undergone challenges of one kind or another on the various survival programs now popular might have a different perspective on survival if they read this book.  Lou Zamperini is the \\"ultimate survivor.\\"<br /><br />  To Zamperini, surviving meant starving and thirsting while confined to a life raft for 47 days.  That ordeal included fighting off sharks while enemy planes shot at him.  Surviving meant living with the tryanny, torture, and torment of his captors, including the threat of decapitation.  It meant living through two cold winters as a prisoner of war, his body weight dropping to as low as 66 pound.<br /><br />  Zamperini was forced to survive in the rigid domain of despair, beyond the reach of help, or rest, or pity.  Survival meantmeant living from day to day with the heart tearing itself between hope and fear, merely subsisting under a cloud of doom with no end in sight.<br /><br />  Yet, Zamperini was able to call upon the inner strength that had been nurtured in his days as an Olympic runner, and to endure.<br /><br />  Some of Zamperini's greatest challenges came after the war was over, the biggest one being overcoming the anger and hate he felt for this Japanese captors.<br />  With God's help, \\"Lucky Louie\\" succeeded in every one of his challenges. It's a fascinating story, a story of real survival.	2003-02-28

Of special interest to me was the chapter on determining slowdown rates in the marathon as well as in shorter running distances.  Professor Fair takes marathon age records beginning at age 35  -- the age when we are supposedly \\"over the hill\\" -- on up to age 84 and comes up with some interesting statistics. The slowdown rates at shorter distances vary a little, indicating speed deteriorates a little faster than endurance, at least in the middle years.<br />The findings relative to running times may very well apply to other activities.  Author Fair concludes that societies may have been too pessimistic about losses from aging for individuals who stay healthy and fit.<br />Other chapters deal with presidential elections, extramarital affairs, wine quality, college grades, interest rates, and inflation.  What do they have in common?  As Fair explains, they can all be explained and analyzed using the tools of social science and statistics.	2003-01-20

He calls trance the \\"Rosetta stone\\" that unlocks the mysteries of existence.<br />  Author Harper calls upon a wide variety to authors, including Alice Bailey, Jacob Boehme, Richard Bucke, Carlos Castaneda, Deepak Chopra, Larry Dossey, Albert Einstein, Stan Grof, Graham Hancock, Aldous Huxley, Carl Jung, Charles Lindbergh, John Mack, Raymond Moody, Michael Morse, Oliver Lodge, Kenneth Ring, Gary Schwartz, Ian Stevenson, Ken Wilber, and scores of others in piecing together the very complex puzzle of consciousness and the meaning of life.  He adds in his own mysical experiences and observations.  The picture that emerges will be an abstract one for most people, but there are many smaller images within the full picture that are easily discerned.<br />  Dr. Harper concludes that the universe is a hologram -- one whole message.  He sees our DNA molecule as the simplest form of a hologram.  \\"Our DNA molecule serves as the monitor and the system clock of the cosmos tuned to the geomagnetic cycles of Gaia, our Sun, and Milky Way Galaxy,\\" he explains. \\"This is what the shaman does in trance:  taps into DNA transmissions.\\"<br />  Harper draws from quantum physics, anthropology, biology, the Bible, mythology, abnormal psychology, near-death experiences, astronomy, astrology, crop circle studies, alien abductions, Egyptology, Mayan Cosmology, seemingly every conceivable source that that lends itself to the mystery of consciousness and the meaning of life.

One never knows for certain whether the writing is in fact coming from spirit or whether it is coming from the subconscious. Of course, it could also be total fabrication.  Suzanne Ward seems honest and sincere and so I ruled out the latter. To fabricate such material would be in total opposition to the message. As for it coming from the subconscious, Ward recognized this possibility and explained that many of the ideas coming from Matthew were totally alien to her, even to her imagination. Thus, I was left to conclude that Suzanne Ward may very well be one of those gifted with the ability to communicate with the spirit world.<br />While many of the ideas expressed by Matthew are foreign to Christianity and other religions, they are similar to other revelation through mediums, including automatic writers.  They appeal to reason and are consistent with a just and loving Creator. It should be kept in mind that much of the Bible is based upon such medimship.  Moses receiving The Ten Commandments is an example of automatic writing.<br />Matthew describes his environment, the activities in his realm, the nature of time, the difference between angels and spirit guides, the effects of prayer, and other aspects of the &quot;larger life,&quot; including the nature of transition from this side.  Very little of it was new to me, but it would be very enlightening to people who have had little exposure to such &quot;Truths,&quot; if we can accept them as such.<br />Since I am the first person to review this book, it seems that few people are open to these Truths.  I think that is sad.  We spend time reading &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and other fiction, but totally ignore books offering real wisdom, as this one does.few people are open to these Truths.

I have read hundreds of accounts of paranormal activity, but the activity summarized in this book is really amazing.<br />  I was aware of EVP (electronic voice phenomena) and assumed that ITC (Instrumental Transcommunication) was just another name for it.  It isn't, however.  ITC involves much more detailed, more direct, and more profound information coming from the spirit world.  We're talking spirit messages via computer (not attached to the internet), by phone calls (which the phone company has no record of), and by faxes from nowhere.<br />  As I read the book, I constantly viewed it with a skeptical eye.  However, author Macy comes across as very sincere, dedicated,discerning, and credible in his observations and reporting of them.  I find it difficult to believe that he and the number of reputable scientists involved in ITC research could have been duped over and over again for years on end.<br />  Over many years of reading and personal research, I am convinced of the reality of a spirit world.  I believe in spirit materialization and spirit communication.  If all of the other things I have encountered, e.g., materializations, apports, levitations, direct-voice mediumship, trance mediumship, etc., are real, I see no reason to draw the line and say that ITC is beyond belief.<br />  The pseudo-skeptics will certainly smirk, scoff, and snicker in their usual closed-minded,arrogant, vainglorious, and pompous manner, but that is their problem.  For the open-minded person who believes that there is more to this world than the material, this book has much to offer.	2002-08-11

Generally, stories of near-death experiences, death-bed visions, and other spirit communication, as related by Wooten-Green from his Hospice work, are taboo subjects for both the Catholic and the Protestant because some of the messages are not always consistent with the narrow and distorted meanings given to Scripture.<br />  In fact, this book was found in a Catholic book store, even though Wooten-Green states the \\"cloud of witness arrives on the scene whether the dying person is Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Native American, or none of the above.\\"  Either the Church watchdogs missed that or there is hope for the Church.<br />  The author relates about 20 interesting, intriguing, and inspiring stories from his experiences -- near-death experiences, death-bed visions, apparitions, nearing-death awareness, and near-life experiences.  They support Wooten-Green's contention that life is a spiritual process that begins with birth, flows eventually to death, and continues on to a new life.<br />  Anyone involved in giving care to the dying should read this book.  It should also offer comfort to those facing death as well as to those with friends or relatives who may soon pass.	2002-06-01

Wallace sent his theory to Darwin and when Darwin gave his presentation to the Linnaen Society in London during 1858, he also presented Wallace's parallel theory, from which came \\"the survival of the fittest.\\"<br />  At the time he was working on his theory of evolution,<br />Wallace was a complete materialist.  \\"I was so thorough and confirmed a materialist that I could not at that time find a<br /> place in my mind for the conception of spiritual existence, or for any agencies in the universe than matter and force,\\" he<br />writes in the preface.<br />  Wallace came to believe in the reality of spirit<br />communication and became an ardent Spiritualist. Many mainstream scientists of the day scoffed,sneered, and snickered, but Wallace remained steadfast in his beliefs.  \\"I assert without fear of contradictionn that whenever the scientific men of any age have denied the facts of investigators on a priori grounds, they have always been wrong,\\" he answered his critics.<br />  Wallace gathers together the best evidence of the 19th Century and the testimony of esteemed scholars and scientists of that era who also investigated mediumship and spirit phenomena.<br />  The words and wisdom of this book are as applicable today as they were 106 years ago.  It makes one wonder why mainstream science has made so little progress in awakening to the Truths discovered by Wallace and others, suggesting perhaps that Truth is beyond absolute proof and that spiritual evolution requires constant seeking, searching, and striving.<br />  To further quote Wallace:  \\"My position, therefore, is that the phenomena of Spiritualism, in their entirety do not require further confirmationn.  They are proved quite as well as any facts are proved in other sciences.\\"	2002-05-30

Only the introduction and the first and final chapters deal with the author's plan to provide an internet service by which people might be able to send a code from the Afterlife to prove their continued existence.  Frankly, I had no desire to read 242 pages dealing with codes; therefore, I procrastinated in buying and reading this book. Once I got into it, however, I had a hard time putting it down.<br />  Smith, who was born in 1911 and passed into spirit a few months ago, was the author of more than 30 books, mostly on metaphysical subjects.  In her younger years, including her days as a journalism major at the University of Texas, she was not interested in spiritual matters.  In fact, she was a cynical agnostic.  It was not until after she was into her 30s that she discovered she had the gift of automatic writing. &quot;It was the most peculiar feeling I'd ever experienced,&quot; she explains.  &quot;The hand was just writing by itself without my conscious will being involved in any way. It wrote scragglingly across the page in run-together words.&quot;<br />  Smith received a number of messages from her mother as well as from &quot;intruding&quot; spirits.  Later, she began hearing from a spirit who identified himself as James Anderson.  Later, Smith figured out that Anderson was the famous psychologist/philosopher William James of Harvard.  James admitted that he used a pseudonym, because he figured that if he came to her with a celebrated name, she would not believe him. Smith states that she wouldn't have.  Of course, the pseudo-skeptics, i.e., the cynics, would scoff at this whole idea, but Smith established herself as a very credible investigator and reporter during her career.<br />  The introduction and conclusion to the book are written by Drs. Gary Schwartz and Linda Russek, authors of &quot;The Living Energy Universe.&quot;  Schwartz recently published &quot;The Afterlife Experiments,&quot; reporting on his study of five famous mediums at his Human Energy Systems Laboratory at the University of Arizona.

As a psychiatric social worker, Dalzell had worked with patients who had \\"heard voices.\\" He therefore began to question his own sanity. He wondered whether he was talking to himself, whether it was free association, or if he indeed had clairvoyant abilities.<br />Some of the messages Dalzell received meant nothing to him, but when he spoke with Keller's parents in Germany, they took on meaning and were very evidential of life after death.  Dalzell decided to attend a seance with a respected medium.  Before attending the seance, Dalzell asked his discarnate friend if he would communicate a code word to him through the medium.  The medium struggled with the German word but managed to get enough of it to convince Dalzell that the code word was indeed communicated.<br />In another seance with another medium, Dalzell first contacted Keller's mother in Germany and asked her to try to communicae something to her deceased son and to ask him to relay it on through the medium.  Dalzell did not want to know what it was, so that he could rule out mind reading on the part of the medium.  Dalzell was amazed when he later told his friend's mother what the medium had to say, only to learn that one of the messages communicated was the one the mother had asked her son to relay on.<br />The foreword of the book is by Gary E. Schwartz, Ph.D., author of \\"The Afterlife Experiments.\\" Schwartz met Dalzell in February 2000 and was impressed with his honesty and openness, especially his willingness to put his reputation on the line by going public with his experiences.<br />The book meets my \\"Four I's\\" test -- Interesting, Informative, Intriguing, and Inspirational.

He received his doctorate from Harvard and taught at Yale before moving on to the University of Arizona, where he is professor of psychology, medicine, neurology, psychiatry, and surgery as well as the director of its Human Energy Systems Laboratory. But Schwartz is not your mainstream scientist.  Even though very much a skeptic himself, he had the courage to take on a research project in a scientifically taboo area after being introduced to a medium who immediately began communicating very evidential material from his mother.<br />  Schwartz arranged for five mediums, including the well-known John Edward and George Anderson, to undergo testing at his laboratory.  All possible scientific controls and precautions were taken.  The conclusion by Schwartz and Dr. Linda Russek, who collaborated with him in the research, was that the mediums were indeed gifted and able to communicate with spirit entities.<br />  In in the initial stages of the research, Schwartz found it difficult to believe what he was seeing and hearing.  \\"My degree of doubt in the presence of all data was frankly irrational,\\" he writes.  \\"I was experiencing skeptimania.\\"  But as the research continued, Schwartz was forced to face the truth.  \\"I can no longer ignore the data and dismiss the words,\\" he continues.  \\"They are as real as the sun, the trees, and our television sets, which seem to pull pictures out of the air.\\"<br />  While the appendix to the book reads like a scientific journal, the book itself is well written in layman's language.

I had read George Anderson's \\"Lessons from the Light\\" as well as two of the books about him.  I found them all interesting, informative, intriguing, and inspirational, but it had been my experience that second and third books by authors just usually rehash the material in the first book or two.  I doubted that Anderson had much more to offer.  I was very much wrong.  This is the best of all books by or about Anderson.  I hesitated in buying it, let it sit on a book shelf for some time, but then couldn't put it down once I started reading.<br />  This book is more than some trite, mundane, and unremarkable utterances from the dead. Of course, the cynics who call themselves skeptics would scoff at even that, but I have learned enough about mediumship to know that it is for real.  Yes, there are frauds, but Anderson is certainly not one of them. He comes across as a sincere, caring individual with a gift that he is using to help many people. From the many spirit communications that have come through him, Anderson has been able to piece together a concept of the \\"hereafter\\" and how souls continue in the realms.  There is much wisdom, much profoundness in this book, all consistent with the preponderance of information obtained through other gifted mediums of the past 100 or more years.<br />Whenever I enjoy a book as much as I did this one, I buy a copy for my daughter, a pediatrics nurse who occasionally works with dying children.  She has informed me that such books help her understand and deal with the losses.  However, inasmuch as my daughter is now expecting a child, I questioned whether I should buy this book for her.  Does a woman ready to give birth to new life want to read about death?  The paradox here is that in coming to understand death, we come to understand the divine plan and better understand, appreciate, and enjoy life.  If this understanding can be passed on to a child in his formative years, it would seem that the book is indeed appropriate at this time, and therefore I am buying a copy for her.would seem that the book is indeed appropriate at this time, and therefore I am buying a copy for her.	2002-03-20

It is very well written and keeps the reader captivated and wondering what comes next.  As the owner of two prosperous night clubs, Dougherty was leading a very hedonistic life, striving to be &quot;one with his toys.&quot;  He was a playboy who had strayed far from the spiritual path on which his Catholic school had tried to direct him toward. After becoming involved in an altercation at his New York nightclub, Dougherty had a near-death experience, which involved nearly every one of the characteristics associated with the NDE.  He was met on the &quot;Other Side&quot; by an old friend, who had been killed in Vietnam, then accompanied &quot;into the light,&quot; where he encountered other deceased friends and relatives and had a life review.  &quot;While in the presence of God's light, many revelations were conveyed to me,&quot; he writes.  &quot;As God was bestowing a radiant energy upon me, I recognized that the energy contained information about universal laws, revelations that were part of God's plan for the universe.&quot;  Several chapters are devoted to these revelations, but Doughtery's own awakening is what kept me glued to the book.  He comes across as very credible in explaining why there is no way that his NDE can, as the pseudo-skeptics claim, be written off as nothing more than an hallucination or dream. It so impacted him that he gave up his nightclubs as well as alcohol to pursue a life of helping others.  The book meets my &quot;4-I&quot; test -- interesting, informative, intriguing, and inspiring.  I plan to give some copies of the book to friends and relatives as Christmas gifts.	2001-08-22

It was a quick buy in a &quot;New Age&quot; book store in San Francisco.  I debated with myself as to whether I really wanted it and whether it would add anything to my research.  Feeling somewhat guilty about walking out of the store without a purchase, I bought it.  I'm glad I did.  However, while the spiritual messages are interesting, it is the historical content that really intrigued me.<br />  The author was an Estonian film critic in the Soviet Union before migrating to the United States. The story of her trials and tribulations with the KGB and other Soviet agencies kept me glued to the book.  While we often heard about the cruelties of  the Soviet hierarchy and its agencies before wall crumbled, we did not have that many firsthand, personal accounts.  To hear or read the author tell it, it was worse than I had imagined. People were afraid to make friends, because even your friends could turn out to be KGB informants.  Because of her confrontations with the KGB, the author was reduced from being a respected writer to being a menial laborer.<br />  The author's spiritual awakening after moving to the United States is also very informative and inspiring.	2001-06-16

They include near-death experiences, deathbed visions, past-life regressions, clairvoyance, clairaudience, faith healing, ESP, precognitive dreams, apparations, and automatic writing.  The skeptic or the fundamentalist will scoff at most or many of them, perhaps calling some of them mere coincidences, but anyone with an open mind, especially those who have become familiar with the operations of other dimensions of reality, will understand and appreciate these stories. The story of her father's NDE and deathbed visions is especially interesting, intriguing and inspiring.<br />  As Lanigan mentions, most of us are too busy &quot;running helter-skelter&quot; in our everyday activities, too busy just surviving, to take note of the magic or divine influences in our lives.  The purpose of the book, she says, is &quot;to lift the blinders from our eyes and reveal the divine ballet performed between humans and angels.&quot;<br />  This is not really an angel book, per se.  It is one woman's observations relative to psychic phenomena. It may not be for the person who has his or her &quot;blinders&quot; strapped on tightly, but those who have shed their blinders will find it entertaining and validating, while those who have their blinder on only loosely might find it an &quot;eye-opener.&quot;rs&quot; strapped on tightly, but those who have shed their blinders will find it entertaining and validating, while those who have their blinder on only loosely might find it an &quot;eye-opener.&quot;	2001-06-16

However, the entity possession that the author of this book addresses is not quite the same thing.  &quot;Entities are not full human spirits who have lost their way and become attached to a living human being,&quot; Dr. Sagan explains.  &quot;If four weeks after the death of your aunt you happen to catch an entity that feels like her, it is just a fragment of her astral body, not her immortal soul trapped inside you.&quot;  A graduate of the Paris 5 Faculty of Medicine, who also studied Sanskrit, Sagan now direct the Clairvision School in Sydney, Australia.  There he helps clients dislodge themselves of these astral &quot;parasites&quot; through an expanded state of perception. The book contains many case studies in which clients are brought to focus on an entity and then to clear themselves of it.  While apparently unique in Western parapsychology, such entity possession is, according to Sagan, well documented in Eastern esoteric sources.  To help us understand it, Sagan first explains the four-fold nature of the human being.  The lower complex is the physical body and the etheric body.  The etheric is the life of the physical and apparently seen as the aura.  The upper complex is the astral body and the Ego or Higher Self.  Our thoughts and emotions are contained within the astral body, which is entangled like a spider web around the Ego and encased within the etheric body.  At physical death, the upper complex separates from the lower, leaving the physical body to decay and the etheric body to dissolve in the ethers.  However, as the etheric body dissolves, the shattering of the astral body begins.  Sagan says that it is not uncommon for the astral fragments to retain their etheric parts with which they used to be connected.  These fragments are imprinted with characteristics of the person, including cravings, addictions, emotions, and traits.  If the person was an alcoholic, his astral fragments go wandering around in astral space looking for something to satisfy them.  As like attracts like in the astral world, an alcoholic fragment will be attracted to living people who crave alcohol.  The etheric body of living humans has its own defense mechanism.  Therefore, it is usually in &quot;high risk&quot; situations, such as surgery, an accident, or intoxication, when the defense mechanism is down, that the astral parasites can attach themselves.  While mainstream medicine no doubt looks askance at Sagan, he writes with authority and conviction.  Most of it makes metaphysical sense, or at least as much sense as the alternative theories.

It is not a &quot;how to&quot; book.  While it is intended as in introduction to the use of Kundalini energy for spiritual awakening, the book deals more with the philosophy underlying the &quot;shortest path to God&quot; than the techniques involved in achieving the transcendent state. The author explains that his purpose in writing the book is to show how common beliefs in most religions of the world have Kundalini energy as their common denominator even though this energy is given different names.  It emanates below the base of the spine and then moves upwards through the chakras.<br />Dr. Kumar, who experienced his Kundalini awakening in 1987, frequently calls on scholars, seekers, seers, sages, swamis, saints, and saviors to confirm or illustrate his points.  These include Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, Mohammed, Joan of Arc, Swami Muktananda, Saint Hildegard, Lord Krishna, Mary Baker Eddy, Arthur Conan Doyle, Swami Ramakrishna, Grace Cooke, R. M. Bucke, Edgar Cayce, Deepak Chopra, John of the Cross, Saint Paul, Emmanuel Swedenborg, Carl Jung, and many others, even boxer George Foreman.<br />As I was not really looking for a &quot;how to&quot; book, I was very pleased to find out the book was much more than that.

After Lodge's son, Raymond, was killed in World War I, during 1914, Lodge received various messages from him through several mediums.  Although Lodge thoroughly analyzed the messages and their means with scientific acumen and was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that they were from his son, much of the scientific community guffawed at Lodge's conclusions.  Still, Lodge remained steadfast in his beliefs and his book did much to promote the cause of Spiritualism, which might broadly be defined as the organized practice of communication with discarnate spirits.<br />While science lined up against Spiritualism on one side, religion was opposed on the other side, primarily because of Bible warnings relative to spirit communication. Many English citizens who had lost loved ones in the Great War turned to Spiritualism and away from the Anglican Church, which apparently did little to help them in their grieving.  Seeing this &quot;cult&quot; as a threat, the Church hierarchy began to consider its own views on death, eternal life, and spirit communication.  Finally, in 1939, the Anglican Church commissioned an investigation into Spiritualism,which had continued to flourish in spite of the fact it was caught between science and religion.  After the committee report was submitted to Archbishop Cosmo Lang, it was suppressed, apparently because the committee findings to some degree approved of much of what Spiritualism had to offer. It was finally released in 1979.<br />Dr. Kollar, a priest and history professor at St. Vincent College and St. Vincent Seminary in Latrob, PA, dug deep into the archives of the Anglican Church to find out exactly what went on in the various exchanges among the Church leaders.  Many of the letters between the archbishop and various bishops reveal numerous concerns they had about the needs of the faithful and how those needs were being filled by Spiritualism and not by the Church itself.  Kollar finds clues as to what motivated the cover-up of the 1939 report.<br />This investigative report makes for an intriguing story.ithful and how those needs were being filled by Spiritualism and not by the Church itself.

At age 56, after a brilliant scientific career, he devoted the last 30 years of his life to spiritual meditation and mediumstic trances.  In what apparently were out-of-body experiences, he conversed with numerous souls in the spirit world, including many low-level spirits.  For Swedenborg, evil, hell, and the devil are synonymous.  When he talks of a &quot;devil&quot; or a &quot;satan,&quot; he is referring to an evil spirit or one who has chosen to turn away from God.<br />In &quot;Debates with Devils,&quot; Don Rose offers a compendium of what Swedenborg set forth in some 30 volumes he wrote about his findings in the spirit world.  The focus in this book is on what he found in the lower realms of the spirit world.  A companion book,&quot;Conversations with Angels,&quot; focuses on the higher or heavenly realms.<br />Hell is not literally a place of fire, as much of orthodox religion teaches.  As Swedenborg saw it, it was more a fire of the mind. The souls in this state continue to love the material more than the spiritual. &quot;In the same degree in which angels have wisdom and intelligence, infernal spirits have malice and cunning,&quot; Swedenborg wrote. These devils use their cunning to negatively influence those still living on the earthly realms.  &quot;As soon as they detect even the smallest thing that a person loves or get a scent, so to speak, of what is delightful and precious to him, they attack it instantly and try to destroy it, and so the whole person,&quot; Swedenborg wrote.<br />Swedenborg says that hell is not God's revenge or punishment.  Souls choose hell of their own free will. And yet, God permits them to climb out of hell into better states of mind.<br />The seeker who wants a view of hell that makes sense -- one that goes well beyond what orthodox religion has offered -- should read this book.ll that makes sense -- one that goes well beyond what orthodox religion has offered -- should read this book.	2000-12-31

It offers much food for  thought.<br />Evidence of survival comes to us in different ways -- near-death  experiences, mediumship, past-life regression, and astral travel being the  most often cited in recent years.  However, the Death Bed Vision (DBV) is  one that is equally strong and not so fully explored in recent  publications.<br />Sir William Barrett of England wrote the best-known book  (&quot;Death-Bed Visions&quot;)on this subject in 1926.  But before him,  astronomer Camille Flammarion's 1922 book offered a comprehensive report on  DBVs.  In 1977, Osis and Haraldsson researched the subject and reported on  it.  Now, Dr. Carla Wills-Brandon brings us up to date.  She cites many of  the best case studies of Barrett, Flammarion, and Osis, but add her own  interesting, intriguing and informative research, including several  personal experiences that are very convincing.<br />DBVs inlcude reports of  the dying seeing deceased loved ones waiting for them as well as glimpses  of the &quot;other side,&quot; reports by bedside witnesses who have  observed spirits in waiting, and other witnesses, including doctors and  nurses, who have seen the spirit body leave the earthly shell.<br />The  non-spiritually-challenged should also find this book very helpful and  reinforcing. It will give them some indication as to what to expect or look  for when friends or relatives prepare to cross over, and, of course, what  they can look for when it is their time to graduate to the realms of higher  vibration.<br />Having read several hundred metaphysical books, I'd have to  put this in the Top 10.  I intend to give copies to my two daughters, both  registered nurses.

Not only does she paint vivid word pictures, she provides  drawings of structures on the other side -- produced, she tells us, by her  going into transe and her spirit guide then directing two artists.  According to Browne, her research is based on her direct-voice mediumship  (wherein her spirit guide communicates with others in the room while Browne  is in a transe and the material is being taped),her near-death experience  (NDE), the NDEs of others, her astral traveling, and past-life and  between-life regressions of many of her clients (she is a  hypotherapist).<br />Although I have read dozens of metaphysical books on this  subject, I have never come across any with as much detailed information as  this one.  I must confess that I had some reservations about reading her  book as Browne seemed a bit too &quot;New Age&quot; and cultish for me  (since she started her own church).  The first half of the book was fully  consistent with all of the things I had previously read about the Other  Side, including the many dimensions or planes and the fact that the plane  we gravitate to is based on our actions and good works in this life time.  We get many chances to evolve in spirit (other lifetimes) and progress  toward the Godhead (true heaven).<br />In the second half of the book,  Browne gives detailed information on aliens, angels, and councils on the  Other Side.  Much of that I have read before, but never so much and with  the certainty and matter-of-factness of Browne.  When I finished the book,  I didn't know what to think.  I believe Sylvia Browne is sincere and  credible in so far as she believes what she is writing. Moreover,  everything she writes makes sense.  However, whether the pictures she  paints of the Other Side are unconsciously embellished to fit her  preconceived views (formed by much reading of metaphysical material)is the  question. Since nearly all of it is consistent with the information given  us by other mystics, seers, mediums, regressionists, etc. I do not discount  it and am inclined to accept Sylvia Browne as a woman with a very special  gift.unconsciously embellished to fit her  preconceived views (formed by much reading of metaphysical material)is the  question.

A big part of that wisdom is coming to understand paradox. Perhaps the biggest paradox has to do with overcoming our fears.  The secret, we learn,  is not running from those fears, as so many people do, but turning around  and confronting them.  Better yet, embracing them.  That's what Ram Dass  advocates with the greatest fears of the western world -- aging, changing,  and dying.<br />Plato wrote about Socrates &quot;practicing death.&quot;  Michel de Montaigne, the 16th Century French philosopher, wrote: &quot;To  practice death is to practice freedom. A man who has learned how to die has  unlearned how to be a slave. Knowing how to die gives us freedom from  subjection and constraint.&quot;  Carl Jung said that he was convinced that  it is hygienic to discover in death a goal toward which one can strive.  Ram Dass discusses the psychology and philosophy of embracing aging,  change, and dying, or, to put it in other words, of &quot;practicing  death.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, the average materialistic Westerner will not  grasp the wisdom of Ram Dass.  It is likely too advanced for the pure  scientist or for the religious fundamentalist. In order to fully appreciate  this book, one must have at least attempted to expand his or her  consciousness to things outside the material world, beyond the ego. For the  person on a truly spiritual path, Ram Dass provides the words to explain  what that person has intuitively felt but has never been able to explain.  The real paradox is that in learning how to practice death, we learn how to  fully appreciate life and how to live it joyfully until it is time for  transition.	2000-06-28

Loved ones on the other side would come  through and provide clear-cut, evidential information that helped the  grieving ones overcome their grief.  Some of them are real tearjerkers.  Once a person can overcome his or her fear of death, once that person can  embrace death, life becomes more meaningful, less stressful, and much more  enjoyable.

It is different from most in that the focus is on what Dr. Rommer calls  &quot;less-than-positive&quot; (LTP) NDEs.  Most of the NDE books detail  the blissful or &quot;heavenly&quot; type experience.  Accounts of the LTP  experience have not been as readily available, apparently because people  who have had them have been reluctant to tell others about their  &quot;hellish&quot; experiences.  However, Dr. Rommer has managed to  interview a number of such LTP experiencers.  She finds that such  experiences, while often frightening, are usually transforming and  therefore &quot;blessings in disguise.&quot;  A large percentage of LTP  experiencers &quot;awaken&quot; to their past transgressions and to the  need to straighten out their lives by embarking on a spiritual  path.<br />There are numerous interesting accounts by experiencers.  While the  focus is on the LTP, there are enough positive experiences to offer the  reader some bliss to go along with the unpleasant and more than balance the  negative.  There are some very interesting philosophies related by some  experiencers.  Dr. Rommer approaches the subject with scientific  objectivity, but fortunately, for the reader, she lacks the willful  blindness and intellectual arrogance of the avowed skeptic.	2000-03-21

The author is Professor Emeritus at Temple University with graduate degrees in dentistry,  endodontics, microbiology, clinical psychology, and clinical nutrition.  He  therefore approaches the subject from the perspective of a scientist.  Among his 12 previous books were seven dealing with stress management.  Although he had a near-death experience in 1983, Dr. Morse was too busy  satisfying his material needs to concern himself with the spiritual  implications of his NDE.  It was not until after he retired from Temple  University 10 years later that he started to seriously consider his  spiritual needs.  Triggered by the deaths of several close friends and  relatives, Morse began dealing with his own stress disorder -- death  anxiety.  Rather than continuing to repress or suppress his fear of death,  as the vast majority of people do, Morse did an about-face and met those  fears head-on.  He read everything he could about near-death experiences so  that he could better understand his own NDE.  He began to see connections  between the NDE and general out-of-body experiences (OBEs), i.e., the  ability of some people to loosen the etheric or spirit body from the  physical body and explore other dimensions of reality.  His investigation  then took him to apparations, visions, dreams, seances, and the reports of  credible mediums.  As a result of his investigation, Morse makes a  &quot;Kierkegaardian leap&quot; by embracing death, thereby finding peace  of mind and greater enjoyment of this lifetime.<br />The second half of  the book is a summary of the afterlife concepts of all of the major  religions and sects, even including fraternal orders such as the Freemasons  and Rosicrucians.<br />The book touches all bases in man's quest for  understanding what follows physical death  -- Biblical accounts of the  afterlife,reincarnation, the stages of the afterlife, evolution vs  creationism, electromagnetic spectrum theories, every conceivable topic  related to the survival of consciousness.

Clarke's book is about achieving optimum balance between energy and effort.  It's about coordinating the effort with the energy that allows for  adaptation, i.e., better performances in the sport.  Clarke offers a matrix  in which workout effort is classified in varying degrees on  one side and  in which energy is classified across the bottom.  There are 30 possible  combinations of this effort-energy matrix.  Clarke says that only five are  optimum adaptive workouts.<br />The runner who want to improve should gain a  lot from reading Clarke's excellent work.	1999-06-27

US	52580842	R2A56XGGO2XJCP	0310219922	290635970	Light and Death	Books	5	55	56	N	Y	Interesting, Informative, Intriguing, and Inspiring	Dr. Sabom presents a Christian perspective of the Near-Death Experience, citing many Bible passages that allude to the NDE. As a &quot;liberal&quot; Christian (by Sabom's definition), I found his &quot;conservative&quot; or  fundamentalist Christian approach a bit puzzling and surprising; however,  it was intriguing nonetheless. Most authors on the subject tend to go the  other way, i.e., be overly objective for fear that they will appear  unscientific and therefore unintelligent.  Dr. Sabom clearly does not  suffer from this ego hangup. There were a number of very interesting quotes  by people who have had NDEs, not unsimilar to those given up by other  authors on the NDE but each adds to the credibility of the NDE as something  more than a mere hallucination of an oxygen-deprived brain.<br />There is an  interesting chapter on prayer (&quot;spiritual medicine at  work&quot;).<br />The book will not appeal to the skeptic, but for those who  are prepared to recognize the limits of science, it is an excellent read.  I bought extra copies for my daughters, both registered nurses, hoping that  Dr. Sabom's research and views will at least partially counterbalance the  skeptical attitude of most doctors they come in contact with.	1999-04-19

Part I of the book summarizes  the various afterlife planes or spheres from the low spheres, where  earthbound souls dwell, many of them unaware they have passed over, on up  to the higher realms (Seventh Heaven?) inhabited by more enlightened souls.  Much of Part I appears to be based on his metaphysical research rather  than what he has learned from his abilities as a medium. Generally, the  souls that communicate through a medium seem to be from the middle or lower  planes rather than the higher ones.<br />In Part II, Van Praagh presents  some very interesting case histories from his experiences as a medium able  to communicate with souls on the &quot;other side.&quot;<br />For those who  have not read Van Praagh's first book, &quot;Talking to Heaven&quot; or are  unfamiliar with the abilities of a medium, I would recommend reading Part  II before Part I.<br />As someone who has read more than 400  metaphysical/spiritual books, I would place this on my &quot;top 10&quot;  list.  It's definitely a treasure.	1999-03-08

The other reviewers have already expressed my thoughts.  The one thing I would add is that, unlike the other books by mediums I have read, Edward clearly explains how the communication from  departed souls comes to him, i.e., in picture images that he must  interpret. Other mediums have briefly touched on this or just alluded to  it. Never have I seen an explanation like that Edward has given the reader.  So often the skeptics are quick to jump on the information that is wrong  or does not make sense, as if the medium should be 100% correct on  everything. When you read how Edward gets the information, you understand  how so much of what comes through is not clear or can be misinterpreted. I  intend to buy several more copies to give as Christmas gifts.	1998-11-23

Most of them don't realize they have died and are quite surprised when the author tries to question them.  He asks the spirit to identify itself and the spirit sometimes reacts by asking what business it is of his. It can be both humorous and sad at the same time. For one reason or another, these earthbound spirits have not entered the light and gone on to the other side.  The author's questions are aimed at finding out why and then helping the spirit to make a proper transition to the &quot;other side.&quot;  It's the best work of its kind among a dozen or so books of this nature that I have read.  The author is objective, analytical, and credible.	1998-07-17

Author Berman is an excellent writer and  is both objective and analytical in his search.  The near-death experiences are only a part of the evidence he explores.	1998-07-12
