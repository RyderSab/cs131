It opened my eyes to communism in China in the 60's and 70's in that although I had heard of the \\"re-education\\" of the youths from intellectual and political families, I had never really considered the harshness of it all.<br /><br />This novel touches upon the humanity of man in ways that, I suspect, are as common as when civilization first began. I was especially captivated by the manner in which myths and legends probably appeared among unsophisticated and rather simple people who are closed off from the communications of the larger cities.<br /><br />I was intrigued that his friend found the beautiful little seamstress \\"too uncultured\\" to love at first, even though he made love to her.  And was mesmerized with the actions of the beautiful girl once she is exposed to knowledge.	2005-08-29

When I first read the premise for this novel, \\"Wealthy man dying of cancer leaves videotape, which issues a challenge for his three sons to find their inheritance,\\" I thought the book would be trite and predictable.  Wrong!  I just could not turn the pages fast enough and read this in one day.  It was just a gripping and suspenseful book that had so many twists and turns that my heart was pounding at times!<br /><br />\\"The Codex\\" is action-packed, with great, believable dialogue. It cries out to be made into a movie!  At the beginning of the novel, you are aware of the separate lives that the three brothers have made for themselves and it is painfully obvious while there is no real overt hostility among the brothers - there is absolutely no closeness either.  You cannot fathom how they will ever cooperate and work with one another to succeed in their mission.<br /><br />The novel very realistically captures the failings of so many fathers who are successful in a \\"larger than life\\" manner, revealing the intense pressures and expectations they put on their children.<br /><br />\\"The Codex\\" is a story of redemption and of personal growth, which is masterfully and expertly woven.	2005-07-15

At first glance, \\"Death of a Gossip\\" did not fit my ideal of the \\"hero.\\"  It features Hamish Macbeth, a Scottish village constable - who isn't particular handsome or suave and is notoriously known for \\"mooching\\" coffee at the local hotel. (He sends the majority of his paycheck home to his parents and siblings.) Initially, I thought it might be a little dated as it was written 20 years ago.<br /><br />But I quickly discovered that there is a reason for the success of this series, with additional new episodes published each year. In many ways, this series is light - and in many ways, it is rather profound. M.C. Beaton conveys important insights about human flaws and strengths in a remarkably understated way.<br /><br />As the title suggests, this book focuses on the murder of a newspaper gossip columnist, who has made a career of embarking on various group vacations throughout the country - but only after first investigating the \\"skeletons\\" of the other guests on the tour.  She has built her reputation on ultimately exposing these vacationers in her column.<br /><br />When \\"The Gossip\\" is murdered, Hamlish steps in to investigate the mystery - but in a funny, quirky way.  The mystery is solved through the often hilarious recounts of conversations and events that take place in the quaint, unsophisticated Scottish village.<br /><br />Hamish Macbeth GROWS on you and wise advice is to be gleaned from this patient, sometimes lazy, all too human constable  - almost before you discern it. He transports one back to a simpler time when the good character of an individual was the most important attribute one could possess. I urge readers to give this series a try because it only gets better with each book.	2005-06-21

I cannot ever remember enjoying a \\"romantic novel\\" more than \\"He Loves Lucy.\\" (This is rather strange because although I thought \\"Public Displays of Affection,\\" - also by Susan Donovan, was well-written, I loathed the entire premise of this earlier novel - although I'm far from being a conservative.) When I read the concept behind Donovan's new book, I decided to take a chance and ordered it from Amazon.<br /><br />\\"He Loves Lucy\\" details Lucy Cunningham's year long weight program in the spotlight. Each month she weighs herself on television as part of an ad campaign for a local gym. Her goal is to lose up to 100 lbs. for which she and her personal trainer, Theo, will each receive $1000 for every pound she loses.  This money will enable Lucy to start up her own advertising/public relations firm and it will allow Theo the means to return to medical school.<br /><br />I LOVED everything about this book! Everything from Lucy's near- fatal ingestion of a Milk Dud upon meeting her hunky trainer, to the glimpses into her food diary and funny affirmations, to pizza man Luigi being in the second row during her weigh-in, to her \\"motivational tool\\" to lose the last of her weight.<br /><br />I am sure that one of the reasons that I enjoyed this book so much is that I totally identified with Lucy as I was about 40 lbs. overweight at her age. I went on a strict diet and exercise program (although not on television!) and people were amazed at the transformation. My life truly changed. I especially thought it insightful that the nearly universal typecasting of overweight women as \\"fat, lazy, slobs\\" and beautiful women as \\"superficial, conceited, airheads\\" was included.  Usually the truth can only be found on an individual basis.<br /><br />As usual, Susan Donovan's characters are witty and often hilarious. Her plots are creative and fresh. An exceptional and touching romance that should prove to be especially inspiring to anyone with a few pounds to lose.<br /><br />This would be a GREAT movie!a GREAT movie!	2005-05-19

In \\"Total Rush,\\" she returns readers to the Italian/New York roots of the Dante family, focusing on Gemma - who has always independently marched to the beat of her own drummer. A little offbeat, Gemma owns her own \\"mystical, crystal, candle, incense\\" type of shop in New York.<br /><br />In her first two books, Martin's main focus was on hockey with the New York Blades.  However when Gemma falls for Sean Kennealy, a New York Fireman, Martin brilliantly captures the camaraderie, dangers, and relationship issues conducive to fire fighters.<br /><br />Although I am not a big \\"romance reader,\\" I have never been able to put Martin's books down!  I have always finished each book the same day because she has brought believable characters with realistic issues to life.<br /><br />Especially moving in \\"Total Rush\\" was the quite real dilemma that so many in our society face today concerning the care of family members with Alzheimer's.  Martin addresses the issue of the utter exhaustion and fatigue that plague caregivers in spite of wanting to do their very best to help. Readers get a small glimpse into the overwhelming numbness and strain that can often lead to elder abuse.<br /><br />\\"Total Rush\\" was a delightful and romantic book that was far from being depressing.  Yet it left me thinking of so much more after I had finished reading it.  I now have a deep compassion for what family members must endure with the ones they love when faced with real problems.  These problems may be health related or work stress related, but Martin doesn't just glibly have the main characters \\"riding off into the sunset\\" to pursue their romance. Deirdre Martin once again proves that \\"light and romantic\\" books need not be superficial.	2005-05-19

Although I haven't really cooked much in recent years, I have collected cookbooks since I was young.  I own at least 200 of them.  In recent years, many of them have been \\"Diet Cookbooks.\\" In virtually all of them, I have only liked maybe 1/10th of the recipes.<br /><br />That said, this is one of the VERY BEST COOKBOOKS out there!  I almost didn't purchase this, because so many of the diet plans out there always do a half-hearted cookbook following their best sellers...almost like an afterthought. Also, I had been so disappointed with what I felt I would be able to eat while on the BFL program. WRONG!<br /><br />If you are looking for nutritious (but GOOD!) recipes that your WHOLE family can eat or you need to lose a few pounds or are even on another diet program, or if you are even THINKING of going on the BFL Challenge, I URGE you to buy this book!<br /><br />\\"Eating for Life\\" is AMAZING! It is a quality hardcover book and each recipe features a full page picture. But what floored me was that ALL of the recipes are GREAT! Most do not take a great deal of time to prepare either! (I have actually started COOKING again!)<br /><br />The ONE feature that could have been included was that the nutritional info is not included with the recipes. I have an online program that quickly converts this information for me, but it would have been nice to have this included.<br /><br />However, something that was included that I thought was so terrific - and am surprised that most cookbooks haven't done this before - is that for most of the recipes, it includes a little \\"cameo\\" picture of the specific brands of products that they used to make the recipe!  I loved this feature because I have made many recipes before that because I used a different brand -- just didn't quite taste like the original.  Most cookbooks don't feature this because I guess it is like \\"free advertising\\" for these products...but hey, if they are good enough to use, they deserve the exposure.<br /><br />Bill Phillips: You outdid yourself with this terrific cookbook!> <br />Bill Phillips: You outdid yourself with this terrific cookbook!	2005-05-05

Stephanie Barron was one of the first authors to base her book, \\"Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor\\" on the premise that these are the \\"long-lost journals\\" of Jane Austen, herself.  In my opinion, no one does it better.<br /><br />As a deep admirer of Jane Austen's works, Stephanie Barron has brilliantly penned both a suspenseful murder mystery AND kept true to the realism of Jane Austen. I think her books are wonderful.<br /><br />Footnotes explaining certain customs, historic notes or words are liberally sprinkled throughout the novel.  I found their addition to be quite helpful.<br /><br />However,  you will note that there are many divided reviews. If you have ever been the least interested in any of the Jane Austen novels and enjoy mysteries as well, I urge you to try this series.  Barron has just had her 7th book in this series published...so obviously she has MANY fans.<br /><br />Likewise, if you hated Jane Austen's books when you had to read them for English class, then perhaps you should pass this series by -  because it is written in the same vein...which is the highest praise I can give the author!  A brilliant novel and thoroughly enjoyable mystery!	2005-04-26

Although I have never met Dr. Dharma, his work with Alzheimer's is internationally known, as he is the leading authority on the prevention and reversal of Alzheimer symptoms. I learned of his work as he was the first in the medical community to establish the Alzheimer Prevention Foundation International, here in Tucson.<br /><br />By candidly voicing my own opinion, I may address the same apprehensions as someone who is reading this review. You see, initially, I thought that Dr. Dharma's work would center totally around eastern religion because his photos feature him in a turban. I was VERY skeptical. While I like to think that I have an open mind, I just have never been into practices that weren't fairly \\"mainstream.\\" I then read his medical creditials and was convinced that this was a man with intelligence and vision - who knew something that it was important that I learn.<br /><br />Dr. Dharma is so respected in the medical community that he was asked to speak before Congress regarding an integrated medical approach in the prevention of Alzheimer's. This threatens to reach epidemic proportions in the next 20 years.<br /><br />If you are concerned about an aging parent's memory; if you know someone with Alzheimer's and think that absolutely nothing can be done about it; if you are experiencing your own bouts of occasional memory loss - I URGE you to order this kit!<br /><br />Alzheimer's begins approximately 30 years before the first symptoms appear. If someone in your family has Alzheimer's, this also increases your OWN chances of developing the disease.<br /><br />I was amazed at what I learned in this program. I learned about memory loss as we age and memory loss under extreme on-going stress. In stressful situations, cortisol prevents glucose from entering your brain cells and blocks neurotransmitter functions, which cause your brain cells to die.<br /><br />However, the medical evidence is absolutely conclusive in showing that the symptoms of Alzheimer's and other forms of memory loss can be alleviated and reversed by regenerating and increasing brain cell connections.<br /><br />The memory kit centers on 4 basic approaches to reversing memory loss.  They are not gimmicks or memory tricks found in so many other books, but are medical advances that are leading the way in this field.  The kit includes a book, a CD, and a series of large cards.<br /><br />I have recently read other publications by Dr. Dharma, which have been life transforming. This physician is the world's LEADING authority on the prevention of Alzheimer's and his advice is medically solid. I urge you to investigate this great new science and help yourself or someone you care about. The cost of the kit is so little, yet the information you gain will literally transform your life.other forms of memory loss can be alleviated and reversed by regenerating and increasing brain cell connections.<br /><br />The memory kit centers on 4 basic approaches to reversing memory loss.

It rates right up there with the first two books of her series, although all are great.<br /><br />Aunt Dimity is featured a little more here than in other books, which focused on neighbors and friends of Lori Shepherd, but I would still love to have Aunt Dimity featured even more!<br /><br />Upon initial inspection, \\"Aunt Dimity and the Next of Kin,\\" may sound rather bleak as Lori meets Elizabeth Beacham while on her volunteer duties of visiting hospital patients. Elizabeth has a terminal disease, but is without family.  Her brother, whom she was seemingly close to, has disappeared. Learning of Lori's great knack for solving mysteries, Elizabeth seeks her help.<br /><br />While the premise may sound depressing, I found the story to be very uplifting and inspiring.  It was more than just a \\"cozy read.\\"  It leaves the reader reflecting on what is truly important in life. Is it wealth or social position? Is it fame or possessions? Is it the love of friends or neighbors? Is it family?  The answer I arrived at was that it is the legacy that one's life imprints on those you leave behind.<br /><br />This is a series that is best when read consecutively and bought all at once - because once you start reading the first book, \\"Aunt Dimity's Death\\" - you will not want to stop!	2005-04-22

It is delightful!<br /><br />Likewise, Hiro Kimura's cover art brilliantly showcases Joanne Fluke's work as usual. What a terrific artist!<br /><br />Hannah and Lisa face grim competition in the form of Georgia transplants, Shawna Lee and Vanessa Quinn, when the two southern belles open up a bakery directly across the street from their own shop.  They are barely making a profit and news of their competitions' exquisitely decorated shop, does nothing to alleviate Hannah's fears.<br /><br />Her fears are even more compounded when she realizes that she faces competition not only with her bakery, but with her heart. Mike is increasingly seen in the company of Shawna Lee!<br /><br />Hannah tries to focus on the business and puts her energy instead into Lisa's wedding and worrying about her mother's new romance.  And as always, she turns to and depends on good, faithful, best friend, Norman - who while he may not be as passionate or as good looking as Mike, has always been steady and true.  I like them both so much that I hope that Hannah never has to choose!<br /><br />But suddenly - all in one night, Hannah's competition is \\"snuffed out!\\" The mayhem and the murder that Fluke \\"cooks up\\" makes this one of her best books yet!

In \\"Cross Your Heart and Hope to Die,\\" Nancy Martin has taken the \\"Blackbird Sisters Series\\" to another level!  Her latest installment, which features the often chaotic lives of the three Blackbird Sisters, is filled with Martin's trademark wit and banter dialogues; mystery; innovative plots; and something....new.  When you reach the final page in \\"Cross Your Heart and Hope to Die\\" - you CARE about these characters and what is going to happen in their lives next. Nora, Libby, Emma, Michael, Lexie, and \\"Killer Dog Spike\\" - you find that you can't wait to read about the next chapter in their lives.<br /><br />Martin doesn't disappoint with her play on words when \\"Cross Your Heart and Hope to Die\\" centers around \\"the Brinker Bra\\" - an invention which turns every woman's physique into the \\"Jane Russells\\" of yesteryear.  The fashion industry becomes fierce however, when Nora's boss, Kitty Keough - Chief Society Columnist, is \\"pantyhosed\\" to death!<br /><br />Nora has more on her mind, however, than writing a memorial to Kitty, when Michael Abruzzo and his mobster family are implicated in the murder.  Between rescuing her two sisters: Libby, who has become the \\"tupperware porn saleswoman of adult toy products\\" and Emma who has escaped from rehab to ride bareback as the Brinker Bra's \\"Lady Godiva\\" - Nora has her hands full!<br /><br />This is a series that just keeps getting better with Martin's immaginative plots and multi-dimensional characters. The highest compliment that I can give to her is that when the box arrived from Amazon.com, it contained six new works by six of my favorite authors.  Nancy Martin's book was the one I chose FIRST. It was better than every expectation....a great read.	2005-04-19

I ordered \\"The Thin Commandments Diet\\" expecting to find most of the same diet advice that is contained in the 50+ other diet books that grace my bookshelf. Weight has been a life long struggle for me although many times I have managed to remain quite slim. However, I felt that if I managed to gain even ONE piece of advice to help with the weight battle - it would be worth Amazon's small price of $10 for a hardback book with over 300 pages in it.<br /><br />Like many people, when I experience stress I have often turned to food. Unfortunately, the older I have become the more difficult it has been to get the weight off again.<br /><br />Before I even opened this book, I jotted down the \\"10 Commandments\\" that I expected to find. I mean, after all, how different could his advice be?  And yet I found, that while Dr. Stephen Gullo incorporated some of the dieting advice that I had encountered before - he presented it in such a way that it was as though I was reading it for the very first time.<br /><br />How many times have you read a diet book that had lots of recipes, but you really didn't have a clue as to what to eat when you weren't following complicated recipes?  The Thin Commandments IS DIFFERENT.  Dr. Gullo has included a list of \\"110 Best Diet Foods\\" and lists specific brands!  In my opinion, THIS BOOK IS WORTH BUYING FOR THE LIST ALONE! The list doesn't deal with \\"exotic, gourmet\\" foods at all. These items can be purchased at your local supermarket and Trader Joe's or if you live in a smaller town - he lists the websites as well.<br /><br />He presents this approach because you can have the BEST INTENTIONS in the world, but if you are absolutely SICK of \\"diet food\\" or are eating the same things over and over again - how long are you going to stay on ANY diet?  If you feel you are being deprived, technology in the last 10 years has made such an abundance of foods that taste even better, in some cases, than  foods that are loaded with calories.<br /><br />I had to smile at what was termed \\"expensive\\" food in one review because it's not. Eggs are used a lot as well as fruits and other items. NO! Expensive is buying a grocery cart full of sweets and snacks; expensive is having to buy wardrobes in three different sizes; expensive is health problems such as diabetes from weight gains; but most of all expensive is not living your life to its fullest because you are too embarrassed to go to a social event or a reunion; full of regret for letting life pass you by.<br /><br />Dr. Gullo mentions that you can be the most successful person in the world (I thought of Oprah BEFORE she lost her weight) and if you are heavy - how happy are you going to be with yourself?  But he also mentions the reverse: You can have the most overwhelming problem or the worst day of your life - and if you have conquered your weight, that is the one area at least that you can feel pleased about during that time.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, this book is $10 (or a trip for two to McD's). I urge you to just take one more step and believe you can do this just one more time and order the \\"The Thin Commandments.\\"  I learned SO MUCH from this book (and remember I'm a diet book \\"expert\\")!

Elaine Flinn's second book in her antique mystery series is even better than the first!  \\"Tagged for Murder\\" (love the title) again features antique dealer, Molly Doyle, as she continues to rebuild her reputation in the posh community of affluent Carmel, CA.<br /><br />Mayhem erupts when local antique dealer, Trudy Collins, abruptly dies from an apparent heart attack at the Carmel Antiques Show.  When Molly's sister, Carrie, suddenly arrives that day with her daughter after a 15-year estrangement, Molly once again fears her sister is being deceitful.  Carrie swiftly and unceremoniously leaves her daughter, Emma, with Molly and takes off to pursue a \\"legal career\\" overseas.<br /><br />As fake antiques and additional murders begin to surface, Molly attempts to piece together who is behind these acts  - against her better judgment and certainly against the wishes of Police Chief Randall.  The result is a great mystery and terrific development of wonderful characters.<br /><br />Flinn has a wonderful series going!  The dialogue is written in a realistic manner as to the verbiage that individuals actually use.  Any \\"dangling participles\\" are included to make the conversations realistic and engrossing as, let's face it, most speech patterns and dialogues are not always in complete grammatical sentences.  To change this would change the whole rhythm of the characters.<br /><br />The addition of Emma was absolutely brilliant!  This kid brings such a new dimension to Molly and others.  I thought that Flinn VERY ACCURATELY AND REALISTICALLY did not have Emma enrolled in school.  Only about 2-3 weeks have elapsed (not months!) and Molly has started the legal process to have Em remain with her. She has arranged for a tutor, but for Molly to enroll Em in school, only days after being abandoned by her mother and before any decisions were made by the State, WOULD have been unrealistic.<br /><br />Likewise, Molly's relationship with Chief Randall is currently being defined.  Randall cares greatly for Molly, but sternly masks his fear as he is trying to rein Molly in when she insists on putting her life in jeopardy.  From the first book, \\"Dealing With Murder,\\" we have learned that Randall is often jaded and rather acerbic in nature- as is Molly at times.  Randall gives Molly a difficult time as she KNOWINGLY hides evidence that she wants to look over.  Good grief - the argument that she gives Randall about \\"forgetting about certain evidence\\" is an excuse that they both realize is fabricated.  However, she can't very well say, \\"Randall, here is the evidence that I deliberately withheld from you while I attempted to discern how involved my sister is in this matter!\\"<br /><br />And finally, Molly's sister has not been arrested because she is out of the country. They have just that night discovered the extent of her involvement.  Although the next book may indicate that she may be extradited back to the States for trial, law and customs officials may \\"have bigger fish to fry\\" and not pursue it.<br /><br />\\"Tagged for Murder\\" is a wonderful new series and I greatly anticipate the next book by Elaine Flinn!ned.

The constant theme in the favorable reviews of \\"Arson and Old Lace\\" is that readers can't wait for the next book, \\"Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow\\" in this brand new series by Patricia Harwin.<br /><br />The writing is superb and the plot and outcome take some unexpected twists.  Moreover, I found the main character, Catherine Penny, to be so realistic and indicative of older women in our society today.  After a long, successful marriage, she has abruptly been left by her attorney husband for a younger woman.  She is angry and bitter, but is also determined to get on with her life and start anew.  Moving to England to live in a small English village that she fell in love with when they visited their daughter, Catherine has wiped the slate clean.  She looks forward to being near her daughter and grandson and is charmed by her new village cottage.  What she isn't prepared for are the memories that sometimes overwhelm her of the times that she spent with her husband there.  She isn't expecting the murder and mayhem that the sleepy, tranquil village awakens either!<br /><br />I personally loved how her daughter Emily was portrayed. Her daughter has always kept her emotions in check and cannot fathom why her mother cannot do the same.  Emily is a new mother and a take-charge psychotherapist who has very definite ideas on child rearing.  Many of these ideas are \\"unrealistic,\\" but so true of some new mothers!  Especially since Emily is assertive and maybe a little bit of a control freak.  She is totally consumed with her new son and is pretty uptight about how he should be raised.  The one area that made me dislike Emily, somewhat though, was her totally disregard when her mother was almost killed.  However, I can also understand that many people mask their fear with anger instead.  So even though it didn't make me fond of her, I found it to be very realistic.<br /><br />I think that Catherine Penny is in a niche that would appeal to all readers, but especially readers in their 20's and up.

I was not familiar with his work, but thought that I might learn a little about candles and enjoy a pleasant mystery as well.<br /><br />I thoroughly and completely enjoyed this book!  And while, yes, I did learn a lot about candlemaking (at least enough to want to make me want to try the craft), I was absolutely enchanted with the characters that Tim Myers has brought to life!<br /><br />This introductory mystery details the life of Harrison Black who has unexpectedly inherited his Great Aunt's estate. Although the bank owns most of it, this estate includes River's Edge - a shopping mall of sorts, that houses eccentric tenants as well as his Great Aunt's candle shop, \\"At Wick's End\\" and an apartment to boot.<br /><br />Retiring quickly from his less than thriving job of selling junk computers, Harrison moves into the apartment. He soon comes to believe that his aunt's death was not an accident. Simultaneously, while immersing himself in learning how to run a candle shop, Harrison attempts to solve his Great Aunt's murder.<br /><br />What captured me so thoroughly was not only the great plot and the long list of \\"suspects,\\" but Tim Myers' accurate and very realistic portrayal of the problems that confront someone who has suddenly become the owner of a store.<br /><br />\\"At Wick's End\\" is such a terrific book that I can't wait to read the sequel, \\"Burning at Both Ends.\\"  Great job by a fine writer!	2005-01-30

I have to confess that I rarely EVER read Stephen King novels or watch his movies.  I am a big fan and think he is one of the most (disturbingly) creative authors out there.  But frankly, his movies and books scare the bejesus out of me!  I NEVER forget his terrifying plots!<br /><br />When he first started with movies like Christine and the book \\"Thinner\\" - he was a little tamer,I believe.  I couldn't pass up the premise of this book and its title, so steeled myself for the nightmares.<br /><br />I found \\"Thinner\\" to be thoroughly captivating!  The ironic ending reminded me of O'Henry's short stories and I believe that most readers (even those who don't typically read King) will totally be immersed in this great tale.	2005-01-28

It really was a fluke ordering \\"Blue Moon\\" by Lori Handeland.  I don't usually read \\"paranormal suspense/romances;\\" don't read \\"horror\\" stories or books; Stephen King movies (on the rare occasions that I have watched one) scare me to death and generally I have found the realism sorely wanting in these subjects.<br /><br />That said, I absolutely loved this book. I urge readers who don't normally read this type of book to give this one a try.<br /><br />\\"Blue Moon\\" introduces Miniwa, Wisconsin cop, Jessie McQuade, who thrives at her job in this small town that is overrun with tourists each summer.  A rather plain loner, Jessie is smart, witty, and great at her job, and...lonely.  Life is going along at its same somewhat boring pace when a teacher hits a wolf and is attacked. Suddenly the town seems to have a vicious pack of wolves within their midst.<br /><br />Jessie discovers a wolf totem at the scene of the accident and wears it for safekeeping when she realizes that she can no longer trust those around her. Mandenauer,an old German Jager-Sucher is brought in to kill the wolves and a mutual respect develops between them. Accompanying him, Jessie becomes a hunter of these wolves as she tries to protect the town and prevent the impending ritual set to occur during the next blue moon.<br /><br />Jessie encounters Prof. Will Cadotte - a Native American activist while tracking the first wolf from the car accident and later discovers that he is an authority on the subject. Their romance not only brings passion, but lends itself to realism when the issues of prejudice from both of their ethnic groups are confronted.<br /><br />Credibility; realism - that is what worked for me with this book with both the supernatural and the romance.  Lori Handeland does not ask the reader to simply accept the rationale of werewolves.  Her storyline provides a completely plausible and believable scenario for the mutation of these wolves.<br /><br />\\"Blue Moon\\" is suspenseful, romantic, and BELIEVABLE.  I couldn't put it down. It was THAT good and I have just ordered Handeland's next novel, \\"Hunter's Moon.\\"  Great writer; great concept.  I have become a fan.s THAT good and I have just ordered Handeland's next novel, \\"Hunter's Moon.\\"  Great writer; great concept.  I have become a fan.	2005-01-18

I love his Oz book and Alice in Wonderland book and King Tut book and other books.  I have virtually all of them. I ordered this one expecting something wonderful.<br /><br />If it was not Robert Sabuda and I didn't know what he is capable of producing, I would not have been so disappointed. But I was shocked that Sabuda would choose to skimp in this manner.<br /><br />This could have been an absolutely BRILLIANT book.  The cover is really neat and has touches of gold. But ALL of the fold-out art is just stark WHITE.  There is NO color AT ALL except for the background. The result is FLAT and every page cries out for Sabuda's wonderful color schemes and production.<br /><br />I do not know if this was done to cut cost, but his publisher should rethink this.  I do not normally give bad reviews, and I am sorry but I will be returning this book - WHICH I NEVER DO!!  I cannot \\"BARE\\" (bear) to look at it knowing what Sabuda is capable of and compare this last effort that missed the mark SO much.<br /><br />I truly and sincerely hope that his publishers will redo this book in color even if it means jacking the price up.  I will be the FIRST in line for such a book because the pop-ups are as usual very unique and intricate.<br /><br />I know that I am not the only person by far who was HUGELY disappointed in this book.

Michael Pate has written such a motivational book with, \\"When Big Boys Tri.\\"  It is outstanding and a GREAT book for ALL triathletes - big boys, little boys, big girls...(well, you get the idea)<br /><br />The book is inspirational for anyone consumed with the desire to complete a triathlon or to go on to their next triathlon.  Throughout the book, Pate has interwoven truly unique and motivation sayings.  My favorite was a thought-provoking poem written by Arnold Palmer.<br /><br />\\"When Big Boys Tri\\" isn't really a book about reducing your time (although he has many great suggestions), and in some ways it is not so much a book about the races themselves.  As the title indicates, Michael Pate has written a special book about the journey itself - as you strive for the triathlon race and as you strive toward being the best that God has designed for you.	2004-09-01

Written by actress Harley Jane Kozak over the span of several years, it would be a great movie for her to appear in as the title character.<br /><br />The book works on many levels in originality and humor.  The touch of the ferret is priceless!  The characterizations of Woolie's friends and Ruby are really well-done.<br /><br />If the book is slightly less flowing in parts, I think that is the result of being written over the course of several years.  I think that the second book will come easier. All in all, a very charming first novel.	2004-08-28

When I stayed up reading this book, I thought it was a fluke - but I found that I couldn't put \\"Fair Play\\" down either!<br /><br />I thought that the characters were well-defined and quite realistic.  There is a lot of anomosity between Ty Gallagher, captain of the Blades, and Janna throughout much of the book and it would have been utterly unrealistic for it to be anything else.  Ty is a sports legend, who is handsome and charismatic. Beautiful women throw themselves at him at every opportunity. He doesn't want his life complicated by any serious involvement and that singleness of purpose has made him the great athlete he is.<br /><br />Likewise, Janna has just landed the PR dream job of the century where she is making more money than she ever thought possible. She has a job to do and that is to get the players involved in community events that bring good publicity to the team while effectively handling \\"damage control\\" for their frequent lapses in judgment while off the rink.  Ty does not like to play the \\"PR Game\\" so there IS a lot of conflict initially.<br /><br />The language by today's standards was not inappropriate at all. In fact, if anything it was really toned down as, let's face it, hockey players are well-known for their \\"colorful\\" language!<br /><br />\\"Total Rush\\" is to be Deirdre Martin's next book and I will definitely be reading it!	2004-08-23

I was actually reading another novel when the second book in the \\"Paige Turner Mystery Series\\" arrived from Amazon.  I soon just gave up trying to get involved in the other book as \\"Murder Is a Girl's Best Friend\\" beckoned me.<br /><br />The saga continues when her late husband's army buddy appears and asks her to help him investigate his kid sister's murder. A lot of thoughts come to the surface for Paige as she was deeply in love with her husband when he was killed in the Korean War. Yes - they were only married for 3 months, but Paige was devastated. Amanda Matetsky very ACCURATELY depicts Paige as a woman of the 50's.  Paige doesn't NEED a man; rather she is portrayed as a loving, caring woman. Actually, Paige is quite a lot more independent than most women of the 1950's, most whose identities were very closely formed to the men in their lives.<br /><br />Matetsky also very accurately has researched the jargon and headlines of the detective magazines of that period, who were a little more \\"scandalous\\" in their use of words such as \\"rape\\" than most of the newspapers of that period.<br /><br />This series transports the reader back to New York in the 1950's in a charming manner, that is not ridiculous or silly in the least. Paige Turner is a character that you will LIKE. Abby is great as the uninhibited close friend and neighbor as well.<br /><br />I really look forward to the next Paige Turner mystery!	2004-08-22

Do not let this title fool you! This book is for ANYONE who has just discovered the thrill of wanting to compete in a triathlon. \\"Slow Fat Triathlete\\" will help ANYONE who has never experienced a triathlon - even if they are rail thin. Also, just calmly brush aside the word, \\"fat,\\"(which the author amusingly refers to as the \\"f -word\\" in her first sentence) - because if you get involved in THIS sport, you may soon be a LOT slimmer.<br /><br />What if, after a lifetime of HATING to exercise, you suddenly woke up WANTING to exercise? We ALL know the reasons to exercise as a means of achieving better bodies, better health, and increased longevity. Yet how many of us EVER find that \\"magic pill\\" that will suddenly make us ENJOY exercising?? Exercise for many of us has ALWAYS been B-O-R-I-N-G.<br /><br /> Well, for me that \\"magic pill\\" came in the form of wanting to start competing in triathlons.<br /><br /> As Jayne Williams reveals in her witty and utterly self-confident style, triathlons do NOT have to be of an \\"Ironman\\" caliber where you swim 2 miles, ride 120+ miles and run 25 miles. In EVERY state (including Alaska), you will find many \\"sprint\\" triathlons consisting of a 400-yd.swim, 12-mile bike, 2-3 mile run/walks. They also have \\"Olympic\\" triathlon events that increase the ante to a 1/2-1 mile swim, 25-mile bike, and 6- mile run/walks. Likewise, they have 1/2 Ironman triathlons as well.<br /><br /> How is this possible to suddenly ENJOY exercising? Well, for many of us, it is the lure of the fun and competition. Come Race Day and the pay-off arrives after all the hours of hard exercising. You race, talk and have fun with fellow competitors, get a \\"goody bag\\" with t-shirt and neat free items, often enjoy a dinner or gala event following the race, travel to different events, and most of the time you get a medal just for crossing the finish line! Likewise, if you are REALLY good (or it's a really small race!) you get a prize if you are one of the first three finishers in your age division.<br /><br /> Having expressed my enthusiasm for my newly found sport, let me say that Jayne Williams and \\"Slow Fat Triathlete\\" saved my passion and \\"career\\" as a triathlete! I am the type of person who when interested in a subject, promptly logs onto amazon.com. After perusing various books, I generally order a great deal as I seek to gain different information.<br /><br /> In this case, I promptly ordered the top 15 triathlon books and virtually ALL of them were written for the seasoned triathlete hoping to shave a few pts. off their time. With the exception of Dave Scott's book, they were written so far above my level of competing, that I was absolutely discouraged and ready to throw in the towel. Even the various websites online (even for beginners) did not offer the kind of information that I was seeking.<br /><br /> And then I finally got to \\"Slow Fat Triathlete,\\" which answered all my questions (and then some!) in a captivating, somewhat quirky style. It was the \\"Siren of the Triathlon\\" and it called to me with every page...<br /><br /> After I read the book, I actually sat down and read it again, with notebook in hand, to jot down the various advice that it contained. Now remember, I had already read about 10 other books on triathlons that contained none of this information! To be fair, although these top books were written by GREAT triathletes, I often think that the authors are so far removed from their first triathlon experience, that they cannot comprehend the vast amounts of knowledge that those training for and entering their first triathlon need.<br /><br /> I didn't even know what T1 and T2 were and suddenly I was confronted with various charts full of abbreviations in other books! I even signed up with the most elite and widely recommended online coaching forum (and certainly not cheap) - and they didn't have a clue as to the level that a real beginner needed.<br /><br /> Jayne Williams' book is smart, funny, and somewhat \\"indelicate\\" in spots. (After a look at her website, I have to side with her mother...) But it is the most inspiring, knowledgeable book on triathlons that I have ever read. The author hails from Harvard and Berkeley and yet her writing is so hilarious at times that you will swear that she writes for SNL! She covers everything from what equipment is a must, to which flavors of energy gel taste great, to pre-race instructions, to how to get out of your wetsuit, to what brand of sports bra can enable even the most \\"abundantly endowed\\" woman to compete!<br /><br /> For the first time ever, I actually wrote Oprah's staff, BEGGING for this author to be on the show. (I hope that Williams' editor and/or agent follow through!) This book DESERVES to become a best-seller!<br /><br /> If you are thinking of entering a triathlon or simply want that \\"magic pill\\" that will lure you to WANT to exercise, BUY THIS BOOK. It has my HIGHEST recommendation. The resources and websites in the back (and her husband's terrific artwork sprinkled throughout) just contribute to help make this the BEST TRIATHLON BOOK OUT THERE!mother...)

Yet surprisingly, he is quite gracious about his wins.<br />&quot;Triathlon Training&quot; has individual chapters on swimming, cycling, and running techniques uniquely suited for the triathlete.  It offers a year-round training program and workout schedules for 3, 4, 5, and 6-day training weeks with the most effective intensity, speed, and duration for each workout.<br />It covers nutrition and specific tips to get ready mentally for the race, preparing for transitions, and pacing yourself throughout the race.<br />Frankly, my goal is simply to finish the race.  Regardless of my time, Dave Scott's techniques have already helped to prepare me for Hawaii.  His attitude and motivation helps prepare you for Life 101 as well.	2004-07-15

Lisa Scottoline's &quot;Killer Smile&quot; is more than just a suspenseful and engaging mystery with great characterization and plot.

But first and foremost- &quot;Killer Smile&quot; is a fantastic mystery.<br />Scottoline's story is compelling and sincere.  What is even more touching is that Lisa draws from her own paternal grandparent's experiences for this novel.  Her father would have been so proud of this book by his daughter.<br />&quot;Killer Smile&quot; is more than historically engaging, however. It is a mystery that has you turning pages quickly because it is so gripping and suspenseful.<br />I especially loved the thoughts of Mary throughout the book in regard to her feelings toward her family and friends.

It is not a superficially light book and there are parts that will make you laugh and parts that are very somber.<br />Jo Beth Sidden raises and trains bloodhounds and utilizes them for tracking in a small county in Georgia.  Her life is rather interesting. Her deceased father became a famous artist when she was a teenager, while most of her childhood was spent in dire poverty.  Her childhood though, is in many ways very mysterious.<br />Yet by working continually, Jo Beth has built a kennel and bloodhoumd business.  Businesses and law enforcement agencies hire her and her dogs to seek out drugs and criminals.<br />Jo Beth is rather a tough woman because she has had to be. But she is working at addressing the vulnerabilities in her life and this dialogue is reflected as well.  She is a very ardent feminist because she has had to confront countless prejuidices in her life of work.<br />Virginia Lanier has topped my list for new authors.	2004-06-14

I found &quot;Ready to Serve, Ready to Save!&quot; to be an invaluable book.  Although I have experience in obedience work, I have seriously been considering joining a search and rescue group in the near future.<br />There are so many tangents to examine before purchasing a dog and training him as a puppy for SAR that I wanted to read about search and rescue missions, without any exaggerations or any glorified accounts, to determine if I had what it takes to get involved in such an undertaking.<br />I was concerned about some of the reviews, which stated that the book was basically reports of specific missions, because I felt that it would be very boring.<br />I am so pleased that I ordered this book because I have found the reports to be so honest and interesting.  They are anything but dull!<br />This book takes such a realistic approach to entering search and rescue work. It is such a commitment and you have to often drop everything (even if you have theatre tickets or it is your child's birthday party, etc.) if you are called out with your dog.  Many times the searches do not result in finding ANYTHING and much of your time is spent simply training and practicing with your dog.<br />&quot;Ready to Serve, Ready to Save!&quot; has provided an honest, factual look into search and rescue work.

While not everyone holds this novel with the same high esteem that I do, I urge those who have NOT read &quot;Persuasion&quot; to buy it.<br />This book has meant different things to me at different times in my life.  I have often reflected why I find the story so fascinating and believe it is because it so accurately portrays the human spirit and exposes our flaws and strengths with such transparency.<br />Jane Austen reveals those who are so superficial that they see no goodness or worth other than beauty and wealth (Anne's father and sister); those who are so dependent that they do not listen to their own heart - but instead leave their most important decisions for others to make (Anne herself); and those whose pride has been wounded.<br />And perhaps what is so captivating, Austen lets the reader vicariously &quot;undo&quot; an error in judgment.

It primarily features Emma Jenkins - an animal behavorist, and Thomas Tobin - (a.k.a. &quot;RobotBoy&quot;)an attorney with the Baltimore County task force.  Emma has divorced her husband, who is also an animal behaviorist - after his grambling and womanizing have gone on too long.  Thomas has been in an emotional vacuum since finding out that he is sterile and getting dumped.<br />When a bookie, who is one of Thomas's main informants, is bashed in with a blender, Thomas adopts his murdered snitch's dog &quot;Hairy.&quot;  He is a Chinese Crested (thank goodness they show his picture on the back cover!) and he is terrified.  And yes, Hairy DOES steal the show in this book!<br />Likewise, Emma has adopted her best friend's daughter - LeeLee since her mother died in a car accident the previous year.  LeeLee and Hairy are brilliant and in many ways - this is their story as well.  For LeeLee and Hairy must learn to let go of their past lives and trust others enough to love them too.<br />Although I agree that it would have been wiser to not reveal the murderer so soon; this was still a very good book. There were perhaps a few too many steamy scenes and &quot;RobotBoy&quot; started to get on my nerves toward the end - but the ending really was pretty neat...especially the last sentence.<br />I truly believe that Susan Donovan will only get better....	2004-05-15

I did not expect to enjoy Jennifer Crusie's &quot;Strange Bedpersons&quot; as much as I did.  But I truly liked it.  Several reviewers mentioned that it was a little dated as it was written in 1994.  I didn't find that it was, as heck - I know women (and men) who are still living their lives as though it were the 60's (and 70's).<br />I read this in an afternoon and the novel totally held my attention. The writing by Cruisie was great as usual. The hardest part in reading  &quot;Strange Bedpersons&quot; was that maybe I am too much of a realist (not enough of a &quot;romantic&quot;)and kept thinking how these couples were going to stay married after a few years?  (But I guess that's another story!)<br />I LOVED the character of Lenny. I thought the entire situation involving him was just so superb. I loved how Tess had played such an important role in his life.<br />Although &quot;Bet Me&quot; is (thus far) my favorite of Crusie's books - I certainly would recommend this book as well.	2004-05-14

Although I have long known that she produces some of the greatest dialogue around - such as in \\"Bet Me,\\" I wasn't yet aware of her range in characterization and plots. \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" reveals this talent thoroughly.<br />Sophie Dempsey is the eldest daughter in a family of \\"gypsies.\\" As a child, her family made frequent moves and engaged in constant con jobs. Sophie is the one member of the Dempsey family that does not have a police record.  As the eldest, she has spent a lifetime of sacrificing her needs to look after her siblings - Amy and Dave.  They are a close family who believe that \\"family comes first.\\"<br />When Amy gets her involved in filming a porn movie in Temptation, Sophie is divided. She has met the sexy new mayor, Phineas Tucker, but for the first time is torn between loyalties. When she meets his beguiling daughter, Dillie, Sophie doesn't stand a chance.<br />Like all small towns, Temptation is not one to easily embrace new comers. It is a town where gossip travels like the wind and tradition is to be carried on at all costs.  However, Temptation has never met a woman like Sophie, a dichotomy of innocence and predator.<br />I loved Sophie's \\"Five-Step Program:\\"<br />1.  Make the Mark smile.<br />2. Get the Mark to agree with you.<br />3. Make the Mark feel superior.<br />4. Give the Mark something.<br />5. Get what you want and get out.<br />The characterizations in this book were magnificent. Rachel, Rob, Frank, Virginia, Liz, Leo, Wes, Amy, and Davy - they were just so well defined.<br />I loved the ending to this book with Sophie's thoughts on the political posters. It was just hilarious and hopeful and you truly got the sense that this could work....	2004-05-12

I have already pre-ordered the second book in this series, &quot;Murder is a Girl's Best Friend,&quot; which is coming out in July 2004!  Amanda Matetsky's new series, starring &quot;Paige Turner&quot; (groan...), set in New York 1954, is THAT good!<br />Amanda Matetsky does a wonderfully job of turning back the hands of time and taking us back to an era where women were just on the brink of being independent. This story is filled with &quot;little white gloves, Hopalong Cassidy, lunch counters at Woolworth's, the automat, and the BMT.&quot; All the references of the mid-1950's... A time when Paige is expected to make coffee for her male co-workers at &quot;Daring Detective&quot; magazine as she fends off their passes. A time when she must secretly plot to get published because she is a woman. (It always amazes me how far women have come in such a short time!)<br />When a beautiful blonde model is murdered, Paige almost feels as though the victim is telling her to solve her murder - so that she can bring justice to Babs Comstock and get published as well.<br />I LOVED this book. The concept was so original and the plot was refreshingly creative. The characters of Paige Turner, Dan Street and best friend, Abby are just terrific! I felt as though the author kept Paige totally in character with the times of the 1950's as ALL women were pretty much &quot;the little woman&quot; in those days. I love how Paige earns the respect of Dect. Dan Street for her intellectual and deductive aptitude in this mystery.<br />I can't wait to see how these characters evolve. I hope that we hear something of little Ricky in the books to come as well. Amanda Matetsky has a great new nostalgic series with Paige Turner, which will leave you turning the pages quickly as well!	2004-05-11

Well, not JUST a computer, but an AIP (Artificial Intelligence Personality), who solves crimes.<br />When Ray Santiago is murdered and his laptop disappears, Maude, Tim, and Turing are frantic. Not only are they grieving over the death of their newest member, but apprehensively they must discover how much information has been revealed. As they delve deeper into the mystery, they begin to discover that their co-worker had a few mysteries of his own.<br />Although I enjoyed the first book, &quot;You've Got Murder,&quot; a little more - I really thought that Claudia was a great addition.  However, the dual personality with Turing was a little creepy.  Overall, I think that most readers would like this series, however.	2004-05-07

I have a LOT of work to do at our business today, which will be rather difficult as I HAVEN'T BEEN TO BED BECAUSE I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT reading, &quot;Bet Me&quot; by Jennifer Crusie.  For the first time in a LONG time, I could not put the book down!<br />I think that it is a crime to have the Spotlight Review rating this only 2 stars!!  It is one of the BEST books that I have read all year.  I guess that everyone is different, but I can't believe that we were reading the same book.<br />Jennifer Crusie's books ALL have great dialogue, but sometimes her previous books seemed just a little too &quot;dysfunctional&quot; in a witty kind of way.  Even though &quot;Bet Me&quot; has its strange moments, it is a captivating book.<br />The dialogue completely submerged me into the characters. The entire time I was reading it, I thought, &quot;My God - that is exactly what people would say.&quot;  It wasn't canned or stilted- it was funny, but more believable than any dialogue I think that I have ever read.<br />I hope that Jennifer Crusie will write more books like this. What is truly a shame though is that the first reviewer's views are far from the majority opinion of this book. Sadly, that is what too many people will look at.  This really is a book worth buying.  I loved the characters and especially liked the addition of the last chapter.<br />Excellent, excellent book.	2004-05-07

Martin continues her hilarious journey of the siblings, and the mysterious adventures they encounter.  The plots just keep getting fresher and more innovative and the dialogue keeps getting wittier. (If that is possible!)<br />In this novel, Nora Blackbird continues her first real job as assistant to the Society Editor of the local newspaper.  She attends various society functions, many of which she was routinely invited to previously in her &quot;former life&quot; - before she had to go to work. The only difference now is that she has to write a review and email it to the editor.<br />When she is not working, Nora is usually either saving the world from &quot;killer dog&quot; Spike (love him!) or taking care of her sister's family. Libby is recovering from recent childbirth and is busy embracing the goddess within. (The goddess, by the way, is Placida - deity of tranquility, adventure, and weight loss!)<br />While Nora is covering the annual &quot;fox hunt&quot; breakfast event for the newspaper, Rush Strawcutter, the husband of a dog food heiress, is found murdered in a horse stall.  Nora's job of rescuing her siblings only escalates when she discovers that her sister, Emma, is drunk and unconscious in the stall as well.<br />Fortunately for Nora and her siblings, Michael is nearby to help lend a &quot;streets smart&quot; hand as Nora deals with blackmail, mystery, and romance.<br />An excellent and fun novel! Nancy Martin is quickly turning into one of my favorite writers.	2004-05-05

Her creator, Zack, has programmed not only a &quot;personality&quot; for Turing - but has also downloaded thousands of mystery novels into her data base. There is a self-improvement feature built into the standard AIP programming and Turing becomes &quot;all that she can be.&quot;<br />When Zack's friend, David, is killed in an automobile accident, Turing starts to notice that Zack begins to change the way he does routine tasks on the computer. When Zack doesn't report to work for several days, Turing becomes concerned and enlists the aid of his co-workers, Maude and Tim, to help discover if he is in any danger.<br />Although this could have been marketed under &quot;science fiction,&quot; this novel fits perfectly under &quot;mysteries.&quot;  Donna Andrews does an excellent job in her characterization of Turing. By the end of the book, I longed to have a computer with some &quot;personality.&quot;  I definitely feel that within the next 20 years, computers with this feature will be available for the general public.  Until then, I'll keep reading all the great sleuthing works starring, Turing: Computer Dectective Extraordinaire.	2004-05-04

First, I have to say that I have NEVER bought a &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; book on ANY movie.  I stumbled across &quot;The Making of Pride and Prejudice&quot; on Amazon. Sue Birtwistle's adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; IS probably my favorite movie of all time, but the previous reviews on Amazon convinced me that I would like the book as well.<br />If you truly enjoyed the movie, I hope that you will take a chance and read, &quot;The Making of Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Sue Birtwistle and Susie Conklin - even if you don't normally read this type of book.  It is FASCINATING.  It isn't just all the wonderful pictures (and how DIFFERENT the actors looked!); it is that this book methodically explains the concept behind the movie, the writing, the casting, the houses (&quot;Pemberley&quot; is actually at Lyme Park), the costumes, the wigs (Jennifer Ehle is a BLONDE!) and so many more interesting facts.<br />I was particularly amazed that Colin Firth originally TURNED DOWN the role of Darcy - because he didn't feel that he could do justice to the part. (Most of us can't imagine ANYONE except Firth playing the role!) Sue Birtwistle had to convince him to do the part. (And he was so nervous that he was physically ill initially.)<br />This is a terrific book, which chronicles the process of making a truly magnificent movie.	2004-05-04

Killian develops her characters beautifully.<br />Scholastic - looking, \\"serious-minded\\" Grace Hollister, who is in her early 30's,is an American teacher at St. Anne's Academy for Girls. While on vacation in England's Lake District, to study and explore the historical sites of her favorite poets, she rescues the submerged form of Peter Fox, lying face down in a stream.<br />Grace soon discovers that she, herself, is unwittingly submersed in a mystery, as she seeks to recover a relic of Lord Byron's, which will shed profound literary light on his life.<br />Although, many parts of this novel read a little too much like a \\"Gothic Romance,\\" Diana Killian's magnificent command of prose and dialogue carry it to the next level.  I was so impressed with her choice of words. \\"The stream chattered merrily over the rocks, undeterred by the motionless form of the man lying facedown in the shallow water,\\" and thus begins Chapter 1.  One reviewer, discussing a different mystery writer, was perturbed over the constant use of the words, \\"muttered,\\" etc.= and started to underline them and counted over a 100. Killian could tutor that author because I was amazed at the different words of action as she variously indicated dialogue.<br /> Truly brilliant writing, which I believe is only going to get better with intricate, fresh plots.  I will definitely await her next \\"Grace and Peter\\" book!	2004-04-30

I believe that &quot;Star Struck Dead&quot; is Sheila York's first novel. It is a terrific one!  Think of a mystery that takes you back in time to Hollywood's golden era of the 1940's...<br />The year is 1946, the place is &quot;TinselTown,&quot; and Lauren Atwill has had enough.  Separated from gorgeous matinee idol, Franklin Atwill, Lauren knows that she is no longer willing to endure his countless infidelities. Waking up, bruised and scraped from the ill-effects of the night before, Lauren discovers herself in a hospital room. She is baffled as to why anyone would have abducted her on her way home.  Her jewelry and money have been taken, but she has not been harmed physically - only drugged.  When she receives compromising photos of herself, she learns that she is just one of the many victims of a blackmailing gang.<br />In a town where careers are broken like hearts, Lauren hooks up with streets smart, private eye - Peter Winslow to discover who is behind these incriminating setups.<br />The plot is complex, but so refreshingly solid that few readers will see this ending coming!<br />Now, imagine a writer that can style her writing to that sort of &quot;Raymond Chandlerish&quot; use of deadpan humor. [&quot;A few women in very short skirts and very high heels were walking in pairs up and down the pavement...They were probably just waiting for their husbands.&quot;]Wow!  Sheila York is great at this.<br />Her descriptive use of truly unique metaphors(?) only adds to her brand of writing. Some phrases were so good that they just amazed me. &quot;Except for the soft brushing of the wind in the eucalyptus, it was quiet.&quot;<br />I have a feeling that Laura Atwill is going to be one of my favorite characters.  I hope that York is hard at work!	2004-04-27

It is NOT for the \\"faint of heart\\" or most senior citizens (although it depends on the seniors).<br />100 Things provides information on such festivals and events as: Academy Awards Ceremony (which is REALLY difficult to get into); World Campionship Punkin' Chunkin' , North American Rainbow Gathering, Mardi Gras, Custer's Last Stand Reenactment, Testicle Festival, Roswell UFO Encounter, etc.  As you can tell these events CAN be pretty bizarre (but never dull).<br />The book's events are divided by both country and, in the back, by month, which is helpful.<br />Unfortunately, the book only lists their own \\"whatsgoingon.com\\" website as internet info on the events. This would have been great, but it hasn't been in service lately. This glitch may be temporary, or the website may no longer cease to exist - but I would make sure that the website was up and running before I purchased the book.	2004-04-27

The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's &quot;Flight: 100 Years of Aviation,&quot; by R.G. Grant and John R. Dailey LOOKS like a &quot;coffee table book.&quot;  It is SO much more than that - although at over 400 pages and approximately 1000 magnificent photographs, it certainly would fit the bill. It is worth every penny of it's cost.<br />As the female Vice-President of two small aviation restoration companies, I collect a lot of aviation books. This is absolutely the BEST historical view on aviation. The information and photographs that it provides on early aviation are the best that I have seen. It features memorabilla as well as photos of aviation's many pilots/inventors.  Almost all of the photographs were new to me and not simply the same photos shown in all the other books.<br />Later models are glossed over a little more, but I imagine that the book would have been over 1000 pages if they had gone into much more detail.  This book is meant to serve as an overview of aviation's history.  Most aviation history books simply feature the planes. This book details so MUCH more. It discusses black boxes, ejection seats, posters, newspaper clippings and much more; truly giving a well-rounded view of aviation.<br />If you are a pilot or simply interested in aviation - or if you know a young person who is interested in aviation....THIS is the book to buy them.  The photographs ALONE are worth purchasing this book!	2004-04-25

His style is bold, campy, and original.<br />Today, I received the books and I was AMAZED.<br />The book, \\"America the Beautiful\\" is BEAUTIFUL. What is even more beautiful is that Chris Gall shares in the preface how a framed copy of Katharine Lee Bates' verse, written in her own hand, inspired him so much as an artist as he was growing up.<br /><br />Gall bestows a MAGNIFICENT tribute to his great-aunt's stirring song. Each line of Bates' meaningful verse is paired with a beautiful illustration by Gall. These works of art depict a nation blessed with God-given gifts; a nation built on justice, optimism, hope, and a shared love of America's land.<br />After viewing this book, which is pristinely made with thick paper and rich colors, I intend to buy several more as gifts. There are wonderful images of the Statue of Liberty, Pike's Peak, immigrants, the Apollo II, and my very favorites - the firemen of Sept. 11th, and the WWII Tuskegee Airmen.<br />Because \\"America the Beautiful\\" is not just a book which is great for artists or children or to grace the coffee table (although that is where MINE is going!), it is a work of art - which magnificently stirs the patriot within us all...	2004-04-22

Elaine Flinn has a wonderful career ahead of her with this series!<br /><br />\\"Dealing in Murder\\" features Molly Doyle (a.k.a. Elizabeth Porter), a Manhattan antique dealer specializing in art, who moves to Carmel, CA, to start over after her husband leaves her for another woman.  Unfortunately, he has taken her reputation with him, as he has been forging art with his new woman and Molly is implicated as well.  The art world is very exclusive and elite so Molly devises a 5-year plan where she will be able to make enough money in Carmel to ultimately start a new business in New Orleans.<br /><br />Almost immediately, Molly inadvertantly visits a woman who has just been fatally stabbed.  In the exclusive, posh community of Carmel, murder is rare and Molly immediately becomes a suspect in the eyes of Chief Randall.  Coming from a long life of cops, herself - Molly becomes involved in the case.<br /><br />Flinn has given us AMAZING characters.  Molly is bruised, ashamed, and DETERMINED to get back on top in the antique world. She is bitter and has isolated herself from other men. She has something to prove.  Chief Randall is a hardened cop who has no illusions about any \\"goodness\\" in mankind.  For the most part, he just wants to do a good job until retirement.<br /><br />The array of minor characters is SUPERB as well. Flinn has provided a firm foundation on which to build.  I especially was intrigued with Molly and Bitsy's relationship.  Most authors would have devised having these women become fast friends and solving the case together.  Instead, Flinn has opened the door for a realistic and evolving friendship with Bitsy - that I look forward to reading about in future sequels.	2004-04-21

Dibbs.<br />The book is written by Tony Holmes, who does a wonderful job - but the real focus is almost 250 pages of WWII aircraft that have been BRILLIANTLY photographed. It has more photographs than most books, for which I have paid TWICE this price.<br />As vice president of an aviation company that restores military aircraft, I tend to collect a lot of aviation books, which feature restored aircraft.  This is one of the best.  It is unfortunate that a photo of the book is not featured at Amazon because this book is worth the money and worth the wait.<br />The book is divided into 20 chapters. Some of which include: P-40, Spitfire, F4F Wildcat; P-51 Mustang; B-17, F4U Corsair, F6F Hellcat; Mitsubishi A6M Zero; P-47 Thunderbolt and P-38 Lightning.  Each chapter is remarkable.<br />The P-40/ Kittyhawk Mk I are my favorite planes and these are some of the BEST photographs that I have seen of these planes. (And I've seen a lot.)<br />This book is worthy of being, &quot;coffee table&quot; material because there are so many pictures, but it is also a book that will delight the most obsessed aviation fan as well.

Literally, I read over 500 pages in less than one day.<br /><br />Additionally, the cover design was SUPERB.  I cannot imagine a book jacket, which would better display this novel.<br /><br />The ONE aspect that SOME readers may find disquieting is that Niffenegger uses the typical 4 letter sexual words of slang.  I was not bothered by this, because it fit with the age/time of the characters - but I know that many conservatives will find this offensive.  I am going to urge my mother to read this wonderful novel...but I will also tell her to \\"prepare herself\\" for some of the dialogue.<br /><br />This is Audrey Niffenegger's first book and if she writes nothing more than this novel - it will still be enough to have truly left her mark on the literary world. (Although, I truly look forward to future books.)<br /><br />What is especially poignant is that while the concept of time travel is nothing new - Niffenegger delves into the pain, suffering, inconvenience and fear of time travel. She doesn't simply gloss over the realism with adventures - but intricately examines the human element for those who are left behind as well as for the time traveler himself.<br /><br />\\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" will appeal to both men and women.  It is a story of adventure, it is a story of the human spirit, it is a story of family and friends, and it is a story of love.<br /><br />If you buy ONE book this year...make it \\"The Time Traveler's Wife.\\"	2004-04-19
US	36424541	RYDSHWUTL8FTD	1575665409	759818149	Murder Among Strangers	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	The Best Kate Austen Mystery to Date...	&quot;Murder Among Strangers&quot; is the 4th book in the Kate Austen Mystery Series by Jonnie Jacobs.  The interweaving plots/subplots in this latest book are just great. I, and apparently other reviewers, feel that it is the best Kate Austen book thus far.  Jonnie Jacobs seems to get better with each novel...<br />&quot;Murder Among Strangers&quot; focuses on the series of neverending events that take place when Kate stops to help a woman who has been stranded in the rain when her car fails.  Kate is kidnapped by the woman and her boyfriend and in many ways a friendship of sorts develops between Kate and the woman.  It is a friendship born out of wanting to survive, fear, and gratitude.<br />Kate Austen is about as realistic as a character gets. In many ways, she is far too easy going and passive for my tastes, but that is what makes her so real.  At times, it seems as though everyone from her child to her friends to the dog are &quot;bossing&quot; her around - but that is more realistic than some &quot;super woman&quot; heroine who lives an idyllic life.<br />Kate's relationship with Detective Michael Stone is not always perfect as this book reveals.  He is slightly tempted when a young co-ed at the police department shows great interest in him.  The situation snowballs and he is faced with many uncomfortable decisions.<br />Jonnie Jacobs' portrayal of Anna &quot;It's in my room, Anna exclaims, as though she's just scored in Jeopardy&quot; and Libby are brilliant.  She truly has captured the dialogue and mannerisms so realistic of kids today.<br />This is a series that just keeps getting better. Let's hope that a new Kate Austen book will be coming out soon!	2004-04-18

We continue to view how they are coping with the terms of their Uncle's will, which stipulates that they must live and work in Voorburg for 10 years before they can inherit the wealthy estate.<br />To earn money, the siblings temporarily work at a private nursing home. When an overbearing old man is smothered, they work with Police Chief Howard to help solve the mystery.<br />I LOVE these characters and this book is no exception.  I was reading another book when this arrived from Amazon and I could hardly wait to start reading it.<br />\\"It Had to Be You\\" transports the reader back to the early 1930's and immerses one in the jargon, names, and historical data of the time period. I was AMAZED at how this book was so well researched and the attention to historic detail that it showed. We learn of Roosevelt's inauguration; of his imposed restrictions on the banking industry and his fireside radio chats.  We also meet traveling salesmen with the latest novelties: \\"samples\\" - small products of new items such as \\"Bisquick\\" that allow the consumer to try them before buying.<br />I especially enjoyed reading about Robert's suggestion of the dumb waiter. Churchill is an absolute MASTER at realism.<br />More than any other \\"Grace and Favor\\" book, \\"It Had to Be You\\" focuses more on the daily life of Lily and Robert Brewster rather than the mystery itself per se. If you seek a mystery that leaves your heart pounding and wondering who the culprit is, \\"It Had to Be You,\\" is probably not the best choice. And to be honest, if you are seeking a great romance - these two are as celibate in thought and deed as it gets....<br />But if you seek an historic delve into the lives of two great characters (even if they both need a little romance in their lives!) - you can't go wrong.  It is especially interesting how the Brewsters do a variety of odd jobs, and I look forward to the next book to learn what they will be involved in next!<br />Churchill is a wonderfully gifted writer and the series is great.ng how the Brewsters do a variety of odd jobs, and I look forward to the next book to learn what they will be involved in next!<br />Churchill is a wonderfully gifted writer and the series is great.	2004-04-16

This is the FUNNIEST and CUTEST book for ANYONE who likes animals.  Men will enjoy it as much, if not more, than women. It is NOT a &quot;religious&quot; book, but a hilarious &quot;translation&quot; by Mark Bricklin of the various &quot;messages&quot; that he is sure various pets are sending up to God.<br />I have 3 copies of this book at home now and have given at least 7 books to friends, vets, my hairdresser, and family. It is a DELIGHTFUL little addition in a gift basket for someone you know that has a dog, cat, bird, fish, hampster; (you get the idea...)<br />Examples of Bricklins' humor, which are included:<br />&quot; Dear God,<br />Is thunder absolutely necessary?&quot;<br />McGwire Dog<br />&quot;Dear God,<br />How do I get rid of dog breath?&quot;<br />Delilah Dog<br />&quot;Dear God,<br />Are humans on uppers or are we on tranquilers?&quot;<br />Buddy Box Turtle<br />&quot;Dear God,<br />Please Pass this message along to my so-called master:<br />Why are you trying to teach me to roll over and play dead? Do you find that funny?  Funny how?&quot;<br />Joe Dog<br />These are just a FEW of the terrific messages to God from a vast menagerie of pets.  Most are just really funny, but a few are rather touching.<br />You cannot go wrong with this book. It is great to bring cheer to anyone's day!	2004-04-14

In many ways, I found it to be &quot;darker&quot; than her previous two, but far more intriguing.  The plot is suspenseful and takes the reader down many roads as well as through a few blind alleys!<br />In this riveting mystery, Kate is coping with a visit from her soon to be &quot;ex-mother-in-law.&quot;  While Andy is no longer living in the same household, he and Kate are still on friendly terms, largely for the sake of their daughter, Anna. Kate has no desire to stay married to her charasmatic, but flighty husband. Her affections are still for the dependable Dectective Michael Stone,who has been living with her - at least prior to her mother-in-law's visit!<br />Libby continues to live with Kate and continues to be beligerent and sullen in typical fashion of her teenage status. Anna continues to be 5 going on 21.<br />In addition to Kate's consulting job, she is also teaching art at the local high school. Unfortunately, her work is less satisfying when a student becomes the latest victim of a serial killer.  Kate feels compelled to bring relevant information to the police - not only for justice of a dear student, but because she fears that Libby is also being targeted.<br />&quot;Murder Among Us&quot; shows the extent that Jacobs is excelling at her craft. I especially was appreciative that she more fully explained how Kate was making ends meet as well as her character's realism in dealing with her children. There were times that I found it really difficult to admire the &quot;parenting skills&quot; of the title character because I am more of a disciplinarian - but I have to say that Kate's character and laid-back attitude is FAR more realistic of our society!  In the real world, teenagers and children talk back to their parents!<br />This is a very good mystery series, which keeps improving. I look forward to reading the next sequel, &quot;Murder Among Strangers.&quot;t;	2004-04-14

NEEDS 2nd PRINTING!!	\\"Bedtime Stories for Dogs\\" is one of the funniest and most CREATIVE books that I have EVER read.  It is WONDERFUL for anyone who has a favorite dog and it makes a SUPERB gift.  I have several at my house on hand as gifts and have already given many copies to my family and friends.<br />Leigh Anne Jasheway is a creative GENIUS. I was amazed at her humor and talent as she adapted fairy tales and nursery rhymes to a more \\"canine perspective.\\"  These stories are not \\"fluff.\\" They show a creative talent that I sincerely hope Jasheway will pursue in additional works.  The book is approximately 100 pages and on quality paper.<br />I sent one copy to my sister who is an executive in Colorado (with two degrees and a Masters).  She was laughing so hard that she proceeded to call our mother long-distance and READ her one of the stories over the phone!<br />Some of the delightful stories include: \\"The Three Little Pugs,\\"  \\"Snow White and the Seven Chihuahuas,\\" \\"Goldilocks and the Three Cats,\\" and more.

It is no mere &quot;coffee table&quot; adornment; it is ART and REALISM fused into one magical book.  The brilliant photographs of Virgil Hancock chronicle &quot;Sin City&quot; in all its glitter and in all its waste. His artistic images range from the neon-studded hotels on the strip to wedding chapels to pawn shops to a group of ventriloquists attending a convention.<br />Gregory McNamee perceptively captures the mood of a city that defines 'extremism' with his superb narration.  His essays are insightful and frank without the flowery superlatives.  McNamee weaves the tale of a town that is a contrast in Life 101.<br />Las Vegas is one of my favorite cities. Every few months, we fly our plane to Vegas and less than 2 hrs. later, I am transported to another world: a kingdom of luxury, excitement, and fine dining. There are few sights that are more captivating than slowly circling over the vast menagerie of neon lights.<br />I'm a &quot;down to earth&quot; woman - I love hiking through forests and deserts, but there are times when I want nothing more in life than to be pampered at The Venetian and enjoy all my favorite gourmet restaurants in Vegas.  There are few places that I would rather visit.<br />&quot;American Byzantium&quot; is a must read for those who love Vegas as I do  - as well as for those who plan to visit Vegas for the first time.  This book captures Las Vegas in a way that not only focuses on the stardust of luxury, but brushes away that dust to reveal the stark realities as well.	2004-04-13

I have literally bought some of these books and eaten candy bars while reading them!  I am here to tell you that \\"Curves - Permanent Results Without Permanent Dieting\\" is different from all the rest.<br />This is a book that FINALLY makes sense.  It does not offer glib promises and it is EXCELLENT for both individuals who work out at Curves and those who don't as well as for individuals who have a lot of weight to lose and those of us who have 10-20 lbs. to lose.  It is geared for women (and men) who are both middle-aged as well as those who are younger.<br />It offers basically three nutrition plans: Calorie-Sensitive Individuals; Carbohydrate-Sensitive Individuals (so followers of Atkins will do well on this); and a combination Calorie-Carbo.<br />It truly will show you HOW to incorporate a combination of strength training and aerobics exercise into your life without overtaking your life.<br />The book is great in that it includes shopping lists, meal plans, food guides, and charts to track your progress.  There are also questionnaires to help you discover if you are calorie- or carbohydrate-sensitive (or a combination) so that you can choose the meal plan that is best for you.<br />It is well written and easy to follow and definitely worth buying!	2004-04-12

I was impressed with the first Kate Austen book, &quot;Murder Among Neighbors,&quot; but the plot of this second book is even BETTER.<br />The book opens with Kate Austen's pending divorce with &quot;finding himself&quot; husband, Andy.  Thankfully, the book doesn't dwell on the divorce, but centers on Kate getting on with her life.  She is now working as an art consultant and her relationship with Detective Michael Stone is heating up.<br />Kate arranges to meet business acquaintance/friend - Mona Sterling at Mona's home and finds that Mona has uncharacteristically decided to commit suicide.  Kate and friend Sharon begin to gather clues to convince the Walnut Hills Police Dept. that this has been, in fact, a murder.  In the meanwhile, she takes in Mona's beligerant teenage daughter, Libby, and must cope with the attitude and language of a young girl who is hurting.<br />One sidenote is that Jonnie Jacobs could have been describing my mother PERFECTLY, when she writes of the older woman, Mrs. Stevenson, who has been living in the neighborhood for years and still addresses the homes by their former owners.  My mother is constantly pruning her garden out front so it was bizarre to read about a character that fit her so well!  Talk about your realism!<br />The plot was great with this book and takes a very unexpected turn. The characterizations are excellent as well.  The personality of Kate Austen is VERY laid-back; very non-threatening, and somewhat a little TOO easy-going for my aggressive style of personality. Kate isn't really what you would call a &quot;leader&quot; or a &quot;mover and shaker.&quot;(And it really grates on my nerves that her daughter, Anna, seems to have more control in the household than she does - but this is VERY realistic.)  This is unusual because most amateur sleuths are these &quot;Type A&quot; leaders when in reality not everyone is like that. It is rather insightful to get a glimpse as to how individuals such as Kate react and how people respond better to her style of interacting with them.<br />This is a series that is really good and one that you are sure to enjoy.t is rather insightful to get a glimpse as to how individuals such as Kate react and how people respond better to her style of interacting with them.<br />This is a series that is really good and one that you are sure to enjoy.	2004-04-12

Flying is a PASSION and &quot;Slipping the Surly Bonds&quot; is a great book for anyone who shares that passion....<br />This is a must read for pilots or ANYONE interested in flying or connected with the aviation industry.  It is NOT a &quot; sparse, flowery book of aviation poetry,&quot; - it is a very thorough book of aviation history in the form of various quotes. I would estimate that there are approximately 1000 quotes contained in this easy to read format.<br />This book makes a WONDERFUL gift for pilots and those who have always been fascinated with flying. However, unlike most books that contain a few poetic lines on each page - this book centers more around historic and literary quotes.  Although it is more than a &quot;coffee table&quot; book, it is certainly a book that would easily interest most guests.<br />&quot;Slipping the Surly Bonds&quot; is divided into 14 areas and has an index for easy referencing. Areas of interests include:  First Flights, Magic and Wonder of Flight, Air Power, Combat, Predictions, Piloting, Safety, Space, and Women Fly and more.<br />As a female Vice President of two small Aviation Companies, I have often searched for gifts for pilots, etc. who have been difficult to buy for.

It is a book that captures a realistic look at life in the very comfortable Walnut Hills, CA area.<br />Kate Austen has an adorable 4-year old and is 2 months pregnant. She would be quite happy if it were not for the small fact that her handsome husband has gone off to the Swiss Alps to &quot;find himself&quot; in Europe.<br />Fortunately, Kate finds herself too busy coping with the daily demands of being a mother to fall apart.  Her beautiful next-door neighbors is brutally murdered and Kate haphazardly finds herself drawn into discovering clues as a result of her interactions with various neighbors in the community.  A nice looking detective starts questioning Kate and finds her answers quite interesting...<br />The characterizations of the community were very good and this book was quite interesting.  My only doubt was that it mentioned several times that there were many months when Kate and Andy found it difficult to pay the monthly mortgage. Yet, Kate has no job although her daughter attends a posh preschool, and a maid comes to the home once a week.  Although she does start ultimately working part-time, it would seem that money would have been a larger concern for her as her husband had been gone for almost 2 months by that time.<br />Nevertheless, the book is quite good and plan to read the next book in the series, &quot;Murder Among Friends&quot; tomorrow.	2004-04-11

Suffering from jet lag, they team up with their first cousin - \\"Pukey Luke\\" in this hilarious tale.<br />Luke, a successful businessman and father of U.S. Congressman, will never outlive his nickname, \\"Pukey Lukey,\\" which he earned due to his propensity as a child for motion sickness in cars.  The sisters have never forgiven him for ruining virtually every vacation while they were growing up and Mary Alice NEVER lets him ride in her Jag!<br />While Patricia Anne is out walking Woofer, a distraught Luke shows up at her home.

The series was recommended to me by my cousin who is in her 70's and I can see why it appeals especially to the older crowd.  However, I can attest to the fact that readers of all ages will enjoy it equally as much.  I mention that seniors will especially enjoy it as there seems to be only a handful of mystery series where the heroine is &quot;advanced in age.&quot;<br />The series features siblings - Patricia Anne (short, sensible, petite, demure, reserved, retired schoolteacher) and Mary Alice (250 lbs + , flamboyant, impulsive, and bold) and the hilarious interactions of dialogue that transpire between the two.  Anne George was an absolute MASTER at dialogue.<br />Mary Alice buys a Country Western bar and the following day, the prior owner dies of &quot;overkill&quot; - he's hanged, stabbed, and drown in the bar's wishing well.<br />Mary Alice and Patricia Anne are soon fearful that they may be next and work feverishly to discover why the previous owner was killed and more importantly .... by whom?<br />You will truly enjoy this light and funny series!	2004-03-30

Unfortunately, they have an online website!  LOL  Actually, it was kind of neat because you can actually see some of the various types of candies that the author describes in her series.<br />I thought that it was so neat that she also based this mystery in part on the antique chocolate molds.  Oh...went on eBay and they just got a shipment in from Belgium of antique molds. Actually, resisted them =but again, how neat to look at them.<br />This second book was even better than the first and was belivable in plot and dialogue.  Lee's tongue twisting impediment still gets on my nerves and it is just a little too cute in the words that DO come out  - but it was a little more &quot;bearable.&quot;  The one criticism is that I thought the Teddybear Event in Warner Pier could have been expounded upon at the end.  It was described in the beginning and we really don't hear too much more about it.<br />The mystery aspect was very good as I didn't realize until the end who was involved in the murders.  This is a light, but truly enjoyable series.	2004-03-29

But I had enjoyed the first three books of the series so much that I took a chance and I am very glad that I did.<br />I reread the first three books before continuing with this book and it didn't skip a beat.  I am amazed at Ms. Churchill's ability to portray her characters of Lily and her brother, Robert Brewster as they are evolving and maturing.  Robert is NOT as flighty as he was when younger.  They are in the midst of the Depression, poverty is rampant and Americans are worried about the fate of their Nation and he is gaining some maturity.<br />One of my favorite scenes is when Robert drives \\"Voters for Roosevelt\\" to the polls in his Duesie when he didn't even VOTE in the previous election!<br />There is plenty of excitement in the book as a group of mysterious guests arrive at the mansion for a few days.  A murder ensues and the plot thickens.  \\"Love for Sale\\" also brings a new boarder and a few more husbands die.<br />Readers MAY have been disappointed by the book because due to the title, they may have been expecting a big romance for Lily or Robert.  (Lily DOES need to have some romance soon and hopefully with a new man who is from a similar background.) The book does alternate between several characters, but to me it just makes them multi-faceted and doesn't focus on just one or two individuals.<br />I LOVE these characters and this town.  I enjoy how they are maturing and how Churchill so expertly weaves historical facts into the plot.  Her dialogue is amazing and so believable.<br />Don't expect a deep romance and I think that you will find that \\"Love for Sale\\" is Churchill at her finest.	2004-03-25

Blonde, gorgeous, tall and Texan Lee McKinney leaves her role as &quot;Texas Trophy Wife&quot; and comes to help manage her favorite aunt's chocolate business in a small resort town.<br />Trouble ensues when a much hated defense attorney dies after ingesting a cyanide-filled trouffle that Lee has delivered.  The mystery escalates from there and is very skillfully delivered.<br />Although &quot;The Chocolate Cat Caper&quot; is a light, cozy read - it isn't juvenile in the least.  The one area that is rather silly is that the author insists on giving Lee McKinney an impediment of a sort where she substitutes the wrong word in sentences at the most inopportune times.  The effect is suppose to be funny - but I just found it to be silly.<br />In spite of this, I thoroughly enjoyed the first of this series and am currently reading the second.<br />The cover art is GREAT and it was disappointing to note that the artist did not receive any mention in the book.  This is sad as the art helped me to decide to buy the series.<br />Also great were the neat chocolate facts, which were dispersed throughout the book.	2004-03-25

In Jill Churchill's third book in the &quot;Grace and Favor&quot; Mystery series, you get a glimpse into the lives of those living through the depression.  Yes, the series is meant to be a somewhat light mystery set during the depression-era, but it truly is so much more.  You start to see how the depression caused a very wide gap in the social mores of the day when there were very strict adherences to the class structure.  Approximately a third of the country was in dire poverty during the height of the depression. In &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me,&quot; you start to see how so many of these social snobberies start to be abandoned by Lily and her brother, Robert Brewster.  They let the town know that they are not rich, but have suffered complete financial ruin as most of the town has and that it has only been through the miraculous good fortune of being named in their Uncle's will that has enabled them to live in a mansion.  Luckily, after a period of 10 years - they will inherit the estate as long as they meet the provisions of the will and earn their living.<br />Readers are in the midst of the Bonus Army March as they camp out in Washington, D.C. in 1932.  Churchill recounts the historic adventure through the eyes of their newspaper editor, Jack Summer who travels to D.C. to get a first-hand glimpse of the protestors.<br />The papers proclaim that Henry Ford has cut wages and increased hours and hosed down disgruntled employees who are seeking better conditions. ( I was a little confused about this as I knew that in 1914, Ford was the first to establish a &quot;minimum wage&quot; law as he raised the pay from $2.50 to $5.00 - which was a fortune in those days for doing assembly work.  Naturally, it helped him retain employees - but I doubt that in 1932 many people were buying automobiles and Ford was trying to keep the company afloat.)  It would have been nice if this had been explained.<br />In between all the historical events, there are two murders and plenty of dialogue.  You grow to like these characters more and more with each new book. This Churchill series is as good as it gets!y of dialogue.  You grow to like these characters more and more with each new book. This Churchill series is as good as it gets!	2004-03-22

Their relative's will stipulates that they must earn their living expenses (minus the upkeep of the house, etc.) for 10 years - before inheriting the estate.<br />Hesitantly, they embark on the venture to invite a famous novelist for the weekend and invite various wealthy friends as paying guests. They know many who will pay for the priviledge of spending the weekend at the manor in his company.  A murder takes place and in order to earn any type of profit at all - they must solve the mystery.  (As well as knowing that one amongst them is a murderer.)<br />I especially enjoyed how the plot and characters were so believable.  Also, Churchill does a wonderful job of incorporating various historical facts of the time into the story.  It is interesting to read that Phoebe makes hats for Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt whose husband is the governor in a nearby city!  When Lily invites Phoebe as a boarder to their mansion, Churchill gives a very sound reasoning for Phoebe's decision. This type of detail makes the characters very multi-faceted with a great deal of depth.<br />Excellent book; wonderful series!	2004-03-21

It is light, but it is MAGNIFICENT. Charmingly, the books in the series are named after various hit songs from the period. The series chronicles the adventures of Lily Brewster and her brother Robert as they make the transition from high-living lifestyle of the idle rich to the depths of the stockmarket ruin and father's subsequent suicide to their miraculous inheritance of the Grace and Favor mansion from a distant relative.<br />&quot;Grace and Favor&quot; refers to the house that they have renamed. Although, rather than a true &quot;Grace and Favor Trust&quot; - which allows tenants the use of an estate during their lifetime only -Lily and Robert will inherit the mansion and the estate if they adhere to the stipulations in their Uncle Horatio's will and reside in the small town for 10 years.<br />Although, on the surface this may sound hokey - &quot;down and out kids inherit from long-lost relative&quot; - it truly works and is believable.<br />It opens with Lily Brewster, hot and miserable from her bank teller's job, looking back at the lifestyle that she used to live.  It is upbeat, but rather than glibbly glossing over their depression-era life, Churchill lets the reader know how Lily has nothing in common with the other tellers; how Robert's job is akin to socializing with the gang rather than confronting the reality that he now has to work as a waiter and escort to make a living; how the apartment is small with no bath tub and thin walls; and how all their family's possessions have been sold.<br />Churchill also doesn't tritely make life wonderful when the characters go to the Grace and Favor mansion.  She depicts the sacrifices for social butterfly Robert in leaving the excitement of New York behind. It also reveals his thrill in discovering the Dusenberg Model J car that with his attention will soon be in excellent condition.<br />Churchill not only makes this a spiffy little mystery - she makes her characters believable in the 1930's setting.es this a spiffy little mystery - she makes her characters believable in the 1930's setting.	2004-03-19

I have to confess that I do not usually read Nora Roberts, but this series is SO much more than what it looks like.  This series is one of the most compelling that I have read.  I couldn't WAIT to read each book.<br />I do not usually enjoy &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;family generational&quot; sagas. KEY OF LIGHT was nothing like the typical tale.  This is the story of Mallory, Dana and Zoe - three strangers who become eternal friends as they seek to help one another in their quest.<br />Nora Roberts takes Celtic Lore and blends it with modern day America and the results are believable.<br />What works more than even the plot, however, is Roberts' complex journey into each character as she shares with the reader the strengths that each of us have deep inside.  In the face of adversity, they find strength together and the results are magical.	2004-03-18

The characters are funny and somewhat dysfunctional.<br />My one criticism (and it's a big one) which only made me give it 4 stars was when Nora shouts out that one threatening word as she is fighting for her life.....&quot;polyester!&quot;  Pleaassse. There is a point where too much wit makes it absurd.  And Nancy Martin's editors should have stopped her with that one.<br />In spite of this absurdity, I will definitely read the next Blackbird Sisters book.<br />On a positive note, one area that Ms. Martin explains very well in this second book is why Nora has never learned to drive.	2004-03-18

Nancy Martin has a great new series with this first book centering around  Nora Blackbird and her sisters.  Many parts of it are flippant and just plain funny.  The characters are terrific!<br />I do have to say that this is one of the very few books that took me about two chapters to get into that I turned out to really like.  So, although it does have a somewhat slow start - it is really worth reading.<br />The romance that is heating up between Nora Blackbird and Michael as well as the \\"fate of the Blackbird Widows\\" is intriguing.<br />Nancy Martin's description of Nora's brother-in-law Ralph was just terrific especially in the finally pages.  The description of Nora's sister, \\"Not the sharpest knife in the drawer\\" was hilarious.<br />I have a feeling that Nancy Martin's Blackbird Sisters series is only going to get better.	2004-03-17

Suddenly, your comfortable world and everything that you hold dear are stripped away from you and you are brutally attacked. Through cosmetic surgery you are given an exquisite face and seek nothing but revenge.  This is the premise that Iris Johansen presents in THE UGLY DUCKLING.<br />This was really a good book. It was not quite as &quot;gruesome&quot; in terms of the specific details as some of her novels, which I appreciated.<br />I especially enjoyed that she referred to a scene (that reminded me of the movie as well) as remeniscent of the movie, TRUE LIES.<br />I also really enjoyed the singleness of purpose as Nell strives to make herself strong.<br />So many things work with this novel.  We are given an insight into Nell Calder's childhood as to why she is so submissive; we are given a glimpse into the dynamics of her marriage; we are even a party to the horrible dreams that she endures night after night.<br />The supporting characters are some of the best from Johansen.  Tania, a woman who truly understands what Nell has been through and Peter, the young man who stands by her through adversity were two of my favorites.<br />A great book from a great author.	2004-03-15

I hate to confess that I didn't even know that the Wright Brothers had written anything later in life.  This was so great to read about how Orville Wright and his brother and family really felt about their quest.<br />As co-owner of an aviation restoration company that works on older aircraft, this book meant more to me than most.<br />What I have noticed about most pilots is that except for those who get involved in the military or through chance - most pilots are almost &quot;meant&quot; to fly from the start.  It is something that inspires them from the time they are kids.  With the cost of flying and owning an aircraft, not every kid pursues his dream, but for Orville and the rest - once they are up in the sky it makes it all worthwhile.	2004-03-14

There are some mystery series that although cozy, just get boring after awhile.  The Joanne Fluke series are NOT of this genre.<br />I personally love the dialogue and the characters.  Hannah Swensen doesn't seem to me to &quot;order any of the other characters around&quot; and in fact it seems as though she often has to walk a fine line between dodging her mother and her sister. I do think that the men in her life and how THEY feel could be a little more developed, but this is a really cute series.<br />In &quot;Blueberry Muffin Murder,&quot; Connie Mac (who HAD to be based on a &quot;Martha Stewart&quot; type) comes into town and the fun begins.<br />I do think that this series would probably appeal more to women than to most &quot;career driven macho men.&quot;  Although, anyone who likes to cook would probably really like this series as well.	2004-03-14

I think that it would be very easy to resort to trite, old wedding disasters - but Donnelly manages to avoid this.<br />Other reviewers have mentioned that the novels were too long or characters weren't developed enough.

It was extremely well written.<br /><br />I was so interested to learn of the role that David Foster had in her American recordings.  David Foster is a master with talent.  He also has introduced the world to Josh Groban.  It is my utmost hope that Celine and Josh will do many duets and shows together.  It isn't just their voices - it's their personalities.  They are both confident, but they are both so unpretentious as well.<br /><br />I was awed by the strength of Celine and her family.  What a unique environment to grow up in!  Additionally, Celine seems so honest about her life - both the good and the bad.<br /><br />I was amazed at the details regarding her husband, Rene. Amazed that Celine had such a love for this man that it triumphed over YEARS when he repeatedly \\"rejected\\" her.  She was famous and could have had any number of boyfriends, but instead her heart wouldn't allow her to love anyone but Rene. I believe that Rene was MEANT to be with Celine and her family; that he truly didn't begin to live until he met them.  Likewise, I think that Celine is everything that she is because of Rene.  Not just her voice, but her looks, style, education, etc.<br /><br />Celine, a \\"homewrecker?\\"  Give me a break!  She was 14 and mesmerized by a cultured, attractive,genius agent who put her first in his life.  I don't think that any marriage could have survived when one woman becomes such an obsession  as Rene wanted the whole world to hear Celine.  And in all fairness, the marriage had been over for a long time before he finally made love to her at 20.  To me it is one of the greatest love stories of our time!!<br /><br />Rene groomed Celine to become the woman she is.  And he is her whole world.  What man could resist this?  Personally, I think he should feel as though he is the luckiest man in the world to have the love and loyalty of this gifted, funny, and amazing woman.d resist this?  Personally, I think he should feel as though he is the luckiest man in the world to have the love and loyalty of this gifted, funny, and amazing woman.	2004-03-12

I'm sorry, but I wish that I had read at least one before I bought all of them.  I could hardly read through parts of these books because they were so trite.<br />There were passages where Carly Phillips really grabbed my attention with her style.  But the plots were just so boring.  Also there were more sexual passages than I felt it needed.  I felt it almost concentrated more on the sexual passages(for frustrated housewives?) rather than using the sex scenes to enhance the romance.<br />I don't know.  Maybe it is just me. This was the kind of book I probably could have enjoyed in maybe my very early 20's.<br />If you are a mature woman (over 35) who has any semblance of depth - pass on this trio.	2004-03-12

I loved the concept of this book and felt that it deserved five stars for this alone.  I would not have missed reading this book for anything.<br />I also accidentally happen to see his uncle's picture located at the end of the book, before I started reading and I'm so glad that I did.  I feel that it should be placed at the beginning of the book because after viewing the man, I felt an even greater attachment to him.<br />There are characters in this book that are just brilliant, such as the &quot;Blue Man.&quot;  What creativity in describing him!<br />Some of the characters though, just didn't seem as developed...as though he had a deadline that didn't allow him to expound upon them.<br />I suggested this novel to my sibling who emailed me, &quot; I think I'd rather be surprised over my Welcoming Committee. &quot;  Not me! I immediately started thinking about the 5 people I will meet in heaven.  I have to say, my dog was right there at the top.<br />Mitch - a wonderful tribute to your Uncle!	2004-03-12

First, I think it is WONDERFUL that one book can create such controversy and inspire over 2000 readers to write a review.  I think that Dan Brown is one of the most brilliant writers of our time.<br />It can be very disconcerting when basic core religious beliefs are scrutinized and examined.  If you feel that it is wrong to ever question your beliefs or the Bible or Church - then it would probably be best not to read this book.	2004-03-08

I have looked at it daily ever since I purchased it.  I truly have never been that big on \\"seeing the world,\\" but I intend to make time for it now.<br /><br />I knew, obviously, about a great many of the places prior to reading this book, however Ms. Schultz takes the reader on a global safari with each turn of the page.<br /><br />The book does NOT include ONLY 5 Star hotels (but hey, they work for me!), but also includes ingenious (for brave souls) hotels such as the Ice Hotel in Sweden, etc.<br /><br />At almost 1000 pages (at a reasonable cost) this book is wonderfully concise. It serves as a great starting point with website info for each attraction when available.<br /><br />I'm glad that I'm going to marry a man who's also a pilot. I've already informed him that I can finish the list if I can only live to 100....<br /><br />This book is one of the best investments that I have made.	2004-03-03

They are one of the most charming and delightful series that I have read.  The humor that is infused into each book is unlike any other writer.  Nancy Atherton has a way of merging mystery and fantasy; mayhem and small English village from another time.  Stuffed childhood toys with a will of their own seem perfectly part of one's life. Is this Dan Brown?  No. But to me it's like reading an old friend.	2004-03-03
