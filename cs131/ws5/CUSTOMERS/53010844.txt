The amazing thing is how well the anecdotes are expressed. With each story, Mr. Gandhi reveals himself to actually be the legendary figure that he  became during the struggle by India for its independence from England.<br />An insightful book, one that will help anyone who wishes to understand this man by viewing pieces of his life through his eyes. I recommend this book wholeheartedly to anyone who is interested in Gandhi, or even in the inner-workings of people's minds.	2004-04-30

I love historical fiction. So when a co-worker recommended this book, I ran right out and got it. And I'm really glad I did.<br />The battle of Thermopylae was one of the most magnificent defeats ever suffered by any army; it made the legend of the Spartan warriors. Some histories have it that King Xerxes of Persian commanded an army of around 2 million men and were moving to attack the city of Thermopylae. Thermopylae was a port and situated behind a mountainous pass. 300 Spartan soldiers and about 3,500 allies, sworn to defend the City, stationed themselves at the pass and for a week, held off Xerxes'army.<br />The story is narrated by the lone Spartan survivor of the battle and is told to King Xerxes of Persia. Mr. Pressfield brings not only the battle to life, but his characters as well. I found myself hoping against all odds (and history)that the Spartans might win this battle, so sympathetic are the characters. He describes the Spartan way without detracting from the story - rather, it allows the reader to understand why the 300 performed as they did. <br />This book reads very quickly. It is compelling and I recommend it highly.	2004-04-30

Narrated by Stevie Taggart, Dr. Kreizler's servant and now on his own, owner of a tobacco shop, this story details the kidnap of the daughter of a Spanish diplomat, just as the diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Spain are imploding, leading to the Spanish-American War. <br />The major characters are fully-blown here, oddly human and very real - each has his or her own limitations which are very well<br />explored in the novel. The minor characters could use a little more fleshing out - but the murderer is very well explored and there is a great deal more plot to this book than the previous one.	2004-04-30

Mostly it's an introduction to the characters who are grouped together by Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt (yes, the President Roosevelt of Teddy Bear fame) to solve the murders of child hustlers in the late 1800's New York. But, when the action picks up - it does so with great alacrity! This is definitely a worth-while mystery-thriller to read - the history is well researched and you can nearly smell the stench of the streets of the 1890s. <br />Narrated by investigative journalist John Schuyler Moore, we get to participate in the investigation with Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, the &quot;alienist&quot; as psychiatrists were known then, Miss Sarah Howard, Teddy Roosevelt's assistant, Stevie Taggart, Dr. Kreizler's servant, and two New York City police detective brothers.<br />The best part of this book is knowing that the characters have been established and you can move on to the next book, The Angel of Darkness, which, in my opinion, is a much better, faster- moving read.	2004-04-30

Most of the characters in this book of historical fiction really existed. King John, who has been demonized by the Robin Hood tales, was a strong king of England who loved his children dearly and loathed his enemies. Llewellyn, the first Prince of Wales dreams of a united country. King John dreams of subduing Wales and Llewellyn. When King John marries his (...)daughter, Joanna, to Llewellyn, Joanna is at first reluctant and frightened. However, she comes to love her husband and finds that she must chose between spouse and father.<br />Ms. Penman writes with incredible power and emotion. Her history is well researched, and her characters, settings and dialogue are all incredibly believable. You may find that when you put the book down you are wondering, just a bit, exactly where and when you are. I highly recommend this book.	2004-04-30

This biography is intriguing and an interesting read; if you've  seen the movie, you should know that the film was really sanitized. John Nash, as a person, does not seem nice, decent or in any way sympathetic; he had strong views and treated people intimately connected with him like garbage.<br />This is a good biography, if you are interested in finding out about a truly heroic comeback. The mathematics which are central to Dr. Nash's life are WAY over my head - but do not interfere with the actual telling of the story. One problem which occurs is the way the author writes the story - it is very choppy, but this is still an interesting read.	2004-04-30

And that's exactly what it is. Queen Elizabeth I, daughter of Henry the VIII is a legend, which Mr. Hibbert attempts to address. Often, this is a dry and, at times, tedious read. However, the details  of Elizabeth's physical appearance, politics, and idiosyncracies are extremely interesting. The author details life with Elizabeth and her court, including both of the Queen Marys, Robert Dudley, Sirs Walter Raleigh and William Cecil and others.<br />The time line is obscure - Mr. Hibbert jumps around quite a bit and it can be confusing to the reader that isn't paying exacting attention. I wouldn't recommend it to a casual reader looking for a lot of melodrama and action. But, all in all, this is a good read for those who are interested in Elizabeth I.	2004-04-30

He lists Dr. Kelno as one of the prisoner doctors that committed horrible medical experiments on Jewish prisoners. Kelno is suing for defamation.

Barbara Kingsolver's novel of a missionary family gives the reader an idea. The family consisting of the Reverend, his wife and 5 daughters go to the Congo without sanction by his church in order to bring religion to the natives. The difference in cultures is stunning, and something that people who have never thought about going to Africa may never have thought of. The story is built around real events during the Congo revolution for independence. The writing is wonderful - each of the daughters has a section describing the events that were occuring in that era, and each daughter writes very distinctively and around the age group that you would expect.<br />I didn't hate this book, but it isn't one of my favorites. It has, however, peaked my interest about what happend in the Congo in the 60's and before. This has led me to order several other books on the Congo.	2001-07-17

I love Pern, the riders and most especially, the dragons. This book opens after AIVAS, the artificial intelligenced computer has shut down, and the dragonriders are now concerning themselves with what will happen &quot;After&quot;. After is when Thread stops falling once and for all. This book continues where &quot;Dolphins of Pern&quot; left off, fleshing out more characters and the culture of Pern. F'lessan, rider of bronze Golanth is the focus of the book, but all the old characters are still around and participating. The problems that were solved in Dolphins of Pern have created a whole new set of problems, including The Abominators, a fanatic group bound and determined to keep Pern in the old ways, instead of the new, technological environment that is coming about thanks to AIVAS.<br />Read the book in 2 days, loved every minute of it!

I watched and listened in horror in May 1996 as 8 climbers died on Everest in the worst one-day disaster that had ever happened on that mountain. I was overjoyed and incredulous when the news broke that one of the climbers, Beck Weathers, who had been left for dead on the mountain, had somehow managed to walk back into camp. Dr. Weathers lost his nose, both hands and his toes from frostbite, but he lived through his ordeal on the mountain.<br />This is Weathers' story. It follows Weathers through his depressions to his discovery of mountain climbing and from there, the story really begins. This book is told from Weathers' point of view with his wife, Peach and several friends, relatives and acquaintances chiming in with their recollections. <br />I enjoyed this book. It is a quick read and very interesting. I do have to warn you, however, there are times that this book reads as if it were a marriage counseling session between the Weathers. I found that Beck Weathers is a person to be admired for his sheer will and determination, but he is very human and very flawed.	2001-07-17

I got the first three books in this series in a gift pack and I have to be honest. I read this book and thought &quot;I have two more of these books to read. Maybe later.....&quot; but I did read the next two books and they are terrific. Which is why this review is so difficult. This book introduces the main character of the series, Roland, a gunslinger whose world has &quot;moved on&quot;. As I understand it, gunslingers are supposed to be like the knights of old (or at least the old we were taught about in my day and age). They are chivalrous and protect the weak. The problem with this book was that I couldn't really sympathize or feel anything for the character. However, you kind of need this book to get along with the next two (or three or four....).So let me put it to you this way - the next three books are terrific and will be reviewed shortly. This book is iffy, but you really need it to understand what Roland is and why he does what he does - so whether or not you like this book, you'll need it to really enjoy the next set in the series. After reading the second book, I realized the worth of this one. I guess this is a backhanded recommendation - get this book so you can really be entertained by the rest of the series!	2001-07-17

The voyage is considered one of the most remarkable voyages in seafaring history.<br />This is a good book. I really enjoyed reading it. It doesn't flounder about with long-winded descriptions of everyday life, but you get a real sense of what these men went through. This was definitely a more rugged era!

The author's wife dropped an email to me, suggesting that I might enjoy this book.  I ordered it and read through it.  This is a charming story and, although I mostly confine my dragon reading to McCaffrey and a few others, the story seemed fairly original to me.<br />The problem with this book is that the author desperately needed an editor.  Misuse of words (&quot;heard of runner beast&quot;, &quot;no bases in fact&quot;), lack of punctuation, grammatical errors all marred the story.  The dialogue is repetitive and doesn't ring true.  It's a shame, because without these difficulties, this would be a really good read.<br />I can't write a novel and applaud Mr. Adams for his effort, but in future, a good proof-reader and editor may come in handy to reduce the kind of errors that ruined the suspension of reality for me.	2001-07-17

She made her debut at the age of 16, having been held back by her mother and cello teacher. But once she hit the stage - she became an international star. Her playing was so interpretive that she was often criticized for detracting from the music. However, she also influenced many notable classical musicians of our time with her fervent interpretations of the cello repetoire. Her career as a cellist, however, was short-lived as, at the age of 27, she was diagnosed with MS. Her cheerful demeanor and courageous outlook on life is chronicled here, as are most of her performances.<br />This biography, while some times reading like a discography of Jacqueline du Pré is a very biased toward du Pré's husband's point of view, but much more even-handed about du Pré than Hilary and Jackie. However, Elizabeth Wilson is herself a cellist and student of du Pré and she makes a lot of assumptions that the reader will also have a thorough understanding of certain musical terminology such as up or down bow or glissando. This is an interesting book, but may be terdious to anyone who does not have a thorough grounding in the cello repetoire, classical music or the playing of a stringed instrument.	2001-07-17

I don't know the War of the Roses, I don't care about the War of the Roses.... all I know is that each of the many characters that are introduced in this first volume are fascinating and very individual.<br />This book is very violent, and gives a feel of medieval times - set in a world whose history is recorded in thousands of years.  There is magic and magical creatures throughout the story, but the story is about the people involved in the various situations - not the magic or the creatures.<br />Each chapter of this book is told by a set of major characters - some of the narrations are connected, others are not, and yet, the book is never difficult to understand, I never lost the plot lines (and there are many) and after each individual narration, I found myself in a different place with a different person - wanting more from the previous character and yet dying to find out what was going on with the current character.<br />I highly recommend this book - even for those of you who feel that the fantasy genre is way overdone!

Rayford Steele, his daughter, Chloe, Pastor Bruce Barnes and journalist Cameron (Buck) Williams have banded together to form the Tribulation Force. Rayford and Buck are pressed into service of the man, Nicolae Carpathia, that they begin to believe may be the antiChrist. Nicolae has burst onto the world political scene, taken over the United Nations and signed a peace agreement with the nation of Israel. and has introduced policies that will bring the world together as a global village. In the meantime, God's judgement has started as predicted in the Book of Revelations.<br />Mixing Biblical prophecy, the apocalypse, some romance and a lot of conspiracy, Tribulation Force continues the saga. This is another good book. I must warn you - the writing is not difficult or breathtaking - this book is entertaining, suspenseful and is quick-moving.	2000-12-28

While there are some fair to good suggestions for anyone who is trying to start up a Human Resources department - one of the things that drew me to this book was the mention that there were electronic forms that came with the book.  The forms are on floppy disk and are available in DOS.  Not a really good choice for a person who has been working with Windows 95 for years.<br />The one thing that I was able to use when I first got the book was the layout of Job Descriptions.  I couldn't use the ones on the disk, but the layout in the book is fairly good.  However, I soon discovered other, better books on the market and have shelved this one.	2000-12-28
