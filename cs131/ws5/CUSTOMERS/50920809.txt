I understand that the 1st edition was rife with mistakes, and the redo has gone a long way to fix this. There are still a few mistakes, such as a paragraph being repeated in text and in a sidebar, but for the most part it reads well.<br /><br />Conan d20 wonderfully captures the mood of Robert Howard's Hyperborean Age. It is a truly beautiful full color hardback with gorgeous, evocative art that recreates the images of Howard's writing. Mongoose has also fully supported the line with many accessories.<br /><br />Highlights: The combat system deviates from standard d20 with Parry and Dodge Defense rather than Armor Class. You can block weapons, or dodge attacks, but if you get hit, armor soaks up some damage. There's a little more bookkeeping, but most players and GM's will be pleased with the result.<br /><br />Lows: Some of the writing can get tedious toward the gazeteer section, without quite as much visceral plot hooks as this critiquer would have liked. And the magic system is modeled after HP Lovecraft and Howard's works at the time. Magic is evil, dangerous, diabolical, and there's not really many good reasons for good PC's to use it. This might go against the grain of persons wanting to recreate characters from the films, and a little GM adjubcation might be in line.<br /><br />Overall, i was very pleased with the new corebook and am looking forward to enjoying others volumes in the line.	2005-03-30

A companion book to Vile Darkness, Exalted Deeds shows gamers how to portray the heights of good and righteousness in the face of evil. There's not much to add that other reviewers haven't already covered. One missed element is the outstanding artwork. The angels are portrayed as firesword-wielding instruments of the gods, burning with divine might. Avatars and immortals clash on vivid fields, and the dark things of the universe paw closer like hungry tigers.<br />  Some of the artwork contains nudity, which is another reason for the mature rating, but it is nothing gratuitous or pornographic. Overall, the book is a unique one among the annals of roleplaying material, if not for the content, then surely for its combination of stunning full color art. Good work, WotC.	2003-10-31

I cannot recommend it highly enough.  Suspense, terror, violence and mind-bending horrors, it's all here, and it takes a well-prepared Keeper (or GM) to make it flow smoothly.  I actually adapted it to d20 for our campaign, and if i were to do it again i would probably use one of the new Shadows of Cthulhu or Trail of Cthulhu instead of the standard BRP rules.	2003-06-05

Prestige classes include orcs that feed on the rage around them, alternate uses for rage ability such as temporary critical attacks, and lots of background on the culture. For the price, definitely worth it for someone into the bestial race.	2003-05-06

Most of the gritty rules are already referenced in the PH, DMG and MM, so that left plenty of room for the writers to go wild. The setting is a clever blend of Middle Earth and Martin's books, so that some of it seems very famililar (end of the Third Age, orcs, elves, etc) but the real twist comes with Izrador (not unlike Sauron). This diety of evil controls the world now after being thrown down from heaven (the Sundering) but in turn, the good gods can no longer touch the world either. Evil rules, the Dark One has spread his fingers across the land, and the rule is to obey or die.<br />  Right from the start, EVERYTHING seasoned players are used to in a typical D&D campaign are turned on end. Gold is rarely used in commerce, quality items are very hard to fine, magic is ancient and rare, weapons and armor are illegal and punishable by death, civilization is mostly ruled by orcs, pockets of deep, distant lands crawl with trapped demons, and one by one the major races are dying. Soon, Izrador will rule all, and in time he will regain enough power to take revenge on his celestial brothers.<br />  That is, unless the champions of the earth can stop him, which is where the players come in. The earth, in a last ditch effort to preserve itself, embues certain men and women with powers above the norm. Nothing flashy, just bonuses here and there that replicate what you might find in the core rule books. The feel, flavor and nature of the campaign is about as far from Greyhawk, the Realms, and Dragonlance as you can get. Very well balanced and lot of fun, this is a setting for players and DM's who want some dark fantasy, and aren't afraid of the dark themselves.	2003-04-28

The art is vivid, and many of the beasts are fiendishly creative and scary. As far as the monsters already covered in Tome of Horrors, yeah, there is some stuff that has been redone, maybe 5 to 10 monsters we've seen elsewhere, but it's interesting to see a different take by another designer (particularly the disenchanter, which has a FF CR 17!)	2003-04-21

The thing is, i never thought of it myself, and Savage Species takes several hundred pages with full examples to show some ways it might be done. The book is not perfect, such as mistakes and a complete lack of creature background, history, culture, etc...everyting that the 2nd ed. book had. Still, this is much better than the earlier book (which wouldn't even let you play a troll as it was too powerful; not anymore).<br />  It has lots of monstrous feats, some better than others, great magic items with art, wonderful illustrations, some good templates and some so-so templates, but mostly just text that gets you thinking, \\"hey, i want to make my own special class.\\" The rules are set down, the options are there, and if anyone wants to take the time to craft their own beasties it's not too difficult. Plus, it lets a DM scale down monsters for lower level parties, and easily boost them for higher level.<br />  Ideally, if a DM were starting his own campaign in a monster-dominated world, you can't do without this book. SCrap the standard races of humans and elves and leave in the minotaurs and troglodytes, celestials and djinn.<br />  Lastly, the book says that a monster class should be taken completely from 1st level to whatever level it maxes out at before one can add on regular character classes. The reasoning is that someone can take the powers of a 1st level monster and tack on character levels from there on out. I'm bending this rule myself; if players wanted to take several levels of mindflayer and go rogue the rest of the way, fine, but they can never go back to mind flayer. Besides, a mind flayer at 3rd level would not have the abilities of say, a 3rd level dwarf cleric, and far from the lethal mindblast talent.<br />  A great resource, it just takes some determined reading to fully implement the usefulness.efulness.	2003-04-03

What i actually use from these books rarely justifies the cost. That's the case with the 3rd edition AaEG, a book that has some solid rules and some stuff that makes you scratch your head (such as flippers and a snorkel). Although many people don't care, the art is the same as the splatbooks, and despite being hardcover the book is completely b/w, and not especially great. Sometimes i really miss the full-page color templates from 2nd edition. Anyway, the book is broken down into mundane adventuring items, magical items, and vehicles. The biggest section is the magic items, and while many of them are nice, such as the manticore blade +3 that fires projectiles, a lot of the items are just tried and true and generic &quot;it lets you cast true strike twice per day.&quot;<br />  Many of the items are gleaned from Dragon and other sourcebooks, but as i lack most of those so it's all new to me. Still, I just can't shake the feeling that i could have thought of that magic item myself without paying someone to tell me...	2003-04-03

Hardcore original system players don't like the action-oriented feel of d20 (which automatically brings to mind images of fighters and wizards battling the Mythos and winning!)<br />I never played the original version, but i have read some of Lovecraft's stories and i like his fiction. I bought the old version at the same time i bought the new one, compared and contrasted the two, and in my non-professional opinion, i think they are both beautiful games that can offer tons of unique entertainment for gamers.<br />If not for d20 cthulhu, i never would have been introduced to shoggoths and mi-go, colours from space and the machinations of the Great Old Ones. That was a main reason for publishign the book, and i doubt few players and gm's (or keepers) can say that it is not an attractive hardback.<br />d20 Cthulhu is no less dangerous than Chaosium's game, although players WILL have an easier time churning through cultists and other adversaries due to all of the combat feats in d20. As for the mythos, these monsters have so much damage reduction that it would take a rocket launcher down one's throat to usually annoy them. In the meantime, just like in the old game, your character gets messily eaten and digested.<br />It's all in the quality of the rules, the willingness of the players and the competency of the GM.  I myself am an old school D&D player and DM who loves the vulnerability of the game and how your players cannot under most circumstances fight their way out of an encounter. My current players are D&Ders who like to see their characters live and grow, so although they like the imagery and fear factor of CoC, they don't like losing their precious little creations. So we don't play much. I'm bummed.<br />So that's the face value of it. The game introduces the community to something they might not have been exposed to, while at the same time not ostracizing D&D gamers they had already roped in. When we started playing 3rd edition D&D it took a good year and a half to get used to the rules. It might take some dedicated CoC players just as long too. If you're an original version player of CoC and never had a complaint or cared for a more robust combat system/core book, then there's no need to buy the d20 version. Otherwise, for new players, i say jump in and enjoy a delightful and terrifying experience.<br />  Cthulhu loathes you...had already roped in.

Full color and with sections divided into PC and GM information, it is packed with plot hooks, enemies, allies, and art. Drawbacks include that it is not as useful for PC's other than fun reading and detailing their homeworlds. A personal peeve was that many monsters and locales are described but lack pictures to illustrate them. But that's probably hard to do for every monster and locale as so many are introduced over the book. Overall, a good product especially for new players who don't own any other planet guides from earlier game systems.	2003-01-27

The book is gorgeous, i mean really, really well done, chock full of attractive layout, art and photography. I never played the old WEG Star Wars. That's too bad, as i feel that i might have missed out on something. I've read all of the reviews regarding the new version, and to say the least they are very contradictory.<br />  I sort of know what they mean. When 3rd edition came out i was sorely against it for about a year. I found it confusing, some of the changes unnecessary, and the general FEEL was not the D&D of 1st and 2nd edition that i knew and loved so well.<br />  Given time with my group, we slowly integrated the rules, tweaking them as needed, leaving out a good bit of the OOP rules and keeping what we wanted. In the end, we all became hardcore d20 fans as we came to understand the complexity and flexibility of the system.<br />  I don't think it matters what game system you use, so long as it is a good, stable one, if you are into rpg's. No system is perfect, not the old WEG system, and not the new WOTC system, but the new one is still pretty damn good.<br />  For any of you out there who still have reservations, keep in mind that you can alter the rules for your own style of play. Give some classes bonus abilities, let armor reduce vitality damage, make races stronger than Humans, give droids maximum hp at every level, do whatever you want to create a game that fits your needs.<br />  Combat is fast and furious, but ONLY if you are familiar with d20. Our first forays into attacks of opportunity was a disaster. SW is still deadly, much more so than D&D. Wound point damage is equal to your constituion score, an average of 10-15 points. A simple blaster does 3-24 points of damage on a critical hit. Add that with fatigue penalities, saves vs. unconsciousness, and lack of healing potions, character lives are rather fragile.<br />  In conclusion, i am pleased with the book and the system, and the wonderful accessories available for the game. Like with D&D before it, this update has been a welcome change. And even if they DO come out with another version after episode 3, i'll just have to save up ... over three years to buy that too.D&D.

I am pleased to recommend the Monsternomicon and its steampunk approach, which can easily be adapted to any campaign. Even if you use FR, the use of mechanics and firearms can have its place somewhere, and provides a great twist for adventures.<br />The nomicon is lavishly illustrated, with pictures that harken to the early days of first edition. The art in this book is MUCH better than anything in the Creature Collections by S&S. Great work from a D20 publisher, and anyone who runs a hardcore Iron Lands campaign shouldn't be without this. If you are a collectorand appreciate talent, soul and hard work, snatch this one up before they're all gone.	2002-10-06

Instead of saying first what DID work, i want to point out some shortcoming to prospective buyers. This book assumes that you really need stats for the dieties, all the way down to their SKILLS and FEATS. I personally thought that was going too far, and was a major waste of space. But, the way the folks at Wizards have set things up, you could easily run a campaign with the PC's playing dieties, and you could have Helm clash with Umberlee and actually know exactly what they could or could not do in combat. Beyond that, the roleplaying aspects of controlling a diety take the game to new realms.<br />Anyway, a lot of the info is stuff old FR players have seen before. The 2nd edition Faiths and Avatars actually had tons of info that this book does not (and consequently print small enough to make your eyes bleed). If you have the old Faiths and Avatars, i suggest using it along with the Faiths and Pantheons to get the maximum impact (the older book had incredible detail about the clergy; the newer is scimpier in that regard).<br />The prestige classes are interesting, and the art in the book is overall very good, as other reviewers have noted. I like the Realms, but in my personal opinion there are too many dieties, and most of the information in these books i will never use, sad to say.<br />Overall, there isn't much bad  about the book, assuming that you like the Realms in the first place. It is all the dieties you could ever want, or need, or use, but at least DM's and players have a lot of room to work with.	2002-05-28

I've never been a Cthulhu player, but i've always liked horror and Lovecraft, and i've played D&amp;D on and off since first edition. I bought both the last edition of CoC and the newest one, just in case WOTC botched the transition from one game platform to the other. Fortunately, that is not the case, and what the new CoC turn out to be is an incredibly beautiful full color tome that captures the essence of Cthulhu. <br />The rules are pretty much identical to 3E D&amp;D, but with the added Sanity (which is the same as old versions of CoC). The art is phenomenal, and the entire book comes together as something that either Lovecraft readers,collectors, CoC players, or D&amp;D players can all use. There are even stats for all the converted Elder Ones in case your players want to take on Cthulhu himself (he has 882 hit points, and Azamoth has over 2000--yikes). <br />I hope old players of CoC don't mind the facelift to their favorite game. Aside from a few problems with game mechanics (i still don't get the autofire spray; the chance to hit is abysmal when emptying a full clip wildly) that the gamemaster can simply ignore or repair if he/she doesn't like it, the game is perfect. I hope this gives Chaosium a boost and that their future works fully support the system.	2002-04-11

Druids, Rangers and Barbarians will love some of the feats, although as with everything, all of the material is optional and subject to the DM's discretion according to his gameworld (I'm wary of the Wildshape Spellcasting myself, it is very, very powerful).<br />But taken as a whole, there are tons of interesting prestige classes, although most of of these are best suited to NPC's (with a few exceptions). The spells are great, and the overall enthusiasm that the writers injected into the next really stands out. This is a book that can really make these three classes a lot more fun to play.	2002-03-06

It's the same size and layout as Magic of Faerun, so that right there is a plus. Personally, i think the artwork is much better than Magic of Faerun, and some of the power groups detailed therein are quite intriguing. From the Daemonfey to the old Red Wizards, the book covers dozens and dozens of personalities, locales, and enemies to throw against your party.<br />If you don't play in the Realms, the book is not as useful, but it is still GRADE A gaming material that could have pieces used in other campaigns. It seems like WOTC is pumping all their best talent and money into the FR series, which is fine by me, but it means that some other lines end up lacking (like the class supplement books).<br />Yes, the book is very pricey, but for a DM who wants a whole slew of villians, monsters and plots, it's worth the money.	2001-11-12

I particularly like the mind flayer assassin. There are groups of non-human parties that are somewhat strange, but i suppose they all fit the flavor of 3rd edition where weird is the norm.<br />  Not a mandatory book, and sort of on the thin side, but a resourceful DM can use it.	2001-10-29

They are geared toward new DM's and take the time to explain the new 3rd edition rules and proper ways these rules should be used. This is a very refreshing way to read a module for new and old players alike as it reinforces what you know (or just think you know).<br />  Highlights: A simple but well planned adventure centered around the retrieval of a holy relic. The villians are nasty, more than a challenge for the 1st and 2nd level characters the module is designed for, but the website has free advice on how to tailor the adventure for more powerful characters.<br />  Numerous NPC's are introduced with quirky backgrounds and personalities that the players may or may not meet. I have adapted the entire module to my Forgotten Realms campaign and plopped it in the north, a few hundred miles from Waterdeep.<br />  The writers stress that although the module is very difficult for low level characters, they did this on purpose as the best memories often derive from the most demanding challenges. And a resourceful DM can still save the PC's butts from the fire without them knowing.<br />  Definitely worth giving a try, and the best thing is, the more popularity Necromancy Games gets, the more money they acquire, and the better their products will be in the future.	2001-10-23

The presentation is great with robust artwork and the detail we've come to expect from 3rd edition. That said, i think the books lacks the edge of the orginal OA. Also, the world of Rokugan, while not bad at all, just doesn't perk my interest quite as much as Kara-Tur did. In fact, much of the book describes which elements Rokugan does NOT incorporate, but still provides the rules so that DM's and players can use them in their own campaigns. This to me just seemed silly. If you are going to through the trouble of using this Oriental universe then why not make it compatible with all the rules presented?<br />  I suppose it's a minor quibble, and otherwise the book does have some good material. The monsters are great and have a lot of flavor, and there is so much info about the Shadowlands in the book it would be a waste not to use it, even if you ARE playing in Kara-Tur.<br />  For those DM's and players who want an Oriental feel to their games, you can certainly use this book and pick elements from it. A good product, just not quite all i had hoped for.	2001-10-18

The d20 Open Gaming License looks likes its off to a good start. I was not impressed with the initial Creature Collection and didn't even buy it, but this one is of MUCH better quality. The black and white artwork is generally very good with the occasional lacking picture.  Just a brief listing of the pros and cons of this manual:<br />  Hundreds and hundreds of strange and deadly monsters, all fully detailed and versatile in all types of climates, from cities to swamps to deserts to oceans.  As mentioned, most of the artwork is very good and a great visual aid for players so they know exactly what it is that is about to kill their characters.<br />  Cons: Virtually all of the material is heavilly rooted in the Scarred Lands campaign setting.  This in and of itself isn't bad, but a lot of the details will be hard to mesh with other campaigns. Much of the descriptions are ultraviolent and lend a very dark tone to the book, but that probably won't be a deterrent to most readers.<br />  But if all you want is the picture, a brief blurb and the 3E stats,(like me) this book is for you. That said, i don't know much about Scarred Lands aside from reading the CC2, but it looks like a DANGEROUS place to live.  The world is full of murderous, grotesque monsters intent on slaying all life, with the ruminations of Gods and Titans thrown into the mix to make it even more dangerous. The VAST majority of these creatures were created by gods and titans both living and dead, but they can still be adapted to individual campaigns without too much trouble.<br />  I look forward to CC3 and hope that Sword and Sorcery Studios can outdo themselves with the next one. They're one gaming company to keep an eye on as they grow, and they've earned this DM's respect.	2001-10-10

It draws from many years of material already established by TSR and then adds to it new information.<br />The Nine Hells, Pandemonium, The Abyss, The Seven Heavens, these are all here and all fully detailed, including planar traits, inhabitants, rulers, cities (if any) and options for creating your own planes based on the templates created for the D&amp;D cosmology.<br />  There are even stats for the Astral Dreadnaught, the one-eyed beastie from the cover of the original Manual of the Planes!<br />  For DM's who truly want to delve into the mysteries of the D&amp;D universe, this book is mandatory. Expensive, yes, but at least this time you are getting your money's worth. If only WOTC could keep up the trend with high quality materials like this instead of slapping out the subpar paperback Class Supplements.	2001-09-18
US	50920809	R1WJHR9TISY63	0786918500	74184571	Manual of the Planes (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying)	Books	4	6	6	N	Y	Quite Useful	Taking much of its info from the original Manual of the Planes and splicing it with lots of Planescape material, then adding a dollop of its own stuff, this is a hefty book that will have newbies to the D&amp;D cosmology eagerly grabbing it up. <BR>  <BR>The planes are well detailed, illustrated, given unique characteristics, settings, and all with that 3rd edition twist. Lots of new monsters in the back, plus the expected assortment of some prestige classes and planes-specific spells.<br />The only drawback one might have (and its a minor one) is that if you are a long-term player of D&amp;D and own all the old sourcebooks, you will already know a chunk of this material. But fret not, there is PLENTY of new ideas that sets it apart, particularly the options to create your own cosmologies. Definitely one of the better 3rd edition sourcebooks.	2001-09-12

This is a big one, 192 pages, and chock full of spells, magic, rules and prestige classes that should keep anyone busy for a long, long time. Lots of artwork (some very good, some not as good) and a nice layout, very attractive. This makes up somewhat for the terrible spell selection in Tome and Blood with some interesting ideas. Hope they can keep this up for future products.	2001-08-09

In particular, the class enhancements like Sword and Fist and Defenders of the Faith. They're not BAD, per se, and Tome and Blood has its useful information, but compared to what it could have been, and what you're getting for twenty bucks, its just about not  worth it.  First, the pluses:  New skills, new Feats (some of which are overpowering, so DM's' beware) and the best thing is the new Prestige classes, including the interesting Guildmage and the Pale Master. The Prestige classes are well thought out and interesting, and many players will be hopping to try them out.  Now, the minuses, which in my opinion outweigh the pluses-  The presentation of the book lacks appeal. The artwork is sparse, not all of it good, with few embellishments along the way to jump out and grab the reader. I have to admit, i miss the old brown Complete Handbooks of 2nd edition with their full color inserts. Not only where they longer, but there were cheaper too!  There is roughly eight pages of this skinny 96 page book that describes the domicle of a wizard, replete with room descriptions and details. In my opinion, when space for text is so limited as is, this could have gone toward somethign much more useful.  The spells are TERRIBLE! How many ice/fire/acid orbs can a person need? I was looking forward to dozens of rehashed spells from the Wizard's Handbook series updated to 3rd edition. Sorry, that's just not really done here. There are a few good spells, but you are better off grabbing the second edition ones and updating them yourself, or wait for yet ANOTHER supplement to come along that has some decent spells.  Roleplaying tips are sparse, other than what is included in the prestige classes. EVen these could have been fleshed out some more.  To me, the whole project just seemed rushed, slapped together with a minimum of expense and then shipped out at the usual high price. If i could have just gotten some better details out of it i woudl have been happy, but for this DM, they were just too far and few between to give it a higher rating.ipped out at the usual high price.

Even if you are running a 3rd edition campaign, this boxed set is definitely worth your picking up if you can find it. The conversion to the new rules might take a little effort on the DM's behalf, but the payoff is the most exciting, deadly, and awe-inspiring campaign ever put to paper. It wraps seamlessly around Gary Gygax's original Tomb of Horrors, and you even get the chance to go back and explore it again if you did so for the first time twenty years ago. My players have no clue what the Tomb really is, and i'm still keeping them in the dark until later.  Like other reviewers have said though, be warned. The module is deadly, and about halfway through and all the way to the end, it can eat up PC's like candy. But far as quality, it has some of the best writing, the best traps, the best plot, and over sixty illustrations to mesmerize your players. Definitely try to check this one out, as its going into the history books.	2001-06-05
US	50920809	R3PX15MFCM05OF	0786918322	918446994	Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faerun (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)	Books	4	12	18	N	N	Not a bad addition	For someone who was generally displeased with 3rd edition, I have been able to enjoy the Monsters of Faerun more than i though i would. The monster manuals have always been my favorite part of the D&amp;D game, and in my opinion, the old Monstrous Compendiums were the heyday of the series. Sure, the art was only black/white, but the descriptions! The plot hooks! The overwhelming numbers of foes and fiends for your PC's to fight! It was great. The new Monster Manual sorely disappointed me except for the artwork, and even some of that was not perfect (I don't like the changes made to trolls, for one thing).  The biggest problem with the Core Monster Manual was the way they crammed in all the monsters, sliced away all the background information and scaled them down to nothing but combat stats for reckless adventurers to hack through. So much detailed information lost from the 2nd edition, just to put more monsters between two covers, with a confusing layout on top of that.  As for the Monsters of Faerun, although the book is still a little slim, the creatures are well picked, bringing back some old favorites like revenants and shadow dragons, and the little blurbs on their function in the world fleshes them out some. It is still far from perfect, and if WOTC is to ever regain my full trust, i would love to see some future monster manuals where they have more roleplaying tips and monster quirks,maybe even bring back the Ecology, rather than just stripping them down to base AC,feats and damage. I know the new game is combat heavy, but the monster manuals for me were always the most fun to read, and i wish they still were.	2001-02-13

On my PC,the search engine works fine,a little clunky,but more than fast enough to whiz through pages,as  long as they are not zoomed in all the way.  Everything prints just as  you need it to,and I haven't had the need to look up stuff through Adobe at  all.  Bottom line,an indispensable addition for a DM who just wants the  right article or picture to supplement his campaign.  And when more patches  are released to update some of the problems (like some missing  inserts)well,all the better.	1999-12-30
