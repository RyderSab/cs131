Harms reconstructs the development of trade routes and merchant houses (canoe houses) along the Zaire (Congo) River from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth.  Harms gives an informative sketch of how societies along the river adjusted to accommodate the demands and opportunities presented by commerce, first in slaves, then in ivory.  Harms, for instance, offers an interesting suggestion of how wealth among the commercial class changed (for the worse) the nature and quality of married life for women.  <br />For a discussion of similar developments in Southeastern Nigeria, see Trading States of the Oil Rivers, by G. I. Jones.  John Thornton has authored a number of articles and books on the era of the slave trade in West Central Africa (the Congo-Angola region), while David Eltis, et al., Routes to Slavery, presents essays on the slave trade.  Readers interested in Central Africa should also consider works by Jan Vansina.  <br />Daily Life in the Kingdom of the Kongo, by Georges Balandier, translated by Helen Weaver (1968), remains a highly-readable, greatly-informative work.	2001-08-01

We might associate Florida with summer homes instead of slave cabins, but Smith tells us of a slave system firmly planted in the sunshine state, particularly in a cotton belt on the Florida Panhandle.  The narrative includes a discussion of the conflict between white landowners and a small but striking community of free people of color.<br />Smith's work is well-written and well-researched.  Her style is engaging, her scholarship impressive.<br />Those interested in plantation development in Florida might also consider the essays edited by Jane G. Landers, Colonial Plantations and Economy in Florida.  The essays anthologized therein consider much of the period preceding Smith's study.	2001-07-11

Mullin argues that slaves resisted slavery in Virginia from the spread of plantation slavery in the 1690s to the conspiracy hatched by Gabriel Prosser in 1800.  Mullins contends that all slaves fought to undermine slavery, whether they were a majority of the African-born slaves in the early-1700s or an elite of American-born artisan slaves in the late-1700s.  Based on their cultural background and their work environment, however, slaves encountered different forms of slavery and responded with different forms of resistance.  Mullin also mentions the religious and ideological influences on slave conspirators and their possible white sympathizers late in the eighteenth century.<br />Stanley Elkins, in Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life, argued that American slavery, unlike Latin American slavery, psychologically infantilized slaves so that resistance was uncommon.  This book by Mullin, and Black Majority by Peter H. Wood, should be understood as rebuttals to Elkins.  The 3rd revised edition of Slavery contains Elkins' brief rejoinder to both Wood and Mullin.<br />For those interested in the possible influence of African heritage on African responses to slavery, see Daniel C. Littlefield, Rice and Slaves; David Eltis, et al., Routes to Slavery; Robert Ferris Thompson, Four Moments of the Sun: Kongo Art in Two Worlds; and Michael Angelo Gomez, Exchanging Our Country Marks.  Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, Africans in Colonial Louisiana,  includes an enlightening chapter on Senegambia during the era of the slave trade.  Those interested in North American slave revolts should also consider Wood's Black Majority on the Stono Rebellion in South Carolina.

In America, ironically, the Puritans established colonies which came to emphasize deference to authority.  In colonial New England, a rough equality in condition eased  most tensions of hierarchy in status.  By the eve of the Revolution,  however, several factors--religious, political, economic and  demographic--worked to rekindle the Puritan tradition of agitation and  radicalism.  The Protestant emphasis on the authority of individual  conscience was revived.  Richard L. Bushman explores these developments in  Connecticut, providing a colorful social portrait.  He brings to life  arguments and controversies, illuminating the convictions and feelings of  each side.  Bushman's work proves very informative and quite readable.	2000-05-22

Dunn discusses the adventurers of the first twenty years, mostly  small-scale farmers; the cavalier-planters of the 1640s and '50s, Royalist  exiles who fled the English Civil War; and the slaves who became a majority  of the population in the period Dunn considers.  <br />Dunn offers a detailed  contrast between the lives of the planter elite and the enslaved majority.

Parrinder qualifies West African polytheism by noting the concept of a single  principal deity.  This spirit, however, is considered remote.  This deity  is not usually approached directly.  Instead, prayers and offerings are  directed to lesser though powerful spirits.<br />The ghosts of ancestors  whose names are remembered are also venerated.  Gifts of food, and other  signs of respect, honor the place the recently-deceased continue to hold in  the family and society.<br />The practices of fortunetellers and diviners  are also discussed.  The religious practices of various devotional centers,  called houses of a god, feature the ritual death and rebirth of devotees.  Throughout West Africa, spiritual vocation means becoming a new person.  Scarification and learning a new language are often part of starting a new  spiritual life.<br />The concepts and practices considered by Parrinder  offer fascinating insights into West African theology.  A good companion  work would be Parrinder's excellent West African Psychology.  Dominique  Zahan's The Religion, Spirituality and Thought of Traditional Africa is  also an excellent study.  The perspectives are different; for example,  Zahan mainly considers ethnic groups in French-speaking Africa, whereas  Parrinder concentrates on English-speaking areas of West Africa.	2000-03-25

The studies  provide a detailed and informative consideration of life in the  seventeenth-century Chesapeake.<br />The scholars writing in this volume have  published various works on the colonial Chesapeake.  James Horn, who  authored the essay on servant emigration to the Chesapeake, has written  Adapting to a New World: English Society in the Seventeenth-Century  Chesapeake.  Lorena S. Walsh, who herein examines marriage and family life  in colonial Maryland, has written From Calabar to Carter's Grove: The  History of a Virginia Slave Community.  Darrett B. and Anita H. Rutman  provide a startling and compelling portrait of family fragmentation and  reformation due to early parental death and successive remarriage.  The two  also cowrote the study, A Place in Time: Middlesex County, Virginia,  1650-1750, a detailed reconstruction of life in a Virginia county, for  masters and farmers and servants and slaves.<br />The emergence of an  American-born elite is considered in Virginia by Carole Shammas, author of  Inheritance in America, and in Maryland by David W. Jordan, author of  Foundations of Representative Government in Maryland, 1632-1715.  Carville  V. Earle, author of Evolution of a Tidewater Settlement System, presents a  study of disease and death rates in early Virginia.  Kevin P. Kelly studies  the dispersed settlement patterns in Surry County, Virginia.  Kelly  authored The Economic and Social Development of Seventeenth-Century Surry  County, Virginia.  Lois Green Carr and Russell R.

Parrinder considers various features of West African psychological thought.  Parrinder's discussion of West African concepts of the supernatural, like belief in shape-shifting, are intriquing.  Equally  interesting are his expositions of West African psychological thinking,  like dream interpretation.  <br />Parrinder's description of West African  ideas of reincarnation is one of many thought-provoking observations.  In  Hinduism and Buddhism, the unenlightened suffer the misfortune of rebirth  to this world.  In West Africa, people who prove themselves worthy elders  enjoy veneration by family who survive them, as well as the prospect of  eventual return to the realm of the living.  The spirits of the unworthy or  the rootless haunt the West African landscape.  <br />Also, several children  may bear the name of an ancestor whom they are all considered to  reincarnate.  In West Africa, various aspects of a single person's  character and personality are reincarnated.  Thus, a single individual may  be reincarnated in several people.  Parrinder also explains that some West  Africans believe that each person has multiple souls, presenting a further  intriguing twist on African concepts of the self.  <br />Another good study of  the peoples of this region would be another book by Parrinder, West African  Religion.	2000-03-25

Thompson finds that most Puritans, before leaving Britain, lived, worked and socialized in the same network of communities in which their ancestors had lived for many generations. Even the merchants, the most mobile group Thompson studies, were only incrementally mobile. Over years, or over generations, merchants moved town-by-town, steadily closer to London. Most Puritan colonists, Thompson asserts, would have found the move to another continent a drastic break from both their heritage and their experience.<br />The examination of callings, both religious and occupational, proves extremely interesting. Thompson shows how these men and women lived in England, and why they finally felt compelled to leave. Details of their lives, both personal and professional, enrich Thompson's study.<br />The work is a tremendous contribution to our understanding of the Puritans, in both England and America. Thompson offers a work of outstanding skill and readability.<br />Other works in the same field would be the section on East Anglians relocating to New England in David Hackett Fischer's Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, and the entirety of D.

Jordan and Matti Kaups studied America's frontier culture to discern its ethnic heritage. Most historians of the American frontier locate its origin in the vicinity of the Delaware Valley. In this book, Jordan and Kaups trace America's frontier culture to a surprising corner of Europe's \\"hard scrabble periphery.\\"  In the 1700s, about a century before Davy Crockett, residents of this corner of Europe depicted their frontiersmen fighting bears!      Jordan and Kaups consider evidence from literature, anthropology and architecture. The authors discussed the equipment carried by frontier hunters, the primitive and ecologically exahustive farming and homesteading techniques, the building of log cabins and even the notches in fence rails to trace the possible origin of American frontier culture.    Anyone interested in frontier or colonial history should consult this work, as should anyone studying the history of ethnic diversity and racism in North America. This book is a particularly good supplement to David Hackett Fischer's Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, which considers localized seedbeds for four regional cultures. The authors repeatedly acknowledge the Indian contribution to the frontiersman's capability. The debt to Native America is clear. Sadly, the authors illuminate few particulars in this regard.     The scholarship is meticulous, the investigation fastidiously detailed. The authors were determined to prove their case; they have done so in a style that is both interesting and convincing.	2000-03-24

While Goodfriend discusses the English, her work is  stronger in considering the French Huguenots, and strongest in examining  the Dutch.  Her thoroughness is illuminating and her style entertaining.   <br />This book, however, does not encompass every ethnic group in colonial  New York.  For instance, the German and the African presence in the city  does not receive the same scrutiny as the French and the Dutch.  Goodfriend  does offer a portrait of ethnic interaction.

The life story of a woman from each of the groups considered lends character and definition to this excellent  scholarly work.  African-American women, Native American women, and  Anglo-American women in New England and the Chesapeake are among those  considered.  As New Amsterdam became New York, women of Dutch descent  experienced major changes in their legal rights.  Berkin's treatment of  this transition from Dutch to English law exemplifies her fascinating and  informative style.<br />The study ends with a discussion of women's lives  during the American Revolution, including the moving stories of women who  lost their fortunes or their lives in that struggle.  The biographies of  martyrs, however, do not eclipse a good discussion of the everyday lives of  women during the conflict.  Berkin also examines how the logic of  democratic revolution, strangely, did not extend to women's rights.<br />Berkin has made an indispensable contribution to colonial history,  women's history and ethnic history.	2000-03-23

Association was based on lineage membership; authority resided with elders of the extended  family.  <br />Some societies did exist which bound together people from  various families.  Hunting societies, for instance, initiated people from  different families, even different ethno-linguistic groups.  Political  authority and association, however, did not transcend the limits of family  allegiance.        Several movements and leaders did aim at establishing  authority that would encompass people from many families, and supersede the  authority of lineage heads.  Joseph Miller interprets the dreaded Imbangala  invasions, who terrorized Angola, in light of this objective.   <br />Many  kingdoms were established among the Mbundu.  On the eve of Portuguese  colonization, however, authority reverted from kings to lineage elders.   <br />Other works on Central Africa include histories by Phyllis Martin, David  Birmingham and John Kelly Thornton, as well as Miller's Way of Death:  Merchant Capitalism and the Angolan Slave Trade, 1730-1830.	2000-03-23

Angus does a beautiful job  in arranging these fragments to present an intriguing mosaic.  <br />Another  classic on ancient Mediterranean religion would be James George Frazer's  The Golden Bough.  For a more recent study, see Michael Grant, Myths of the  Greeks and Romans, which includes a discussion of the mystery religions.	2000-03-17

Essays cover peoples in various countries, including Ghana,  Nigeria, Somalia and South Africa.  <br />Spirit possession for many of these  peoples is not always or even mainly the demonic experience related in  cinematic portrayals.  In a study on Ghana, for instance, we read that the  possessed must be a person of known good character and respectability if  they are to receive the honor and authority of becoming the oracle for  ancestral spirits.  In many of the African cultures, spirit possession (at  least by the mid-20th century) was a phenomenon notable among women.  In  some cultures, possession helped balance power between men and women.   Women who might not otherwise properly speak out on certain issues were  permitted to pontificate if possessed by a male spirit.  In other cultures,  where the traditional (relatively) high standing of African women was in  eclipse, possession served to counter domination.  Those interested in a  discussion of that issue, and the ecstatic experience in general, might  enjoy I. M. Lewis's study, Ecstatic Religion.  <br />Recommended titles on  African religion include works by Edward Geoffrey Parrinder, Dominique  Zahan and John S. Mbiti. <br />For a discussion of the influence of African  religious experience (especially of the spirit) in America, see books by  Mechal Sobel, as well as Harold Bloom's provocative introductory essays in  The American Religion.

It is a great introduction to northern Ghana.  <br />Other ethnographies on Ghana that may  prove interesting include works by Madeline Manoukian, Eva Meyerowitz  (especially, The Akan of Ghana), David Tait (The Konkomba of Northern  Ghana), R. S. Rattray, Meyer Fortes, Ivor Wilks, Nehemia Levtzion, and  Esther Goody	2000-03-09

Martin, continuing the work of Franklin Garrett, offers a wonderful survey of Atlanta from 1940 to the mid-1970s.  Martin selects anecdotes to beautifully evoke each period he discusses--Margaret Mitchell  rallying recruits for World War II; youth reading comics in the basement of  a church-sponsored hangout; gawkers driving to a hippie enclave in the  late-sixties and early-seventies.  Martin draws heavily, but not  exclusively, from contemporary newspaper accounts to create a  richly-textured chronicle.  This is a vivid depiction of an era and a city.	2000-03-09

Religious rites and socialization in many African societies emphasize discretion, circumspection and stoic endurance of pain.  Initiation rites,  and other religious ceremonies, also emphasize the need for personal  regeneration.  Maturation and personal development are understood to  involve ongoing transformation.  Drawing heavily from post-colonial work,  including Zahan's own research among the Bambara around the 1960s, this  study is a great introduction to &quot;traditional&quot; African thought.   <br />Similarly interesting studies on the same subject are two works by  Edward Geoffrey Parrinder--West African Religion, West African Psychology.   Parrinder consulted earlier works on Francophone West Africa (e.g., Louis  Tauxier's study of Bambara Religion), but his research focused especially  on Anglophone Africa--the Ibo and Yoruba of Nigeria and the Akan of Ghana,  for instance.  Zahan's work was largely on Francophone Africa; his work is  only in English by translation.  The contrasts and similarities between the  two authors are illuminating.	2000-03-08

Wood describes the experience of Blacks in early South Carolina.  In the initial stages of colonization, planters welcomed the skills of Africans, encouraging Black initiative in many projects.  Some Africans herded cattle and cultivated rice and indigo, as they had in various parts  of Africa.  Eventually, however, landowners shifted to intensive plantation  development.  Planters then sought to limit the strikingly independent  economic pursuits of enslaved African-Americans.  Wood sets the stage for  the outbreak of the Stono Rebellion in 1739; he then chronicles the revolt  with a combination of magnificent scholarship and tremendous narrative  skill.	2000-03-07

Joseph C. Miller convincingly  reconstructs the Mbundu efforts to establish a broader sense of identity,  and a wider basis for political power.  Some traditional organizations  established a basic framework for organization that transcended lineage  affiliation.  Hunting societies, for instance, initiated members from  different lineages and even different ethnic groups.  Mbundu leaders  continually tried to legitimize even broader authority that would supersede  allegiance to extended families and encompass members of many lineages.   The Mbundu did establish many kingdoms.  By the eve of extensive Portuguese  colonization, however, authority and loyalty eventually reverted from kings  to lineage elders.  Miller offers great insight into political philosophy  and practice in West Central Africa.<br />     For studies of the same region,  see works by John Thornton and Jan Vansina, as well as various works on the  Ovimbundu (related to the Mbundu), and Miller's own The Way of Death:  Merchant Capitalism and the Angolan Slave Trade, 1730-1830	2000-03-07

Ornamentation, like  personal affects and shards of broken glass, in Southern graveyards reflect  Congolese religious heritage; baton-twirling, by Cuban dancers and Southern  cheerleaders, and jug bands in Louisiana reflect Congolese musical  heritage.  Other aspects of African-American and American Southern culture  reflect not only Congolese religious and artistic heritage, but Congolese  religio-political thought and practice.  Some rightly advise caution in  considering the consistency of a culture over several centuries.  This  work, however, is not only composed magnificently, but argued well and  substantiated convincingly.<br />For works on the same region, see books by  Wyatt MacGaffey, Jan Vansina, John M. Janzen and John Kelly Thornton, in  addition to other works by Robert Farris Thompson.  For similar themes of  African culture in America, with a stronger caveat against thinking a  culture does not change over time, see works by Mechal Sobel, Michael  Angelo Gomez and Melville Herskovits.  For studies of people from different  African regions brought to different American regions, see Philip D.  Curtin, The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census; David Eltis, et al., Routes to  Slavery; and Daniel C. Littlefield, Rice and Slaves.	2000-03-07
