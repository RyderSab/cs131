The subject matter of cyber dating and online communities was a great choice and needless to say interesting.  As we all know, cyberspace dating has become very common and there are many pros and cons.  More and more people are now interacting in the many online communities. Stormy placed the reader inside of the online dating game by showing very real situations that can come about when meeting  <br />a significant other online. <br /> <br />We are introduced to Kyla and Charles.  Kyla who is strong, single, raising kids, managing a career and a home, as well as searching for companionship.  Charles who is a player of players, but is missing something really important.  The other characters played a major role in the book, as they gave a true picture of the interactions which take place within online communities.  You get to see the drama so many people have experienced online, but also the networking that can evolve from meeting people in cyberworld. <br /> <br />Though Stormy did a wonderful job with her freshman novel, there were scenes I felt could have been deleted as they weren't really needed in the story. The book moved a little slow in the beginning because there was a lot of telling through narration and not enough showing.  The story picked up toward the middle and the pacing was fast thereafter.  Stormy gave the readers a slamming ending, making the reader yearn for more.  I can't wait to see what she has in store for us with her future works as she grows in her writing career. <br />	2005-03-05

No, this is not a story about Martin Luther King, Jr .. it's about living the life as Martin Luther King, Jr's child.  It reveals the ups and downs of being born to a public figure such as the late GREAT Martin Luther King, Jr.  Dexter does a pretty good job of showing us the hurdles he and his family have had to cross.  I think it's good for people to read, because you get to see what the family members are faced with (a sort of behind the scenes glance at being in the shadow of one's famous father).  Dexter also gives you insight on The King Center.  I recommend this read to all people.

Symone is a woman who is dealing with demons of the past haunting her:  living in chaos of the projects, a mother who has gotten caught up in the street life and who is unable to give her the nurturing she needs, the horrendous tragedy of waking up to an overdosed mother at a very tender age, being bi-racial, adopted, and being molested as a child.    <br />Symone not only told her story.  She allowed us to know her mother Dolores.  Although Dolores did not provide Symone with a stable home-life, we were able to understand Dolores as a woman placed in chaos and desperation.  We were able to travel with Symone through her present and past life with her adopted family the Hustons.  We came to know each of them.<br />Darnella has told a story which is rarely heard, but oh so desperately needs to be read.  With her poetic background and great storytelling style, she allows the character to take you through her present and past life.  You feel Symone's heartache; you feel her pain, confusion, rage, self-battles and battles with others, as well as her desperation.  <br />Darnella did an excellent job with her freshman novel.  This was truly a very different read.  The plot was very well put together.  I think everything she placed into the story was needed, because in reality there are many women out here who has and is going through what all of these characters faced and dealt with.  The characterization was great!!!  It was very apparent Darnella did her research before penning this unbelievable novel filled with psychological and sociological scarring.  If you have not purchased your copy, you need to do so today.   A very sad story, but again it really needs to be read and heard.  You will find yourself happy, sad, crying, angry, feeling everything each of these characters is going through.  What I loved the most was she was able toshow tremendous growth in the characters.  But, in the end you will understand how one is able to survive the cards life has dealt him/her.   <br />~Tonya Howard	2003-04-21
