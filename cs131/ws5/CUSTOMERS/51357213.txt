There are many disciplines that have to come together to make data warehousing work : database design, business understanding, management expertise, data mining, creating reports, project management, OLAP and more.<br />Finding a book that can full explain the full data warehousing picture is not possible, what one must look for is a series of books or materials that will together paint the full picture.<br />Building Dimensional Data Warehouses is one of the books that can help readers in the process of painting the whole data warehousing picture. Ralph Kimball is an experienced data warehousing leadder who has stayed away from hype and concentrates on facts.<br />The focus of this is book is creating the data structure for repositories in the data warehouse set-up. This is a highly recommended book for technical readers looking to enhance on their database design skills for building large data repositories that are optimized for providing analysis.<br />Business readers may obtain more value from reading some of the other of Mr. Kimball's books.<br />Please let me know if you have found this review helpful.	2003-09-25

The secret to a fulfilling relationship with an Oracle database set-up is knowing which stable Oracle release to use and the suitability with the operating platform.<br />Essential Oracle 8i Data Warehousing is focused on giving readers an objective understanding of using Oracle for implementing data warehousing repositories.<br />This book is better suited to technical users, who already have some understanding of Oracle, about to embark on the data warehousing process. This is not a book that is heavy on the side of data warehousing design nor dimensional modeling.

Seldom is a marriage of business and technical skills more necessary than in data warehousing implementations.<br />Many data warehousing books wax on the technical issues and requirements - such as data extraction, modeling etc. These are important and bring great benefits to any implementing team. However, till recently, there has not been a good book to follow through on the data warehousing implementation. <br />The business benefits and how it can be enhanced from data warehousing are discussed in Larry English's book. Many reader, will no doubt, have data warehousing implementations and will want to enhance the investment. This is the book for you.<br />Understanding the business is an almost primordial instinct that a data warehouse designer must have.

Recently I set out to find a book, on Meta Data, to accompany a presentation I was making to the Insurance Industry Association.<br />Business executives are concerned on return-on-investments for IT investments. Meta Data can be far removed from most executives mind share. <br />In my search for Meta Data reading material - I came across David Marco's book. Finally I found an author that can write effectively on Meta Data that addresses technical issues while answering questions that business executives will have.<br />It is very easy to get buried in theory with Meta Data - the challenge is to define an effective company-wide strategy that will increase efficiency and identify opportunities for further analytics. It is important to engage colleagues and built trust for Meta Data implementations. <br />Mr. Marco does an excellent job of discussing real-world Meta Data implementations.

But few comes as close as Alistair Cockburn's book in discussing Use Cases from practical experiences.<br />Developing Use Cases is not a difficult concept to grasp - it is the part which heavily involves the client and is one of the most critical moments in the software development lifecycle. The difficulty lies in developing Use Cases correctly and efficiently within the software development process. Few development teams have mustered this to perfection.<br />Mr. Cockburn's book gives excellent guidelines in the practical nature of Use Case development which tend to be omitted in most other books. I purchased this book for my development team and we found this a good back-to-basics reference guide for software development.	2003-06-25

Data Warehousing (DW) involves constant tweaking and the goal of good DW project management is minimizing the associated operational cost.<br />I have been a fan of Ralph Kimball as he writes as a person who has been through many implementations. With Mr. Kimball there isn't a miracle cure being touted - stay away from publications that claim such a cure.<br />Mr. Kimball approached the subject with good advices and encourages the readers to watch out for the pitfalls and follow best-practices in design implementation. It is similar to working with a well experienced supervisor.<br />The core to successful DW implementations is - LISTENING. Listening to the users on their needs and gauging the software resources available at your disposal.<br />Trade-offs in design versus cost/performance are a must. You will never have all the resources you need to implement the DW of your dreams. And if you did, chances are very high that once the DW is ready for use the business cases have changed making the design redundant.<br />Mr. Kimball will help in passing these information and much more. It also goes in good technical detail for suggested modeling of data. <br />I hope this review is helpful, please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.	2003-06-06

This is a one-in-a-million technology book that makes sense from multiple angles. Most UML books are written by researchers that tend to have a myopic view on a project's scope. My impression from reading the book is that Paul Reed, the author, knows the theory and is experienced at practicing this theory - a rare find.<br />This book fully encompasses a whole project view and succesfully involves/educates the reader.<br />Let me explain : It is challenging to develop a book that covers OOP, UML, Rational Unified Process(RUP), Java/J2EE, Application Servers/IDE etc. Also most publishers will not touch such a subject assuming it will narrow the potential readership.  <br />Having heap all the flatery, I must add some caution - to fully make sense of the book the rader must be somewhat familiar with some of the concepts - i.e. OOP, Java. Otherwise it can be hard to grasp.<br />I would recommend this book to developers/managers that wish to enhance their requirements process in software development.<br />In this book you can expect to visualise the role of UML in the full cycle of a project. The development process followed is RUP. There are nice background information on how to enhance the productivity of the development team in the design stages. The project discussed is a typical J2EE set-up - JSP, Servlets, choice of Javabeans and EJB, choice of Tomcat or BEA WebLogic and a Microsoft SQL Server (or Oracle) as the back-end.<br />I hope this review helps - please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.<br />Thank you.	2002-09-03

I found the book helpful, as with most of Scott's work, despite the sometimes redundant information. <br />Despite my cautionary introduction above, I recommend this book to developers and project managers. <br />In this book the reader can expect to find information on how to implement development processes with Agile Modeling (AM). <BR>This book discusses the processes for development - it does not go into the details on how to use the tools.<br />There is a comparison chapter on AM and XP which is helpful. AM, like all development processes, is a mixture of art and science. It is not carved in stone - although many may disagree with this statement.

Although I have been a follower of XP and have read David Astels works before, I was initially apprehensive on reading another book on XP programming.<br />One of the goals of XP is to be succinct and iterative - ironically I had difficulty finding XP books that had followed the goals of XP. My assumption is that many of the books have been rushed to publication.<br />&quot;Practical Guide to XP&quot; has many more plusses than minuses. There are actual hands-on examples, with code. About a quarter of the book is devoted to test and source code from an XP project. I am normally not a big fan of having complete source code from a project in a book - aside from making the book heavier it generally serves little purpose. In this particular case, it makes sense as the processes of XP can be &quot;followed through&quot;. XP is a development process/philosophy - as such it is better for newcomers to follow an actual implementation to fully appreciate the concepts. <br />This book will help somewhat to clear the fog on the many views on XP. XP, like all development methodologies, is a combination of art and science. There will be many views on methods of practicing XP and each project will be unique. This book will help you decide what you need to use for your particular project.<br />Hope this helps - please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.	2002-08-14

In addition Web Services is a very fast moving target, most publications cannot keep pace with the developments.<br />I was very impressed by how this book gives an \\"honest\\" overview of Web Services and cautions against making unrealistic promises. Additionally the authors are to be commended for not over-focusing on their employers Web Services strategy - the authors are mostly from IBM. <br />This book is mainly for people who would like a deeper introduction on Web Services and sink their teeth on a number of examples. As with most technical books on new technologies, one cannot expect all the examples to work as described. Also some of the instructions given are more complicated than necessary. I would recommend using this book in conjunction with online research.<br />Despite the cautionary paragraph above, I highly recommend this book. You will be hard pressed to find another book of this caliber on Web Services <br />P.S If you are very new to Web Services, a good approach is to reasearch online first. Discover the different approaches i.e. Microsoft and \\"the rest of the world\\". Then start with this book and another on Microsoft as well. Launching straight into the book could be confusing.<br />For the hackers, this book does not go in sufficient depth to start the next enterprise Web Services project. Nor does it compare the approaches with analogous specifications, e.g. CORBA<br />UPDATE - Sept, 2003 - I recently received an email from a reader asking for an updated opinion of the book.

There are definately nuggets of information that I find valuable - but these can be more readily accessible elsewhere - like in an O'Reilly primer. And beginners will be better served by reading a gentler introduction to Java.	2002-02-06

In 2000, I was strugling on loading Linux to my Notebook - most of the drivers were not recognized. There many agonizing days before it started to work - without modem support. And linux literature was disparate and difficult to come by. <br />Red Hat Version 7.2 makes things almost as easy as a Microsoft OS to newbies. And the book goes through the steps in extremely digestable formats. Red Hat support does not come along with the CDs - but this is not really necessary. The book covers the topics very well. And if you need to troubleshoot on areas not covered by the book, there are a wealth of info through google and deja.<br />Best wishes on your migration to Linux. It is a fun OS to use and the migration path is now, almost, painless.	2002-01-31

I find that the books he authors well written and delivers the critical information in a digestable manner.<br />&quot;Web Enabled Data Warehouse&quot; is not an exception. I would recommend this book more to beginners than to readers who are already familiar with Data Warehousing and fundamentals of the Internet. <br />Areas where the book does not have enough focus is on dynamically created pages and effect on Data Webhouse. <br />If you are already familiar with Data Warehousing there many not be much new to glean from this book. There are differences that are encountered with a Webhouse than traditional Warehousing but the info in this book will not necessarily bridge the gap.	2001-08-14

This is a great book to distribute in the company before brainstorming on the project. Ralph Kimball has excellent suggestions for steps in the implementation process. It is not too technical and this is very helpful for colleagues in other departments that will be politically supporting the project.	2001-04-09

It is helpful and recommended to people who have heard of Data Mining before and want to know more. This is not a book for those who are knowledgeable in Business Intelligence or Data Mining. <br />This book does not talk about CRM applications. CRM applications are in a constant flux and material on them are better served by online publications.	2001-02-12

This book gives a good quick overview without going in deep. <br />The other problem with writing a book of this nature is the danger of being obsolete even before publication. A fair bit of information is redundant, especially descriptions on companies and products.<br />The book can also be better served with a case study or two.<br />Overall a good attempt on a difficult subject. Being from a technical background, I did not gain much from reading this book. But I have found it useful suggesting this as recommended reading to non-technical managers who are contemplating Application Servers and EAI.	2001-02-11
