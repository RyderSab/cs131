But is she really what she seems? <br /> <br />Vanessa is really a compassionate, shape shifting alien who has managed to get through a porthole in time and jump from her planet to planet earth.  Her planet has been taken over by one who calls himself The DREADFUL EYE and now she is a wanted alien.  Taking on the form of a human woman on Earth she wants the tattoo artist to render her form visible to human eyes so that she becomes almost invisible to alien eyes. <br /> <br />But tattooing Vanessa is not going to be an easy task, not while there is continuous battle to be done with the groups of invisible men who arrive on earth to bring her back. <br /> <br />Despite his intentions the main character finds himself falling in love while on the run with the alien woman he tattoos, and when she is captured he finds his way to her planet to get her back, and to do battle with The Dreadful Eye who has his sights on conquering planet Earth next. <br /> <br />With the help of Aleister Crowley, Sir William Crookes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats and others, the main character just might succeed.  Set against the a backdrop of Victorian England and an alien planet, it's a fight to the finish for Vanessa...and for Earth. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book, it is definitely Science Fiction but the author has a lot of real places woven into the story, places in London England.  MacIntyre's writing is smooth and perhaps the biggest surprise was that this book is pretty funny in some places.  It's suspense and Sci-Fi mixed with a good dose of bitingly funny English humor.  I highly recommend it.	2005-05-13

Ok, so you want to write \\"your story\\", or create a character that surprise! is so very like you.  Or maybe you just want to start writing in first person present.  But you can't!!!  You try but it just doesn't come out right.  You resist, you tell yourself that you can't do it.  That you suck.  Well, perhaps you honestly do but before you start to believe it pick up this book. <br /> <br />I think that the real problem, for me anyway, when it comes to writing first person present or developing a character that has experiences based upon mine, is fear.  Fear of what might happen if I dare to dig into my life, my feelings. <br /> <br />What this book did for me was help me to get over that fear.  Or it at least inspired me and made me want to keep trying to write my truth.  It's difficult when writing like this to REMEMBER two things:  It's FICTION and no one HAS to see it but you.   <br /> <br />This book isn't dry and it isn't authoritative.  In a witty, conversational manner Nancy gives you reasons to write your truth, to get out of your way, to break the barriers that are keeping you from writing something real and honest.  Give yourself permission to feel and pick up this book!  I think you will like it ;)	2005-04-15

I guess I shouldn't rate it down for that though. <br /> <br />This is a huge, very gorgeous, very heavy book of photography by regional artists and photographic journalists. The pictures are divided up by countries and by the artists.  There  is contemporary photography, \\"artsy\\" stuff I should say, but then there are also vintage prints and photographs of just everyday life and events in Central America. <br /> <br />Why I was disappointed...I initially got this book because I was under the impression that there would be a lot of photographs, photographic journalism, documenting the civil wars in Guatemala and El Salvador.  There is very little of that in this book.  So I don't recommend that you buy this book if that is what you are looking for.  There is nothing about the war in Guatemala, and there is one very small section on the civil war of El Salvador with a few pages of photos, but I didn't find it to be very satisfying or moving.  It wasn't worth it for just a few pages.  Luckily I checked the book out from a library and didn't buy it outright. <br /> <br />This is no doubt a great book, it just wasn't what I was looking for.  I won't judge it on that though.  If you are looking for photographs and journalism from the civil war in El Salvador I highly recommend \\"El Salvador\\" by Larry Towell.	2005-04-15

You might even know that lack of land and racist policy drove the war.  But do you really know how it came to be and why? <br /> <br />This is what this book will do for you.  It will take you deep into the politics and events that led to the bloodshed that was most apparent during the 1980's.  It will reveal why Guatemala is still bleeding from this war.  It will show you why so many Guatemalans are for the most part silent about what really went down during that war. <br /> <br />Silence that spurred Daniel Wilkinson, a young Harvard graduate from the States, to hop on a ratty motorcycle and travel throughout the country interviewing countless numbers of people in a quest for the truth of what went on on the mountain, and why there has been silence there for so long.  This book isn't stuffy, it's not authoritative.  In fact, most of the time it is apparent that Wilkinson doesn't know what he is doing half of the time he is in Guatemela.  Which makes him very real as a person.  You kind of travel along with him, it's THAT good.  Wilkinson doesn't go for shock value in the retelling of his events.  His is a firm, quiet truth and he tells his tale, his experience in this book, focusing on why getting to the truth is nearly as horrifying as the truth itself. <br /> <br />Pick this one up for a better, deeper understanding of the civil war in Guatemala.  As you read it in your comortable house your perception on life just might change.  I know mine did.	2005-04-15

I highly recommend this book for a number of reasons. <br />If you are just starting to delve into the knowledge about Guatemala's tragic civil war this is the place to start.  What this is is an abridged version of the Human Rights report on the atrocities committed by the Guatemalan army.  This book is made up of two things: analysis and then personal testimonies from the victims.   <br /> <br />What it does for you is reveal that these crimes committed against the indigenous population went far beyond simply stated genocide and ethnic cleansing.  There was far more to the army's tactics than massacre and physical torture.   <br /> <br />The crimes against the Mayas were highly psychological and I think that this report reveals that and puts it clearly.  This book takes what you might already know about the horror and brings you in deeper.  By the time you're done you will have a more clear, more concise, more accurate picture of what was done by the army to not only affect these people but to also keep them in silence about a war that not too many people know about.   <br /> <br />It also shows why Guatemala is still so devastated by this war, and what it's going to take to ensure that this history doesn't repeat itself.  It's difficult in some places to read, but I think you need to.  As you sit in your comfortable house reading it, I think it will change your perception on life.  It did mine anyway.	2005-04-15

So I was a little disappointed to find that out.  Not that it cost me or anything, I'm just warning you.  Apparently there are two \\"Gifts of War\\" books out there, both by Larry Towell.  But THIS one is the program for the exhibit, it's not the book with the poems and the photographs.  So be sure to get the right one and probably not this one!<br /><br />This is a program-like item.  It's really thin without a real binding and cover.  I'm under the impression that it's something that was handed out at Larry Towell's exhibit of the actual photographs shown in this program.  Like it's a little reference guide, the photos are here and numbered and there is a little blurb on what it is you're looking at (on the wall).  So that was disappointing.  The photographs are good, but they aren't very big because supposedly you are looking at them on the wall.<br /><br />On the plus side there is a little bit of poetry and victim testimonies here, in the very back.  But that's it.	2005-04-15

I have just started learning about Feng Shui.  Before I was interested in it but thought it was much too complicated and dificult for someone who just wants to do it for fun.  It does look hard at first when you take numbers and direction into consideration.  But it's not, the basics of Feng Shui are very simple and with a book like this you will learn in no time!<br /><br />Hale goes over the Bagua, the funky octagon shaped diagram you've probably seen before but didn't know what it was!  Well it's a tool for Feng Shui and it's called a Bagua.  Each side represents an element, color, and a part of your life like work, money, romance, etc.  He breaks the Bagua down and makes it very easy to understand.  Think of the room you want to \\"Feng Shui\\".  Then imagine an invisible octagon  on the floor of this room, each side representing something.  How do you know which side goes where? Hale makes that easy.<br /><br />You discover what your \\"Kua\\" number is by adding the numbers of the year of your birth until you reach a single digit.  Then for men you take this number and deduct it from ten.  For women you don't deduct but you add five instead.  Once you have this number you can discover what directions are best for placing your bed, your desk, things like that.  Hale provides a list and all you need is a compass.  Your head should point in this direction and your desk should face this direction.  Once you know which direction is best for you, you can start with that \\"side\\" of the Bagua.  Then the other areas of the room, what place is what, fall into place!  And you can decorate accordingly and he offers suggestions and explains symbolism.  There are lots of tips and taboos in this book, like windchimes stimulate the good \\"Chi\\", no mirrors reflecting the bed, always have the door in sight, no open shelving facing the bed or desk.<br /><br />This is turning out to be much easier than I thought and very fun.  I highly recommend Hale's lovely book which is large and very illustrated so you can understand what he is talking about. He shows you how to feng shui a bedroom, entire house, garden, office, everything!  Just a really pretty book with good ideas.understand what he is talking about.

In this one the writing wasn't as annoying as it was in Amazonia, not the kind of repetitive dialogue there was in his last paperback.<br /><br />Ice Hunt is a thriller that is typical Rollins.  And adventure mission, a secret, and of course impossible ferocious man eating beasts thrown in.  I really liked Subterranean and Excavation but this one really dragged on.  The first third of the book was really good, but after awhile I got tierd of ending each chapter with \\"His time was running out\\" and \\"all went dark\\" and \\"He knew he would die\\".  That and \\"The russians are coming! The Russians are coming!\\" just seriously all the time.<br /><br />If this is going to be your first Rollins book, I recommend 'Subterranean' and 'Excavtion' first!  It will give you a chance to give him a chance :)	2005-02-05

A little less than a third of the book is what I was easily able to get through.  The writing was very good, it flowed, it was very witty and enjoyable.  But once the plot went into one large flashback of the lives of two of the main characters' time in the war I just lost interest.  It became pretty boring, almost like someone else had taken over the story and was writing it.  I really didn't care about those two characters anymore, I think that flashback really bogged down the story, though it might have been essential to the later plotline, I really don't know now :)  But I was bored with it and stopped forcing myself to read.

The title is extremely misleading, unfairly so. Like the formal review above says, this novel has some scenes in it worth of the best American Erotica award.  I was shocked and could have done without these trashy scenes.  I'm sorry but the author could have gotten her point across, about what makes these women shut down emotionally ater their experiences, without this kind of filth.  The title, the relious notes in the book, it all just doesn't mesh with erotica.  It cheapens the book and it's topic somehow.  I would expect this from a trashy romance novel, but from a book entitled \\"Altar Music\\", with religious themes, written by a former NUN.  I just felt very misled by this book, and I stopped reading ater the first third.  DO NOT get this for Grandma, you know what I mean.  I'm not a prude and I was offended.  The erotica was absolutely not neccessary.  I question the writer who feels she needs this in her toolbox.  I question the reader who needs this in their plotline for \\"understanding\\".

I really did enjoy the plot up until the arranged marriages of the two characters.  The secret woven into the story was compelling and made the book more interesting than it would have been without it, and the best thing was the two female characters being portrayed as strong, independent women.  From reading books like this one would swear that all Indian women are unhappy in their marriages, all Indian men are abusive and controlling, that kind of thing.  But this does not reflect a flaw in the writing and story itself so I guess I can't rate on that.  Strong characters and a strong plot make this worth reading.	2005-01-14

If you are new to Carroll's work STAY AWAY from \\"White Apples\\".  This one is very good, but it is a little out there, even for Carroll. Don't read it until you're ready or you will be turned off by him and that would be sad.  So don't start with it, it's a hard one. <br /> <br />Every Carroll book has an element of horror in it.  Not in your face horror either, the suspense and horror are not cheesy.  The horror is there, usually not until the last 1/3 of the book when you're pretty sure something is up but you have no idea where Carroll will take it.  I can hardly explain it, it's subtle, creepy horror, like \\"briefly come home, leave, but later glad you didn't turn on the lights because the axe murderer was standing right there in the corner\\" kind of horror. <br /> <br />In \\"The Land of Laughs\\" Thomas and Saxony have travelled to the hometown of their favorite author Marshall France, now deceased, in the hopes of gaining the rights to write an authorized biography.  While there Thomas begins to realize that some pretty darn strange things are happening in the town of Galen.  Things aren't quite right, the people aren't quite right, and they have been strangely welcoming and awfully anxious for him to finish his book.  This is one of my favorite Carroll books, the ending gave me chills. <br /> <br />Read this, you will not be disappointed.  This is Carroll's first book actually, and I highly recommend it, \\"The Wooden Sea\\", \\"Kissing the Beehive\\", \\"The Marriage of sticks\\" and \\"Bones of the Moon\\".  But yeah, start with this one :)	2004-12-18

I had never read anything by Tolstoy before, because let's face it, the man's novels are frightening. But Divine and Human is captivating and thought provoking without being boring or pompous. Perfect if you've always wanted to read Tolstoy, but simply don't have the will or time to tackle War and Peace.<br /><br />Divine and Human is a book of short stories by Tolstoy, it's thin and a pretty book, which is why I opened it in the first place.  I was hooked almost immediately.<br /><br />These stories are injected with Tolstoy's philosophy about life, death, god, and how all things happen for a reason.  My favorite story deals with God; in a coffeehouse men high up in their respective religions debate over whose God is best and whose views are right.  It takes a fable of the sun, told by a Confucian monk, to help them see that they are all in some sense, right.<br /><br />A great compilation of Tolstoy!  I'm debating over whether or not to give this to my Philosophy professor.  You won't be sorry you spent some time on this one!	2004-09-04

Do not buy this edition (pictured) for a person with failing eyesight. I have young eyes and thought I might go blind reading this one. The print is very small, the book would be twice the size it is if the publishers had used average print. And it would have been more enjoyable as well if there wasn't so much crammed onto one page.  <br />  <br /> I enjoyed this book, but I must say that it isn't as good as &quot;The other Boleyn Girl&quot;. Katherine is a classic I know, but it wasn't nearly as exciting or intriguing. <br />  <br /> The writing is very beautiful, and the book reads like a very well written, entertaining history novel. It chronicles the life and times of Katherine Swynford, with a special focus on her love and complicated relationship with John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. For those who don't know who Katherine Swynford is, an easy way of putting it is that she is a direct descendant of Henry VIII. <br />  <br /> But there aren't any hold your breath moments.

I must say that so far this is my favorite read of the summer.  I didn't know what to expect, the concept of a common history told by an uncommon character (Anne Boleyn's sister Mary) is touchy.   <br /> <br />But I loved it, for Gregory not only writes well, but she has quite an imagination.  I was impressed and intrigued by the way she took a history known to many, many people (we all know Anne's fate here) and made it fresh with murder and tons of dark little Boleyn family secrets. Mary, Anne's younger, obedient to the end, golden sister tells the tale of how the family gave, risked, and gambled everything, often at too high a price, to put Anne in the King's bed and ultimately on to the throne. <br /> <br />And I also love the way she has made Anne Boleyn out to be a complete monster in this novel, when she did meet her fate I have to say that I didn't feel too bad for her. <br /> <br />A must read for anyone who is looking for a great story!	2004-07-24

Which, for everyone out there who is tierd of a decent storyline bogged down with silly, meaningless sex and smut, is a VERY good thing.  This book tells the tale of the lives of a close group of women who are struggling to discover who they are and what they really want from their lives as they also contend with their identities as Latina women.  <BR>On the whole I enjoyed the story, it was humorous in some places and the writing was very smooth.  I got through this one in a few days and I must say that it was more serious than I expected, and this is why, in my opinion, it is not genuine chick-lit.  It is a few steps above that.  <BR>However, this seriousness is also why it gets four stars and not five.  As a Latina (I actually call myself Hispanic), parts of this book just hit too close to home for me to REALLY enjoy it.  I pressed on because I did like the story, but a book like this can make you feel uncomfortable if you can relate to the frustration these women feel when it comes to ignorant stereotyping of Latina women and Hispanic, Mexican, Spanish, WHATEVER roots.  The ignorance of some people in this world is seriously jaw dropping to me, and so seeing this true ignorance these (fictional but very real) women deal must deal with, particularly in their careers, was just really true and really frustrating. <BR>Also, I can see why some people would have a problem with this book because it DOES play upon some stereotypes itself.  For instance, this book does not portray Hispanic, etc. men in a very flattering light.  Nor does it seem to have much patience with first generation immigrants.  None of this really offended me because personally, I think they are pretty true.  <BR>But ANYWAY, do not read this book if you are Hispanic, etc. and are looking for a beach read.  Because this book might hit too close to home (like it did for me) and I guarantee your blood pressure will rise and for reasons of your own you might even start hyperventilating.  <BR>Like I said, great story, great writing, but too close to home for comfort.	2004-05-07

Which is no doubt why her Princess series and All American girl have been so successful and well liked.<BR>This book is absolutely fun, fun, fun!  I enjoyed it and I am on the brink (praise the lord) of exiting my teens.  This book brings back all the teen angst of a young girl trying to deal with life while attempting to come off completely sane as she does it.  Will she succeed?  <BR>I highly recommend this book for you if you are shopping around for a book to get a young girl.  It has everything, a cute President's son, slightly nutty but caring parents, snappy dialogue, action, frustrating \\"I'm totally stuck\\" moments, and yes, even Gwen Stephani.  Plus, this book is very clean so you need not worry about giving something inappropriate.<BR>Cabot is an absolute scream and if you have the time you should definitely read this book yourself!	2004-05-07

Mostly I bought it because I love Marian Keyes (trust me, her story in this one DOES NOT do her justice) but I really like this book for many reasons.<br />The stories are not chock full of [adult relations], strip teases, or other various corny, READ: laughable scenes.  I think this is a breath of much needed fresh air that definitely sets this \\"romance\\" anthology apart from any of the ones written by \\"American\\" women writers that I have attempted to read.  These stories just flat out rely on humor, wit, and charm, not CHEAPNESS to carry the plots.  Very impressive I think.<br />The stories were short.  Which is great when you are in a reading environment that gets interrupted a lot (like, say you are supposed to be doing your job for example).<br />The stories are cute and very well written.  Ok, I wasn't impressed with some of them, but the majority are very well written, quick reads that are cute, sassy, and totally fun.  Don't worry about actually falling asleep on the job with this book.  This might sound stupid, but the style of these Irish women writers makes their stories flow well.<br />Pick up this book as your next romance anthology read, or any light read for that matter, and PLEASE skip the Kasey Michaels and the Lori Foster anthologies!	2004-05-07

I was like, ZZZZZzzzz this is boring, why torture myself.  But then, months later I picked it up again and finished it.<BR>Simply put, if you stick with this book and make it past maybe the first ten chapters you will (hopefully) be hooked.  If you are not hooked then I suggest dropping it because, for you anyway, it will not get better.  This book is excellent but hey, if it's not your cup of tea that's ok too.<BR>For those who stick it out for awhile you will see the genius in Faber's language.  It is so smooth and floaty and just gorgeous.  I think it's meant to be savored, page by page, so I don't recommend reading this book in a day even if you are capable of it.  <BR>In my opinion Faber's characters could be more rounded out but you do have feelings for them almost right away as they deal with the tortures in their lives; be it unrequited love, mental illness, difficult pasts, or maybe just drunkeness.  <BR>Faber's Victorian England setting only adds to the beauty of this book, and I really didn't mind any of the technical flaws in either the characters or the plot, because his writing more than made up for it.  <BR>The ending was a little bit fuzzy and did end abruptly, but that is really true to the title don't you think?  Personally I thought that was cool.<BR>Take the time and savor this book, if you like the classics and literature in general, the chances are good that you will find your money and your time well spent on this book! :)	2004-05-07

I thought that maybe it would be unbearably fluffy, and while Mia is a sarcastic smart aleck, the observations she makes about her life and those around her are actually pretty intelligent and downright funny.  <BR>Mia is a typical angst ridden teen who wants nothing more than to blend in with the woodwork, snag the hottest guy in school, and pass Algebra.  But before she knows it her world is turned upside down when her infertile (something Mia DEFINITELY does not want to know) Dad announces that he is the Prince of Genovia and that Mia is now his sole heir to the throne.  While the man is infertile, he is not crazy.  He is very serious.<BR>So now Mia is a princess with paparazzi, a bodyguard, and people with ulterior motives.  Plus she is NOT passing Alegbra and there is a boxer-clad teacher in her kitchen.  What is a girl to do?<BR>Read this book to find out!  It is aimed at a young adult audience, but I really found the humor in it and I mostly stick to literature.  And it's clean enough to let your kid read it without fear.  I will definitely hunt down the sequel!	2004-04-07

Richard is an ordinary, do gooder who loves his comfortable life where nothing unexpected, unplanned, or unpleasant occurs.  But once he helps a girl from London below (another world that literally exists below the London Richard lives in) Richard finds that he is pulled in and no longer exists to anyone from his previous world.  Making it back is going to be hard, but surviving the trip is going to be nearly impossible.  And unfortunately he has teamed up with a group of people who each have their own agendas.  One wants revenge, one wants to kill a savage beast, and one wants to fufill a long standing debt.<BR>Gailman does get tremendous points for originality and imagination.  But for me anyway, that is all he gets.  I was disappointed with Neverwhere.  Gailman is supposedly close to Jonathan Carroll in his writings, but if you are going to read this book hoping for someone like Carroll, don't bother. <BR>I think the main problem with this book is that its premise is so fantastic, outrageous, and vivid that the characters and Gailman's writing style simply cannot measure up.  All of this is happening so fast to them and it is so fantastc that they cannot keep up.  <BR>And so the result is flat characters, flat dialogue, and a pretty flat writing style.  Gailman does not flow very well, and he is nowhere near the literary style of Jonathan Carroll.  The plot just seems to be forced on the characters, like they are just going through the motions and doing what Gailman wants them to do.  <BR>    The only redeeming thing about this book is Gailman's fantastic imagination.  The whole concept of this book and the effort it took to conjure up some of the outrageous images hints at his talent.  But that's about it.  It's a good concept, but as a writer Gailman cannot carry it.	2004-03-20

I hesitate to call this chick lit because I believe it is a bit more serious than that.  Which is a good thing!  :)  The book has a very serious vein in it, near the last third of the book.  Which was very surpising to me, but the author made it work.<br />Eve is an intelligent, together thirty something who has run the gauntlet of bad men and has still come out of it with not only a good man, but a good job and best friends.  Yet she can still hear the biological clock ticking and, after over a year with Michael, belives engagement and marriage are not only the ONLY  options, but the most logical ones.

I recommend it because it is such a small book with such a huge message.  Eddie, the main character, has grown old and, carnival ride repair man that he is, he feels as though his life has not been of much use to anyone.  It takes a tragic accident, an arrival in heaven, and a painful journey once there to make him believe otherwise.<BR>  <BR>Five people from Eddie's life have been sent to tell him about his life and what his actions on earth meant for them during their lives, and how Eddie fits into the big picture because we are all ultimately connected to eachother.  The story is soooo good because the fact that Eddie didn't really know some his &quot;people&quot; personally during his lifetime makes for some awesome twists and just reiterates Albom's concept of how we are all, knowingly or not, connected.<br />The ending was a good one, and Eddie's fifth person will surprise you!<br />What Albom has to say in this book is somewhat original and definitely powerful and inspiring.  But what makes this man a genius is that he does all of this in 200 pages.  I mean, imagine that.  If you have tried to get a start on a book, or collect your thoughts, or written an essay even, you know how hard it is.  Albom's story is just wonderful.	2004-02-21

With her curves and overall maneating charisma, Clarissa Alpert is woman who is a bit smarter than she comes off (much like Jessica Simpson).  Going after what she wants with a selfish, but somehow innocent mentality, whether it be a handbag or a man, makes this character endearing.  Yet despite everything she's got, Clarissa does not have Mr. Right, and the diamond encrusted biological clock is ticking.  <BR>  <BR>Enter the man she sets her sights on.  An up and coming Hollywood &quot;it&quot; producer.  Clarissa knows that this man has everything...except her.  As things progress Clarissa gets to shop for wedding gowns, rent halls, choose the food, basically plan a fantastic wedding with all the trimmings.

Some weirdo Linguist sets out to teach his dog to talk so it can tell him if his wife's death was a suicide or not.  Is he crazy?  Desperate? <BR>  What I really loved about this book was the way things were written.  This was good writing, and I really liked how the author put in all of these little whimsical incidents in the relationship between Paul and his wife Lexy that really showed that they loved eachother and were a good fit.  I think that without those, Paul would be just another grieving widower, and Lexy would be a crazy woman who jumped to her death from a tree.  By knowing all of the little things these two went through and did for eachother, it made their relationship something special, and so I felt for Paul and Lexy more than I would have if the author didn't do such a good job of portraying them as two people with a deep (a little bit odd yes,) love.  I really wanted Paul to find out the truth, poor guy.<BR>  I also liked the twists in this book, there are only a few chapters left and I was like &quot;What's going to happen next?&quot;  From the very dark to the light, to the plain weird, Parkhurst has constructed a story that will not leave you bored.<BR>  As for the animal abuse issues, I do think that they were very graphic and disturbing.  But WITHOUT them I don't think this book would have the weight that it does.  I don't think this book would make its readers feel.  The dark side of animal linguists that Paul goes in to are an example of how desperate he really is.<BR>  The only thing I wasn't clear about was the book's title.  So that bugs me a little that I can't make the connection there, but anyway I highly recommend this book!	2004-02-13

I am just a beginner at yoga and I love this book because the instructions to the different asans (poses) are clear and understandable, AND the more complicated poses are explained through drawings and photos, not just text.  You don't need to keep track of all the steps in your head as you move into the pose, it's all there in a series of drawings.  So if you are a very visual person, I recommend this book.  This book takes you through the most basic of asans to the most complicated.  It has all kinds of drawings and photos, as well as chart-like things at the end of each section with a simple outline of the pose and a picture so you can put together your own yoga session.  This book also has background on Yoga and things like diet and breathing.  Some of the models are so lithe they are gross looking, and some of the poses will make you say &quot;Holy Hell!&quot; to yourself, but secretly you will want to learn to do them too.  A great book!	2004-01-22

If you did not like the movie you really shouldn't rate this BOOK poorly.  It is considerably better than the movie and fills in the gaps and explains behavior that would otherwise come off as just pointless and weird.  Also, I just want to stress that you have to look past any technical holes in the plotline.  If you get hung up here you are missing the point,  which is that Kathy and Behrani are two very alike people who refuse to bend and understand one another.  As a result of their selfishness and inability to understand, they end up losing everything.	2004-01-12

If you read literature and other big people books, chances are you will like this one.<BR>  At the center of this book lies a one story bungalow in California, siezed from owner Kathy Niccolo by the county after she does not pay a business tax.  Unfortunately the bills were never hers to begin with and mistakenly sent to the wrong address.  But by the time the country acknowledges its mistake, the house has already been auctioned off to former Iranian Colonel Behrani.  <BR>  The Colonel has immigrated to the states after revolution erupts in his country, he and his family barely make it out with their lives.  Forced to take numerous blue collar jobs to provide his family with the kind of royal living they are accustomed to and still running out of money, the Colonel decides to invest in Kathy's house and quadruple his money once he sells it.<BR>  So the battle over the house begins.  Kathy is desperate to get her father's house and her stable life back.  A recovering alcoholic and drug user whose husband has recently left her, Kathy's life was beginning to come back together prior to her eviction.  <BR>  The Colonel is deperate to keep the house, as he is nearly broke and has his name and pride to think of.  He hates the fact that in America he is no one and no one cares who he was before.  He needs the house and the new life and status it symbolizes to him.  <BR>  Whether the county situation over the house is beliveable or not, you have to look past that and more into what Dubus is trying to portray.  He does a good job of telling a story about two people who cannot understand one another, thrown together because of a situation that never should have happened.  A situation that ultimately destroys what both have worked so hard for.<BR>  Dubus writes beautifully, and while I enjoyed his physical discription of things, the one problem I had with the book was that he felt the need to describe each and everything his characters did in detail.  This got a little tedious at times, and I admit I did skim when this happened.  I could have done without the sex too, but in my opinion that was a very minor thing.<BR>  The last few pages of the book were a little disappointing, but I did enjoy the buildup to the ending.  It was a twist, it was unexpected, it was tragic.  I had heard from some other reviewers that this book does not have a happy ending and I kept wondering how Dubus was going to make a tragedy out of only twenty or so pages.  Well he did.  Wow.<BR>  Buy it, borrow it, or check it out from the Library.  Just read it.  A little bit of discipline yes.  Regret, definitely not.	2004-01-08

I have yet to be sorry, so thanks everyone! for their reviews encouraging me to read it.<br />  At the center of the story lies the Stark family in the North, who are tied very closely to the King of the Iron Throne.  The books title pretty much sums up the very basic plot.  Who should continue to sit on the Iron Throne is a matter of dispute between several houses, and continues on in the next book &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;.<br />  A few of the reviewers here are disappointed with the book because of its lack of fantastical elements.  I agree with them, there is little fantasy here in the way of dragons, magic and things like that.  The places are obviously made up, but that aside I think this book reads like a historical fiction novel.  It's very political and this coupled with the overall missing fantasy is what made me really like this book.<br />  I also think it is really clever of Martin to switch points of view throughout the book.  Each chapter deals exclusively with the thoughts and situations of a different character (Martin has several he switches out) as they struggle with not only political problems, but personal ones as well.  This form of writing manages to keep the plot working smoothly.<br />  If you like lengthy, disciplined reading that isn't literature, then you will probably like this book.	2004-01-08

I was more impressed with it than I thought I would be.  The entire package is intersting and informative.  The cards have poses that can easily be achieved by beginners, which was what I was looking for.  The kit also comes with a blue yoga strap that is fairly durable.  The cards are orange with the poses and their names in white on the fronts and an explanation of how to achieve it on the back.  Overall I like this kit, the one bad thing I can think of is that the picture on the front of the card is not always explained clearly on the back, or isn't really that pose at all, only sort of in a vague way.  So that gets confusing, but other than that I enjoyed this kit as a present to myself.	2003-12-26

I decided to give this book a shot though because I had just gotten into practicing Tarot, and the title of the book interested me.  There is a little bit of tarot mixed up in here, the heroines grandmother practices it, and the Prince of Cups card follows every chapter.  So that was kind of neat.  <br />Besides that I enjoyed the writing and the plotline, both were sophisicated enough to hold my attention, there were actually big words in this book, ha ha.  And I also liked the fact that a few real-life historical figures showed up in the storyline, for instance the Borgia family (Lucrezia in particular) makes an appearance, as well as Niccolo Machiavelli.  This is a quick read, it is fast paced and enjoyable, without being ridiculously goofy.  <br />I really recommend this book for anyone who proclaims to hate this genre!	2003-12-05

Like the other two books it has everything (adventure, romance, humor) with a bit more suspense.  <BR>     The book continues with the adventures of Phedre and Joscelin (a cross between a bodyguard and boyfriend I guess) with a ten year gap between the previous book and this one.  The exiled woman who betrayed them both is back, sending word to Phedre to help her find her missing son.  Believing that the boy has been used as a pawn in a highly political game, Phedre goes in search of him only to find that his kidnapping is part of something much more simple, yet far more sinister.<BR>     So she goes after him, deliberately travelling to a far away, hell on earth place that she knows she may very well never escape from.  Just when you think &quot;shes dead for sure this time&quot;, Phedre escapes and gets what she wants (because she always does).  Still, wondering how she will do it makes for great reading.  Some of her experiences in this place are truely awful and graphic, so that might be a put off if that bothers you.<BR>     You definitely could start with this book and not be too confused, although I recommend that you at least read the second book before this one because it is important to understand the political circles Phedre runs in, and why exactly she risks her life for the son of a woman she despises.<BR>     I love this trilogy, mostly because it has an amazing female heroine.  Plus I love the ending of each book, which always revolves around a huge &quot;homecoming&quot; party, where things are said that wrap up each book nicely.	2003-12-04

I bought this deck as my first beginners one because I didn't like the artwork of some of the other beginner deecks (Raider Waite, Robin Wood).  The backs of the cards are bright blue with white stars.  This deck has completely illustrated minor arcana cards with objects and people (besides just the ten pentacles or the three swords) so you can learn the stories of these cards.  This helps when it comes to committing them to memory.  Unlike the Raider Waite deck, the illustrated minor arcana are not as extremely detailed, I liked this because it wasn't distracting and I didn't feel overwhelmed with too much side information about each card.  I really like this deck because of the bold lines and colors to the illustrations.  It suits my personality perfectly!	2003-11-28

I ran High School track and cross country and understand the bonds you form with the people on your team.  And so I thought the author did a really good job placing those bonds and emotion into the story.  The author can tell a good story and I enjoyed his very physical descriptions of the running life and felt that they were very real, believable, and inspiring.  I also really felt for the main character (something every good book does), and liked the fact that he grows and learns from his pain.  He is anything but a flat character, which is refreshing.  I am convinced Jackson has run high school track and cross country, and if he hasn't he has been extremely close to the sport to the point where its in him as much as it would be otherwise.<BR>     This is a great running book, though I'm not sure I would recommend that you buy it for your running kid because of some of the language.	2003-11-18

I would not recommend this book if it is your first one by Keyes.<BR>     Keyes is a scream, an absolute sarcastic scream.  I usually love her because of her wacky outlook on things.  Her books are hysterical, but at the core of them they take on very serious issues (drug use, alcoholism, depression, difficult childhoods), which I think is why Keyes is so successful in the realm of chick lit.  She's the perfect blend of humor and seriousness.<BR>     I have read everything that she has written so far, and have to admit that I was a little disappointed with Sushi for Beginners.  This book is not one of her best ones, and after reading her latest paperback (Angels) I guess I expected more.<BR>  In this book her characters come off flat and whiny.  Lisa and Ashling are trying to get a new Irish womens magazine off the ground, and the basic premise of the book revolves around their trials.  Clodaugh, the other woman, is a friend of Ashlings who is terribly unhappy with her marriage and kid filled life.  <BR>  More than once I found myself wondering what the point of the story was.  Keyes is a good writer, and the story isn't bad or anything, its just a little flatter than a lot of what she has written before.  Her characters usually start off as either depressed or silly people who evolve throughout the book to become better, deeper, self fufilled ones who learn about themselves and what is really important in life.  Lisa and Ashling get there eventually, but with two chapters left in the book it was too late.  Only a teeny bit of true Keyes tried to shine through at the very end.  And while I did laugh out loud a few times, Keyes trademark humor is overall missing from this book.  <BR>  I'm not sure why this is.  To me, her best books have been those that involve the Walsch sisters (Watermelon, Rachel's Holiday, and Angels), so maybe that blend of family humor is what shows Keyes at her best, maybe its what her books need.  Because this one and \\"Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married\\" are both not Keyes' best at all. <BR>  So read one of the Walsch sister books or \\"Last Chance Saloon\\" before \\"Sushi for Beginners\\".	2003-11-04

Whether or not you feel inclined to join the ranks of the Wacky Chicks, you will definitely enjoy reading about the courageous and resiliant women Doonan profiles here.  They are absolutely hilarious with their sassy approach to life that is uninhibited and yet clean.  I think they are the women every woman wants to be, though most of us lack the courage.  Not only are these women funny in their own right, but Doonan's writing style is equally entertaining.  He has that kind of snappy \\"humorous gay guy\\" quality to him that is really funny without being too stereotypical or campy.  I really liked this book and recommend it for anyone with an inner Wacky Chick.	2003-10-31

If you make it past this point you won't be sorry, for the book (and its sequels) is fast paced from there on out.  I usually don't read fantasy but I really liked this book because enough of it was believable and it wasn't too campy or wacky.  Not only is Carey a great writer, but her plotline had EVERYTHING in it.  Romance, action, adventure, suspense, with some sex thrown in.  A lot of these reviews mention the scenes of masochistic sex Phedre (Fay-dra) actually takes pleasure in as maybe being too graphic for some readers to enjoy.  In my opinion they weren't all that bad, and lacked the usual corny and pointlessness most sex scenes in books have.  I recommend this book and the two that follow! Phedre is such an amazing female, not only is she horrendously clever, but she's like Houdini the way she manages to get herself out of impossible situations.  I don't know who would be fitting to be cast as her in a movie, but Orlando Bloom would be the perfect Joscelin (even though this would be like resurrecting Legolas) and I thought of Rena Soufer whenever Melisande appeared.	2003-10-31

The concept is fun, the dialogue is witty.  But I think part of the problem is that there isn't enough of it.  Too much of the book is Jane's thoughts, and this wouldn't be so bad if she wasn't so hyper in her thinking.  Rather than humorous, Jane just comes off anxious.  Her anxiety was seriously making me anxious as I was reading, and I think paragraph after paragraph of her thoughts tended to just bog down the story.  It was just too much.  I think this was why I kept skimming the paragraphs of Jane's thoughts (which in some cases was pages).<BR>  If you want a single-something story with witty dialogue AND hilarious thoughts (but not overly anxious ones!) I would recommend &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; by Sophie Kinsella, or &quot;Watermelon&quot; by Marian Keyes.	2003-09-05

Her plots and characters are complicated enough to be fairly believable and keep me interested, while still making the book light reading.  Some of the dialogue is a little bit cheesy in some places, but overall this is the book to read if you tend to stay away from historical romance.	2003-08-06

Fairly light reading with enough suspense woven in to keep me interested.<BR>    I know these authors have recieved a lot of criticism from readers who think the series has gone on long enough, or who think the books themselves are too simplistic.  But I think maybe they are supposed to be this way.  <BR>            The general public does not read at a college level, and the way these books are written make them all the more accessible for everyone.  If the plotlines and characters were more complex, and the theology not comprehensible for anyone without background in theology, or if these authors had come up with just one large book, I believe this would have been a turn off for those already Christian, and those who aren't but are curious.  <BR>          I think these authors have done a very good job with this series.	2003-08-06
US	35711400	RSFD1LNPPVWSC	0142001740	378345448	The Secret Life of Bees	Books	2	3	3	N	N	Nothing extraordinary	This was a good book, however there are many good books out there.  There wasn't anything about this particular book that made it stand out from any other feel good story.  In some places the wording was very lyrical and ejoyable to read.<br />  However the story itself is nothing original: Setting-The South.  Main Character-Young white girl with an abusive parent(s) Plot-She manages to stumble upon the one person who seems to care about her.  Most likely this person is a) a woman and b) black.  Or in this case it is several women.<br />  If you were really into this sort of story I would suggest reading &quot;Before Women had Wings&quot;, or &quot;Ellen Foster&quot;.  Kidd's book basically follows the plotline of these two books, and I think these are a little bit better than this one.	2003-08-04

Even I tend to skim a little bit.  But I really liked this book, unlike the others I feel that it had more action to it and was almost like the \\"climax\\" book in the series.  The anti-Christ really starts to crack down in this one, and I think that is what held my interest.  In his desperate attempts to curb criticism and build his following, Nicolae only succeeds in making even his devout followers doubt him.  And this only provides the background for multiple suspense and action scenes that involve the Trib Force as they work against him.  When I was done I said \\"Wow.  That was a good book.\\"  And it's hard to say that with all the trash out there.	2003-08-04

This book is not meant to be taken too seriously! I was entertained by Miranda and Andrea BECAUSE they were on such extreme sides of the scale.  That is what makes this book so entertaining.  I also found myself smiling at the mannerisms of fashion know-alls James and Nichol, and the author also incorporates the attitudes of the doormen, nannies and drivers which I thought was a nice touch.  Some reading should just be fun, entertaining, and relaxing, and this book is exactly that.	2003-08-01

I liked this book, for a chick-lit girl Carrie is refreshing as she isn't obsessed with shopping, getting a guy, losing weight, or otherwise revamping her entire life.  Unfortunately this also makes her rather high strung.  But her character does makes this book enjoyable.  I liked how the author takes everyday situations and makes them amusing.  Carrie's observations on life are maybe a little more analytical than most people's, but at some point we all think about the hypotcrites in the world or what a \\"date\\" really consists of.  And at some point we are all in the city.  Lonely.	2003-07-26
US	35711400	RAZR7STM9DOMJ	0380820293	543757976	Last Chance Saloon	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Keyes' best!	I love this book, and don't think that it is typical chick lit.  It is a little deeper than just single girls out trying to get themselves out of debt, lose weight or trap a man.  In fact, Katherine hates men, Tara won't leave the one she's got (even though she should) and Fintan loves the one he's with.<BR>  The characters were well developed, they wittily talk and spar like only best friends can.  And they change as people by the end of the book.  Fintan becomes sick and calls in favors from Tara and Katherine, &quot;challenges&quot; he calls them.  Ones that will change their lives...for the better.<BR>  A great book about friendship.  Once you have read this one, read Keyes' other books, specifically the three that each deal with one of the four Walsh sisters.  Claire in &quot;Watermelon&quot; is my other favorite.	2003-07-26

Would you love them anyway?  Would you leave?  Would you risk leaving your safety net?  Could you deal?<BR>  These are the questions Carrie finds herself meeting when her high school sweetheart is paralyzed after...well, a dive from Clausen's pier.  <BR>  I liked this book because the situation seemed real to me, and I think the main questions this book addressed were ones we have all thought about (not to be morbid) at some point in time.  Whether you agree with her or not, the choices Carrie makes are what make her human.  The writing held my attention and the flow to the plot was very smooth.  I highly recommend this book.	2003-07-26

The book gets points for presentation, it is pretty and the photographs were excellent to use for examples.  Honestly though, if you are looking for the basics of Henna I would just recommend going online and doing research there.  There are tons of knowledgable people out there with their own sites.  I didn't really learn anything from this book that I couldn't have found online.  Use toothpicks to apply your henna (it takes longer but I think it's less messy than cones) and make sure you put STRONG black tea in your mixture.	2003-07-26
US	35711400	R195Z38MS4N96J	0060008032	568824372	Angels	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Angels	This book is better than &quot;Rachel's Holidy&quot; but not as good as &quot;Watermelon.&quot;  Still, it was hilarious in typical Keyes deadpan humor fashion.  It's like she takes everyday observations one has always thought about and turns them into laugh out loud words.  <BR>  One of the reasons why I love the characters in her books is because they are shamelessly witty and fun.  If this is your first Keyes book, Maggie Walsh (the main character) is just one of the four sisters Keyes has written books about.  Claire &quot;Watermelon&quot;, and Rachel &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; are the other two, and I sure wish Keyes would write a novel about the bratty, youngest Walsh sister Helen, who makes several brief, bitingly funny appearances in &quot;Watermelon&quot;.<BR>  <BR>  Lastly, in my opinion Keyes best book isn't any of the ones dealing with the Walsh sisters. &quot;Last Chance Saloon&quot; is one of my favorite books.  It's about three best friends and when one of them becomes very sick, he gives the other two challenges that he calls &quot;favors&quot; and makes them swear to him that they will change their lives...for the better.<BR>So after Angels, be sure to read it!	2003-07-25

The author can effectively tell a story.  However, I could not get into the main character at all.  In my opinion the author did a good job of making Ina out to be a whining, selfish woman who, if in the back of her head knew that the married/children life was not for her, should not have made the choices she did.  No one is to blame for her unhappiness but herself.  Yes, her husband is a rat, however throughout the book it was as if Ina's main problem was not her husband's infedelity but rather her unhappiness with who SHE had become. The woman was unhappy because she chose to be.  Throughout the book she complains almost non stop about the dredges of motherhood, but what did she really expect?  No one forced her to &quot;give up her dreams&quot; and no one forced her to marry her husband.  And only a selfish person would leave her children for one week after her husband leaves her (as if they haven't been abandoned already.)So while I enjoyed the writing, I really did not like the main character.	2003-07-11

The only thing that kept me going was Carroll's words, he writes beautifully and so that made the book enjoyable.  What I didn't particularly like was thinking I FINALLY had a grasp on what it was he was talking about only to have the plot take a 180 turn.  So I was getting frustrated with Carroll for about the first half of the book.  If you choose to read it, stick with it.  This book will grow on you and you will want to keep it so that it won't fall into the hands of someone who won't appreciate it.  It's difficult at first, but I give it five stars because of the writing.	2003-06-28
