US	49784014	RRY5E9EEXLIKA	0385510454	797048445	The Broker: A Novel	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Good Read	I've been hooked on Grisham since reading The Client and The Firm in one weekend. I was a bit disappointed in The Summons, but had my love of Grisham's writing rejuvenated by The Painted House. Anyway, about The Broker. As a previous reviewer noted, The Broker falls back on Grisham's tried and true formula of a \\"sympathetic character, intrigue, and a chase leading into a good ending.\\" <br /> <br />My only disappointment with the book is the detail of life in Bologna. I suppose one could say the same thing for his details of Memphis in earlier works, but for some reason, my interest in the culture, language, and restaurants of Bologna did not work for me. Grisham's attempt to portray a book with international intrigue reminded me of a Ludlum novel-which I enjoy immensely, by the way. The Bourne Identity comes to mind.  <br /> <br />Grisham fans can buy this book with confidence. It's a good tale, with plenty of life threatening circumstances and a hero's use of his brains to escape the danger. <br />	2005-02-28

I'm not a historian, but found the book very readable. Its 900+ pages present an in-depth analysis of the history of North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, leading up to the rise of Islam. Interestingly, Lapidus reveals the rise of Islam did not happen in a sudden, broad sweep, as I had been led to believe. Rather, Islam was adopted by Bedouins, merchants, etc. one tribe and village at a time. According to Lapidus, Islam has been marked with internal strife from the beginning when numerous civil wars over doctrine, leadership, and interpretation of the Prophet's message, led to the division of the faith into its Sunni and Shi'a sects. It is an incredible story that every westerner should read. The book covers the periods prior to Mohammed's revelations through the 20th century, and is divided into three parts: <br /> <br />The Origins of Islamic Civilization: 600 to 1200  <br />The Worldwide diffusion of Islamic Societies <br />The Modern Transformation <br /> <br />As a Christian, I found the depiction of Christianity's role in the Middle East, especially in the early days of Islam, interesting. Lapidus is a noted scholar and has done us all a service by writing this book. I highly recommend it.  <br />	2005-02-28

Jared hypothesizes that societies collapse due to both eco disasters, and an apparent disregard for the cause or resolution of these eco-disasters. This book is not strictly an environmentalist's look at society and its interaction with nature; rather, Jared strives to illustrate the erosion of our infrastructure and standards of living as indicators of this coming demise. In this sense, the book is prophetic. Jared analyses the causes of collapse among ancient societies, from both an economical and environmental perspective, and connects their demise to current circumstances in our own. <br /> <br />I recently traveled through a rural portion of South Carolina and seen examples of Jared's thesis for myself. I noted entire communities gutted by lack of economic opportunity, farm fields abandoned, grain elevators and tobacco barns rusted and idle, and downtown areas empty. It was depressing. Where have the people gone?  In another example, my hometown in Southern California is dead. The once vibrant chemical industry is defunct, due to availability of similar products from Peru and Canada. My hometown failed to adapt to changes in the trade laws (NAFTA) and now finds itself unable to produce and sell a product, which sadly represents the bulk of the town's income. Naturally, people migrate out, and now Los Angeles County has recognized the town as a Godsend for cheap housing for welfare recipients. What a way to go. <br /> <br />Jared's message is disturbing, but at the same time he discusses how some societies managed to meet the challenges of population growth and economic and environmental transformations in a constructive manner. The information in this book appears to be well researched, and Jared's writing style makes it highly readable. <br />	2005-02-07

Schaub talks about finding deals, negotiating for better terms, using agents, managing your properties, and protecting your key assets. The paragraphs below briefly discuss three of his key points.    Schaub's chapter on learning how to work yourself out of your day job hit home with me. Isn't this a goal we all share? Schaub's plan is easy to understand, but not necessarily easy to follow. In my action plans, I first wanted to be able to pay my electric bill with income that had spun off my investments. After reaching that goal, I wanted to pay my phone bill, car insurance, etc. I kept working to build investment income sufficient to pay my bills. Eventually, I reached a point where my investment income has almost equaled my work income. I'm using the bulk of my work income to make investments. Schaub suggests using your investment income to replace your need to work. I suggest you keep working, and use you work income to make bigger investments.    Schaub's entire thesis rests on the concept of buying quality properties that you manage and control, and striving to pay them off within a ten-year period. When you approach retirement, theoretically you will have the income of these properties flowing into your bank account. This is a great idea, and certainly doable; however, maintenance, tax, and insurance expenses will never go away. So don't forget that maintenance alone may eat up to 40% of your gross income. Insurance and taxes will eat another 10-20%.    Schaub talks about owning property out of town, and this is important info for all investors. Your main concern is control. I learned my lesson the hard way here. I owned a home free and clear in a different state. However, my property manager seen to it that every month I had a significant maintenance costs, such as $325 for removal of used stove. $459 forremoval of tree roots from pipes under house. Month after month I put up with these outrageous costs, that I would have handled for pennies if the home was within a hour's drive of my home.     Schaub suggests you Focus on making small deals that you can understand and control. For example, a small investor can earn sufficient returns from several single-family homes in good neighborhoods, without having to negotiate for malls and apartment complexes, or get over your head in partnerships and complex land development deals.

The cashflow quadrant is represented by four squares, where the E square represents Employee, S equals self-employed, B is business owner, and I is investor.    The interesting point is that while many self-employed people see themselves as business owners, Kiyosaki believes a self-employed person is somebody who owns their job. A business owner is somebody who controls a business, but is not tied to its day to day operations. For example, a doctor is self-employed, and is limited in his ability to grow in wealth by his ability to work, while not being able to replicate himself. The owner of a service company, on the other hand, is able to hire a manager, build control mechanisms, and esentially leave the day to day operations to others, while collecting portions of the profit and being free to build other businesses.    This book is highly readable and takes off where the first Rich Dad, Poor Dad ended. I recommend this book to any aspiring wealth builder.

I guess I'm more of a Robert Allen type of reader in that I want to see creative wealth building ideas, coupled with unique strategies.    Sadly, while this book is very well written and certainly serves a purpose for older people approaching retirement, much of the information did not seem suited for my dreams. For example, this book discusses, taxes, IRAs, 401(K), building home equity, and obtaining life insurance as the main ingredients to wealth creation. A bit pedestrian, in my opinion.    If you are looking for this type of info, buy the bok, you won't regret it. However, if you are looking for some entrepreneurial oriented, business start-up type info, look elsewhere.

No Problem!: A Low-Stress, High-Velocity Guide to Writing a Novel in 30 Days	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Motivating	Baty is a hilarious writer, who uses his keen sense of humor to motivate aspiring writers to work their tails off to get the first draft of a novel onto paper. The idea of writing 50,000 words in a 30 period seems ridiculous, and Baty admits the finished product is a long way from being publishable. However, the method to his madness is to find a way to compel the writer to put his or butt in the chair and start writing. <br /> <br />Basically, the book comes down to two premises: turn off your self-editor during the composing of your first draft; and, set definitive time and production goals that challenge you to put words to paper. <br /> <br />Like his suggested one month of production, this book is about 50,000 words long, and is highly readable. The first half of the book is dedicated to encouraging you to give the outrageous project a try, and the second half is broken into a chapter for each week of the month long writing project. Whether you actually commit yourself to trying this or not, the lessons of shipping your self-editor off to boarding school for a month, and challenging yourself to actually put some words down on paper, are highly valuable.

Here's a lady who loves reading more than eating, and thinks making beds is a waste of valuable writing time. I could live with a person of these values. <br /> <br />What a great writer, and some great ideas. In this book Dr. Sellers takes a no-nonsense approach to excuses for not writing and encourages aspiring writers to use the same 24 hours granted to all mortals to write for 10 or 20 minutes per day. She teaches you how to focus on your writing, finding quiet time, and accepting the solitude so important to writing. Also, I love her love of reading. Throughout the book she uses the metaphor of reading and writing as lovers. According to Sellers, writers read, and in fact often sleep with their books. I warmed to her imagery here, as I often bang an elbow or my back on a hardbound book left in my bed. My personal favorite bedtime book is an old one, Jean Christophe, by Romain Rolland. This book was written around 1910 and is over 800 pages. There is something about Rolland's writing that sets my imagination drifting into unexpected places. Sellers legitimizes this compulsion of mine, and advises the writer to let your writing flow with your imagination. Sellers also uses some yoga analogies in this book, but the book is not about yoga. I know nothing about yoga, except what I may have learned from David Carradine in the 70s TV series, Kung Fu. It is not a distraction, and illustrates her points well. <br /> <br />Sellers does not present actual writing instruction in this book, that is not her purpose here. She is highly readable and offers a ton of ideas for inspiring people to drop the excuses and start writing. <br />	2004-12-17

The story takes place in Michigan, during the Depression, and depicts Bud's struggle to survive while searching for his father. I won't give away the story, but the end result is different from what you may expect. The story is highly readable, and as far as Newbery type books go, is entertaining.     Bud's \\"Rules for a Better Life\\" are funny, in that they depict a child's interpretation of events around him. For example, recognizing an adult's willingness to help as a means of getting information to use against you. The \\"rules\\" provide a break in the storyline and offer some comic relief to some otherwise tense situations.     Bud's situation reminded me of \\"The Journey of Nattie Gann,\\" in the aspect of a young person crossing the country alone, dealing with Hoovervilles, railroad cops, and hunger. This book ended too quickly, as I wanted to hear more about Bud's life and how he made out.     Bud, Not Buddy is a good kids' story, suitable for readers aged 9 and up.

In this book she uses her knowledge of the publishing business to help writers gain an understanding of the publishing process. The book is divided into two parts: Part One discusses issues specifically related to writing (although this book does not get into actual craft techniques); Part Two discusses the publishing process itself. More specifically, Lerner includes a detailed look at the types of writers, namely the ambivalent, neurotic, and self-promoting types. In th epublishing part she discusses agents, editors, dealing with rejection, and the book publication process. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book that I found both informative and inspiring. Lerner uses extensive quotes and anecdotes from successful writers to illustrate and reinforce her points, and her writing style is very approachable and a joy to read. For example, on page 87 Lerner states: \\"No matter how much you think you deserve attention...the work will prevail or fail on its own merits at the end of the day.\\" The book is not focused on any particular genre, and is valuable to any writer, fiction or nonfiction.  <br /> <br />Similar books which I would recommend for the aspiring writer include: \\"The writer's Book of Hope,\\" by Ralph Keyes, and \\"On Becoming a Novelist,\\" by John Gardner. <br /> <br />Ron Atkins is the author of two children's books, Abby and the Bicycle Caper, and his upcoming (January 2005) Abby and the Bike Race Mystery. <br />	2004-11-29

Gardner does not go into specific craft techniques in this book, but his detailed discussions on the writing process, dealing with publishers, and overcoming rejection are essential reading. The foreword to this book, written by Raymond Carver, is 8 pages long and is very good-almost worth the price of the book itself. Gardner states in his preface, page xxiii, \\"I try here to deal with, and if possible get rid of, the beginning novelist's worries.\\" No single book can discuss everything a writer worries about, but Gardner does a good job covering the main points. Gardner does not focus on any particular genre in this book, and in fact, genre writers may be a bit frustrated by his focus on the mainstream novel, and writing for the sake of art, over commercialism. However, his ideas are worth looking at by all of us. <br /> <br />Similar books which I would recommend for the aspiring writer include: \\"The Writer's Book of Hope,\\" by Ralph Keyes, and \\"The Forest for the Trees,\\" by Betsy Lerner. <br /> <br />Ron Atkins is the author of two children's books, Abby and the Bicycle Caper, and his upcoming (January 2005) Abby and the Bike Race Mystery. <br />	2004-11-29

This book specifically discusses: dealing with anxiety, frustration and despair, overcoming the discouragers in your life, exorcising excuses for not writing and pursuing a career in writing, the rites of rejection, the nature of publishers and editors, and how to keep hope alive. <br /> <br />Years ago I had a basketball coach who taught \\"if you're not getting at least four fouls in a game, you're not playing defense.\\" He didn't like fouls, but his point was, in the process of playing the game aggressively, fouls are going to happen. Fouls are not necessarily indicators of defeat, they are indicators of effort. Likewise, Keyes' approach to rejection is that all successful writers deal with rejection. In his book he provides numerous examples, including Nobel and Pulitzer prize winners, of authors who face rejection even after winning critical acclaim. Rejection is a fact of life, Keyes say, learn to deal with it. Easily stated, but it still hurts. According to Keyes, writers who have not experienced rejection are not sending out enough material; and, writers who don't learn to accept rejection as part of the writing process, are doomed to quit writing altogether. <br /> <br />Keyes is the author of another book titled \\"The Courage to Write,\\" which I highly recommend. Similar books by other authors which I would also recommend for the aspiring writer include: \\"On Becoming a Novelist,\\" by John Gardner, and \\"The Forest for the Trees,\\" by Betsy Lerner. <br /> <br />Ron Atkins is the author of two children's books, Abby and the Bicycle Caper, and his upcoming (January 2005) Abby and the Bike Race Mystery. <br />	2004-11-29

The author presents a detailed description of each poem, with a discussion of its cultural significance and the meaning of each line in the poem. For example, the death poem: <br /> <br />Clouds drifting off: <br />The sight of <br />Moonlit heavens. <br /> <br />In this poem, the reference to clouds refers to the Japanese belief that floating clouds symbolize the life of man. The author of this poem died in August, which is a traditional month of moon viewing in Japan. <br /> <br />While the title sounds grim, in Japanese culture death poems are a celebration of death, written by the person who his facing his or her own mortality. Death, in this context, is a transition to another life form (in my opinion). In addition to the poems, the author presents a beautiful discussion of poetry in Japan, and how it relates to their view of death. The book contains poems from Zen monks and famous haiku poets. <br /> <br />Another poem that appealed to me as a writer: <br /> <br />I write, erase, rewrite, <br />Erase again, and then <br />A poppy blooms. <br /> <br />Ron Atkins is the author of two children's books, Abby and the Bicycle Caper, and his upcoming (January 2005) Abby and the Bike Race Mystery. <br />	2004-11-29

The original object of the game was to come up with the biggest insult of another person's mother, or other family member, while keeping your cool. The first person to lose his or her temper was the loser. <br /> <br />This is a hilarious book, and Percelay has several others like it.

The format is interesting, although it poses some material early on that is fairly daunting. The introduction to this subject I received by watching the 4-hour PBS production motivated me, however, to push through the tough stuff. As it turned out, the authors used the first chapter as an overview of everything, then used subsequent chapters to expand on individual concepts presented in the first chapter. I would have preferred the first chapter at the end, allowing the Preface to suffice as an introduction to the material. You may want to try reading the preface, then skipping ahead to the second chapter, saving the first chapter for last. This may keep you from tossing the book aside before giving it a fair chance. Just a thought. The title \\"Origins\\" threw me because I assumed it focused on Darwin's theory; however, this book is more than that, and combines elements of astrophysics, biology, and geology to describe how the universe was created, and the possibility of extra-terrestrial life. As Sagan would say, there appears to be billions and billions of opportunities for life in the universe. <br /> <br />For the serious scientist, I would further recommend: Steven Weinberg, author of several books on the subject, including: the \\"Quantam Theory of Fields\\" Volumes I and II, and \\"The First Three Minutes.\\" Also, B. Reed's book \\"Quantam Mechanics: A 1st Course,\\" and Brian Greene's \\"The Elegant Universe,\\" seem to be popular. These books give a more detailed, math-heavy version of Origins. <br /> <br /> <br />As an amateur scientist, rather weak in mathematics, I am happy with the depth of studying Origins, and enjoyed the color photos in this book. Carl Sagan's books \\"Cosmos\\" and \\"Billions and Billions\\" are good supplements to this book, written at a similar level, approachable by non-scientists. <br />	2004-11-23

As an orphan she is sent to America to live with an aunt and uncle. As the story develops, Karina finds herself enrolled in a school (by court order)that requires participation in flying ultralight airplanes. The author demonstrates a thorough knowledge of flying, although forcing a kid to learn flying seemed a bit much. <br /> <br />The story is told is third person subjective viewpoint, giving the author a lot of room to use interior monologue with the lead character. This seemed appropriate, as the premise of the story deals with a young girl's survival and adaptation to a tragedy that has turned her world upside down. I was a little unsure whether this book was meant for adults or young adults. The issues of the young girl in trouble at school placed the book in the young adult category, but the writing level, word usage, and most of the dialogue, seemed to put it in the adult category. Either way, it is an interesting story and deserves more attention than it appears to be getting.  <br />	2004-11-23

Books	5	2	2	N	N	Insightful	This is a heart-warming collection of over 70 personal stories told by children of various ages, about their hopes and dreams for peace, equality, and a bright future. Among adult writers and political leaders, these subjects sound clich and overdone; but, as told by the youngsters in this book, the subjects are fresh and invigorating. The book is divided into three sections, featuring stories from 4th , 8th , and 12th  graders. <br /> <br />One elementary school student was asked what he would want to tell adults. His answer: \\"I want them to know that they're not bad kids. They do pay attention in school. They can do some stuff that adults can.\\" In other words, we as adults can learn from these children that not every kid is bad, failing in school, or incapable of learning. Amidst all the negative media about schools, violence, and drugs, it's good to hear a positive message from the kids themselves. Marcel Proust wrote a book called, Remembrance of Things Past around 1910. I was amused to read a sentence in it where a woman is lamenting the \\"slovenliness\\" of young people these days. That was almost 100 years ago. And in the Holy Bible, Jehu was chastised by his father for racing his chariot through the village. The so-called problems of our youth are nothing new. Be of good cheer and read and learn from the kids around you. You can start by reading this book. <br />	2004-11-19

It is said that a bumblebee only flies because he doesn't know that he can't (aerodynamically speaking). Likewise, professors are notorious for destroying good reads in what I would call a paralysis by analysis. That said, this book plays a role in educating those who choose to analyze literature, but spare me the superlatives. The book is not \\"engaging\\" or overtly \\"humorous,\\" as the publishers would have you believe. <br /> <br />I must admit however, that the book did open my eyes to some fairly obvious elements of literature that I knew intuitively, but had never consciously applied or analyzed. For example, literature is full of symbolism, motifs, archetypes, heroism, etc. Most avid readers are aware of this, but reading about it and learning how to recognize it in some of its more subtle forms was enlightening. Foster also postulates that a writer is impacted by everything he/she reads or learns, as it is \\"impossible to write in a vacuum.\\" I thought that was fairly obvious, but I suppose it was good to hear. <br /> <br />On the more negative side of things, I disliked Foster's attempts to be conversational. For some reason it just didn't come off. This book is about learning how to analyze and interpret literature, not trying to become my friend, or convince me that the author is a nice guy. I was also bothered by some of the repetition of examples. In a world replete with outstanding literature, Foster seems to be fixated on Toni Morrison. Call it personal, but I can't stand her writing. Also, if one more jokester tells me to practice to get to Carnegie Hall, I think I'll puke. <br />	2004-11-19

Where else can you get 1900 pages of health info for about $25? I work with doctors on a regular basis and find the information in this book essential to both presenting a patient with an ailment to a doctor with my opinion regarding a diagnosis, and in understanding the official diagnosis the doctor presents. The drug interaction information is also good to know, and may save your life. Any time you are prescribed a medication you should read this section and identify any potential risks or interactions your doctor may have overlooked. I work with doctors daily, and these things do happen. <br /> <br />The best part of this book is its organization, which is understandably important when you have this much information to organize. For example, there are specific sections of the book that discuss cancers, digestive disorders, family planning, etc. The entire book is divided into several hundred chapters, and the book includes a detailed appendix for additional resources. However, be advised that internet references in the appendix may be outdated, as this type of information changes so quickly, a book cannot hope to keep up. As an added benefit, when this book goes out of date, you will find it makes an excellent door stop. <br />	2004-11-19

However, if you enjoy reading novels similar in style to Dickens and Trollope, you will be enthralled by the detail, humor, and complex plot of this story. It is true that Clarke over uses footnotes, and sometimes I felt I was reading a treatise on the Napoleonic Wars; however, the footnotes also add to the details of the story and provide an in-depth look at the topics relevant to the story line, and the writing style Clarke uses duplicates the typical writing styles of 19th century England.  Also, this book does not present the typical Tolkien motifs of sorcery, as in the 3 m's (myth, magic, medievalism) that many of us have become accustomed to in this genre. There is also not a blatant quest, as in Tolkien or Rowling's stories. <br /> <br />If you want to read a detailed, rather slow moving, but invigorating story, I recommend this book. I would not recommend this book for young adults. <br />	2004-11-10

The book is a compilation of popular low-carb recipes from the Akins Center, and is written by the wife of the late Dr. Robert Atkins. It is printed on glossy paper, which is great for use in a kitchen environment, and many of the recipes are complemented by full-page color photos of recipe presentations.

Colonel Walden is right on the money. Busy forklifts do not translate into effective or efficient supply operations. Careful use of economic order quantities, re-order points tuned to demand levels and demand forecasts, and a focus on ensuring the 20% of inventory items that account for 80% of your transactions are always available, is what matters. Also, forward deployment of assets where possible to cut down on ship times to the customer is important. Colonel Walden gives you the facts.

At first I thought she may have been referring to the World Trade Center, or the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Either way, the event itself causes the heroine to be left in her country home to fend for herself. She refers to herself as \\"Green\\" because she loves nature and has a near magical intuition for gardening and animal husbandry. The prose is beautiful, and while I found the subject matter depressing, I enjoyed Hoffman's use of language. She is a very good writer. The majority of the story is an internal dialogue with Green. You will not find a single quotation mark in this book, as the very limited use of dialogue is actually Green's retelling of the events in her mind. <br /> <br />Hoffman introduces Green in her normal world, surrounded by family and her gardening routine. At the onset of the apocalypse she enters another world, so to speak, and even changes her name to \\"Ash,\\" which is reflective of the burned up world around her. Gradually, as a year passes, she is figuratively reborn as a new \\"Green,\\" as she accepts a new normalcy. In a sense, this story is a \\"hero's journey\\" story. The book contains about 10,000 words and is suitable for young adults, aged 12-16. I honestly can't see most boys enjoying this book-although that will be their loss. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-29

Normally, I don't bother reading children's books written by celebrities, but this series of books is funny, lighthearted, and full of the nonsensical humor of the Fonz. In the beginning he describes his 4th grade hero, Hank, as the \\"world's best underachiever.\\" Hank abhors school essays, so instead of writing about Niagara Falls, he builds a working model of the falls and brings it to class for show and tell. The resulting disaster lands him in the Principal's office. According to the authors Winkler and Oliver, \\"The hall is a only place when you're sitting outside the Principal's office.\\" <br /> <br />This book is ideal for readers aged 8-10. It uses silly, irreverent, classroom humor to tell the story of a young boy who enlists the aid of his classmates to keep him out of trouble. This is one book in a series of similar stories, and promises good reading for both parents and elementary school kids. As an aspiring writer for children (Abby and the Bicycle Caper), I found this book entertaining and suitable for family reading.  <br />	2004-10-26

I did not rate this book with 5 stars because it is presented as an \\"Administrator's Companion,\\" which I felt was stretching it a bit. As a previous reviewer has stated, there are better alternatives for strictly \\"desk reference companions\\" to Exchange; however, I was pleasantly surprised by how readable the book was, given that it is a Microsoft Press publication. <br /> <br />For example, on page 9, the authors define policies thus: \\"Policies are collections of configuration settings that are applied to one or more Exchange configuration objects.\\" The authors continue to define various policies in pretty basic terms. On page 268, the authors describe how to create a policy using step by step directions: \\"To create a server policy, right click the Systems Policy container, point to New, and then choose Server Policy.\\" The instructions are also accompanied by extensive screen shots. While other reviewers found the screen shots redundant to the narrative, I feel comforted by the screen shots that match my screen when I am attempting to implement a procedure by following the text. <br /> <br />The book begins with an introductory chapter that provides a good review of the uses and concepts of Exchange, but is probably a waste of time for experienced users of Exchange. The following chapters include detailed instructions relevant to: planning, deployment, upgrading and migrating to 2003, functionality, security, maintenance (including disaster recovery and troubleshooting), and a fairly decent glossary. The authors also invite commentary and suggestions to their email sites: benglish@networknowledge.com and books@walterglenn.com. Both authors are MCSE and MCT certified. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for those new to Exchange or preparingfor the Exchange Server exam. Administrators looking for a thorough desk reference on the subject should try Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 24seven, ISBN: 0782142508. <br /> <br />	2004-10-22

Its clever use of the word \\"meat\\" in its title grabbed my attention in the bookstore, and its 275 recipes promises a wide variety of experimentation in the kitchen. Roberston uses a lot of tofu and eggplant as substitutes to meat. Prior to reading this book, I ate eggplant about twice a year, always breaded, fried, and fattening. You had to cover my fried eggplant in Louisiana hot sauce to make it edible. As for tofu, I ate it occasionally, sliced, fried and boring, and usually found it rather tasteless and rubbery. Robertson has rescued me from both of these self-inflicted culinary disasters. <br /> <br />The derivation of Robertson's recipes are Asian, Chinese, French, Latin, and what is now becoming known as \\"New American.\\" She uses ginger, garlic, and sot sauce as the base for many recipes, and teaches you how to cleverly turn mushrooms, green beans, and eggplant into some pretty good meat type dishes. I eat meat because it makes my feel satiated-that is, I enjoy the flavor and texture of meat, and the fat tells my stomach I have eaten. Vegetables can be disappointing in all three of these important aspects of eating. But, I have to honestly say, with Robertson's help, my argument for eating meat is weakened. I'm working against generations of cultural conditioning relevant to my insistence on eating meat, and with Robertson's help, I hope to one day free myself from its shackles. Time and experimenting with Robertson's recipes will tell. <br /> <br />One of the best aspects of this book is the simple ingredients contained in the recipes. I live in bit of a provincial type town, where exotic vegetables and spices are hard to come by. I'm not a chef either, but found the instructions fairly easy to follow. I recommend you add this book to your collection. <br />	2004-10-21

Regardless of the politician's party, the response was unanimously in favor of this trend. The mantra in the 90s was that outsourcing allowed Americans to specialize in the high tech jobs, while leaving heavy industry and low skilled work to the third world nations. Some predicted we would all eventually be doing each others' laundry and buying each others hamburgers, which is gradually becoming reality. However, until Lou Dobbs came out with this book, I counted him and his network among the elites supporting outsourcing. I am happy to now read that Dobbs is advocating some type of restraint in the outsourcing of jobs, although I am a bit suspicious that his current diatribe on the subject may be related to presidential politics <br /> <br />Regardless of politics, Dobbs is right. Why do we allow unfinished timber to be shipped out of Coos Bay, Oregon by the bargeload for finishing in Japan, when an entire milling industry in the U.S. was gutted to make it happen? Why do we create customer service call centers in Asia, when there are thousands of English speaking people right here that could do the job better? And, why do we continue to perpetuate the myth that outsourcing is good for trade? Ask yourself this: What can a consumer in China, who earns a few bucks a day, lives in a hut or government housing project, and lives off a handful of rice a day buy from America, a Hummer? Dobbs is right. Outsourcing is not so good for trade and the U.S. as once believed, and the hemorrhaging of our economy needs to stop. <br /> <br />People talk about how America needs to learn how to compete on the global market. This means reducing our standard of living to offer products at competitive prices. Labor is just a portion of this cost. Most of the manufacturing powerhouses today, China, India, and the garment producers of Sri Lanka, the Middle East, and S. America do not have the labor laws or product liability concerns we have. Should we compromise our standards in hiring, pay, and liability to compete? <br />	2004-10-13

Typical of Da Vinci and Angels and Demons, this book portrays characters deciphering codes to save the world, assassins attempting to kill of the academic heroes, and villains working from the inside. <br /> <br />The depiction of the National Security Agency in this book sounds credible, although it's hard to judge, as the NSA is by nature very secretive. I trust Brown created much of the detail, which I accept as this book is after all, fiction. Brown did a good job suspending my disbelief, and while I had a fairly good idea how the book would end by about the halfway point, I enjoyed reading it. The last few chapters string the suspense out well, although some of the reviewers here felt that part was overdone. <br /> <br />This book is not up to the level of Da Vinci and Angels and Demons, and it does not invovle religion to the extent of his more popular titles. This suspense/thriller is more along the lines of a Clancy novel, so people should not buy it expecting the inside look at Catholicism they may be accustomed to with Brown. The book deals with U.S. intelligence operations and code breaking, excusively. If you ar enot into military/CIa type intrigue, don't get this book.	2004-10-12

This is a sensible diet that makes sense and works for most people who are not metaboically resistant. Eating six small meals a day rather than 3 large ones is a good idea, and tends to match the Zone diet in this area. Balancing carbs with protein is also a good idea and matches several other diets out there. The author advises you to eat oatmeal in the morning for breakfast, but you need to be aware of something: first, make sure you buy the old fashioned kind that takes about 5 minutes to cook. Do not eat that instant stuff. Second, if you eat a massive dose of carbs, as oatmeal contains, for breakfast, you can count on being ravenously hungry witin about 2 hours as your body compensates for the spike in your sugar levels from the carbs. <br /> <br />Fianlly, this book is really not about developing great abs. It's just a catchy title. If you lose weight, your abs will naturaly look better. Buy this book if like me, you benefit from the constant encouragement found in reading new diet book--but overall, stick to a basic plan of sensible calorie consumption, avoiding stupid carbs found in sodas and candy, and get some exercise.	2004-10-04

Shirley Jackson introduced the horror genre to numerous themes and concepts (almost like motifs today) that Stephen King has also capitalized on, such as having stones fall on a house (Carrie and Red Rose), an overpowering mother who controls a telekinetic child (Carrie), a large house/hotel isolated in mountains (Shining), a house/hotel that wants a specific person (Shining), use of a scrapbook and/or news clippings to provide historical background (Shining), etc. In this 1959 thriller, Jackson presents the horror of a haunted mansion in the hills that is desperate to claim the life of the heroine. There is no gore or mayhem in this book, but Jackson succeeds in scaring you without it. Typical of Jackson, as in her Lottery story, the ending does not wrap things up cleanly, and leaves the reader's imagination to fill in the details. The first paragraph of this book sets the scene and may be considered one of the best openers in horror fiction. Good stuff. <br /> <br />Several caveats however. Shirley Jackson wrote this book in the 50s. The text has long passages of exposition, is short on dialogue, and frequently delves into the minds of its characters, with viewpoint shifts and tense changes that may confuse the less attentive reader. The book is fairly short, around 50,000 words, as opposed to the 100,000 typical of a King novel. The book is well worth reading, but you will have to work to read and enjoy this story. <br />	2004-10-04

I mention this because their success in this area establishes their credibility in writing a book for those aspiring to write and publish children's literature. Their book \\"Mermaids Don't Run Track\\" served as an inspiration for my first children's book, \\"Abby and the Bicycle Caper.\\" <br /> <br />The premise of this book is that children's stories must be well crafted and tell an engaging story to attract the attention of the young reader. Children are bombarded by a variety of entertainment mediums, and it is up to us as writers to produce a product capable of competing with television, sports activities, and video games. I think all of these activities are fine for young people, within limits, but children in the 5-12 age range can be taught to make reading a part of their daily lives-provided they have quality and entertaining reading material placed before them. <br /> <br />The bottom line: Jones and Dadey are good writers.

The story is introspective and gives insight to the tangled mess created in the mind of a child who experiences and witnesses abuse. As in Dave Pelzer's \\"A Child Called It,\\" the book is not easy reading, but stretches a person's knowledge of child abuse and its impacts, without having to actually experience it. I believe this is why we read--to live other lives vicariously.	2004-09-29

I don't know if Raimondo's theories are correct or not, I only know that the book was an interesting read and he presented some intriguing propositions. I hope history will prove him wrong because the alternative is too frightening to consider. <br /> <br />This book does not blame Israel for 9/11, but it does propose that Israel's intelligence was more proactive in identifying the threat to America than our own intelligence was. The million dollar question here is of course, If Israel knew 9/11 was imminent, did they attempt to notify the U.S.? Using information available to any citizen, Raimondo assembles a preponderance of evidence to support his hypothesis. I would recommend this book to anybody who considers him/herself informed. I wish Raimondo would have sent a copy of this book to the 9/11 Commission. <br />	2004-09-28

Each death is cleverly disguised as an accident or suicide, which leaves you thinking, \\"How will they ever catch this guy if they don't even know to look for him?\\" <br /> <br />This is an excellent novel which I found intriguing and well worth reading. It is a mystery and a psycho-thriller combined. I have been reading a lot of James Patterson and Dan Brown lately, so it's good to find another writer of mystery and suspense on the horizon. <br />	2004-09-28

I have not seen this book in my bookstore, and can only hope people will now order it from Amazon and read it. Don't let this book sit on the bookshelf collecting dust. I have have long since read my copy and passed it on to a neighbor. <br /> <br />The left oriented media in this country have given Michael Moore a pulpit to preach his anti-Bush and anti-conservative America position, now thankfully there is a rebuttal of some of his falsehoods. In particular, the authors dissect Moore's various works, identifying specific examples of blatant manipulation of facts and historical revision. Moore is a comedian, who unfortunately is being taken seriously by poorly informed voters. God help us all if guys like this are our future. Read this book and get the facts. <br /> <br />Other books I would recommend: Unfit for Command, and The Enemy Within. <br />	2004-09-27

Emeril compiles approximately 150 of his favorite recipes in this book, sort of like a \\"greatest hits\\" collection. If you have plenty of other Emeril books, you may already have these recipes. <br /> <br />The book includes the standard fare of: appetizers, soups, salads, brunch, pasta, seafood, fowl, beef, and desserts. My biggest disappointment with this book were the photos. There are approximately 30 color plates in the center of the book, with the remainder being black and whites. The photos don't give clear images of food presentation, and in fact appear to be more people oriented than depictions of food. Do not buy this book to place on your coffee table to show off. It is however, a practical cookbook with recipes comprised of commonly available ingredients. When I placed this book on my countertop I had to weight down the pages to keep it open. It is on the small side, and would not hold open as I followed a recipe. The pages are printed on coarse paper (not glossy), and are not resistant to spills or other things typical in a kitchen environment. <br /> <br />Overall, Emeril fans should buy this book. If you're looking for a pretty coffee table book, look elsewhere. <br />	2004-09-23

AJ Jacobs wants to be a know-it-all, and sets out to re-educate himself by devouring 33,000 pages of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica. Keep in mind, these are big pages, with small type fonts. What was his motivation? Jacobs claims \\"by age 35 I had become embarrassingly ignorant.\\" Don't we all feel that way, honestly? I tried reading the encyclodpaedia from A-Z once. I got to Aardvark and put it down to read Stephen King's \\"Shining.\\" Now the Internet is around to serve our reference and research needs, so I haven't looked at an encyclopaedia for about 15 years. I'm not even sure I can spell encyclopaedia. <br /> <br />The book itself presents tidbits of information from A-Z, with commentary and anecdotes throughout. For example, in an early chapter,  Jacobs writes \\"I know that Adam, of Bible fame, lived longer than the combined ages of the correspondents of 60 Minutes and 60 Minutes II.\\" <br /> <br />Jacobs is hilarious and may have missed his calling as a comedian. Can you imagine the effort it would take to read from A-Z in this encyclopaedia? He probably would have been better served to read the Great Classics collection instead. <br />	2004-09-23

My impression of this cookbook is that it is designed primarily to be used as a coffee table book. It is full of beautiful color photos of both food presentations and steps in the production process. The book features approximately 100 recipes James has gleaned from his school/restaurant. <br /> <br />James includes recipes from the following areas: salads, cooking without heat, poaching, steaming, frying, roasting, broiling, grilling, and baking. The best part of this book is the first chapter, which covers insightful information on acquiring the basic essential tools and equipment to become a chef, and shopping tips. The recipes however, appear highly advanced and rather impractical for most amateur chefs. For example, his recipes generally require items such as: venison loin, juniper berries, chervil, crme fraiche, pancetta, tahina, sour gherkins, palm sugar, and squid, to name just a few of the exotic foods in these recipes. If you have access to these items, great.  <br /> <br />The book is made of glossed paper, which holds up well to spills and working in a kitchen environment. Also, the pages hold open pretty well to facilitate following a recipe while your hands are busy. Overall, this book would make a beautiful coffee table book, but lacks the practicality for my taste and use. <br />	2004-09-23

An earlier reviewer discussed the difficulty in believing the truthfulness of the story due to coincidences and convenient circumstances. However, as he also stated, this was based on a review of the movie, which I also found far from the original story told in the book. <br /> <br />The book is very detailed about the three years of Homer Hickam's life leading up to his graduation from high school and his successful national science project. I found the story very uplifting, and believable. <br /> <br />This story presents an in-depth look at the coal mining lifestyle in 1960 era West Virginia. Coming from a small town, with coal mining and UMW membership in my family's past, I found the story revealing and enthralling. I read this book in 2 evenings.

But, if you plan to keep up with the Darren Shan character, you will need to read this story. Darren confronts the Vampaneze and runs into some old friends along the way. The story is very limited in ghoul, and does not portray Darren learning or displaying any new super-human skills or fighting abilities. In fact, it's a bit of a let down. I'm sorry.

In her introduction she discusses the role of craft and art to writing. Thankfully, for those of us who lack confidence in our artistic abilities, it seems being an artist is only part of the equation. According to Elizabeth, a writer who brings talent, passion, and discipline to the table, will succeed. <br /> <br />This book offers a similar format to other writing instruction books, covering the obligatory, plotting, setting, characterization, etc. However, Elizabeth offers a unique perspective by discussing these issues from the perspective of what has worked for her. Based on her time proven success, the reader knows these are not just formulaic lessons somebody learned in a seminar. The examples, techniques, and advice given by Elizabeth came from years of successful publication. The book is also somewhat autobiographical, as in King's book \\"On Writing,\\" and gives the reader a unique look at the inner workings of a writer's psyche. <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading this book, and plan to incorporate some of the tools Elizabeth has provided into my next project.

Mike weighs in over 255 pounds, chain smokes, and spends 3-4 nights a week getting drunk. Mike admits he tends to become obsessive about whatever he does (smoking, drinking, eating), and decides to turn this tendency into something healthful-cycling. Mike begins to live off protein shakes and 300 miles per week on the bike. One year later he has lost about 80 pounds and finds he has transformed his life, although not necessarily for the better. In the process of becoming obsessive over his cycling, Mike feels he may have sacrificed some aspects of his teaching career, and pushed the limits with his marriage and family obligations. The Kafka, Camus, and Beckett references are minimal and fit the narrative, despite Publisher Weekly's negative comments. This book is a great read for cyclists over 40 and should not be approached as a guide to professional cycling, dieting, or training. It is however very motivating and has inspired me to crank up the intensity level of my cycling workouts.	2004-07-19

Drs Heller suggest you start slow, and work up to a low carb diet over a 7 day period. Using this approach, the dieter has an easier time of adjusting to a carb free diet, without the sudden shock of going cold turkey.<br />However, in my opinion the best part of this book is Part Two, where they discuss tactics, tips, and strategies for succeeding on this diet. I learned in this book that artifical sweetners and MSG were sabotaging my weight loss goals. After suffering for weeks on a low carb diet, I had reached a plateua and my body refused to yield a single more pound. After reading this book I have removed artifical sweetners from my diet, and try to minimize MSG consumption. This is not easy, as MSG is virtually all of our processed foods, including the protein broth ingredient used in canned tuna. Also, the Hellers disclose some of the hidden carbs in food generally accepted as good on this diet. For example, I had been eating a sizable amount of vegetables that I thought were safe, but alas, they were loaded with hidden carbs.<br />The main premise of the Heller low-carb diet is to eat in a way that effectively manages your blood sugar levels. The book gives you plenty of ideas on how to do this, including some surprising debunking of popular low carb diet myths.	2004-07-01

Merle Haggard met him in San Quentin and claims the man was innocent, but Chessman never denies that he was a menace to society. The book presents an indepth and well written look at the criminal mind and the American justice system. This book is well worth reading, but is unfortunately difficult to obtain.

I read all 7 of the available series within a couple of weeks, and can now hardly wait for the next book due out in September 2004. Darren Shan does an excellent job of creating a character (himself) who is very interesting to follow.<br /><br />In this first book Darren visits a freak show that has come to town and ends up getting into trouble--which changes his life forever. While this first book is probably the slowest moving of the 7 I have read so far, you must read this book before proceeding into the next books in the series. Shan always leaves you hanging from one chapter to the next, and each book follows exactly where the previous one ended (or very close to it).<br /><br />If you like vampire stories featuring kids as the vampires, rather than grumpy old Counts, read this series.	2004-06-25

Using his four-step process, I was able to rejuvenate my exercise and diet regimen and managed to lose about 20 pounds. Much of this was fat, as the fourth phase of Greene's plan emphasizes muscle building.<br />This book is probably best suited for beginners. Greene's message addresses losing weight, improving cardiovascular health, understanding why you eat (emotional eating, ala Dr. Phil), and improving self-esteem. Greene also advises people not to eat after 7pm, which I believe may be based on the false premise that a person's metabolism shuts off during sleep. According to Greene's plan, you should change your lifestyle in fours phases: 1) find out where you are at, what got you there, and what you want to achieve; 2) implement an aerobic exercise routine; 3) get to know what emotions are working to cause you to eat in excess of your body's needs; and, 4) build muscle with anerobic exercise.<br />If you already exercise regularly and are knowledgeable of sound nutrition concepts, you may not need this book. However, if you're like me, you may find Greene's book motivational and thus worth the money and time.	2004-06-21

What most diets don't explain is how to control those insatiable hunger pangs and cravings. Critics of the Atkins, South Beach, and similar low-carb lifestyle plans fail to recognize or acknowledge that the carbs (sugars) in our diet stimulate the urge to eat. I have found success (I lost over 45 lbs) with this diet by controlling my carbs and balancing the intake of carbs with protein to minimize blood sugar spikes. The added benefit to this diet is that by limiting and controlling carbs, you also minimize the hunger pangs. I used to eat a normal breakfast of cereal and toast before work, and by 9:30 am, I was searching the office kitchen for snacks. Using the South Beach diet, I have been able to consistently avoid these refrigerator raiding binges and can now make it to lunch without snacking. The hardest part about this diet for me is the evening hours after supper and before going to bed. I now couple the diet plan with an after supper walk or some other diversion that takes me out of the house.<br />Good luck with your weight-loss goals. The South Beach Diet can help you change your food addictions and appears to me to be a safe, well-balanced plan. P.S., sadly, I'm not related to Dr. Atkins.	2004-06-11

The same morning I finished readng this book, a radio interview with a California state legislator was discussing the right of illegal immigrants to have drivers licenses. According to this legislator, to deny the illegals licenses was not only discriminatory, but would cause economic hardships on the farmers who depend upon their labor. I cringed when I heard one of my elected offcials use this type of justification, as it was straight out of the Turner Diaries.<br />The book itself is not very well written, but I'm not a very good writer myself. The intent of the writer was to express his opinions about race in America and how policitcal correctness and the coming forfeiture of our guns will change our way of life for the worse. I believe he succeeded in that objective.	2004-06-08

Contrary to much of the media hype about this book, it is an attempt by the authors to compile statistical data relevant to intelligence and socio-economic status. For example, in Part II of this book, the authors attempt to show a causal relationship between intelligence and crime rates, poverty, teen pregnancy, etc. In the process of conducting their research, the researchers discover blacks in America generally score 1 standard deviation (15 points) beneath whites on various IQ tests. To discredit claims that black IQ is impacted by the oppression of blacks in America, they also revealed similar studies in Africa. In these studies, blacks generally scored 2 standard deviations beneath whites. For this, the book has been denounced as racist. <BR>American society is becoming more and more stratified among economic lines, where poverty and underemployment is offset by spectacular business and economic success stories. The Bell Curve asks why, and then discusses the theory that intelligence may be playing a role here. Critics again claimed that connecting intelligence to success is not reasonable as the economically disadvantaged would naturally fall short on IQ tests, due to poor environmental and educational opportunities. However, the facts state otherwise. Among whites and blacks of equal socio-economic status, children of white families consistently scored 1 standard deviation above black children in the same economic bracket. Again, this was portrayed as racist.<BR>This book is not about racism. It is about frequency distribution and intelligence scores. It is a fascinating look at the use of statistics and is recommended for any student of statistics or the social sciences. Ignore the race card, and learn from this book. As the authors claim over and over, their objective is not to create division, but to establish the foundation of further study in this area. At one time the church virtually stomped out scientific research because the answers being offered contradicted their beliefs. Likewise, perpetuating a falsehood in the name of political correctness will do nothing to help address the facts.	2004-06-08

While it was written about 125 years ago, its plot and character development is well suited to the 21st century reader--adulterous affairs, intrigue, and royalty.<br />However, truth be known, this book is one of those that epitomized Mark Twains comment &quot;A classic is a book everybody praises, but nobody reads.&quot; Tolstoy is not easy reading, and Maerican readers in particular will find the Russian names and their usage confusing. For example, a character may be referred to by his first name, family name, or even a nickname. Readers will spend much of their time trying to figure out who Tolstoy is talking about. Also, many of the characters names are similar, which adds to the confusion. If you can overcome this obstacle, this book can change the way you read and evaluate literature. Somehow, much of our current romance stuff no longer appeals to me.	2004-06-08

Finding and reading this book was like one of those fateful accidents that can potentially change your life. I was stuck in Fresno over the weekend and found myself hanging around the Borders bookstore. Allende's book was displayed on an endcap, and I must admit I was at first captivated by the portrait of the young woman on the cover. The fact that it was also heralded as an \\"Oprah\\" selection did not impress me. I read the first page of this book and was immediately captivated. As a native of California, Allende's depiction of the Gold Rush era, and the rampant racism inherent to the state's early formation, appeared historically accurate, and was sometimes disturbing. I suppose the life changing part concerns a shift in my perception of how California was settled. My 8th grade California history class never discussed slavery as demonstrated by Allende's reference to the Singsong girls (Chinese prostitutes) who sat chained to their beds chanting \\"two bittee lookee, four bittee feelee, six bittee doee,\\" and racism portrayed by the seizure of lands held by Californians and Mexicans. <br />Contrary to some of the other reviews here, I believe the character development of Eliza and Tao Chien was superb. I was disappointed, however, that Eliza's culinary skills were never fully developed, as she could have made a fortune in the gold fields running a restaurant. Instead, Eliza tends to squander her gifts in a fruitless search for a less than honorable lover. I read this book in two days, and I am not a fast reader. <br />The story grabs you, and by the end I was sorry to have to leave the world and lives Allende had created. To me, regretting the end of a book is the mark of a good story. The book deals with slavery (Chinese), oppression (Chinese and Latino), greed (everybody), romance, history, and prostitution.	2004-06-01

This book does not attempt to teach the craft or writing, such as plotting, characterization, dialog, etc., nor is it appropriate for non-fiction writing. Keys intent is to help the aspiring novelist deal with the fear of writing, which may be interpreted as the fear of exposure and/or rejection before our peers and family. Keys uses extensive quotes and anecdotes from various writers like Hemingway, E.B. White, Faulkner, Proust, Frost, and Ezra Pound to illustrate how great writers dealt with this fear. His anecdotes serve to prove the point that you are not alone in your fears. Even the best in the business felt fear. <br />A previous reviewer mentioned an important point, which I feel needs to be re-iterated, and that is, Keys presents so many different takes on how various writers overcame their fears, the reader is left with a confusing array of options, none of which are presented in a concise or manageable format. Simply put, the book does not congeal any techniques into a workable plan. As a writer, I have read quite a few books on this subject and eat technique and craft ideas like candy. This book did not satisfy my appetite for clear-cut techniques. That said, the book succeeds in illustrating how we (writers) must all travel a private path towards his or her writing goals.<br />This is a short and highly readable book, which I would recommend for all writers; however, while reading the book I remember feeling a bit depressed about the writing process.  After reading this book, I pulled out the first draft of my second novel and began to rework it. We'll see where it goes.	2004-05-26

Cirqu Du Freak has shaken my conept of a good book. Two weeks ago I started with book 1, and have read through the entire seires since. I'm a parent of teenagers, both of whom think I've gone crazy to be spending so much time reading Darren Shan. But, I like a good story wherever I find it. shan has created some characters, settings, and situations in this series that keep giving readers what they want--an interesting plot and characters you can't get enough of. I'm sorry I have to wait for September 2004 to read book 8. Man, if I could only write like this, my tame book on bicycle rippers, \\"Abby and the Bicycle Caper,\\" would be making me rich. Alas, it's back to the word processor for yours truly.	2004-05-25

Two 6th graders join forces to solve the mystery of a stolen painting. Using their unique perspective of childhood, they uncover clues that has left the FBI stumped. This book also features some special illustrations that give clues not included in the text. Wild Bill recommends this book to any 9-12 year old, as well as other mystery classics such as Holes, Something Upstairs, and Abby and the Bicycle Caper.	2004-05-17

The rest home is across the street from a \\"seedy\\" hotel, where Sammy Keyes discovers a secret while spying on the questionable characters coming and going from the hotel. Sammy is a very likable and funny character and she often finds herself in trouble. This book has a surprising ending, which makes Sammy an intriguing character and prompts young readers to continue reading the Sammy Keyes series. This book also won the 1999 Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Children's Mystery Book. Other books suitable for the same age range are Holes, and Abby and the Bicycle Caper.	2004-05-13

Of all the ND series, I think I enjoyed this one the most. While Nancy and her friends' activities and dialogue seem a bit dated (don't forget most of these stories were written long before you were born) Nancy is a wholesome character who is constantly busy observing her environment and sticking her nose into places it may not belong. Of course, this kind of behavior is what makes a story interesting. This book deals with arson, stealing patents, and helping an innocence victim find justice.<br />Wild bill recommends this book for mystery lovers aged 9-12.	2004-05-11

I suppose the reason may relate to their both being timeless classics. If you like these stories, you also have many more to choose from.<br />In this book, originally published around 1934, Nancy is faced with solving a mystery concerning a pair of adopted babies. As usual, Nancy sticks her nose into somebody else's business and comes out smelling like a rose. This is a good story, with dated dialogue, but a likable, wholesome character. I recommend this to any mystery lover aged 9-12, and perhaps beyond. I'm an adult, and still enjoy reading about her exploits.	2004-05-11

But getting over that small detail, the story is interesting and it was fun to follow the kids in their adventure, which of course involves more than just running away.<br />From the start, I liked the writer's style, where she states Claudia was \\"not running from somewhere, but to somewhere.\\" She took her brother, because he had money, and hid out in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. What a place to run to.<br />Read this book because you want to, not because some teacher assigns it. You won't regret it.

The author presents his material in a straightforward and entertaining manner.<br />Cleaver's message can be distilled into the following steps: a character wants something, faces obstacles to achieving this want, takes action to overcome these obstacles, and eventually resolves the situation and achieves his or her want. According to Cleaver, a storyteller who can present a story in terms of want+action+resolution, combined with emotion and showing techniques, is sure to get published.<br />This book helped me the most by describing how many writers become stifled in their creativity because they are confusing when to let the writing flow, and when to edit. In a first draft, Cleaver claims the writer should be in flow mode. Edit mode comes only after the first draft is on paper.	2004-05-10

For example, the book deals with the personification of animals (mice and rats), which may not set well with some, and includes some child abuse issues. However, the animals are a metaphor for real life, and feature characterizations typical of human society. The characters deal with prejudice, love, and a quest.

L'Amour starts this book with a reference to his high school class graduating while he was on a steamer in Indonesia. Thus, L'Amour sets the stage for his lengthy discussion of becoming self-educated through books, and experience.<br />In this book, L'Amour presents lists of books he read during his wandering years in the 30s. I particularly enjoyed the part where he described the difference between a hobo and a bum. Accoring to L'Amour, hoboes were not freeloaders, they just used the rails to follow the crop picking from one part of the country to the next. A bum, on the other hand, has no intention of working, and looks for handouts. This distinction was an eye opener to me.<br />Also, his discussion of walking outof th eMojave desert hit close to home, as I was born and raised in the area he described. L'Amour was a great researcher, and wrote from both personal experience and knowledge. This is an enjoyable book and has even been included in numerous literature courses in various universities. Throughout the book, L'Amour emphasizes the value of education through experience and self-guided reading; however, he never degrades formal education as a route to discovery and self improvement.	2004-05-06

I kept wanting her to wake up and realize that people were willing to help her. For example, early in the book when she is given a gift, she tosses it on the floor, which was a bit too ungrateful for me. Although the long descriptions of her imaginary friends became a bit tiresome, and the Prologue left me more confused than engrossed, overall this is a great childrens' story (readers in age group 12+), with well developed characters and excelent descriptions.<br />As a reader who enjoys a well told story, regardless of the genre and age group, I found this story both intriguing and expertly crafted. Wild Bill recommends this book for adults and children, although the story content and character motivation would probably appeal to young women more than the guys.	2004-05-06

Her firts complaint was to the shallow development of the Shane character. I believe the author intentionally left his past dim, his motivations unkown, as part of the &quot;hero&quot; motif. As to violence--it's a western story depicting a range war, not a court proceeding. The author shows Joe's muscles ripping his shirt in the bar fight for a reason. From the perspective of his son, it was vitally important that he see his father as strong, otherwise his admiration of Shane may have overshadowed his father.<br />Wild Bill recommends this book for any reader interested in a portrayal of the wild west in its legendary form.	2004-05-04

The book claims to be 9 books in 1, and although 8 of these so-called books are not complete books in themselves, the information provided is detailed enough to allow a thorough analysis of several web creation programs, and includes a CD which provides a good look at: HTML, Frontpage, Dreamweaver, JavaScript, Flash MX, E-Commerce, and XML.<br />Wild Bill recommends this book for any beginner to intermediate level web creator out there.

Ciuba discloses the secrets of 21 internet millionaires, and shares his ideas on how I can do it also. The book is based on interviews with highly successful marketers conducted on his radio talk show program. The interviews are concise and informative--right to the point. Although the author has proclaimed himself \\"America's Foremost Internet Marketing Consultant\\" I can't argue with the logic and persuasiveness of his many examples and techniques of internet entrepreneurship presented in this book.    This book is a fascinating read that lends credibility to the economic opportunities the internet promises. Ciuba cuts to the chase in his interviews and doesn't fool around with touchy-feely garbage that wastes the reader's time. This book is packed with concrete advice and ideas for building an Internet business. I plan to re-read this book soon, and hope to apply some of the techniques discussed in this excellent how-to business book that is both practical and pertinent to entrepreneurs today.

If you are not familair with this incredible man, consider his hundreds of inventions that have laid the groundwork for robotry, computers, microwaves, and nuclear fission, among many others. In the late 1800s, Tesla filed patents on things such as the incandescent electric light, the transmission of electrical energy, radios devices, electrical transformers, and generators.<br />This book is both entertaining and enlightening, and well worth the purchase price. Tesla has long been overlooked by the general public and deserves recognition as a great inventor, that even Edison learned from. This book in particular focuses on technology that Tesla invented over 100 years ago to transmit electrical energy around the globe, without powerlines. Why have we not implemented his ideas?	2004-04-27

It's no wonder he is on our ten-dollar bill. As a Revolutionary War hero and a major player in the founding of our country, Hamilton may have become president, except for a sentence in the Constitution that requires a president be natural born in America. Hamilton was born on Nevis, a Caribbean island, and was certainly not a part of Virginia club that included Washington and Jefferson, among others.<br />That said, Chernow does an excellent job of reviving the truth about Hamilton from his investigation of over 20,000 primary documents. I must confess, I am only about half way through this huge book, but have thus far found it very readable, well documented, and interesting to those, such as myself, who are not history buffs. Somehow, this book on one of our Founding Fathers has struck a chord with me. If you want to learn more about the founding of America, and one of its principle players who pledged their life and property for a dream, read this book.	2004-04-27

I'm not a big Woodward or Washington Post fan, but when it comes to investigative journalism, Woodward's legacy of thoroughness, dating back to Watergate, appears beyond reproach. I'm a busy person, and try to read and sort facts out for myself, but ultimately, we must either trust or not trust what we read. In this case, I believe Woodward managed to find himself both for and against Bush's policies and decisions towards Iraq. In a quagmire of worthless journalism on this subject, I found Woodward's take both refreshing and enlightening.	2004-04-23

That said, some of these stories abecoming a bit cliche.<br />Blanchard does a good job of illustrating how an apology is not effective unless it is coupled with sincere change. The current business environment can use all the ethical advice it can get, so I gave this 4 stars for that. This book is ideal to pass around to co-workers and subordinates that do not normally read and need to receive printed advice in small doses. Serious scholars of management philosophy would be better suited to go elsewhere.<br />On the plus side, you could easily read this book in the bookstore while waiting for your son to pick out a CD.	2004-04-23

That said, I read this book at least four times, which also attests to its readability.<br />Subnetting, TCP/IP, and Cisco IOS are not the most intersting subjects in the world, but Lammle manages to make the reading comprehensible. You could probably get the same info from the Cisco documentation website, but I guarantee you it will read like stereo instructions. I would like to have seen more information about accessing switches and routers in this book, but perhaps that is beyond the scope of the test objectives.

While the premise of the book is not to teach you how to become a licensed counselor, and it is not specifically addressed to the professional counselor, the book contains detailed information about the counseling process and pitfalls amateurs should avoid.<br />For example, one lesson talks about recognizing our motivation towards serving a given person in need of counseling as a potential &quot;rescue fantasy.&quot; That is, as counselors we should evaluate why we are involved in trying to provide counseling. Amazingly, when I analyzed it, much of my efforts to help other people were actually expressions of my own fantsies to &quot;save the world.&quot; While the authors do not dismiss our fantasies as valid precursors to helping other people, they do help you put these things into perspective.<br />I highly recommend you read this book if you are interested in helping other people.	2004-04-22

Every couple of years I find myself returning to this book to walk with Thoreau and attempt to rediscover my core values and love for pure writing and critical thinking. Thoreau invites his readers to shed the encumbrances of their lives, willingly brought upon themselves in the form of mortgages and jobs they cannot afford to abandon. In short, we become tools to our tools-that is, slaves to materialism.<br />In \\"Nature,\\" Thoreau states: \\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\" Referring, in my opinion, to the eternal quest for material items at the cost of intellectual enlightenment. According to Thoreau, a man will spend his entire life working to obtain a nicer house and to surround himself with the trappings of wealth, all the while forgetting that nature, and the pursuit of simplicity and knowledge are true wealth. <br />This book should be a part of your home library.	2004-04-20

Use this book as a supplement to the main South Beach Diet book. The book discusses the basic framework of the South Beach diet, including important information about the glycemic index of certain foods, which play a key role in insulin production and fat gain. The basic premise of the book, according to the author, is to help you \\"consume the right carbs and the right fats and learn to snack strategically.\\"<br />To teach you how to do this, the book categorizes carb rich foods according to good and poor choices. For example, whole grains, legumes, rice, and starchy vegetables are listed as good carbs, while crackers, pasta, white bread, and processed food products are bad. The bulk of this small paperback is dedicated to lists of foods with their respective carbs, fat, protein, and sugar listed in grams. In short, it is a reference book that supplements the information you get from \\"The South Beach Diet\\" book.<br />Eating of course, is enjoyable, while dieting is a pain. However, having lost approximately 50 pounds over the past 18 months, I can tell you the pleasure of feeling and looking better is worth the inconvenience. Atkins helped me lose weight, but I could only take so much fatty foods, while longing for the crisp, clean taste of fresh fruit. I also read Dr. Phil's book and learned about how my emotions (stress, anger, boredom, etc) effect the way I eat. Trying to diet without understanding why you eat is an uphill battle, so I would recommend you try Dr. Phil and South Beach together.	2004-04-20

Diet: The Easy, Healthy Way to Permanent Weight Loss	Books	5	29	34	N	N	Good Idea	It's good to see the ideas of Dr. Atkins becoming more widely accepted. This book delves into an area that Atkins and South Beach touch upon, but deserves more attention, and that is--how do carbs and sugars impact our glucouse levels?<br />The glycemic index of foods tells you how quickly a food product is turned into sugar after you eat it. As you would expect, white flour and high refined sugar food products convert instantly, causing a complex process of insulin secretion and fat storage. Whereas, foods with a low glycemic index do not cause the insulin reaction, and thus allow the foods you eat to be used as energy, rather than being stored as fat.<br />The G.I. diet is not about military guys or your gastro-intestinal system, it is about learning to recognize good carbs and bad carbs. To lose weight, the author of course recommends avoiding foods with high glycemic levels. I have tried quite a few diets over the years, but find diets that emphasize careful carb consumption work best for me. Over the past 18 months I have lost over 50 pounds by watching carbs. I plan to use the information in this book to further refine my carb conscious lifestyle.	2004-04-20

While his examples are drawn from circumstances beyond the scope of most of our lives, (military war heroes, explorers, Civil Rights movement leaders, Native Americans, religious leaders, and Burmese dissidents), his intent is to teach the reader how to face the daily challenges of life bravely.<br />This book is a reflection of Senator McCain's life, which he admits has not always been up to the level of courageousness he would wish (referring to his Vietnam experiences). By telling the stories of how others handled difficult situations, McCain succeeds in teaching the reader how to face fear. His book extols the honor of self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and defines courage as \\"the capacity for action despite our fears.\\"<br />Regardless of your political beliefs or opinion of McCain, this book is worth reading and sharing with others.	2004-04-16

However, lest you think this all there is to it, Goldratt goes into detail describing how to identify the constraint, how it impacts production, quality, and costs of operations. The book is well worth reading, and seems to suggest a Deming management method whereby the manager should constantly strive to improve quality, processes, and people management. I would recommend the serious reader also read Mary Walton's The Deming Management Method in addition to this book.<br />A similar book, worth reading in my opinion, that deals with the formation of teams to resolve constraints: The Five Dysfunctions of Teams (ISBN: 0787960756).	2004-04-15

In this book, Crile documents the activities of this maverick congressman as he organizes CIA operatives and funding to arm the Afghan rebels with military weapons, including the Stinger missile, to defeat the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In a twist of fate, while freeing Afghans, he may have set the stage for terrorist training, leading up to 911.<br />Crile's accounts of this fascinating history reads like a novel and is well-documented. This is good history, worth reading.	2004-04-15

Each section has approximately 20 recipes, that appear easy enough to prepare and follow the 40% protein, 30% carb, and 30% fat you would expect on a diet plan like this. Also, most of the recipes included carb counts, protein grams, etc. I noticed in the dessert section (my personal favorite of any cookbook) that the recipes employ yogurt, almonds, and fresh fruit extensively. Some sugar substitutes were noted, but not a lot.<br />The author also dedicates 8 pages of the book to summarizing the diet plan, a long chapter on shopping in accordance with the diet plan, and 5 pages of question and answer type stuff that addresses general questions relevant to the diet. Color photos were available for about 50% of the recipes, which is why I titled this review &quot;Pretty Pictures.&quot; I would recommend this book to any reader who enjoyed and plans to use the SouthBeach Diet.	2004-04-15

The included CD is also impressive, with a networking encyclopedia and dictionary included.<br />This book is not for light weights. If you are a home or private user of XP, I would recommend you shop elsewhere. However, if you are an administrator then you need to ask yourself, Why is this book not on my reference shelf?

This book is not about teamwork, so much as the deliberate creation of teams to analyze and resolve problems within an organization. The book is highly readable and informative for any executive aspiring to learn about teams or share an inspirational book with his or her workforce.<br />Lencioni identifies 5 reasons teams fail: lack of commitment, failure to embrace conflict, lack of results focus, lack of accountability, and lack of trust. The author concludes his book and his philosophy with the statement success is a matter of \\"embracing common sense with uncommon levels of discipline and persistence.\\"<br />Read this book and share it with your fellow employees.

This book is typical of the \\"Mastering\\" series, however, and is not intended for light weights. If you are a home or private user, you may be better served with something akin to the \\"Windows for Dummies\\" variety. I'm not trying to be condescending, just realistic. This book is highly detailed and goes well beyond the average users needs. However, the first 89 pages of this book present a color plated introduction to using XP, which I found very helpful and better than most related products on the market. The first 89 pages alone are worth the price of this book for most of us. As an administrator, this book will also serve you well with its detailed explanations, extensive graphics and screen shots, and Mark's interpretation of Microsoft's technical manuals.<br />Compare this book to Microsoft's publication of \\"Windows XP\\" (ISBN: 0735618054).	2004-04-15

The book is highly detailed and features graphics and excellent photos on virtually every page. Also, the book now comes with a 2 hour DVD that illustrates computer repair beyond what is possible in a book alone. While this book is great fro preparing for A+ certification, it does not discuss the exam and you should refer to another book, such as Exam Cram (ISBN: 078973043x) for details on the exam itself.

I would use this book if I knew next to nothing about the A+ exam and was interested in finding out what all the fuss was about. Otherwise, I would skip this one. Either way, do not rely solely on this book for your test prep. Use it in conjunction with other guides by Sybex or Exam Cram.<br />The cheat sheet included in this book is virtually worthless, as the reminders are too brief and vague to be of any real value, instead, use Exam Cram's book ISBN: 078983043x. the book covers both aspects of the A+ exam (hardware and OS), but has limited graphics with hardly any photos. I found the exam required identifying parts and components from pictures, so this book won't help you there.<br />This book overall presents a decent, but minimal, overview of both the hardware and operating system exams and should be used in conjunction with Mueller's \\"Upgrading and Repairing PCs\\" classic (ISBN: 0789727455).	2004-04-14

If you can't read and expand on a statement, such as the one above, then you need to study that particular area more thoroughly. The CD for this book includes practice questions that are also good for testing your knowledge of the material, but do not expect to see actual CompTia test questions here.

Critical thinking is absent in corporate America today, and Maxwell strives to teach the reader to adopt new mental habits to analyze and resolve situations both within and without the boardroom.

Books	5	4	4	N	N	Classic Johnson	The Present is a classic example of Spencer's writing style that typically portrays a main character facing some sort of dilemma and finding solace and/or information from those around him. In this book, a young man seeks to find the answers to achieving success and happiness in his personal and business life.  The book reads like a novel and succeeds in delivering a simple message of learning from the past, living for today, and planning for the future. <br /> <br />In The Present, Johnson extols his readers to live for today by focusing on what is \\"right now,\\" and responding to what is \\"important now.\\" He encourages readers to learn from the past by analyzing past events, learning from your mistakes, and making changes to prevent recurrence of mistakes. Finally, he asks readers to visualize an idealistic future, constructing plans to make this future happen, and implementing the plan to secure it. <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable little book, which you can read in a single setting.

Typical Allen, his book covers real estate transactions and opportunities in-depth; but beyond that, he delves into network marketing, options, and other areas that pique the reader's interest.    Years ago I read \\"Nothing Down,\\" and \\"Creating Wealth,\\" and fell in love with the way he presented investment techniques. Allen is deceptively easy to read, but his ideas are loaded with gold. The concept of creating multiple sources of income, outside a \\"Just Over Broke\\" job, is fascinating. For example, how much income would it take from various small businesses and investments to replace your current job income? Using this question as a basis, I started looking for small, affordable opportunities to replace my job income. I'm not there yet, but believe I am on the right track. Allen's current book rejuvenated my drive to continue the quest, not so much towards great wealth, but simply a chance to quit my day job and secure a financial future outside the vanishing Social Security illusion.

Also, this book features an introduction by Deming.<br />The majority of this book is dedicated to Walton's interpretation of Deming's 14 points, which encourages organizations to: have a constancy of purpose, adopt a new philosophy, not rely on mass inspections, not to accept contracts based on price alone, constantly improve processes, train and retrain, institute solid leadership, drive out fear in the workplace, breakdown departmental barriers, eliminate slogans, eliminate quotas, remove barriers to pride in workmanship, and take action to transform the organization.<br />Walton's book does a good job of presenting Deming's theories, which I highly recommend to newcomers to the quality movement. Those experienced in this area and familiar with Deming's 14 points may not benefit as much from this book, but may enjoy a different take on Deming's ideas and somewhat dated examples.	2004-04-13

Why were many books discarded in the formation of the Gospel, leaving us with the four we are familiar with? As a curious Christian I cannot but wonder abut the messages concerning my faith that certain church bodies and governing powers have tried to exclude from my scrutiny. <br />After finding the Book of Thomas on the Internet and learning that I could approach God directly, without having to go through the Pope, my interest in these controversial \\"lost\\" Gospels was piqued. Later my wife introduced me to the theory of the Priori Scion, that I believe Brown also discusses in his \\"Da Vinci Code\\" which basically states members of the Priori Scion are keepers of the blood of Christ-that is, descendants of Christ. If this is the case, who bore a child from Christ? The Gospel of Mary Magdalene sheds light on this question.<br />Another similar concept concerns the Holy Grail, which most of us believe refers to a cup that held the wine used in The Last Supper. While visiting the original painting of the Last Supper, I noticed the grail is not depicted in Da Vinci's famous painting, however a V, which refers to a female, is depicted in the painting, and suggests Mary Magdalene is the cup (meaning holder) of the blood of Christ. Also, Mary's uterus is referred to as the \\"cup.\\"<br />This book reveals a side of Christ from Mary Magdalen's perspective, free of papal revisionism. I highly recommend this book for any scholar or casual inquirer of the truth. In my opinion, the information in this book strengthened my faith, rather than threatened it.	2004-04-12

One of Carnegie's messages I will never forget was his answer to the question: How do you buy a gift for the man who has everything? According to Carnegie, forget the gift for the man and buy a gift for his wife. The first time I used this technique I convinced the office staff to purchase flowers for the boss's wife instead of the tired old plaque for his over crowded wall. The next day the boss sent thank you letters to every one, expressing how surprised and elated his wife was. That simple gesture paid dividends. Before you write Carnegie's ideas off as schmoozing and patronizing, please read him for yourself. This book has survived the test of time because the author teaches sincerity and high ethical standards as the bedrock to success.<br />Also, don't be distracted by the 1931 copyright on this book. Sharing the credit for a job well done and accepting blame where you are at fault is as valuable today as it was 73 years ago. Buy and read this book, it is a part of our cultural literacy and you don't want to be left behind.	2004-04-12

In this book, Detective Alex Cross works with the FBI to solve a string of robberies/murders that keeps you turning the pages. My only hesitation in rating this book with 5 stars was Patterson's tendency to weight this book down with a lot of family/personal problems that the lead character (Cross) was experiencing while trying to solve the mystery. While personal problems are certainly a part of life, I felt it was a bit overdone in this book.<br />Patterson is very knowledgeable of police and FBI procedures and reading his books is always an eye opener to the world of crime fighting.

This book does an excellent job of portraying how the liberal agenda is eroding the moral fabric of America--for what purpose remains unclear--and how members of this group do not represent the majority of Americans.<br />Savage drives home the point that conservatives, or just patriots who love America and what it used to stand for, need to reveal the the liberal agenda for what it is: destruction of something they don't like. To quote Savage, &quot;If you don't act, who will?&quot;<br />Savage's book details the &quot;enemy from within&quot; (which interestingly, is a line JFK used in a speech given in 1961) in specific reference to their assualt on our schools, military, churches, and family, among many other areas.

While I tend to focus on fiction, Stein's ideas are also pertinent to nonfiction writing.<br />This is a classic work that all current and prospective authors should read. Two of the most important concepts I learned from this book include: spending more time developing your hook, preferably in the first paragraph or page of your novel, and in telling a story with the reader in mind. As a reader, I enjoy a book, such as Patterson's &quot;3rd Degree,&quot; where you become so absorbed in the story and the characters that you forget you are reading and actually feel like you're walking in the shoes of the characters. Stein attempts to teach the reader of his book how to do this.<br />I recommend this book to any writer serious about his/her craft.	2004-03-29

However, and this is important for you to understand, these books alone will not help you pass the certification exams. Much of the material in this book is presented in outline form, and barely touches the depth of knowledge needed to answer the test questions. Also, as the following excerpt from the book description illustrates, much of the text of these books is dedicated to stuff seasoned test takers already know: &quot;The books feature test-taking strategies, time-saving study tips, and a special Cram Sheet that includes tips, acronyms, and memory joggers not available anywhere else. The Cram Sheet is especially useful for last-minute review before the test begins.&quot;<br />My advice, buy this series if you want an overview of the test objectives, and use the material as a guide to your further studies. In that capacity, they are well worth the purchase price. Just don't go into the test room with knowledge limited to what you gleaned from these books.<br />I recommend this book for those starting their quest for MCSE certification.	2004-03-29

Patterson has a unique style of changing the point of view from one chapter to the next, alternating third person perspective with the minor characters with first person when the chapter is about the main character. I found this approach interesting and refreshing. Also, Patterson likes to write short chapters, about 500-750 words per chapter. 3rd Degree has 111 chapters, but read quickly, with each chapter ending with a hook that pulled you into the next chapter. I wasn't real fond of the female detective club thing in this book, but found the story entertaining and never dull.  His plot and the intertwining of current events relative to terrorism added realism to the story. I recommend this book to any fiction reader.	2004-03-29

The book is approximately 7,000 words long.<br />A similar book for the same age group which I would recommend is \\"Abby and the bicycle caper.\\"	2004-03-25

Not all of his suggestions were relevant to me, as I have no ambition to own hotels, casinos, or apartment complexes. However, his aggressive style and take no prisoners approach to negotiating and closing deals is applicable to anyone striving to get ahead in the business world.    Whether your intention is to learn how to make money like Trump, or just to get some insight into his business philosophy, this book is worth reading. Trump shares with the reader his ideas on thinking big, and investing carefully. Much of the material in this book is similar to information I learned from Rich Dad and Robert Allen. But, Trump's attitude towards business is unique and worth learning about. Don't settle for the snippets of Trump's personality and business philosophy you can glean from \\"The Apprentice,\\" read this book and get the in-depth scoop.

The heroine, Abby, gets involved in trying to solve crimes in her neighborhood, such as a stolen bicycle, a missing cat, etc., then finds herself in deeper than she expected. The story ends with Abby solving the mystery, of course, and finds a litle respect from her family which she believed she did not have prior to solving the neighborhood crime wave.<br />This book portrays families in a positive way and does not attempt to preach any moral lessons. It is just a fun story that a young girl can enjoy in an afternoon of reading.	2004-03-09

Somehow the statement &quot;as a man thinketh, so is he,&quot; does not translate well to &quot;as a person thinketh, so is she or he.&quot;<br />Marc Allen points out that in the Buddhist tradition, a book opens with a poem. If the reader can understand the poem, he or she has grasped the meaning of the book, and need not read the entire book. Here is James Allen's opening poem:<br />Mind is the master power that molds and makes,<br />And we are mind, and evermore we take<br />the tool of thought,and shaping what we will,<br />Bring forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills.<br />We think in secret,and it comes to pass--<br />Our world is but our looking glass.<br />Thoreau said something similar in a shorter version where he alludes to how the mind of man can create a heaven or hell for itself.	2003-12-09

As its author suggests, autism is becoming more and more prevalent in our society, and is currently outpacing all other forms of diagnosed developmental disabilities. During a recent event featuring Temple Grandin, she stated one of the keys to her successfully adapting to autism in her life was the early childhood intervention she recieved from family and teachers. In this book, parents and professionals can discover some of the techniques, such as the individual education plan, parents should demand as part of their child's education. Parents should also not allow this to a boilerplate plan, but must insist that it contain a unique and valid assessment relevant to their child, and specific, measurable goals and target behaviors that can be taught, reviewed, and that are a valid skills for developing daily living skills.<br />Read this book and learn about these things.	2003-11-25

In this book, Barnes weaves a ghost story with an interesting twist--the main ghost is afraid of the dark.<br />Children's stories should first be about telling a good story, before being concerned with social issues or political correctness. I enjoyed this book (as an adult) and passed it to my son to enjoy. Finding children's books that are not primarily concerned with school and/or relationship issues is becoming more and more difficult. I appreciated Barnes' effort to just tell a story.	2003-11-25

According to Skinner, it is better to establish outlandish goals and motivate yourself to achieve something above the common &quot;10% above last years sales,&quot; approach.<br />Skinner's ideas are clearly presented and successfully motivate the reader to re-attempt the goal approach to superior performance. While I am weary of being told to set goals, I enjoyed testing his hypothesis that setting outlandish goals will generate brainstorming and subconcsious thinking that wil help you reach these new goals. Set a goal to read this book. If nothing else, you will be reminded that goals (as we are always told according to some ancient Yale study)can help you achieve new heights in your career or personal aspirations.	2003-11-25

Eating for Life is somewhat liike a sequel to his Body for Life book, which I used to develop a diet and exercise plan that has helped me lose over 60 pounds in the past year. I eat a reasonably balanced diet comprised of 40% protein, 30% carbohydrates, and 30% fat. The fat may be a bit high for some people, but combined with one hour of exercise per day, it seems to work out. <br />Phillips goes beyond what I have described above, to discuss how food and exercise impacts your metabolism. He also gives plenty of examples of how other people have used his plan to find greater levels of health and fitness. I noticed Jamba Juice also carries his books--which is a recommendation in itself. However, don't waste your money with this book if you plan on working Phillip's plan half-hearted. His plan requires discipline and hardwork.	2003-11-25

There is a plethora of books on the subject of writing available, so King's take on the subject is valuable in that it sheds light on the inner workings of the writer, and challenges aspiring writers to read, with comments such as &quot;a writer reads--constantly.&quot; One myth he dispelled was the belief that he took his birthday and Christmas off. Not so, acording to the man himself. &quot;A writer writes, all the time.&quot;<br />Also, I found his description of being ran over and recovering from that revealing of his character. I'm no longer an avid fan of King's fiction, but found this book both personal and insightful, and worth the effort.	2003-11-24

After watching The Junction Boys on ESPN, I knew I had to read this book. Of course the movie barely scratched the surface of the story. Jim Dent does an excellent job of bringing the historical events of Aggie football in the early 50s to life. I'm not a big fan of college football, and know very little about Texas A&amp;M; however, after reading this book I wanted to know more about Paul Bryant and college football. You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy this book. Coach Bryant's philosophy of life would serve us all well--hell, he should have been president. Of the 30+ players that survived Coach Bryant's 10 day boot camp from Hell, many went on to successful careers in business, football, and coaching. The success of his students is testament to his abilities as a leader, teacher, and coach. Jim Dent makes it palatable in this book.<br />I recently purchased The Undefeated by Jim Dent, which is a story of the Oklahoma Sooners, and have found it equally enjoyable. Jim Dent is a great writer, and I'm thankful to have discovered him.	2003-01-17

For anti-behaviorists (those who fear being controlled by the human tendency to adapt behavior in order to receive rewards and avoid punishment) this book is a nightmare. Daniels succinctly describes the behavior analysis process and how employers can use it to improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency by &quot;pinpointing&quot; job performance standards and incentive programs. A must read for any manager. His chapter on incentive plans was particularly insightful and illustrates the fallacies of most reward systems.	2003-01-17

However, the media portrayed it as an assault on the fast food industry. Aside from the first and last chapters of the book, the fast food industry was barely mentioned. Rather, this book takes an in-depth look at food production in general, and the meat-packing industry in specific. The author scratches the surface of hiring practices among fast food companies, but the practice of hiring teenagers and the elderly is hardly restricted to fast food joints--check out any retail outlet and temp agency in America. They are all preying upon people who are willing to accept slave labor, and since there are an abundance of such people, we all suffer. Overall, the book is worth reading, but be prepared for detailed reading. Seriously, I don't know very many people who will read this book cover-to-cover.	2001-06-11
