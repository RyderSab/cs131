Perhaps the spookiest &quot;prediction&quot; of McPhee's book is the discussion about how to flatten the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center (WTC) with a small atomic device. This is the first reference, fact or fiction--as far as I can find--that mentions the two 110-story towers as a possible terrorist target. Ironic, eh? All the more ironic, because all it took were two suicide jets to do the job--no atomic explosive needed. But you can't help but wonder if the terrorists of Sept. 11, 2001 (and the first WTC bombing planners) were inspired by this book. In which case, the author must be haunted by the fact that he may have started a &quot;chain reaction&quot; of idea events which led to a prophesy fullfilled?	2001-09-18

Most notable: Maffei should be praised for correcting misinformation about the meteorite-like stones called &quot;tektites.&quot; The author includes research results from aerodynamic studies made by the late Dean R. Chapman of NASA Ames Research Center. Chapman was a genuine scientific Sherlock Holmes; he showed, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the mysterious Australasian-class of tektites originated on the Moon. Few books include this information about tektites. Many scientists still claim tektites were formed by terrestrial impacts. (Aside: research supporting evidence of the lunar-origin of tektites is rarely published--the so-called 'impact mafia' seem to control the peer review of such papers.) This book is out of print but used copies are readily available. The reviewer hopes it is republished.	2001-09-01

Illustrations are clear although some of the photography (b&amp;w only) is inferior compared to other similar books.  The book contains several observer report templates and are especially useful if the amateur is hunting for so-called Transient Lunar Phenomena, most likely venting of volcanic gas.  A CD-ROM (termed a 'lunar atlas') is included.  However, several features I wanted to look out were not on the CD! (I.e., the important volcanic crater Aristarchus--possibly still an active area of vulcanism on the Moon). I personally did not agree with the orthodox recounting of how the Moon formed.  Fission is still a workable hypothesis.  And it is clear the Apollo missions created more questions than answers about the Moon. One unresolved question not mentioned in this book is the tektite controversy.  Some evidence (Apollo 12 specimen and Apollo 16 volcanic glasses) points to at least one type of tektite found on Earth as being lunar in origin.  Despite these points, I still recommend this volume for your favorite &quot;lunatic.&quot; : )	2000-12-01

Oh, an can't I please be left alone to live in my  21st Century, yet still have redwood trees, but not have to live in a  strawbale-bermed house and wear politically correct hemp clothes and deploy  &quot;Love Your Mother&quot; bumperstickers on my Volvo wagon?

I just don't buy the thesis of the bankrupt  political philosophy behind this book and so many like it. I refuse to get  on board Butterfly-Hill's peace train bound for the 13th century. It just  won't solve the problems she so desperately wants to protest. This book is  ultimately insipid; it embarrased me by its sheer lack of reality. Why do  we celebrate the neo-primitive desire by some modern intellectuals to  return to a primeval pre-Eden world where trees have pet names and wild  nature is romanticized? The cover photo of this book pictures the author as  a pale-faced lemur, cute barefeet gripping sequoia bark, and hanging on to  her simian past for dear life! Well, we may be &quot;apes&quot; but we're a  different kind of ape. Oh, and we have come down from the trees, Ms.  Butterfly-Hill or hadn't you noticed?

The Da Capo paperback edition is probably the best one  available because of the maps and illustrations included. It is notable  since it is the only book in print which bears an image of Lord Howe,  killed at the Battle of Trout Brook, the prelude to the Battle of  Ticonderoga in July 1758. But in reading Parkman's work one is sickened by  the accounting of savage brutalities on all sides. The Massacre of Ft.  William Henry on Lake George, N.Y. is a gripping and sad account. One  understands why the term &quot;savages&quot; was applied to the Indians. It  should have also been applied to the Euros. Not an age I would care to live  in.  Today's re-enactors glorify the romance of what was largely a brutal  era. Neat and clean toy soldiers. None of these modern anachronists would  survive a moment in the Adirondack forest and swamp lands of the 1750s. Ah,  but a Wellsian time machine would be a wonderful tool for venturing back  and visit for a day. Be alongside Howe, before his death, and imagine what  could have been at Fort Ti had he lived. Wonder if these young men, now  dead, had any idea of what nation would spring from the bloody soil. But  just a day...	2000-08-14

These brutal people are the last kinds of characters we'd want on  other worlds. They are amoral and stop at nothing to achieve their goals.

Small female feet--when in right proportion of heel, arch and toes--are indeed God's supreme work of erotic beauty.  A  woman's foot, if it is sculpted to near perfection naturally or  artifically, is an object far more sexual than female genitalia or breasts.   While time may has passed by this wise and ancient custom, as practiced by  Asians, there are some very intelligent, cultured contemporary foot-fetish  devotees who enjoy their fetish dominas binding their feet, albeit  temporarily, for visual enjoyment.  So please--we must not rush to  judgement on this ancient and divinely inspired erotic art.	2000-05-02

My chief complaint about Keay Davidson's chatty biography of the late Carl Sagan is that he--the author, that is--intrudes too much.  Be it in the main text or in the editorial-like footnotes, Keay Davidson mugs at himself  in the mirror of his words and says &quot;don't I look pretty? Don't I  write well?&quot;  And who really cares about Keay Davidson's love affair  with himself?  I don't care about Keay Davidson's opinions on nuclear  strategy or civil rights.  I also don't care about Keay Davidson's analyses  of the state of planetary science.  What I do care about reading is  Davidson's topic--Carl Sagan. (Oh, yeah, I almost forgot!)  I don't mind if  Carl Sagan was an odd bird who had warts; who slapped around his first wife  (the looney Lynn &quot;Gaia&quot; Margulis); and oddly worshipped the feet  of his equally looney third wife. What bothers me is the increasing trend  of biographical tradesmen like Davidson who refuse to fade into the  background while telling their story.  Is it the storyteller or the story?   Well, admittedly it's both.  But when you forget the story and pick up the  author's vibes, then it's not fun anymoore.  Like Morris' hilarious and  ultimately foolish 'bio' of Ronald Reagan, the infamous &quot;Dutch&quot;  (sadly, sure to be a rolemodel for all upcoming biographers/frustrated  novelists), we see an increasing number of talented, albiet  exhibitionistic, writers who need to expose their dangling participles to  the defenseless reader at the expense of their subject.	1999-12-21

This book includes only one major  technical paper by the late Dean Chapman and none by expert O'Keefe, both  pioneers in the field of tektite research.  Why is that?  Guess.  Barnes  disliked both men because they challenged his cozy belief in the  terrestrial origin theory. Each set of papers is preceded by the editor's  comments.  Look out for Barnes on his soapbox!  It is peppered with Barnes'  lopsided, subjective, and acid comments about his competitors who beat him  to the punch in figuring out how tektites form and where they come from (it  now appears that they are igneous and extraterrestrial in origin).

This book is a prime example that some classic scientific works of great insight should remain in print as valuable references and sources of key knowledge!  Much of current tektite literature is awash in highly fanciful  and essentially flawed observations linking the stones to terrestrial  impacts--the current state of affairs is but an example of Thomas Kuhn's  ideas about mainstream science's stubborn resistance to &quot;paradigm  shifts&quot; because it threatens personal research turf and the reigning  orthodoxy.  This classic study of tektites--written by former NASA  astronomer J.A. O'Keefe, the 'Father of Space-Age Geodesy'--has been out of  print since the 1970s but should be reissued.  Also, O'Keefe's prediction  of a coming revolution in planetary science seems to be a prophesy about to  be fulfilled.  And not surprisingly, O'Keefe's analysis of the origin of  tektites remains as pertinent and timely as it was in 1976.  O'Keefe's  clear thinking about, and observations of, tektites and the Moon are  brilliant examples of this man as a new Copernicus.  Sadly, mountains of  papers written by many of today's post-Apollo era researchers--who have  only sampled a few tektites and look at them through the horse-blinders of  the &quot;one size fits all&quot; impact theory--has obscured O'Keefe's  magnificent work in this area.  The fact that tektites come from the  Moon--and that the Moon still experiences explosive pyroclastic eruptions  which pose a threat to life on Earth--is clear now and should no longer be  challenged.  Tektites are formed as volcanic deposits on the lunar surface  (either by massive volcanic &quot;glass&quot; eruptions or my impacts  blasting off this volcanic material) and then are blasted off the moon's  surface and fall to Earth in great showers--sometimes even forming  Saturn-like rings around our planet.  In addition, recent re-examination of  the controversial Apollo 12 &quot;granitic&quot; lunar sample No. 12013  (actually a lunarKREEP rock which has a vein of tektitic material in it)  now favors a lunar origin for these so-called &quot;enigmatic stones.&quot;  So, if you are a student of tektites and meteorites, track down as a used  copy of this classic work and treasure it.  It is a timeless reference  work!	1999-07-08

A well written book with good intentions, but there's still reason to doubt the &quot;impact theory&quot; as the reason for the demise of the dinosaurs.  The extensive volcanism of the Deccan Traps in India may have  also formed the iridium layer.  Another idea, never discussed, is that  impacts of lunar volcanic material--expelled volcanic domes--may have  pelted the Earth in prehistoric times.  This idea is especially intriguing  to me since tektites--little glassy stones often thought to be splash from  an impact--appear to some geologists to be more igneous than sedimentary in  origin.  The late Dean Chapman of NASA Ames Research Center had the most  logical theory about impact craters and tektites: craters are connate with  tektite strewn fields!  Thus, a massive lunar dome-meteorite impact was  followed by a trail of tektites as it entered the earth's atmosphere.   Microtektites--lunar in origin-- found at the K-T layer may link volcanic  outbursts on the Moon with these periodic extinction causing impacts.   Also, check out NASA's John A. O'Keefe (author of the 1976 book TEKTITES  &amp; THEIR ORIGIN et al) for an excellent review of this often ignored,  but still very intriguing theory!  Curiously, an Apollo 12 lunar sample  resembled a &quot;terrestrial&quot; tektite so closely if it had been found  on Earth, it would have passed for a javanite (tektite)!	1999-03-13

The reference to tektites--natural, extraterrestrial glass stones--is all too brief however (and inaccurate in scope).  Author William S. Ellis fails to tell the whole  story of the on-going--and most certainly unresolved--mystery of tektite  origin! Oddly, both sides of the constroversy consider the problem solved.   Reading &quot;Glass,&quot; one would assume the &quot;impact&quot; side has  won the debate.  Not true at all!  Ellis fails to mention one of the most  credible theories of tektite origin: That is, that tektites appear to some  geologists and astronomers (and some ceramic scientists)to be  extraterrestrial volcanic glass, probably ejected during ancient silicic  eruptions on the Moon. Also, the author fails to mention that tektite glass  is far too &quot;fined&quot; to have been made in the near-instantaneous  force of terrestrial meteorite impacts, as the mainstream  &quot;impact&quot; scientists contend.  The chemical trends in tektites are  clearly igneous, not sedimentary as noted here and stated by the impact  people.	1999-02-11

The  extended family concepts are marvellous and worthy of emulation today; both  women and men today could learn a lot about sexuality and relationships  from this book--this is a future that would be VERY exciting to live in, at  least for the wonderfully open, loving hetero- homo-, bi-sexuality and  nudity; also nice to see that organized religion may have finally been  extinguished and one of the 10 Commandments--specifically the insane one  regarding the stupid social custom of monogamy--have been revised to fit  human reality!  I could live without the violence and revolution!  This  novel does reference a character from a previous Heinlein work--The Boss,  aka Hartley Baldwin--Friday's partial genetic father--appeared in an RAH  1940s novellete (collected in &quot;Assignment Earth&quot;).  It was nice  to bring him back and flesh out the Boss' secret organization (the Mr. Two  Canes also appears in similar shapes in other Heinlein works--I wonder if  it is intentionally the same character in disguise?).  I like all Heinlein  works, but this is near and dear to me.  (Find the excellent book-on-tape  version narrated by a very SEXY Samantha Eggar!)  Also, the  &quot;Shipstone&quot; concept of atomic power is fascinating; what a world  it would be if such a marvellous power device existed.  I also love the  &quot;pioneering&quot; theme of this, and other, RAH works.  Friday leaves  Earth for a better tomorrow; the old planet is a real mess today as it is  in Friday's distant future (all the more reason to abandon it NOW to the  anti-science luddites and eco-heads and have the smart, visionary  folks-LIKE ME and YOU--head out for the stars!).

A hypervelocity impact happens too quickly to produce the &quot;good,&quot; bubble-free glass of a tektite; and the nearly waterless tektite is as dry as the Moon's surface (the silicate roots of a tektite are igenous/granitic and assuredly not sedimentary as the author notes!).

Futrell), demonstrate conclusively that tektites are extraterrestri! al and of lunar volcanic origin.	1998-07-24

It's almost a new century--why not make a resolution to explore the thrill of safe anal sex?  This is a practical, informative, and mature book. Written by a smart physician who is knowledgeable and experienced himself, I recommended it to a few of my bi and gay male friends. (My wife got curious and ended up sharing it with a close friend of hers, too; it was accepted with relief because so many people are uptight about openly discussing the subject of anal health and pleasure with friends.)  Go, ahead--order this book and explore a whole new world.  This book will &quot;open up&quot; a new dimension in sexual pleasure for you and your loved one(s).	1998-06-30

The highly charged erotic images in this book will haunt you for weeks;  visions of equally exotic and weird women in provocative states of dress and undress.  Kroll demonstrates that fetishism is--for many men and women--both a way of seeing the world and a way of life.  Highly recommended for the collector	1997-11-17
