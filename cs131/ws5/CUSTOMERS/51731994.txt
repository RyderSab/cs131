I remember many Zorros.  As a child, I watched the then \\"old movie,\\" which starred Tyrone Power.  On TV (I don't know what years) there was a Zorro series which was made by Disney with Guy Williams in the title role. In the 1980's a film called The Gay Blade starring George Hamilton was made. It revitalized Hamilton's career and was a funny and interesting spoof of the Zorro character.  More recently, Antonio Bandaras starred in The Mask of Zorro. My reason for pointing out these early films, is just this, I thought that I knew everything about Zorro, and now we're presented with another one.  I wasn't sure that I wanted or needed to know anything more about the masked swordsman; however, I succumbed and read the newest ZORRO, and I did enjoy this new version of the Zorro saga. <br /> <br />Allende's ZORRO is rich with the background of early California and gives us a lot of information about how and why Diego de la Vega became Zorro. We all knew that he was of Spanish heritage, but Allende gives Diego an Indian mother and a grandmother, who teaches him to cherish his Indian blood.  Her influence also makes him want to protect and avenge the oppressed.  Bernardo, who is Diego's best friend, is a solid supporting character. The two had been friends since birth.  They seem to share a mystical mental link and initially, Bernardo is the only one who knows of Diego`s dual persona.  This story is packed with adventure.  Alejandro de la Vega, Diego's father sends his son to Spain when Diego is sixteen.  On the voyage, Diego hones his athletic skills, befriends sailors and even encounters pirates. In Spain, he's taught by a master swordsman, becomes a member of La Justicia and reaches maturity.  He also meets two women who influence his life, the beautiful Juliana and her brainy sister, Isabel.  <br /> <br />ZORRO is an enjoyable and entertaining book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><br />	2005-10-07

The author, Jeff Shaara, did an excellent job of interpreting the characters. His task was a difficult one because his father's book, THE KILLER ANGELS is a classic in the chronicles of Civil War stories.  This book precedes the one written by his father.  <br /> <br />GODS AND GENERALS takes the reader to the beginning of the Civil War and through many of the battles. The major players in the story are Winfield Scott, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Winfield Hancock and Lawrence Chamberlain.  The career biographies of these famous men were striking.  After reading of their early lives and service experiences, it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the Union Army. They were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends. <br /> <br />I listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by Dick Estell.  He brought the characters to life by his narration. This book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history. <br />	2005-09-11

Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of Autism. The condition requires that his entire life be very regimented.  He is brilliant in math and science, but has no understanding of sentimentality or how human relationships work. He can't stand to have anyone touch him, including his parents and life can be very difficult for him and them. Christopher is emotionally disassociated. He works hard to figure things out but seems most comfortable in his own mind.  He is fifteen years old, but often responds to life as a young child.  <br /> <br />The actual story centers on the fact that Christopher discovered the murdered  body of Wellington, the neighbor's poodle.  Someone had used a garden pitchfork to kill the dog. Christopher is shocked by the murder. Since he admires the Sherlock Holmes detective books, he decides that by means of a precise and orderly investigation, he can determine who killed the dog. <br /> <br />This book is so worth reading and I found a gentle and warm humor about the story.  Christopher is amazing and a look into his mind was way beyond anything that I could even imagine. I read the book first and several months later it became my choice for my book club to read. To refresh my memory, I listened to the recorded version and found it to be excellent and I highly recommend that form of the story.  Jeff Woodman, the reader became Christopher in my mind and I can still hear his voice when I think of the story. The members of my book club really enjoyed the book and it promoted one of our longer book discussions. <br /> <br />Don't miss this one! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-11

Dunne was a director and producer of various TV shows and apparently was good at his job.  People enjoyed working with him and he and his wife gave wonderful parties and were invited everywhere. <br /> <br />The book is as much about Dunne and his family as it is about the people that he socialized with.  His story is rather sad because he ended up losing his wife because he became addicted to drugs and the fast Hollywood lifestyle.  There are more than a few moving stories in the book. One pitiful entry has Dunne and Peter Lawford sharing drugs at a party.   Years before, they had been friends and neighbors, but at this low point in their lives, they were both broke and seemingly without friends.  <br /> <br />You can also read about Elizabeth Montgomery, Gig Young, Natalie Wood, George Hamilton, Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda and dozens of other Hollywood \\"big\\" names. Dunne took a lot of photographs and I think that I enjoyed the snapshots as much as I did the text of the book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-17

This story couldn't have been any better. I listened to the recorded book read by Jenny Sterlin and highly recommend it. What could have been, for me, long hours of boring driving actually turned into something to look forward to as Ria's life was revealed, tape by tape. At a certain point, I just had to know what was going to happen in the story and I finished the last four tapes over an afternoon at home. <br /> <br />The book takes Ria from her youth to her marriage to Danny Lynch, who is move-star handsome. Danny also has a fantastic way with him and is in a very successful real estate partnership. His first business venture allows he and Ria to start their marriage off in a fantastic old house on Tara Road. The Lynch family also includes their children, Annie and Brian. On the surface, what seems like a perfect family and marriage is revealed through the colorful and unforgettable characters that are woven through the lives of Ria and Danny. There are mothers, sisters, friends, mother-in-laws, mistresses, shopkeepers and the neighbors on Tara Road. They all seem to make it to Ria's big friendly kitchen. where she feeds them wonderful homemade food and where a cup of tea or coffee is always ready. Ria who is compassionate and generous is also a little naive. Unfortunately, she doesn't always recognize people for who they really are. <br /> <br />After an especially trying time in her marriage, Ria needs time alone and agrees to a two-month house exchange with an American woman named Marilyn.  Ria goes to Connecticut and Marilyn takes over the house on Tara Road. The home exchange gives the two women the opportunity to look at themselves and their lives carefully.

The authors are a husband and wife team who do a lot of research to fit the Victorian time period.  They also introduce some real historic characters into this series. <br /> <br />Kate is now comfortably settled in her new life as mistress of Bishop's Keep, but she still maintains her independent American ways.  On a visit to a house party, she meets Beatrix (Bea) Potter and the two instantly bond.   Bea and Kate find a lot in common, both are in their late twenties and both are writers.  Kate invites Bea back to Bishop's Keep and the two women become real friends. Bea, a shy and very sheltered woman, sees how self-secure that Kate is and thinks that she must gain her own personal freedom from her very domineering parents. <br /> <br />The title, DEATH AT GALLOWS GREEN is a reference to the death of Inspector Oliver, a well-liked local policeman who has been murdered.  The Inspector, known for his honesty, has left behind a wife and precocious daughter named Betsy. When evidence shows that the Inspector may have had his hand in smuggling, Kate, Bea, and their friend Charles Sheridan hope to solve the mystery and insure that the man is cleared of any suspicion of wrong doing.  The welfare of Inspector Oliver's wife and daughter depend on his pension. <br /> <br />Kate and Charles are keenly attracted to each other, and to the dismay of Charles, there may be other suitors interested in the high spirited Kate; however, their romance appears to be   blooming. <br /> <br />For fans of Beatrix Potter's books, the authors have included some of Potter's animal characters in this story. The animals  add a very whimsical and cozy touch.  <br />	2005-07-18

It combines history with awesome stories of real people. The book covers the exploits of famous adventurers like John Cabot, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Thomas Harriot, Ralph Lane, Sir Walter Raleigh, John Smith and Indian princess Pocahontas.     The Lost Colony of Roanoke is discussed with detail.  Beginning with the place to site the colony, the way the colonists were selected, what craftsmen were required, and the amount of food the settlers would need to have in order to survive.  They had to take food that would last until they could plant and harvest there own crops. Food was a constant problem for the settlers and they often had to bargain with the local Indians for grain.    The relationship that the English had with the Indians was often very difficult.  It seemed that the Indians felt that the settlers were greedy and were always asking for help with something that they needed. The Indians were not far from the truth, because many of the colonists were hoping to make a fortune in the New World. When the Indians introduced them to tobacco, the English loved smoking and realized that they could become rich growing the plant, and sending the leaves to England.  Thus, was the beginning of a truly addictive habit that has lasted for hundreds of years.     I've always been intrigued by the story of the Lost Colony, and this book gave a lot of information about the colonists and provided a plausible explanation as to what probably happened to them. Now, I'm hoping to visit Roanoke Island and see the actual site of the colony.    The book's title is derived from the story itself. When the colonists met the most powerful Indian chief in their area, who was named Weroanza Wingina, they learned that it translated to Big Chief.  Then, they began referring to Queen Elizabeth by the same title. BIG CHIEF ELIZABETH is a treasure of fascinating reading!  If you enjoy history, you'll like this book.	2005-06-15

Cary Grant was a unique actor and very private individual, and to my knowledge, he didn't share his thoughts and feelings with the author or to most columnists.       Cary Grant was older than my parents, and by the time that I discovered his films as a teenager, he was already a very mature man. His screen persona was often that of an easy to like and charismatic man. That's exactly why so many of us loved his films.  Yes, he was an actor, but except for a few films, he was almost always the same character. Having read a book by Nancy Nelson called EVENINGS WITH CARY GRANT: Recollections In His Own Words And By Those Who Knew Him Best, I really feel that he did show something of his genuine personality in his work.  Marc Eliot insinuates that Grant hurt most of the women that he was involved with by his remoteness; however, the author also tells us that Grant attracted women by the droves and many women he dated wanted to marry him. So, who really knows what happens in an individual's private life?  Do any of us want to marry all of the various people that we meet?      The overall look at Grant's life was fairly extensive, but I didn't like the way that the author chose to tell us how Grant felt about everything and why he reacted in the way that he did to various situations.  The author made Grant into an unlikable and neurotic person.  Unfortunately, once you're dead, a lot of unproven claims can be made!    I'm giving this book a one star rating. The video research that the author did on Grant's films seemed pretty extensive. but I don't recommend this story of Cary Grant's private life.	2005-06-05

It's their first story in a series of Victorian mysteries. The authors are writing under the name of Robin Paige. I recently became interested in the books when Susan Albert gave a talk at my local library.  Her lecture was very interesting and she touched a little bit into the history of the forensic sciences that were just starting to be developed during the Victorian age. I was intrigued and ready to read the first story. <br /> <br />Kate Ardleigh is the main character of DEATH AT BISHOP`S KEEP. She's a strong and independent American woman who leaves New York when summoned to England by her aunt, Sabrina Ardleigh. Kate was unaware that she even had any relatives left in England.  She's actually asked to be her aunt's secretary.  Sabrina's home is called Bishop's Keep where she lives with her sister.  Kate loves the idea of traveling to England and because she's a secret writer of short stories for a monthly magazine, she feels that she'll acquire a lot of fascinating material for her stories. Aunt Sabrina is a kind woman who Kate admires.  Surprisingly, she is a member of a clandestine group called the Order of the Golden Dawn.  Kate learns a little about the organization while working on Aunt Sabrina's papers. Unfortunately, Sabrina's sister, Bernice Jaggers shows no welcome to her niece and tells her that she didn't want her to come and to address her as Aunt Jaggers. <br /> <br />At the beginning of Kate's visit, the body of an unknown man is found at a local archaeological dig.  When some other deaths take place, Kate feels that there must be some connection to the first death. Sir Charles Sheridan is the duel character to Kate.  He's a wealthy and intelligent man who is fascinated with all of the new sciences that are just emerging. He and Kate meet and find each other to be interesting, but a kind of rivalry is sparked between them when they both becomeinvolved in helping to solve the mysteries. <br /> <br />I liked the premise and I'm looking forward to reading the next story.  From my own experience, a series like this can get even better when the characters become more seasoned and start playing off one another <br /> <br />	2005-05-28

Many of the names we know from legends, and others are in our history books. There were quite a few of these women who I had never heard of before. <br /> <br />The biographies in WOMEN are divided into the following nineteen categories. They are: The First Woman, The Myths of Creation, The Epic Heroines, The Founders, The Intercessors, The Sirens, The Royal Favorites, The Inspirations, The Devout, Femmes Fatales, The Outlaws, The Fighters, The Healers, The Writers, The Artists, The Stars, The Politically Powerful and The Seekers of Wisdom. <br /> <br />I'm not particularly interested in the complete story of characters from myths, but just reading what they are known for was sufficient for me. Some of the Myths of Creations mentioned are: Hine-Nui-Te-Po of the Pacific Island Civilizations, Sedna of the Eskimo Civilizations and Amaterasu of the Japanese Civilization. <br /> <br />I have to say that I preferred the following biographies: The Fighters such as Creek Mary and Helen Keller; The Healers like Florence Nightingale and Mother Teresa; The Writers, Mariana Alcoforado, The Bronte Sisters, Virginia Woolf, Karen Blixen and Agatha Christie; The Artists, Clara Schumann, Coco Chanel, and Georgia O'Keeffe; The Politically Powerful, Cleopatra, Theodora, Isabella the Catholic, Mary Stuart, Elizabeth I, Christina of Sweden, Catherine The Great, Queen Victoria, Tz'u-Hsi, Eva Peron and Margaret Thatcher; The Seekers of Wisdom include, Sister Juana Ines De La Cruz, Marie Curie, Hypatia of Egypt, and Rachel Carson. <br /> <br />I think that this is a good reference book for a personal library and it would also make a good conversation piece as a coffee table book. I feel that it is an excellent and easy way to learn abut the lives of many famous women. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-28

In Cornwall, she also meets Daniel Cassens, a well-known artist who she finds quite attractive.  What follows is a story that involves everyone that I've mentioned and it all takes place in beautiful Cornwall. <br /> <br />For complete enjoyment and relaxation all that's needed is a Pilcher book and a cup of Earl Grey.

What caught my attention was the cover that has a photograph of Thomas Jefferson's beautiful Monticello.  <br /> <br />Including the cover, there are twenty color photographs featuring historic homes. They are: Mount Vernon, Stratford Hall, Carter's Grove, Kenmore, The Carlyle House, Bacon's Castle, The Nelson House, Shirley, Gunston Hall, Montpelier, Smithfield, Belle Grove, Kerr Place, Poplar Forest, Point of Honor, The White House of the Confederacy, The Woodrow Wilson House and Sutherlin House. A brief description of each home is provided along with the date it was built and who lived there.  <br /> <br />A TASTE OF VIRGINIA is also a book filled with recipes of foods that Virginians have favored since Colonial times. Many of these recipes are still enjoyed today. Over one hundred recipes are included.  Here are some of those: Batter Bread, Sally Lunn Bread, Eastern Shore Sweet Potato Biscuits, Oyster Stew, Crab Cakes, Steamed Rockfish, Smothered Chicken, Virginia Ham, Candied Sweet Potatoes, Blackeyed Peas And Stewed Tomatoes, Green Pea Salad, Fresh Tomato Casserole, Pepper Sherry, Pears Baked with Ginger, Pecan Squares, Squash Pie, Apple Betty, Brandy Pecan Cake, Tutti Frutti and Pound Cake. The recipes are not from any specific family, but foods that are popular in the Old Dominion. <br /> <br />As someone who really loves traveling, I can honestly say that a book like this that combines both history and cookery is unique. I hope to find similar books when I make visits to other states. This is a gem of a book! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-11

It's considered a \\"young adult\\" story, but it is certainly worth reading and the history it supplied was exactly what I was looking for. <br /> <br />CAST TWO SHADOWS takes place in South Carolina and details the privileged life of 14-year old Caroline Whitaker. Caroline, the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner has been very fortunate and up until now, has had a wonderful life.   Now, that life has abruptly changed because of the Revolutionary War.  Since her father is a Patriot and her brother sided with the British, Caroline's feelings are conflicted.  To make matters even worse, the British hang her best friend and she is a witness to the horrible spectacle. <br /> <br />The title is also a reference to Caroline's situation in life.  Raised as the daughter of a white family, she has to recognize her other shadow.  Her grandmother, Miz Melindy is a slave on the plantation. Faced with hardships, Caroline's learns to confront life and trust her instincts. She also learns to understand the two very different sides of her background.

It's easy for the reader to get involved in the lives of the five daughters because the characters are all interesting. The stories go through their courtships, loves and family secrets. Leah, the main character continues her life of caring for her younger brother and sister. Her Baby sister, Lydiann is growing up and may be heading for some romantic problems. This is an excellent series and I've found them to be very entertaining. All of the books are cliffhangers and keep the reader in suspense until the next book comes out.  Fortunately, the author, Beverly Lewis, seems able to write quickly. She's also able to keep coming up with different problems for the Ebersol family to handle. <br /> <br />I don't want to give away any of this particular story, but in many ways it didn't come up to the other books.  I felt that the author dragged out THE PRODIGAL a little too much. I think that this book should have wrapped up the series, but there's at least one more book to read. Of course, I will read the next book, but I think that it may be time to tie up all of the loose parts and end this series. <br />	2005-04-26

The first book is called A FREE MAN OF COLOR and I believe that this book is much easier to understand and enjoy if it's read after the primary story. <br /> <br />Ben is a black man, who had been freed from slavery and left New Orleans, went to France where he was educated as a doctor and  returned to New Orleans. The year is 1833 and Ben has to be very careful, people are dying of Bronze John which is the name for cholera.  To add to the terrible season, a gang of men are stealing freed black people off the streets, and reselling them into slavery in different areas of the country.  Ben's constantly worried that he will be kidnapped and sold into slavery again.  He carries his papers with him, and maintains copies of those papers in several different places.  Ben, although a medical doctor is not allowed to fully practice medicine and has to make his living as a musician.  He stays in New Orleans because it is his home, and he has family there, but he often thinks about the freedom that he had in France.  He's a kind and religious character, and really tries to be a good person. As in the first book, there is a very interesting mystery that Benjamin is working to discover. <br /> <br />I really like this series. I think that the author's done a terrific job in her research into the 1840's of New Orleans. There is a lot of information to take in, and many characters to keep track of, but certainly worth the read. <br />	2005-03-28

Chevalier consistently writes very unique stories.  This book has a sense of realism that made me feel as if I was seeing a  glimpse into the Middle Ages. <br /> <br />The author has woven her story around the very real Lady and the Unicorn Tapestries that are presently in a Paris museum.  The artisans and artist who created them are unknown. Chevalier creates the artist in the form of Nicholas des Innocents, a talented and handsome man. He's commissioned by a wealthy Parisian nobleman to design tapestries for his great hall. Before he leaves France, Nicholas falls in love with the nobleman's daughter.  When Nicholas goes to Brussels we're introduced to the family of weavers who do the actual work in the creation of the tapestries.  There the artist meets another young girl, this time, the weaver's daughter. Some characters seem to become intertwined into the work of the tapestries.   <br /> <br />A very interesting part of the story was the influence and power that the weaver's guild had over the lives of their workmen. In fact, women were not allowed to do any of the actual weaving.  This is a rich and haunting story.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-02

Her recording is wonderful, and I highly recommend listening to the tapes. A great deal of French words and phrases are used in the story and hearing them spoken was very helpful to me since I don't know that language. <br /> <br />ELIZABETH AND MARY is a well-written book and I applaud Jane Dunn for her hard work. The story or I should say stories are beautifully written and I learned quite a bit about the two queens. The author reverses back and forth between Elizabeth and Mary with their individual biographies. She keeps the book alive with what was happening in their lives at the same time in history. <br /> <br />I have a new respect and understanding for both ladies.  They were entirely different in their personalities and the way they were raised. That, I think, is what eventually gave them their places in history. Elizabeth, as the daughter of Anne Boleyn (who had been put to death by King Henry VIII) lived in fear of her life for years.  She learned to be careful and diplomatic.  On the other hand, Mary was born to be the Queen of Scotland and a Princess of France. In her early life she had the good council of her mother and uncles to guide her. Her beauty and charm drew people to her and her royal status gave her a certain confidence. Unfortunately, in her later years, she lacked good advice and her often-reckless actions led to her downfall.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-29

Ben was born a slave in Louisiana.  He was eventually set free, left America and went to France, where he married, and became a medical doctor. <br /> <br />The book actually begins in 1822, when after sixteen years of living in France, Ben returns to the Creole society of New Orleans. Since he's black, he's not allowed to practice medicine. Fortunately, he is also a very talented musician, and is able to make his living by teaching piano and performing at social functions.  Ben experiences culture shock on his return to America.  When he had previously lived in Louisiana, the French and Spanish dominated the area and now, the Americans are very prominent and powerful. Ben also has to adjust to the change in his family.  His young light skinned sister is now a placee and his older sister is involved in voodoo.  Ben tries to find a way to live in Louisiana, but he's constantly comparing it to his life in Paris. When Angelique Crozat, a beautiful placee is killed, Ben becomes involved in finding her murderer. Placee was the name given to the light skinned women of color, who became the mistresses of white planters. <br /> <br />The book is a little difficult to follow since so many characters are introduced in the first chapter.  Keeping them straight is a challenge, but the story becomes so interesting that even though it's necessary to keep going back, and rereading earlier passages, I didn't really mind. This is an fascinating story, and I plan to read the next book in this series. <br /> <br />	2004-11-25

It's filled with stories, beautiful photographs, delicious recipes and the charm of Rosamunde Pilcher herself. Many family photographs are included and they add personal warmth to the book.<br /><br />Starting with some remembrances in A Very Special Holiday, Pilcher then discusses a little of the history of sending Christmas cards and includes some interesting lore. The practice was started in Great Britain around 1843 and the original cards were religious.  Later, the family scenes were introduced, followed by pictures of Father Christmas, and snow scenes featuring birds, which were usually robins.<br /><br />The Christmas Baking section was especially enjoyable. She says that her kitchen, \\"is comfortably warm even on the coldest days, thanks to the Aga, the typically British gas-fired stove, which is actually more an oven whose fire is never allowed to die down in the winter.\\" Rosamunde talks about the traditional family foods that she makes and includes several recipes.  She mentions mince pies, turkey and short bread, but I'm intrigued to try the more unfamiliar recipes, for example, Drop Scones, Oatcakes, and Whisky Loaf.<br /><br />A short story called \\" Miss Cameron at Christmas,\\" is featured and completes this wonderful Christmas offering. My favorite quotation from Rosamunde is, \\"The smell of tangerines is one of the true smells of Christmas.\\" I couldn't agree more! I always associate tangerines with Christmas.<br /><br />This book is most satisfying.	2004-11-19

The only problem is her cousin Sinclair. He was the companion of her youth, he's handsome and dynamic and she's always loved him.<br /><br />This is not Pilcher's best book, but still worth reading.	2004-11-17

For reasons known only to her, his mother gave him that first name when he was an infant. Odd's parents are very unusual people.  His mother is psychotic and his father is a self-centered con man. He realized early on that his parents didn't really care for him and so he learned to care for himself. He actually is rather odd.  He has the capability to see dead people.  At times he can also see the future. He never told his parents about his secret powers, because he instinctively knew that they couldn't be trusted and would exploit him.  As a young man he left home and gradually gathered his own circle of friends. People that know his secret and that he can trust.  Despite his unusual and often unpleasant gifts, he is a charming and very likeable young man. He has a wonderful girlfriend that he loves, and a job that he enjoys. <br /> <br />When Odd starts having some dreams of impending violence and he spots a man who is surrounded by black shadowy spirits, he knows that something terrible is about to happen.  <br /> <br />My husband and I are both fans of Dean Koontz. We've read all of his books and enjoy his work as much for the characters as we do the exceptional stories. We had one problem with this story, the ending. It's very clever and unexpected. I can even understand why he wrote it, but I wish he hadn't. It's a fascinating book and I believe it would lend itself well to a sequel. Odd Thomas is one of the very best of the many interesting characters created by this author. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-17

Her books are unique because she's able to take the reader into a world, where life seems ordinary, but somehow, totally interesting. <br /> <br />Miriam Quinn has never married. She's a kind, but unsentimental lady.  By today's standards, she's still young, but fifty years ago she would have been called an old maid! She's an efficient office manger and has a well ordered life that she enjoys. Her plans to spend a quiet and unadorned Christmas holiday painting her new home are abruptly interrupted.  Her brother, a minister with a busy schedule calls upon her to come and help out his family.  His wife is in the hospital and he needs someone to care for his two children. <br /> <br />Her winter holiday turns out to be filled with her duties as chief cook, housekeeper and substitute mother for her two nieces. She meets the challenge, but gains new respect for her sister-in-law when she realizes the amount of work that a young mother has to do.  Miriam also makes a wonderful Christmas for everyone and meets an old friend from her past. <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading about some of the English Christmas traditions and recommend this story for a cozy Christmas read. <br /> <br />	2004-11-13

It's that rare book where a decorator actually shows the reader some photographs of their lived-in home. It's truly a beautiful book and filled with April's beautiful fabrics and home furnishings. <br /> <br />I loved the dining room that has a plate shelf set below the crown molding.  The shelf is charmingly filled with a collection of plates. What appears to be an armoire is against one wall, and is described as \\" this old British colonial cabinet from India.\\"   The table is covered with a yellow and red floral cloth, and the room is personal and very livable. <br /> <br />Even the small area vignettes where Cornell's textiles are displayed are interesting. The gardens have tables covered with lovely cloths and chairs with coordinating cushions. The bedrooms are dressed in the dreamiest of bed linens. Assorted pillows are added to patchwork quilts to make the beds look so comforting and all are delightful to behold. <br /> <br />The studio, kitchen and living room are also shown.  Each room, very individual, attractive and comfortable. So often, books of this type are presented with products in artificial decorator settings. In that situation, the rooms often seem too unreal and cold. That's not the case here. I can honestly say that this beautiful book took my breath away! <br />	2004-11-10

There are a few photographs of decorated mantles and dinner tables, but no rooms or houses are ever shown. This book is all about making Christmas decorations and holiday food! I think that the book would have been even better if a few homes were shown embllished with some of the very beautiful decorations displayed on every page.  <br /> <br />There is information about using live trees and the containers that would suit them.  Also shown are various types of artificial trees. About ten of the trees are decorated and instructions are given on how to make those decorations. I especially enjoyed seeing a twig tree, all leafless branches that were hung with gingerbread cookies and cranberry garlands. A Holly topiary tree was also unique with pear ornaments and a partridge sitting in a nest. <br /> <br />The reader can also learn to make beautiful wreaths, garlands, topiaries, gift-wrappings, cards, and a very unusual Advent Calendar. The directions are all concise and clear. <br /> <br />The Christmas Food section was by far the most enticing part of this production.  The food looks scrumptious and is shown in the most gorgeous of photographs. The meals are titled: Christmas Eve in Provence, North American Christmas Lunch, a German Christmas Dinner and a Norwegian Christmas Buffet.  Besides traditional desserts, the Cakes and Cookies section offers many international treats; for example, Polish Spiced Cake, Scottish Shortbread and Greek Honey Cake. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-30

Just a leisurely look through the book and without reading anything, you can get plenty of decorating ideas.  The various ways of carving pumpkins into traditional jack o' lanterns, celestial pumpkins, or even a chandelier is enlightening.  No pun intended!  The instructions are given for all of the decorative ways to carve the scrumptious gourds. <br /> <br />The chapter called Trading Faces has several different makeup applications; including those for a witch, a skeleton, a mummy, a cat and a vampire. The chapter on Haunting a House has lots of ways to make the house scary.  A unique idea was to make the silhouette of someone standing on the stairs.  Very effective!  The Crafty Party chapter has ways to decorate everything in the house. There are ideas for table decorations, masks, and party favors. <br /> <br />Wickedly Good Menus is, of course, the chapter on food.  There are about 20 recipes included.  The following recipes sound especially bewitching: White Bean & Sausage Stew in Pumpkin Shells, The Devil's Salsa. and The Great Pumpkin Cake.

Their leader is a very determined former KGB colonel who happens to be 92-years old. <br /> <br />I listened to the recorded book that was well read by Richard Ferrone.

She is to pick up Reba Lafferty from prison and escort her home. Reba had been serving time for embezzling money from the company where she worked. Fortunately, Reba has a very wealthy father who has employed Kinsey to look after his daughter. Kinsey takes on the assignment to baby-sit for Reba.  At first, the job seems pretty easy, but then Kinsey realizes that Reba is secretly meeting her former boss and continuing a love affair with him. This is the very same man who she supposedly embezzled the money from.  Kinsey finds out, from an old cop friend, Cheney Phillips, that the IRS is looking at Reba's former boss for money laundering. All is not well, and because Kinsey likes Reba, she gets involved in a very dangerous situation. <br /> <br />Kinsey hasn't had a serious love interest for quite a long time.

This author has written many interesting stories. Often, the characters overlap from one story to the next; however, the books are independent of each other. Saying that, I also have to add, if you read the previous stories, you won't be sorry. <br /> <br />The two main characters tell this story.  Carta Graham is a brainy and attractive woman who went through a life-crisis and found hope with Christianity.  She gave up being a high-powered attorney to become a fundraiser and office manager for a church called St. Benet's-by-the-Wall. There is also a Healing Center attached to St. Benet's. The Healing Center helped Carta and many other people during the difficult times in their lives. <br /> <br />The other main character is Gavin Blake an extremely handsome man. Carta and Gavin meet by chance and seem to have an instant attraction to each other.  Gavin comes on strong and aggressively flirts with Carta. She's completely bewildered and is taken by surprise because Carta knows that Gavin is the lover of her former law partner, Richard.  <br /> <br />In many ways, this book is difficult to read because it takes the reader into the seamy and depressing world of the London sex trade.  In fact, Gavin refers to himself as a leisure worker.  Carta does not want to have anything to do with Gavin, and discusses the situation with Nicholas Darrow, who is a priest and the Rector of St. Benet's. He tells her that helping Gavin out of his terrible life may be something that God wants her to do. <br /> <br />Susan Howatch always gives the reader a lot to think about. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-24

It's part modern time and part historic fiction. This is the dual story of Ella Turner who lived in the twentieth century and Isabelle du Moulin who lived hundreds of years earlier. <br /> <br />When Ella and Rick Turner move from the United States to France, Ella feels a sense of familiarity to the small quaint town which is now her home. She's tormented by strange dreams and feels that many of the town's people react to her in a negative way. She often dreams of a red haired woman who wears the color blue. <br /> <br />A dual narrative also gives us the story of red haired, Isabelle du Moulin who lived in the seventeenth century at a very difficult time when religious freedom was not an option.  The Catholic religion still had some influence, but the Calvinists had become strong and any display of love of the Virgin Mary was punished.    <br /> <br />I've read all of Tracy Chevalier's books and have thoroughly enjoyed all of her very rich and imaginative stories.

It's the lovely story of a redheaded orphan who finds a home with elderly siblings, Matthew Cuthbert and his sister Marilla.  They had actually requested that the orphanage send them a boy to help Matthew around the old family farm. A mistake was make and Anne Shirley, an eleven-year old girl, came instead.  Anne is charming, sincere and has a lot to say about everything. Marilla and Matthew are, at first, amazed at this very out-spoken child, and don't want to keep her. They give her a chance and come to believe it's the smartest thing that they ever did.  This story is delightful and filled with beautiful prose and lovely images.<br /><br />I listened to a recorded book that was read by Barbara Caruso.

When they tune on the television, they find that the entire world is experiencing the same type of disturbance and is being invaded by Aliens.  One upbeat part of the story, is the superior dogs that were on hand to help humanity.  I love it when Koontz includes dogs in his books! <br /> <br />I listened to the audio book read by Ariadne Meyers.  She gave a wonderful reading. This book, because of the very long descriptive passages, probably comes off better when it's read to you.  It's like being told a scary story by someone with a lot of vocal range.

Scarpetta's comrades, Detective Pete Merino and her niece Lucy both take an active part in this book, but like Kay Scarpetta, they lack luster. All of the characters seem to be showing the dark and unlikable traits in their personalities.  <br /> <br />Starting with the book's title, I found the entire story to be disconcerting and distasteful,   <br />	2004-09-28

In 1944, when she was twenty-one years old, she was enlisted in the English army and her assignment as a driver took her to Paris.  It was an exciting time because the French were jubilant over the liberation of France. Elizabeth joined in the celebrations, but became separated from her English army companion.  Intoxicated from hours of drinking, she splashed around with a group of other celebrants in a fountain. Wet, exhausted and cold, she was approached by Patrice Ambard, a charming and well-dressed man who befriends her.  When he finds out that she's alone, he offers to take her to his home to dry off. Drunk and unable to remember where her hotel is, she goes with him.  She's seduced and ends up madly in love with Patrice. Thus, she began a new life.  Patrice owned a high-class brothel, and Lise becomes a prostitute and was known as the notorious Madam Lise Ambard. She was also referred to as La Balafree, the Scarred One.<br /><br />Her life is told through flashbacks and the book actually begins with her in a convent that is run by the French Dominican Sisters of Bethanie. This particular order of Sisters work in helping drug addicts, vagrants, prisoners and prostitutes. Lise's story unfolds, as she remembers her past and the circumstances of her life. Despite the sordid early life that Lise led, this is actually a story of faith, love and forgiveness.<br /><br />The title, FIVE FOR SORROW, TEN FOR JOY is a reference to the rosary.  The Rosary, is a Catholic tradition where the different prayers reflect on the life of Jesus.<br /><br />The author of this fascinating story is Rumer Godden. She is the superb author of dozens of wonderful books for both adults and children. Three of her most well known stories were also turned into films.  They are, IN THIS HOUSE OF BREDE, THE PEACOCK SPRING and BLACK NARCISSUS.	2004-09-07

He and Liza Prior Lucy designed and created over 20 original quilt patterns for this book.  Upon receiving the book, I immediately spent over an hour of time just perusing the pages and reading the descriptions of the gorgeous patchwork quilts. <br /> <br />Fassett's patchwork interpretations are wonderful, but, as always, it's the rich color combinations that make his work so enjoyable. Some of my favorites are: the Gypsy Garden Quilt in lush reds and greens; the Moody Blues Quilt is rich in jewel tones; the Japanese Brocades quilt is a garden of large and small muted flowers; the Hat Boxes Quilt has 36 different boxes, each made up in a different flora pattern; Nona's Quilt, which Fassett patterned after an embroidery piece that had been a gift from his grandmother, is done in a geometric design of yellows, pinks, lavender and greens. Fassett says that the original piece had been stolen from him and he did the design from memory. I believe my overall favorite is the Haitian Fonthill Quilt. It's an angled quilt done in rich vibrant colors and bordered with purple and lavender flowers.  <br /> <br />I also enjoyed several quilts that were a combination of old and new.  The authors purchased old bundles of patchwork blocks and put them together with new material and made quilts.  Those quilts are featured in the introduction to the book and are called: Medallion Circles, Granny's Flower Garden and String Stars. Kaffe spoke of attending a quilt festival where vendors \\"bring old patchwork tops or just bundles of blocks that were meticulously sewn together to become part of someone's bright idea for a quilt. Either the creator of these died, or just got distracted.  All that work will have gone to waste if someone else doesn't take these blocks and build a quilt around them.  I can't tell you how stimulating it is to do just that.\\"  <br /> <br />I believe that anyone who enjoysmaking quilts or just looking at beautiful handmade creations would love PASSIONATE PATCHWORK. <br /> <br />  <br />	2004-08-16

Also, the reviews are quite good. <br /> <br />This is a very original story that makes you think and remember your own childhood. Carmel McBain, the main character is the only child of working class parents who want the best for her. Unfortunately, her mother is overbearing and almost kills the spirit and life of her daughter. Carmel is constantly told what her parents have given up for her and what their expectations are.  Her life, rigidly controlled by her mother, includes the nagging pressure to always be among the top of her class. Carmel would like to participate in helping around the house and other activities, but the constraint that her mother uses won't allow it.  Carmel is to spend all of her time studying so that she can be accepted in the best schools <br /> <br />Mrs. McBain unfairly compares Carmel to Karina, a girl from the neighborhood and Carmel's schoolmate. Karina is the daughter of immigrants and has a lot of duties and responsibilities at home. The two girls don't really like each other, but are thrown together by their mothers. Karina knows what to say to parents and teachers, but to Carmel she is vicious and nasty. She's a person who we've all met somewhere in our lives, who tell those in authority exactly what they want to hear and then makes snide remarks to their peers.   <br /> <br />Carmel makes other friends, but Karina is always lurking in the background of her life. Unfortunately, she's saddled with Karina for most of her school years. Carmel suffers more than her share of the agonies of growing up.  Eventually, something has to give and it does with a sad price. <br /> <br />It's one of those books that the reader gets the idea about what's going on, but nothing is ever completely explained. I have a thousand questions that I'd like to ask the author. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-14

It took me several tapes to become accustomed to her style of reading, which was very slow.  <br /> <br />ENEMY WOMEN takes place during the American Civil War, and is the story of Adair Colley, an 18-year old girl from the southeastern part of Missouri. The first part of the book begins with a history of Missouri at the time of the Civil War. The Union and Confederate positions are explained and the reader is given the complete background for the story.  After that each chapter begins with some historic information which is documented. <br /> <br />Adair Colley, her brother and two sisters live with their father who is a respected member of his community and a Justice of the Peace.  He decides to stay neutral and have nothing to do with the armies inhabiting his state, but the militia will not accept his position and he is arrested. After the Union militia arrests Adair's father, they set the house on fire and steal almost everything that the family owns, including their livestock.  Adair and her two younger sisters follow the militia so that they can plead for their father. He is innocent of being a spy, but if you are not acclaimed as a Union supporter, you were considered guilty. When Adair herself is denounced as a spy and imprisoned, she faces a horrible existence. Her interrogator is Major William Neumann. The only way she can get out is to admit to a crime that she didn't commit or, if possible, escape. Major Neumann despises his job and tries to help Adair.  Their attraction to each other leads to their falling in love, but when he's reassigned, she must find a way to get out of the prison. <br /> <br />I had no previous knowledge of the part that Missouri played in the Civil War and this story was almost shocking in the way that entire families suffered immense deprivation and even lost their homes.  Mothers and daughters of soldiers were imprisoned along with thieves, murderers and prostitutes. It was a sad time in the history of the United States. <br />	2004-08-13

I began with this one because I thought it was the first in the series, but after I started reading, I discovered that it's actually the second book.  The first is called THYME OF DEATH. I like the fact that a plant name is used in the title of each of these stories. <br /> <br />China Bayles is a retired attorney and had previously practiced law in Houston, but had given up that profession to pursue a kinder and gentler life.  She now lives in a small town in Texas, where she grows and sells plants. She specializes in herbs. There are several references to different plants and herbs which I enjoyed reading about. <br /> <br />I found this book to be entertaining and I liked China Bayles, the main character.  The first part begins with a gathering of China and several of her girl friends at a Halloween party. Some of the women are a little weird in their choice of interests. One woman even has a garden of poisonous plants. When a gruesome murder takes place, China becomes involved and uses her skills as a prosecuting attorney to help solve the mystery. To me, the most interesting parts of the book concerned the tidbits of how an attorney views the evidence of a crime.  I think that made the story jell together and become more engaging.  <br /> <br />I plan to read more books in this series and hope to see the China Bayles character become more developed. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-03

I live about 20 miles away from Middleburg, and it is a great place to go for lunch or dinner.  The town is charming and historic and it's always fun to browse the antique shops.<br />Vicky Moon did a good job in writing about Middleburg.  Her style is pleasant and she provides a lot of detailed information. I'm sure that the long time residents of the town had a few laughs over some of the outrageous behavior that's mentioned in the book. I think that adding the section called, Hunting Terms was a good idea.  For those of us who are not familiar with fox hunting or equestrian activity, it was nice to have those terms explained. The author tells lots of stories and antidotes and with the exception of some of the nationally known residents like the Kennedy's, I really didn't know much about the families or \\"old guard\\" who live in the Middleburg area. I found the book to be very enlightening.	2004-07-12

This book is more of a celebration of her work rather than her personal history, although, I did learn a little of her background. <br />Rosamunde Scott was born in Lelant, England, a small village in Cornwall; however, she's lived in Dundee, Scotland, since 1955. The book gives a short, but interesting account from Pilcher, about looking for and eventually finding a flat for sale in a beautiful Victorian Bank Building in Dornoch, Scotland. The flat was apparently used as a vacation home. The book also contains quite a few wonderful old and new family photographs, and several of Pilcher's recipes. <br />I loved the photograph of \\"The Elms,\\" which was the Scott home, where Rosamunde spent her childhood. Another interesting picture is the one of Talland House in St. Ives. It was the home of Florence Pilcher Dow, Rosamunde's mother-in-law. We're told that Talland House was once the home of Virginia Woolf's family. <br />There are many excerpts given from Pilcher's books. They are accompanied by glorious photographs and paintings that really illustrate her stories. The cover of the book shows an enchanting Tudor style cottage that's located in Cornwall. My guess was that it might be Pilcher's home, but it's actually another illustration of the type of house that often shows up in her stories. I also thought that the interiors shown were from Pilcher's own home, but they were not identified as such. I believe they were, again, used to illustrate the excerpts from her stories. I admit to being a little disappointed that they were not her rooms.<br />I consider this to be a \\"coffee table\\" book, easy reading accompanied by lovely pictures.	2004-07-02

Over the last few months I've been in my car quite a bit and there's absolutely nothing better to help the time pass like a Pilcher book! <br />WILD MOUNTAIN THYME is the story of Victoria Bradshaw who was jilted by her lover only to have him come back to her several years later.  He doesn't come alone; he brings, Thomas, his two-year-old baby for Victoria to care for. Oliver Dobbs is a London playwright and the perfect prototype of a self-centered and egotistical man. Victoria is sweep off her feet for the second time in her life and goes to Scotland with Oliver to visit Roddy, his old friend. Victoria runs into John, who happens to be Roddy's nephew.  She had met John before, but only very briefly at party in London. John instantly dislikes Oliver, and takes more than a casual interest in Victoria and how she's destroying her life. I had a pretty good understanding of all of the characters except Victoria.  She was just too bland and weak. I think that the story would have been better had she been a little stronger.  <br />The best part of the book is the wonderful and very poetic descriptions of Scotland and the enchanting people who live there. The author really does know how to capture the reader and transport you into a different time and place. Donada Peters did the reading of my recorded book and I can't say enough about her magnificent voice and the way she handled all of the different characters and their individual accents.	2004-06-27

He left after he decided not to become a priest. He told his parents that he wanted to travel, and his father told him that poor people where not able to travel, unless they were shepherds. So, Santiago became a shepherd and moved his flock of sheep all over Spain. He learned a great deal from his sheep, but he made sure to keep reading and he always carried a book with him.<br />He encounters many people on his journeys, including a king, a gypsy and a true alchemist. The alchemist tells Santiago to \\"tell his heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself, and that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second encounter with God and with eternity.\\" In the desert he learns to see with both his eyes and his heart, he also meets Fatima and falls in love.<br />This book is simply written, but I can already tell that certain parts of the story will always remain in my mind.	2004-06-26

Both books start off a little slowly, but if you persevere, the pace picks up and, it seems like each chapter is more exciting. The main character is Robert Langdon, an American professor from Harvard.  His field is Semiotics, the study and theory of signs and symbols,<br /><br />Author Dan Brown takes on the Opus Dei organization along with another ancient secret society whose members were supposed to be some of the greatest men of the world, including Sir Isaac Newton and Leonardo da Vinci. The story begins in France where Robert Langdon is on a lecture tour.  He's due to meet with a famous museum curator when the police advise him that the curator was killed.  The man's body is laid out, in what appears to be a ritualistic fashion.  Robert assumes that the police want his expertise in helping to solve the murder, but he's warned by Sophie Neveu, a French Cryptologist, that the police believe that Robert is the killer.  Because of information that she's received, she knows that he's innocent.  Robert and Sophie team up to solve the mystery which leads them into amazing and mind boggling discoveries.<br /><br />This author writes fascinating action fiction that keeps you interested and wanting to know more; however, his characters are a little bland. The exception is Lee, a wealthy Englishman who is also an expert in ancient symbols. I found him to be engaging and the most arresting character in the story.<br /><br />Judith Miller	2004-06-14

However, I feel that HIDDEN IN PLAIN VIEW has no substance and offers no new information that can be validated. The authors base their premise, that quilts were used as a tool to help slaves escape, on the word of a woman who sells quilts in South Carolina. The theory was that quilts with different symbols were displayed and they gave messages to the slaves. The authors also went back into African history and attempted to tie in a lot of symbols. I believe the authors were trying, but they really had no solid information to offer and kept on spinning their story.<br />It is possible that along a route going north, a quilt could be displayed outside of a house as a message that this was a \\"safe house\\" or something of that nature.  Escaping slaves mostly traveled by night, so hanging out a quilt would only work during the daylight hours. There's a story for children called SWEET CLARA AND THE FREEDOM QUILT that is quite good.  The girl in the story makes a quilt out of scraps of material that detail the plantation that she lives on; also detailed, was the area outside the plantation, which was more difficult since the girl had to have that area described to her. In the book, the quilt is used as a map for anyone attempting to escape and go to Canada. I really liked the idea and found it plausible.<br />I think, that after all of this time, we'll never know for sure if quilts were hung as signals for the travelers on the Underground Railroad, but the idea of a quilt helping to save a human life is comforting.	2004-06-09

The title is the nickname for the Broken DIS Ranch where this story takes place. <br />Benni Harper Ortiz and her family are helping some old friends turn their family cattle ranch into a guest ranch. The timing is bad because Joe Darnell, the owner of Broken DIS, died prior to the opening of the ranch. Joe's daughter, Shawna, and her husband, Johnny, are now in charge of the endeavor.  Benni has the idea to add a quilting seminar as an extra attraction for visitors. Victory Simpson, a well know quilting teacher, is hired to conduct classes for the guests. The events include trail rides, photography lessons, quilting, a domino competition and other joint activities. Benni's, Grandma Dove is also involved helping out at Broken DIS and, as usual, she provides some comic relief. A lost goose attaches himself to Dove and becomes her self-proclaimed protector. He follows her everywhere and viciously attacks any man who comes near.<br />After the guests arrive, a lot of things go wrong at Broken DIS, including a stable fire, a runaway bull and the discovery of an unmarked grave. Shawna and Johnny are worried because one of the guests is a nationally known vacation writer who checks out new vacation spots.  A poor review of the dude ranch could be disastrous for Broken DIS.<br />This story brings back Detective Ford \\"Hud\\" Hudson, a handsome man that Benni's husband dislikes for good reason. Hud is very attracted to Benni and doesn't hide it. There are some fun characters in this book, including Loretta, Reba, Pinky and Gaynelle, four female cousins from Georgia, who have Detective Hudson on their most wanted list.<br />Gabe Ortiz, Benni's husband, has a very small part in this book and I believe it left somewhat of a void in the story. He's become as important as Grandma Dove to this series.	2004-06-05

The charming illustrations of Sandi Wickersham Resnick enhance and firmly place the story into the mind of the reader. The illustrations show the Clark family in their home and orchard. We also see the family dogs, Belgian horses, black cat, cows, squirrel, chipmunks, mice, black birds and bees. And, of course the frisky fox and her kits. I was especially fond of the shaggy gray dog!<br />APPLE VALLEY YEAR takes us through the seasons of tending and caring for an apple orchard. In the winter, the dead branches need to be trimmed and Ralph Clark, the owner tells his horses, \\"Good pruning makes good apples.\\" He's happy to see a fox and later reports to his family, that the fox is a good sign and will contain the mice population. <br />In the spring, Ralph moves his bee hives to the orchard so that the hives can be set among the apple trees. When the bees awake they will be in the middle of the lovely apple trees. Ralph says, \\"Plenty of bees make good apples.\\"  His children, Tim and Martha are thrilled to be allowed to lay under the flowering trees and look at the night sky.  Martha wishes on a star that she will see the fox.<br />When summer arrives, the fox now has her own family of three kits.  She teaches them to hunt under the tiny green apples. The foxes are pictured walking along a scenic stone wall. In late summer, the Clark family stakes up the branches of the trees that are heavy with apples. When it begins to rain, Ralph says, \\"Rain at the right time makes sweet apples in the fall.\\"  <br />In September, the children start back to school and look forward to getting new shoes after the apple crop is picked and sold. Everyone helps to pick the apples. The crops are stored in a cool place until the buyer comes to get them. Now, the family will have the money to purchase what they need. Next, it's time to smoke out the bees from their hives and remove the precious honey.The hive boxes are stacked on a hill facing south which will keep the bees from freezing during cold weather. In winter, the foxes sleep in the orchard and Mrs. Clark counts the money from the cash box and tells the children that, \\"A good apple sale makes a good year.\\" <br />APPLE VALLEY YEAR is a wonderful and instructive book.  I do hope that our local schools have copies since we live close to the beautiful Shenandoah Valley which is known for its delicious apples. I borrowed this copy from the county library.	2004-05-16

I was expecting a nice cozy story about a group of women who made quilts together. I was surprised that the book took off in an unexpected direction and had a mystery at the base of the story.<br />The book takes place during the great Depression of the 1930's.  The location is Harveyville, Kansas.  The story is revealed through the voice of Queenie Bean who is in her twenties and married to Grover. Queenie and eight other women have a quilting group, which is called the Persian Pickle Club.  They are the best of friends and refer to each other as Pickles. Besides quilting together, the ladies also share their personal troubles, and when necessary do anything that they can to help each other.<br />Even though the characters all hail from a small town, I believe that many of them are women that we've met somewhere in our lives. There are right in front of us!   The timid and gentle older lady, the overbearing and bossy woman who tells everyone else what to do, the young and inexperienced newly married girl, and the average woman who just tries to get along with everyone else.

Big Stone Gap is a small town located in the Blue Ridge Mountains in the southwestern part of Virginia. The story starts quietly with Ave Maria Mulligan telling the story of her life. She's a 35-year old pharmacist who's mourning the death of her mother and dwelling a lot on her past. She thinks of herself as being rather plain and ordinary and also feels that she will probably never marry.  Her best friend, Theodore is a handsome and eligible teacher, but romance does not seem to be part of the relationship. The town people see her as a capable woman who can do anything and will always lend a helping hand. <br />Life is simple in Big Stone Gap and the best part of the week for Ave Maria is when the bookmobile shows up each Friday. In fact, Ave Maria says that everything that's she's learned from life has come from books.  Her favorite book teaches the Chinese art of face reading and she practices on everyone's face and the results always seem to ring true. Things change when Ave Maria discovers some family secrets and her entire world is turned upside down. To add even more drama, Jack Mac, another very attractive man begins showing a lot of interest in her which confuses and complicates life even more for Ave Maria.<br />This is a wonderful story by Adriana Trigiani who is actually from the town of Big Stone Gap. I'm really looking forward to reading BIG CHERRY HOLLER, the sequel to this book.	2004-05-05

She lives with her widowed mother and maiden aunt in a small town called Byron in the Blue Mountains of Australia. The three ladies are part of the very large and self-important Hurlingford family. The story takes place shortly before World War I.<br />The family members are very wealthy, and happen to own a lot of the land in and around the town of Byron. They also own most of the shops and stores in Byron. To be a Hurlingford is to be very tall and very blond.  Missy who is brunette and a little shorter than the other family members is the exception to the rule. Also, Missy Wright, her mother and aunt are the poor relations who live in genteel poverty.  Their brothers and uncles rule the family, and life for the widows and unmarried ladies is indeed drab. The ladies are not allowed to work outside the home, and their pride stops them from asking for financial help. The Hurlingford men are mean spirited and have taken advantage of their sisters and nieces in money matters and inheritance.  Missy is so painfully thin that her body is that of a tall and skinny child.  They live farther away from the other members of the family in a house called Missalonghi.  Missy must walk a round trip of about 10 miles whatever she makes the shopping trip to town. <br />Life starts to change for Missy when Una, a distant relative begins working in the Byron library. Una is divorced and apparently not welcomed by the wealthy Hurlingford clan. She befriends Missy and recommends books that are wonderfully romantic and causes the inexperienced Missy to dream of love. The appearance of a strong and forceful new man, who comes to Byron and buys property right under the noses of the Hurlingford men, also makes Missy aware that just maybe she could find love and happiness. Once she dares to dream she starts to live.<br />My tape was beautifully read by Davina Porter. This story is so good that I listened to the entire book in just two sessions.  It's entertaining and full of surprises!	2004-04-24

The story is set in England and takes place in the late 1940's or early 1950's.<br />Nothing is quite what Anna expected.  The cozy school of her dreams turns out to be large and located in an ugly urban area.  Her class is filled with 46 students, so many that a teacher has barely the time to get to know the individual children. Keeping order among the students is another difficult issue for the young teacher. Anna's other big problem is housing.  Rooms to let are not abundant and she's forced to move in with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Flynn.  Her bedroom is tiny and the overall accommodations leave a lot to be desired.  Mrs. Flynn is ill spirited and the meals given to Anna are miserly and tasteless. Anna does befriend two other young teachers who often invite her to tea and add a little color to her otherwise regulated life. Just getting out of Mrs. Flynn's dreary house for a few hours makes her feel better. <br />As the year progresses Anna learns that there is a lot more to being a teacher than she had guessed. She also realizes that she really loves teaching, but knows that she will be happiest living in the country and working in a small school. The year ends with Anna anticipating the next year, a possible romance and life in general.  <br />There are quite a few books written by Miss Read. She has the most wonderful knack of taking what might seem a rather bland scenario and turning it into a most interesting and satisfying story. Miss Read's real name is Mrs. Dora Saint. I recommend this book for anyone, but I think it would be especially interesting for a young person who is considering a teaching career.	2004-04-11

I was fascinated from the first moment and didn't want to put the book down. <br />There are five chapters in THIS OLD QUILT and they offer stories about learning to quilt; the quilting traditions of the Amish, Hopi Indians and African Americans; the warmth and love that comes from homemade quilts; the camaraderie of quilting bees; and many lovely stories and poems concerning the American tradition of quilting.<br />I was so happy to see many of the paintings of Sandi Wickersham that were used to illustrate this book. Sandi lives close by and much of her work is indicative of my area of Virginia.  I own a few of her prints and it was fun to find them featured in THIS OLD QUILT.  Several other artists including Diane Phalen's work was also used in the book. Their colorful and detailed quilting scenes add an extra layer of depth and pleasure to the book. <br />I poured over the vintage photographs that are mostly black and white or color enhanced. The ladies from the past are shown displaying their work or sitting among friends and quilting together. One 1936 Depression Era photograph is so striking! It's of a lady standing on the porch of a wooden cabin and displaying her gorgeous quilt that was made in the Dresden Plate pattern. The viewer senses that inside that unpainted cabin, life was probably pretty difficult, but this lady was able to make a work of art out of scraps, and a picture of her beautiful quilt endures for all of us to admire.<br />There are many lovely stories to read and enjoy, of both fact and fiction.  My favorites are: HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT by Whitney Otto, THE PERSIAN PICKLE CLUB by Sandra Dallas and HIDDEN IN PLAIN VIEW by Jacqueline Tobin. THIS OLD QUILT is a treasure trove of quilting, memories and lovely pictures. I'm so happy that I treated myself to this endearing book.	2004-04-11

A world where all of the points meet exactly at the right places, where stitches are perfect and the quilt could end up showcased in a museum. Anyone who has really tried to make a quilt will understand the fun that she pokes at that elusive world of perfection.  After all, we see quilting shows on television, view quilts at craft shows and bazaar's and never see any quilt that looks like our homemade efforts.<br />Lisa says, \\"I am not the first person to ever make a Dorky Homemade Quilt.  But maybe I will be the first person to define the category as a bona fide art form.\\" Lisa's right, there must be thousands or millions of dorky quilts hidden in homes all around the world. At least that's what I prefer to think. My big question to Lisa is, why didn't you put any photographs of your dorky quilts in this book?  I want to see what you call dorky, maybe it's not really that dorky at all. Lisa, how can we learn to be proud of our dorky efforts if you don't show us yours? Even us dorky quilt makers need a standard to go by!	2004-04-09

I can honestly say that I relished each and every page.<br />Sandra Dallas wrote the Foreword. She is the author of several excellent novels including THE PERSIAN PICKLE CLUB. She gives some interesting insight into her own love of quilts that was passed down through her family.  Her memories and antidotes add a personal touch of family history to this book. There's also a very entertaining short story written by Marietta Holley titled \\"Miss Jones' Quilting.\\" It takes place around 1887 and gives an amusing account of a quilting bee and how gossip can really get out of hand<br />The art illustrations are enchanting and feature the works of Sandi Wickersham and Diane Phalen.  CRAZY FOR QUILTS is filled with photographs of quilters and many examples of quilts. This small, but mighty book also has a section on quilters' folklore and a glossary of quilting terms. This really would make a great gift for any woman who enjoys quilts.	2004-04-08

After a slow start, it took me a few chapters to become interested in the storyline. I think the only weakness in the book is that the two main characters are a little bland. Now, having said that, I will readily admit that the scientific parts of the story managed to hold everything else together, and keep the reader entertained. Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor whose specialty is religious symbolism is called to Switzerland to help investigate the death of a brilliant scientist.  Dr. Vetra, the discoverer of antimatter, is found dead and his mutilated body has the words ILLUMINATI branded on his chest. The Illuminati were an ancient cult of scientists who had supposedly joined together and had a hatred of the Catholic Church. <br />When a canister of the lethal antimatter is found to be missing, the story takes Langdon to Rome where he and Vittoria Vetra, the daughter of the murdered man, work together to save the Vatican from being destroyed.  The book becomes fast paced and exciting as the two race around the Vatican and the city of Rome trying to beat the clock and a deadly killer. The author, Dan Brown manages many twists and turns in this story, and the research that was done for the book is fantastic.  The reader learns so much about the Vatican and if I manage a trip to Rome someday, I think I might want to read this book again.	2004-03-28

We also meet Mrs. Jones who is lonely for a child and decides to decorate her house for Christmas as if she was expecting a child to visit.  Her husband is a policeman who finds Ivy and brings her home. The book is appropriate for children ages 5-10 and I think that most children would love the story.<br />This is a very colorful book with lovely illustrations by Barbara Cooney.  The author is Rumer Godden who is one of my favorite writers.  Over the last few years, I've been locating any of her books that I can find for my library, including her stories for children. I'm writing reviews in the hope that her beautiful stories will continue to be read.	2004-03-19

She's depressed because James, the love of her life has broken off their engagement. Of course, he had a good reason to do so, because Agatha had not told him the complete truth about her husband, Jimmy. She had led him to believe that Jimmy was dead, and both Agatha and James were shocked to have Jimmy appear at the start of their wedding. James is now in Cypress where he and Agatha were to be together on their honeymoon.

When one of the English tourists is killed, Agatha jumps in to investigate, and after a second murder takes place; it appears that the murderer is also after our Aggie, as Sir Charles likes to call her.<br />AGATHA RAISIN AND THE TERRIBLE TOURIST is a little different from the other stories in this series because it takes place in an exotic part of the world.  I really enjoyed hearing about the history of Cypress.  This is the sixth book in the Agatha Raisin stories.	2004-01-30

The book is filed with anecdotes about famous chefs including a movie star who was also a terrific cook.<br />She was quite open about her failing marriage and her various love affairs.

Tradition tells us that Anne was the wife of Joachim and that they were a childless couple. While praying one day, an angel appeared to Anne and told her that she would have a child.  She was overjoyed and promised to dedicate the child to God.  After being married for twenty years, she gave birth at the age of forty to Mary, who became the mother of Jesus.  This is what is traditionally accepted to be Ann's story or legend in many Christian religions.<br />ANNA WOMAN OF MIRACLES takes place between the years 43 B.C. to about 12 A.D. The authors follow the traditional legend and then build a story where Anna is a mystical healer and a member of the Essenes religious sect.  She marries three different times and has several daughters and names each one Mary. The authors also give Anna, a life long friendship with Julian; a Roman official who often helps her during troubled times. <br /> This book has two authors.  Vivian Van Vick, the original author was a scholar and teacher.  According to the book's introduction, \\"She spent five years researching Saint Anne's life in German, French and Latin documents, and in translations from the Aramaic. She originally planned to write a biography, but quickly learned that Saint Anne's story is mostly legendary, and even contradictory at points, though much of the legend is supported by renowned religious paintings in Europe.\\"<br />Carol Haenni, the co-author states that, \\"I have been a student of the material in the psychic \\"readings\\" of the Christian mystic, Edgar Cayce for more than twenty-five years.\\" She goes on to say that she knew the story and wove the Cayce readings, and gleanings from other sources into the novel. The scene of the angel appearing to Mary was taken from the \\"visions of Ann Emmerich, a German nun who died in 1824.\\"<br /> I thought that the book was intriguing and the authors werevery respectful in the way the material was presented. The writing was a little simplistic and at times, seemed to be aimed at younger readers.  I also found parts of the story very unbelievable; however, the historic research was good and gave the story a rich feeling. I had a sense of what the culture and life would be like for a Jewish woman who was living at that time in history.	2003-11-27

This book was well worth the wait.<br />Ida and Abram Ebersol live with their daughters in Gobbler's Knob, a small town that's located in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  The Ebersol's are Amish and have five daughters, Sadie, Leah, Mary Ruth, Hannah and baby Lydiann.<br /> The story begins with Sadie being unhappy because of something that happened to her during her rumschpringe. That's a brief period in the life of Amish teenagers where they experience a form of dating, and where they will hopefully meet the person they will eventually marry.  Only Leah, and their Aunt Lizzie, know of Sadie's problem and have both promised not to ever tell anyone about what happened to Sadie during rumschpringe.<br /> Leah is engaged to Jonas Mast, a charming young man that she's loved from the time she was a little girl. He's living in another area, where he's in training to be a carpenter. Unfortunately, Jonas is not the man that her father wishes her to marry.  He prefers that she marries Gid Peachey, a good man who loves Leah, but someone she considers to be just a kind friend.<br />The twins, Mary Ruth and Hannah have their own secrets because Mary Ruth loves to read and in the Amish community, pleasure reading is not acceptable. Mary Ruth also hopes to go to high school and college to become a teacher. Shy Hannah is worried about her twin and is afraid that Mary Ruth might eventually leave the community to pursue her dreams.<br />There are a lot of stories going on in THE BETRAYAL and it's a book that is very difficult to put down.  Learning about the Amish beliefs and their way of life is indeed fascinating.	2003-11-26

It has been a long-standing theory that patchwork quilts were used to help the enslaved people to escape by the encoded messages in the quilt patterns. This story is another take-off on that traditional idea.    Clara, a slave girl under the age of twelve, was sent away from her mother to another plantation to work in the fields and pick cotton.  She makes friends with Young Jack who sees that she's unhappy and not eating and advises her that she must eat to have the strength to be a field worker. Clara now shares a cabin with an older woman, who is kind to her and though unrelated, is called Aunt Rachel.     Aunt Rachel also sees that Clara may not be strong enough to be a field laborer, and over a period of time teaches Clara the art of sewing. Once she can learn to sew, she can work with Rachel at the Big House.  Clara proves to be an apt pupil and eventually becomes a seamstress and goes to work for the mistress of the plantation.      The sewing room is next to the kitchen so that Clara meets a lot of people who move around the countryside. She also hears stories about the Underground Railroad, which is a group of people who help slaves to escape.  As Clara listens to the people talking, she begins to question them about the surrounding land and decides to make a map out of sewing scraps.  Eventually the quilt map is completed and Clara and Jack are ready to leave the plantation and go north to find the Ohio River, and head for Canada. Since Clara had memorized the quilt map, she left it behind so that others could use it too, and escape to the North.    The illustrations by James Ransome are excellent.  The drawings are colorful and the expressions on the faces of the characters are wonderfully presented. My favorite illustration and excerpt takes place when Clara is leaving the plantation, and Aunt Rachel advises, \\"Before you go, just cover me withyour quilt, Sweet Clara,\\" she says, \\"I'm too old to walk, but not too old to dream. And maybe I can help others follow the quilt to freedom.\\"    This is a wonderful offering by Deborah Hopkinson and James Ransome!	2003-11-18

Agatha is in her fifties, and has always thought that living in a beautiful thatched cottage would be a dream come true. <br /> Because she has difficulty in meeting people in the village, she decides to enter a local cooking contest where she might win the contest and make some friends. The fact that she can't cook doesn't bother her at all.  She decides to go to London to buy a spinach quiche from a pastry shop and pass it off as a homemade entry.  When someone (the judge) dies after eating some of Agatha's quiche, she becomes a suspect in a murder investigation.  A deadly poisonous plant called cowbane was found to be in her spinach quiche. <br />Agatha suffers great humiliation after the villagers learn of her quiche deception and show their disgust for her. Several of them call her a cheat to her face. She really wants to leave Carsely, but then decides that if she were to solve the murder mystery and find the killer, perhaps the people will accept her. And so begins the first of the Agatha Raisin stories. This book introduces some of the characters that will appear in the later books. Agatha's romantic interest,  James Lacey, the local vicar's wife, Mrs. Blosxby (who becomes a dear friend) and Bill  Wong a police detective who admires Agatha, but wishes that she would not get involved in murder cases. <br />This is a very entertaining and witty story and the often pugnacious Agatha is unlike any other heroine.	2003-11-14

Rose Fenemore who is an English professor rents a cottage on the remote island for a two-week vacation. During her first stormy night there, a man (Ewen Mackay) enters the cottage with a key, and seems surprised to see Rose.  He tells her that the house was his boyhood home. Shortly after that, another man (John Parsons) shows up at the door and says that he is lost and seeking shelter from the rain. The men don't seem to know one another and although Rose is annoyed, she agrees to let both men wait out the storm. The triangle of the three people, and who they are is the focus of the story that is mostly mystery with a touch of romance.<br />My favorite parts of the book were the descriptive passages about the gorgeous scenery and various types of sea birds.  I was unfamiliar with a Petrel, but since they played a part in the story, I looked them up and found a picture of a delightful and very interesting bird.	2003-10-29

This is a fascinating story of two amazing people who have, over the centuries, sparked the interest of historians.  Henry, a warrior king, spent months and sometimes years away from his wife and family. His eventual betrayal of his wife and the breaking of the bond that formerly tied the couple together lead them to distrust each other.  This couple who began their marriage with hope and a shared bond for the future found themselves at odds with their marriage.  They were also in disagreement over the fate of their sons. <br />The king's best friend, Thomas a Becket is also a large part of the story.  Thomas was Henry's first Chancellor and later he became the Archbishop of Canterbury. The author made a statement at the end of the book saying that \\"the bitter quarrel between Henry II and Thomas a Becket is possibly the best documented episode of the Middle Ages.\\" I totally enjoyed this book and loved the fact that the author tells a great story and even made some explanations about the times when she didn't keep to the known facts.	2003-09-29

LAMPS OF TIFFANY allows us to enjoy the beauty of these fantastic works of art while learning something about the components of which they were made.<br />Since most of us can't afford a true Tiffany lamp, I have to say that many of the gorgeous reproductions that are made today are a tribute to the artistry of Mr. Tiffany.	2003-09-19

She felt that she needed to get away from her home in the Cotswolds, and think of something else rather then James Lacey, a man who didn't return her love. Also, by chance, a fortuneteller told her that she might find true love in Norfolk. <br />The rented cottage in Fryfam has a large garden and often little lights appear among the bushes. Many of the villagers seem to believe that fairies are the cause of the mysterious twinkling lights. Agatha makes a few friends who invite her to quilt with them, and when she discovers that their husbands are ignoring them, she intrudes with some suggestions to make the errant husbands take notice. Agatha's friend, Sir Charles Fraith shows up for a surprise visit and to keep Agatha company. When the local squire is murdered, she and Charles do some sleuthing to try and discover the killer.<br />I've read several of the Agatha Raisin books and learned that the more you read them, the more interesting you find the stories and the characters. Initially, it did take more than a few chapters to get involved with, and understand Agatha, who is a little cranky. If you like mysteries that are set in the British Isles, try out a M. C. Beaton book, they are all fun to read.	2003-09-18

I had never heard of it before, but have found most of Maeve Binchy's stories to be more than good.  What at great treat!  This is a terrific story about a small seaside village in Ireland called Castlebay.  I was immediately hooked on the story.<br />Clare O'Brien is the daughter of a poor shopkeeper and meant to stay in her place in this village where your birth status decides your life.  The assumption is rather amazing since the story takes place in the 1950's and early 1960's.  Clare is very bright and stands out in a family where her siblings are certainly not overachievers.  She's helped and motivated by a young teacher who sees herself in Clare and wants to give her a chance at a better life. Clare works hard and wins several scholarships, which enable her to go on to the university in Dublin. This story is filled with a cast of characters who seemed very genuine to me. The unfolding events explain how Clare changes and how the village people, both rich and poor, view the young woman.  Clare's own family, seem to be at odds with the fact that she wants to improve her lot in life, and her choice of a husband is not well received by anyone.<br />The author's daughter, Kate Binchy, read my audio book.  She was such an excellent reader, that I will now look for her name on other audio books.  She was able, with different Irish accents, to keep each character totally unique.	2003-09-07

How did they learn their subjects?  What education did they pursue? Those were a few of the questions that were of interest to me.  The twins, Leslie and Leigh Keno are an attractive addition to the Roadshow.  I especially like the fact that they are always polite and kind to the people who bring in the antique items for evaluation. The Keno brothers never appear to be condescending to the visitors, and their enthusiasm about the antiques is catchy.  <br />Well, HIDDEN TREASURES was a pleasure to read.  In this autobiographic form, Leigh and Leslie tell about growing up in New York and how they became interested in learning about objects that they found around the old family farm and how that interest turned into a love of American antiques. They also relate some interesting stories about their experiences in discovering, and being involved in the identification of some rare and unique pieces of furniture. They both write well, and I found the book to be very entertaining.<br />You don't have to be an antiques expert to enjoy this book.	2003-09-02

Celia, the main character is a \\"sassy\\" twenty-year-old woman who worked as a seamstress in a very fashionable clothing shop.  The inhabitants of Charleston were divided in their loyalties.  Some were Tories and supported the king and England; many others were supporters of the revolution.  After two months of conflict and bombardment, British forces occupied the city of Charleston.<br /> The local hero in South Carolina was Francis Marion, called the \\"Swamp Fox,\\" by the British. His goal was to keep the British army occupied in South Carolina, and away from General George Washington who was fighting another British army in the north. Celia and her friends supported the revolution and acted as spies for Francis Marion during the two years of the British occupation of Charleston. <br />The book is full of the flavor and feeling of the late 1700's.  Luke Ansell, an American soldier sings the following little ditty, as he walks home after his first meeting with Celia Garth.<br />                \\"Now girls why act so shy <BR>                When provoking men come by?<BR>                You know you're only wondering <BR>                     how you strike us--<br />                  Oh forget the won'ts and can'ts!<BR>                   For since half the world wears pants,<BR>                    You might as well own up to it--<BR>                         you like us!\\"<br />I learned a great deal about Charleston and how the people of that town lived through the very difficult years of the American Revolution. The book gives a lot of little tidbits of interesting information.  For instance, it was popular for the colonial women to name their male babies, George. They would then tell if their baby was named after King George of England or General George Washington.<br />This is a well-written and very enlightening story.	2003-08-29

I've been a fan since she wrote ONE CHILD and can't say enough good things about her stories. The important thing to know is that her books are about her true experiences as a teacher. <br />BEAUTIFUL CHILD is the story of one school year in a classroom of children, aged six through nine, who have special educational needs. Torey Hayden is the teacher and her students include Shane and Zane, twin boys who are borderline retarded as the result of fetal alcoholic syndrome. There's a girl named Alice, who has a highly unusual way of speaking to others and often talks to her hand as if it were a person. Jesse suffers from Tourette's syndrome, which causes him to have several tics and obsessive behavior patterns. Billy's, a hyperactive boy who can't be still or quiet, and Venus, is a small girl who is mute, but can, at times, explode into violent rages. Each day of class is full of surprises and the way in which the teacher handles the individual problems is truly inspiring.<br />I highly recommend BEAUTIFUL CHILD and all of Torey Hayden's books.	2003-08-11

Luke is an only child who loves baseball and misses his young uncle who is fighting in the Korean War.  In Luke's world, summertime is composed of the St. Louis Cardinals and grueling days of picking cotton.<br />The harvesting season was one of the most crucial times of the year for the Chandler family. As soon as the cotton was ready to be picked the farmers then had to quickly find the laborers to help them harvest the crop.  This story begins in the summer of 1952 when a group of Mexican migrant workers and the Sproul family who are \\"hill people\\" are hired to pick the cotton on the Chandler farm.  Luke, who seems to be older than his years, tells the story of that season. There's a lot of tension between the Mexicans and the Sprouls and because Luke has a crush on Tally Sproul, he snoops around and gets involved in the lives of the migrant workers and becomes the witness, and keeper of many secrets. One of the secrets causes Luke to tell a major lie, which puts him at odds with his strict Baptist teaching.<br />John Grisham's story gave me the same feeling that I had experienced many years ago when I first read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. I've enjoyed all of the Grisham books, but I believe that this is one of the very best and parts of this story will always remain in my mind.<br />I was also very impressed by David Lansbury the narrator of the audiotape.

It was helpful to hear the pronunciations of the German words and her narration was wonderful.<br />If you're intrigued enough to want to read this series in order, here they are: BORROWER OF THE NIGHT, STREET OF THE FIVE MOONS, SILHOUETTE IN SCARLET, TROJAN GOLD and NIGHT TRAIN TO MEMPHIS.  These are all excellent stories and I only wish that Elizabeth Peters would write more of them.	2003-07-05

King Henry wanted his daughter Maud, to succeed him on the throne. Maud had been married and widowed at a young age and still carried the title of Empress. Unfortunately, the powerful barons of the time did not like the idea of a woman ruling England and when Stephen, Maud's cousin seized the throne, many of the royals supported him.  Thus, began the years and years of horrible civil war that tore the country in shreds. The title of the book is taken from a quote in The Peterborough Chronicle, \\"Never before had there been greater wretchedness in the country...And they said openly that Christ and his saints slept.\\"<br /> King Stephen held the throne, but Maud and her supporters never gave him any rest and the country was in a constant upheaval.  It became even more confusing as some of the royal supporters switched sides and Stephen and Maud did not always know whom they could really trust.  For twenty years, the conflict went on and the English people suffered when their towns and villages were plundered and burned by the warlords.<br />As the years passed, Maud's son, called Henry Fitz Empress or Henry of Anjou is introduced into the conflict of his mother's fight for the throne.  After a while, it becomes evident that Empress Maud would never wear the crown of England.  Instead, her son Henry would be the next English king after Stephen and begin the Plantagenet dynasty. <br />Across the English Channel, the dual story of Eleanor of Aquitaine is taking place. Eleanor, the powerful ruler of Aquitaine had married King Louis of France and she became the Queen of France as a teenager.  Her life was unusual and very interesting. She eventually divorced Louis and went on to marry Henry of Anjou and become the Queen of England. The history in this book is truly fascinating. <br />I applaud the author for her wonderful characterizations and the amazing way she was able to tell this very complex story in such a readable and enjoyable fashion.	2003-07-03

She thinks she might be hallucinating since she had mushrooms on her pizza the night before. However, he tells her his name is Diesel and he's the spirit of Christmas. For some very strange reason she's not afraid of him, but knows that she should be terrified to be alone with a stranger. Locks and doors seem to be no problem for Diesel, but he does condescend to wait outside her apartment while she showers.<br />As usual Stephanie is broke, no money for a Christmas tree, presents or decorations, but she still has her job as a bounty hunter. Well, well, who else would Stephanie Plum be looking for at Christmas time in Trenton, but Sandy Claws?  He turns out to be in his 80's and a bail jumper.  He also happens to be a toy maker.  Since she can't get rid of Diesel, she decides to let him help her in her pursuit of Sandy.<br /> This story is absolutely hilarious; I laughed through the entire book.

Earlene Fowler takes us back into Benni's early life and her first marriage to Jack. The author switches gears often and intertwines some of the story of Benni and her life with Jack with what's going on today in Benni's life. This is the tenth book in this series and there are many parts that make up SUNSHINE AND SHADOW.<br />The story begins when grandmother Dove marries Isaac. Her new husband moves in with lots of stuff and Dove asks Benni to take back the boxes that she had stored at her grandmother's home. Many of the items are things that had belonged to Benni's first husband, and they lead to Benni's reminiscing about Jack who was killed in an accident. As she sorts through the material, she comes across a journal that Jack had kept and she receives a startling revelation.   <br />Emma Baldwin, an old acquaintance and famous author returns to San Celina and she and Bennie resume their friendship. She also agrees to lend Benni a wonderful old crazy quilt to display in the folk art museum where Benni is the curator.<br />Gabe Ortiz, Benni's husband who also happens to be the local police chief, continues to be devoted to his new wife, but the marriage is still a little shaky. The mystery comes into the story when an old friend of Gabe's from the LAPD is killed in San Celina.  After that, someone starts harassing Benni, and Gabe is convinced it has to do with an incident from his own past when he was a drug enforcement officer. <br />I was really looking forward to reading SUNSHINE AND SHADOW, but it was not what I was expecting.  STEPS TO THE ALTAR, the previous story in this series, left me in a state of uncertainty as to what would happen to Benni's marriage to Gabe and I approached this book expecting a resolution to that problem. At first I felt that this story skirted that issue; however, the more I thought about this book, the more I realized that the author knows that a troubled marriage is not cured overnight. I believe that she decided to give her characters time to work through their marital problems. After all, everyone's life is filled with sunshine and shadow. <br />As usual, this author delivers another good book and tops it off by giving the reader something to think about. This is a  skillfully written and very clever story.	2003-06-25

Aside from the fact that the history was enlightening, the stories and the way that Tom Brokaw presented the material made it very entertaining. <br />In his position at NBC News, the author had apparently corresponded, or personally spoken with a lot of World War II veterans and recorded their experiences and inspiring stories into this book.  Their thoughts and remembrances are warmly told and it made me proud of the American soldiers, the regular GI's, who gave up a part of their youth and fought so bravely for their country.  Their stories are emotional and heartfelt!	2003-06-23

This time she's hunting down a local boy who killed his best friend and then jumped bail. She's also been hired by a too friendly mortician to find some missing caskets. Since her Grandma Mazur has a fascination with funeral parlors, Stephanie takes her along as a cover as she pursues her investigations. Joe Morelli, the sexy vice cop is also back and he hangs around so much that Stephanie's mother starts to like him and invites him over to family meals. A mad man is out to kill Stephanie and goes so far as to break into her home and leave body parts as warnings to her. Rex, her pet hamster is almost killed by the same man when a cat is put into the hamster's cage.  <br />There's a lot going on in this amusing and fast paced story.  I thought it was even better than ONE FOR THE MONEY.	2003-06-18

I approached this story thinking that perhaps the book was meant mostly for English majors or those individuals who just love words.  I was right and also wrong.  This is a very clever story filled with interesting word play that everyone can enjoy.  It's also an imaginative fable that is told in the form of letters that are written in lovely prose.  <br />The story takes place on the fictional island of Nollop that was named after Nevin Nollop, the author of a very famous pangram sentence. Mr. Nollop is revered by the islanders and most especially by the officials who are members of the town council. On the island there's a monument to honor Mr. Nollop and beneath it the famous pangram is printed. THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.  One day the letter Z falls of the word LAZY and as time passes more letters continue to fall from the monument.  The council members decide that the voice of Nevin Nollop is speaking to them from the grave and telling them to discontinue the usage of the fallen letters. Severe penalties are issued to the islanders if they use any of the forbidden letters in dialog or in print.<br />Most of the residents think that taking letters out of the alphabet is ridiculous, but since the penalties are harsh; they try to obey the new laws. As time passes, the people become desperate and begin to look for a way out of the miserable repression that had become their lives.<BR> <BR>This book was very entertaining and it was also amusing to see the various words that people would come up with in their messages to one another.  For instance, when many of the letters that would be used to spell chicken were forbidden, a man wrote a note to his friend thanking her for \\"the thermos of pullet soup\\" that she had sent to him.	2003-06-17

Brett Gerson had it all, good looks, personality, spending money, expensive stereo equipment and a luxurious home with a pool. The beautiful life ended when Brett's father was convicted of insider trading and was sent to jail.<br />Brett, his mother and sister all had to make a drastic change to their life styles.  The house had to be sold, and the family moved in with their mother's eccentric aunt, who lived in a very modest home, but on the wrong side of town.  To make matters even worse, Aunt Mary wore only floral muumuus and bedroom slippers.  Her dress style, affectionate nature and \\"homespun wisdom\\" seemed strange to Brett and he was somewhat embarrassed by her.<br />He especially hated the visits that his mother insisted that they make to see his father in prison.  Mr. Gerson who seemed penitent and somewhat broken in spirit was hopeful that his son would forgive him; however, Brett was so filled with bitterness that the only comments that he made to his dad were sarcastic and hateful.<br />He blamed his father for everything including the fact that he now had to work after school and on summer vacation which was something that was unheard of in the world where he used to live. After quitting his first job making burgers, he's takes a job working for Alfie Moore the elderly man who used to clean the pool at his former house.  Britt thinks the job might be a lark and approaches the work in his old self-centered way, but both Alfie and the pool cleaning business are more than he ever imagined. Brett eventually learns the value and pride that comes with hard work and how it feels to be a nameless \\"Pool Boy.\\"<br />This engaging story is told in today's jargon and in the first person. Brett, the protagonist is a spoiled rich kid and not always a very sympathetic subject. The author doesa great job of getting us into Brett's mind and the reader is allowed to watch him grow as a person and become a likeable guy. I also admired the characterization of Alfie Moore who added warmth to the story through his solid and caring personality.	2003-06-15

My first impression was that it reminded me of the Kinsey Millhone Alphabet Mystery Series written by Sue Grafton which started out about ten years before ONE FOR THE MONEY was published. Both series feature a female protagonist who is sometimes out of her league in the rough world of crime and murder.  I do have to say that the Sue Grafton series is perhaps a little more realistic than this book by Janet Evanovich. Having said that, I will also have to say that as a person who enjoys mystery series that feature many of the same characters in each book, I know that the author probably has developed her main characters more with each of the books that follow this one and this was a cute story.<br />ONE FOR THE MONEY is the first book about Stephanie Plum, a  young woman who lives in New Jersey and who has just lost her job as a lingerie buyer and needs another job quickly so that she won't have to move back home with her parents. Her cousin Vinnie is a bail bondsman and Stephanie blackmails him into letting her work for him and try her hand at being a bounty hunter. Unfortunately, her first case involves the apprehension of Joe Morelli, a vice cop who is accused of murder. Stephanie's known Morelli her whole life and is still angry with him for what happened when they were teenagers. In fact, she can't wait to get even. This is a light hearted and fun caper.	2003-06-08

It actually reminded me of a rather steamy historical romance with little basis in truth.  I think that the author took too many liberties with her subject. History has given us quite a bit of information about Queen Eleanor, but the author ignored some important facts and chose to weave a story where Eleanor had a lover who supposedly fathered several of her children.  I also had a problem with the way the character of Thomas a Becket was written. The author made him into a nasty and despicable person. <br />I approached this book with a great deal of enthusiasm because Eleanor of Aquitaine is one of my favorite historical subjects and had a very unique life. As a teenager she was married to King Louis VII of France and later divorced him and married Henry Anjou who became King Henry II of England.  She was also the mother of King Richard the Lionhearted and the very unpopular King John who was forced to sign the Magna Carta. <br />Eleanor's life was so full and interesting that it was completely unnecessary to fabricate stories about her.  I know this is a novel, but the author did not do justice to Eleanor or her life. <br />One of the few things that I liked about this book was the jacket illustration of Queen Eleanor.	2003-05-18

It contained a crimson rose and an airline ticket to Stockholm. There was no note, only the words \\"WIELANDIA FABRICA\\" printed on a card. The package had no return address, but had been mailed from Sweden.  Vicky instantly knew it had been sent by Sir John Smythe, her lover, and a wanted art thief who she knew she should never trust because John had let her down more than a few times.  Vicky had not seen or heard from him in over a year, but she decided to use the ticket and find out what kind of a caper that John was currently involved with. Her suspicions were that he was seeking a Viking treasure.<br />SILHOUETTE IN SCARLET is the third book in the Vicky Bliss Mystery series and another enjoyable story by Elizabeth Peters.	2003-05-07

I don't think that I would have considered reading this book except that it was the choice of my book club.     Well, this story was not really what I expected at all.  Constance, Lady Chatterley is a rather likeable person who is trapped in a sad and boring life.  What happens to her and her lover is something neither really anticipated nor expected.  The book starts in 1917 and at the time when it was first published, the subject matter of LADY CHATTERLEY's LOVER was considered to be totally shocking and unacceptable.    Yes, a few parts of the book have rather crude passages, and language, but Lady Chatterley herself is a very sympathetic character.  The style of writing used by D. H. Lawrence is very descriptive and the pace of the story is probably a little slower than modern readers are used to.  Aside from some offensive language, I think that this was a rather interesting, but very depressing book. Many of the characters seemed to be lacking in any kind of a moral code and I found most of the men in the story to be rather despicable.	2003-04-28

The play, AN HISTORIE OF THE APOCALYPSE AS VISIT'D UPON SUMMERSTOWE was touted as the true story of a seventeenth century witch trial. The play was about Elizabeth Spenser who was accused of being a witch. Melinda decided to stay in Summerstowe and work on the play. In fact, she played a major role in the part of the doomed Elizabeth Spenser.  Melinda also hoped to get material for a possible book on the subject.  She disappeared after the play was over and the police were never able to solve the mystery.<br />The following year, Clair Godwin goes to England on a mission to find out what happened to her best friend Melinda Varek. What she finds is a quaint, picture postcard village called Summerstowe. She also becomes acquainted with the charming Police Constable Alec Wood, the play's director, Elliot Moncrief, and handsome Richard Lacey, a conservation architect for the National Trust. The gathering place for the locals and play participants is a pub owned by Diana and Rob Jackman called the Druid's Circle. <br />Clair senses that she is not wanted in Summerstowe and decides that the best way for her to find out what happened to Melinda is to get involved with the play and the village residents.

Aside from a few pieces of information, the film SCHINDLER'S LIST gave me a better understanding of the man. Like the film, this was mostly about Schindler's heroic saving of Jews during World War II. This book skimmed over his early life and the years after the war which is really what I wanted to be informed about.<br />I did learn one very interesting fact that I had never read before and that had to do with the beginning of World War II and Germany's invasion of Poland. The author, Jeremy Roberts reports that at one point, Schindler had served as a spy for Germany before the war. Schindler's wife, Emilie said that her husband helped obtain Polish uniforms, which were used by German agents in Poland. In writing about the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, the author says: <br /> \\" They came without warning, leading the way for long columns of tanks and men. SS soldiers dressed in Polish uniforms--perhaps based on designs Oskar Schindler had helped to steal--pretended to attack a German radio station.  This was used as an excuse for the invasion.  Other German soldiers parachuted behind Polish lines, where they helped trick many Poles to their deaths.\\" I found this information amazing and I was disappointed to hear of Schindler's possible involvement. Perhaps saving Jewish lives was part of his atonement for earlier wrongs.	2003-04-16

The good times, the bad times and the wild times of George W. are here for all to read. He seemed to be a lovable child who had friends and was very popular. When he had any problems, he seemed to be able to handle whatever consequences that he faced and to land on his feet. The President was born with the gift of gab and could talk and charm his way out of most situations. Laura on the other hand appeared to be the dream daughter of doting parents. Their personalities are quite different. Laura is quiet, calm and pays a lot of attention to details. She's also very lady-like, kind to people and loves to read.  George W. is more emotional, outspoken and seems to have a keen understanding of people and, is able to joke easily and put people at ease.  He's proud of being a Texan, and enjoys that role in his public life.  He's not stuffy and if he mispronounces a word or makes some type of social mistake, he laughs about it, even when the press responds with some type of critical comment.  Laura knows how bright her husband is and she's resentful of the cracks that are sometimes made at his expense. <br /> The President and First Lady are both loyal to family and friends and from what I took from this book, really compliment each other in their marriage relationship. Her calmness and gentleness seems to take the edge away from her husband's stronger personality when he might tend to be a little sarcastic.  They each had a very tragic incident in their lives that made a lasting impression and perhaps gave them another connection. I enjoyed the excerpts about the President's parents and found the bound and closeness that they share to be touching.  George W. and his father, sometimes refer toeach other as Forty-one and Forty-three.<br />The book is well written and it has an enormous amount of information and details about the Bush family.  I felt that the author Christopher Anderson did an amazing job of laying out the personalities of these two people and explaining how their families and the circumstances of their lives shaped their characters. I finished reading the book, knowing that President and Mrs. Bush are both strong and very intelligent people and I also learned that there is nothing phony about either one of them.	2003-04-08

There are three central characters and each chapter is about one of the three women.  Virginia Woolf was by far the most intriguing of the characters and of course she was a real person. I didn't find the other two women to be sympathetic as people. Clarissa Vaughn seemed to be living in the past and Laura Brown was a woman who didn't want to face real life and lived in a world of the books that she read. I was constantly trying to find the link between the main characters, and of course some things are finally revealed at the end of the story.<br />Since THE HOURS was based on Virginia Woolf's book, MRS. DALLOWAY I really wish that I had read that story first. Michael Cunningham has written a very unique and original book, but I have to admit that I didn't like the story and thought it was rather depressing. I don't think that I'll see the movie.	2003-04-04

This book is the catalogue for that exhibit. The following museums were also participants: The Art Institute of Chicago, Huntsville Museum of Art, The San Diego Museum of Art and The Philbrook Museum of Art.  It was the first time that this massive work of art had ever been seen outside of Poland.<br />LAND OF THE WINGED HORSEMEN: ART IN POLAND, 1572-1704 is a splendid pictorial of over 150 magnificent works of art from the Baroque era when Poland ranked as the second largest country in Europe. Poland's location is at the heart of Europe and for that reason its position is at the crossroads of Eastern and Western Europe. That melting pot of nations and cultures is reflected in this outstanding collection.<br />This book highlights paintings of the monarchy; icons, religious depictions and an historic and magnificent painting entitled The Battle of Vienna. Also shown are rich tapestries, exotic rugs, glassware, porcelains, military regalia, weaponry, liturgical objects and the crown of King Augustus III.<br /> The Winged Horsemen was the name given to the Polish hussars. They carried a very long lance, wore traditional metal plate armor and usually had some type of animal skin draped across the shoulder.  What gave them such a distinctive look were the wings that were mounted to the back of their saddles.  In 1683 the King of Poland, Jan III Sobieski led an army of combined Polish and German Imperial soldiers to fend off an attack of 100,000 Turks who had laid siege to Vienna. The Polish Winged Horsemen led the assault and smashed through the Turkish defenses.  The Turks fled in panic and Vienna was saved. A Turkish tent from that siege and armor from a Winged Horsemen are both pictured.<br />The beautiful photographs in this book are accompanied by well-explained descriptions of the various works of art.	2003-03-20

In this story, Ella Brady the main character is a complete dope and unbelievably naive. She gets involved with a married man and seems to think all will end well. When his true nature is revealed and shows him to be a completely dishonorable person, Ella still clings to some type of childish hope that things will work out at some time. Oh, please, he cheated her father out of his life's savings!  This story was just depressing and I found myself telling Ella off on every page. Even though the author tried to take the storyline into other directions, I was never able to get involved or care about the characters.<br />Maeve Binchy has written many great stories and I especially recommend THE GLASS LAKE, EVENING CLASS and SCARLET FEATHER.  Don't waste your time reading QUENTINS the author wrote it on an off -day!	2003-03-15

The characters are good and Elizabeth Peters always provides fascinating settings for her stories.<br />In NIGHT TRAIN TO MEMPHIS, Vicky Bliss is asked by a police agency to be a part of a tour group as they cruise down the Nile River seeing the beautiful monuments and ancient pyramids of Egypt. The police suspect that some professional thieves will be on board and hope that Vicky can assist in identifying them. The characters are diverse and of course, Sir John Smythe also shows up for the tour.  Vicky's dismayed to find him using a different name and traveling with a sweet young woman.  Just a few months before the tour, John and Vicky had resumed their love affair and now she's thoroughly confused by the way that he's acting. There are a lot of surprises in this story.<br />I found it amazing to see that out of 32 reviews on this book, 30 reviewers gave this story a Five Star Rating.  That has got to be some kind of a record. It shows what an excellent writer that Elizabeth Peters is and how she always delivers great fiction.	2003-03-13

It doesn't bombard the reader with too much information, but explains what the beginner needs to know about breathing techniques, various exercises, yoga poses and the importance of meditation. The photographs and illustrations are an important feature of the book and serve me as a reminder in how to achieve a pose that I'm learning in my class.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-03-13

Her words are painful and hilarious, but always ring truthful. The story of her very determined parents and the struggle the entire family experienced is amazing. These parents are not the hand holding gentle souls who cant bear to worry their children, they are blunt and strong and serve as examples of people who are surviving in a very difficult life and often-brutal country. The family lived on several farms trying to make a living on inhospitable land where guerrilla fighters were lurking in the bushes and camping on the farmland during the nights. The truth was they loved Africa, and were determined to stay there.<br />During all of the years of civil unrest, her father was often away serving as a soldier for the government. Her mother was a very emotional, but strong woman who tried her best to hold on even when she saw her children die and she had to continue to run the farm alone while her husband was out fighting. Everyone carried guns and the children were taught how to load a gun as soon as they were agile enough to do it.<br />Alexandra, called Bobo by her family gives us this remembrance that she had from the age of three.  Mum says, Dont come creeping into our room at night. They sleep with loaded guns beside them on the bedside rugs. She says, Dont startle us when were sleeping. We might shoot you. Oh.  By mistake. Okay, I wont. replied Bobo.<br />I didnt want this story to end and hope that the author writes another book and gives us an update on her remarkable family.	2003-03-12

This was a great choice!<br />Malachi McCormick the author of IRISH COUNTRY COOKING has great wit and his comments and insight are a joy to read. Along with 100 of his favorite Irish recipes, he gives a little information about the history of Ireland and adds some lovely memories of his boyhood spent in County Cork.<br />The author begins his introduction with \\"There is an old Irish proverb: \\"Follow steadfastly the ways of your ancestors,\\" which, in matters of diet at least, happens to be excellent advice. And the \\"foodways\\" of the ancestors of some forty million Irish-Americans are exactly what is collected here: the traditional recipes of Ireland.&quot;<br />Many of the recipes are showcased by Irish proverbs which are great to learn and perhaps quote later.  Even if you don't make the recipes they are all very interesting to read. I did make and enjoy the Pea and Hambone Soup, the Buttermilk Scones, Fish Soup and the Corned Beef and Cabbage.  I also intend to try the recipes for the Irish Soda Bread, Pratie Oaten, and Colcannon.  Very enjoyable book!	2003-03-12

The photographs are good and the book is chock full of uniquely decorated rooms. I honestly have to say that almost every room has something in it that I would like to incorporate into my own home. <br />There are fifteen chapters and at the end of each a \\"project\\" is presented with instructions called \\"Watch ME Make It.\\" Some of these are: A Tea Towel Pillow, Hand-Painted Picture Frame, and  Birdhouse Bookends.  Most of the projects seem to be fairly simple to do. To be honest, I don't usually do projects, but I'm very tempted to try to make several of these.<br />I loved looking at how \\"various collections\\" are incorporated into the styles of the different rooms.  I'm a bit of a collector myself, and it was a treat for me to notice that some items that I have from my own collections are featured in the pictures.<br />It may sound odd to say this about a book on decorating, but I found HOME COMPANION to be very uplifting and a joy to read.

I've read the entire series, and have enjoyed each and every book.  It's not necessary to read every book in this series to understand the story, but if you like good mysteries, start with the first book and read them all. I guarantee you'll have lots of entertaining reading if you do.<br />This time Kinsey works with two retired police detectives who hire her to help them investigate an old mystery that they were never able to solve.  In the previous eighteen years, a young Jane Doe was stabbed to death.  The mysterious woman was never identified and her body never claimed. The detectives want one more chance to find the killer and perhaps identify the woman.<br />As usual, the author takes us into the life of private detective Kinsey Millhone, who at age 36 is set in her ways, and quite a character.  She loves fast food, has a rather odd assortment of friends and lives an unglamorous, but nevertheless interesting life.  Kinsey has her own kind of tomboy charm and she's still trying to figure out her life and her past. <br />This story is loosely based on a true murder case.	2003-02-26

She learned her skills as a potter when she was a child, but went on to perfect her work and become one of the most gifted of the Pueblo potters. Her \\"black-on-black\\" style pottery is world famous.   <br />Not far away from the San Ildefonso Pueblo is an ancient village site where the Anasazi Indians had lived.  Dr Edgar Lee Hewitt led an archaeological expedition to the Anasazi site in 1908. The archaeologists found caves with artwork on the walls and also discovered pieces of Anasazi pottery. Julian Martinez, Maria's husband was one of the local men to be employed working for the archaeologists on that site.  He used his drawing skills to copy the Anasazi drawings. Dr. Hewitt asked if Maria could try to duplicate the ancient pottery and he enlisted the help of Julian to paint the Anasazi designs on her work. Over the years, Maria and Julian created a lot of beautiful pottery.  After Julian died in 1943, other members of the family worked with Maria creating the beautiful pieces that are cherished today. Maria Martinez died in 1980.<br />There are some great photographs of Maria, Julian and other members of the Martinez family at work on their pottery. Maria received many honors and acclaim during her life.  In 1934, Eleanor Roosevelt invited her to be her guest at the White House.	2003-02-26

Out of 1000 subjects that have been presented on the program, they've chosen to profile the lives of 250 people that they're calling \\"the world's most influential people.\\" It's necessary to understand that premise because when you look inside you're sure to disagree with some of the individuals that are mentioned and wonder about others who are not in the book. I wasn't particularly interested in the entertainment stars that were chosen to be included but I did enjoy reading the fascinating stories of the good and not so good people who have made up our world.<br />Reading this book is like reading a who's who in the world of the Arts, American History, Human Achievement, World History and Human Spirit. There are a lot of photographs and each subject has a very brief biography explaining what made them a person of world influence and then some interesting tidbits of information are given. I enjoy history and here are some things that I learned from the book:<br /> Eleanor of Aquitaine took 300 women with her on the Second Crusade.<br />Benjamin Franklin was the 15th child in his family.<br />Queen Victoria, the mother of nine children hated childbearing, which she called \\"the shadow side of marriage.\\"<br />Mao Zedong's childhood heroes were George Washington and Napoleon Bonaparte.<br />Writers, Langston Hughes and Ernest Hemingway were friends and attended<br />bullfights together.<br />ULTIMATE BIOGRAPHY would make a good coffee table book!

The author starts by telling how he met Martha and how much he liked her and how generous she was to him.  Next, when her biography actually starts, his writing became rather cold and unnecessarily nasty about Martha's early life and her family.  The information that her father was a mean bully is the premise that is set to explain how and why Martha became the same way.<br />The author gives us tons of information including many quotes from former friends who Martha supposedly used and \\"done wrong.\\"  When so much information and details are given, the reader is forced into acknowledging that some of it must be true.  I've always liked Martha and admired the fact that someone from a working class background became wealthy and famous by her own personal talents, hard work and ingenuity. It's really hard to know how much truth there is to claims that people made about her not giving credit to deserving friends' etc.  Perhaps a lot of that is also true and chances are the public will never know for sure unless Martha herself comes out with a statement saying that she owes a great deal to a lot of people. <br />The Martha in this book is not very likable and on a personal level, I'm disappointed.  She learned to be a self-promoter, and apparently she ruthlessly pursued her goals. I'm sure that many other very successful people in the limelight have been as aggressive and ruthless in their own pursuit of money and success. I do know that a lot of us have good ideas and at times really wonderful dreams about developing those ideas into money.  Martha took those ideas and ran with them.  Maybe she wasn't the first to think of them, but she did develop them into something big and took those ideas right to the bank. In the end, if she hurt family and friends she will always live with that and probably live to regret some of those actions.<br />A note to the reader, this book was written before the insider trader allegations were made.	2003-02-16

He's small for his age, white and of English descent. His name is Peekay and he lives in South Africa. Up to this point in his life he's known only his family and his beloved black Nanny. Now, he's forced to take care of himself and survive under the most brutal of circumstances. The time is World War II and Peekay spends years in a boarding school where he's the only English student among Afrikaners who are sympathetic to the Nazi cause. He's beaten, tortured and treated as a \\"prisoner of war\\" by the older boys.  The Afrikaners are the descendents of the Dutch and there has been a great deal of conflict between them and the English settlers who came to South Africa at a later period of time.<br />When I first started reading this novel, I wasn't sure if I could handle the passages about the brutal treatment of the little boy. However, I quickly learned that Peekay is a spirited survivor and would make it through that horrible period of his life.  On his vacations from school, he meets several people, both black and white who really influence him and teach him to work hard in order to fulfill his dreams. I found an uplifting joy in every success that Peekay experienced. <br />This is a big book, but I looked forward to my reading sessions every day and I'm sure that part of this story will remain in my mind forever. The character of Peekay is very inspiring.<br />Next, I plan to read the sequel, TANDIA.	2003-02-08

This is the first one that I've read but definitely not the last.<br />In this story, Vicky Blair who is an archaeologist at the Munich National Museum receives a photograph in the mail that shows a woman dressed in what is called the gold of Troy. The envelope has no informative letter and shows no return address. Of course Vicky is interested since the Trojan gold had disappeared right after World War II and its whereabouts has been a mystery.  As it turns out, Vicky was not the only one to receive a copy of the photo and she and five other world class archaeologists all come together in Bavaria and compete to be the first to find the treasure for their respective museums.<br />It did take me a chapter or two to get into the story and obtain some understanding of the main premise. I think that readers might be better off starting with the first book in this series.  I must say that once I got a grip on Vicky and the other characters, I really enjoyed this story. The most intriguing character is that of John Smythe or Sir John as Vicky sometimes refers to him.  Again, I guess there is more of an explanation of his character in the earlier stories. Well, John was great and we just got enough of him to make him mysterious, charming and in many ways the most interesting character in Trojan Gold. <br />This author has the ability to combine love and mystery, add some historic facts, mix them all altogether and give us some really good books. She also never goes too far with her romantic passages, and she has the good sense to know that a light touch of romance is much more captivating and exactly what her readers want.  <br />Since, I plan to read the other books in this series, I've looked up the titles and here they are in the correct reading sequence: 1. Borrower of the Night,  2. Street of the Five Moons,  3.  Silhouette in Scarlet,  4. Trojan Gold and  5. Night Train to Memphis.	2003-02-07

This small book of calendar days is beautifully illustrated by Marjorie Stodgell and can be used year after year. Herbs are plants that can be used in medicines, seasonings, flavorings, and decorations. In this book, the author tells us which herbs are associated with the various days of the month.  She also gives us the history or legend that is linked to the plants.<br />The best way for me to review this book is by quoting some of my favorite passages.<br />\\"JANUARY 26 - Wear a scarlet nightcap stitched up with lavender to shun winter melancholy.<br />FEBRUARY  3 - St. Blaise Day  - The saint miraculously cured a boy with a bone in his throat so the day was named after him.  Herbs to soothe a sore throat are hyssop, horehound, and sage.<br />MAY  9 - Violets are in bloom.  Add them to your salads today.<br />JUNE  2 - St. Elmo's Day - St Elmo is the patron saint of sailors. Parsley and violets are special herbs to prevent scurvy --they are both rich in vitamin C.<br />AUGUST  4 - Sunflowers are in full bloom now.  The sunflower is the symbol of constancy as its face follows the path of the sun.<br />OCTOBER  9 - The last herb stalk in the garden after harvest harbors the spirit of the garden.  It should be tied up with ribbon and hung in the kitchen.<br />DECEMBER  11 - St. Andrew's Day - Serve fish today with dill, fennel, tarragon or bay\\".<br />This is a perfect addition to a gardener's library.	2003-02-04

A beautiful garden book is the perfect way to spend a cold winter's day and Vines &amp; Climbers didn't disappoint me.  <br />The book is divided into Five Chapters:  (1) Looking Up -- In this part we're given the use and value of climbing plants.  (2) The Supporting Player--This refers to the bones of the garden and any fences, walls, tall trees and other structures that are on site. (3) Growing Up -- This chapter discusses the essential elements that are needed by every garden: soil, mulch, compost, fertilizers, light, shade and moisture. Some information is also given on pests and diseases. (4) A to Z of Plants --This is the largest part of the book. It gives descriptions of over 120 different plants that include vegetables, fruits and colorful ornamentals.

THE STANISLASKI SISTERS is about two very different sisters and how they find love.<br />Natasha is the oldest child in a family of four children.  She has two brothers, Alexi and Mikhail.  Rachel is the baby of the family.  The three oldest siblings are brought to America as children from the Ukraine and continue to carry their heritage with them. A typical younger child, Rachel is annoyed that she wasn't born until later and has no memories of life in the Old Country.  The entire family is very close and shares a strong bond of love and friendship. Their charming parents, Yuri and Nadia Stanislaski are also a part of their stories.<br />Natasha's story is that of a dedicated ballet dancer who finds love and joy at the age of 17 and loses it very quickly.  She rebuilds her life, but is afraid to commit again until she meets Spencer Kimball, a handsome and very distinguished musician. Spence is immediately attracted to Natasha when they become acquainted in a toy store, but because of a misunderstanding, she takes a strong dislike to him. <br />Rachel's life is that of an overachiever who wants to succeed in her chosen profession as an attorney.  Her ultimate goal is to be a judge.  Her life is changed forever when she defends Nick, a hostile young man who is on the verge of ending up in the prison system.  His older brother, rugged Zack Muldoon is mucho and aggressive and difficult to deal with. In spite of all his bravado, Zack loves his brother very much and will do anything to help him.  Rachel's court room defense, and the judge's decision to make Rachel and Zack co-guardians of Nick, put her on the defensive as she fights to keep from falling in love with Zack.<br />The love stories are good, but more importantly they show the backbone of family life that shapes all of us.	2003-01-31

Barbara Milo Ohrbach has a wonderful way with words and her enthusiasm about the world of antiques is charming.<br />I've owned this book for a number of years, and often refer to it when I want to know a specific terminology or when I'm checking out the care and treatment of a particular antique object.  Because the author's writing style is so enjoyable, I always end up reading pages and pages of the book and learning more with each reading. <br />ANTIQUES AT HOME is divided into eight chapters on the following topics: Ceramics-Wood- Silver- Textiles- Glass- Paper- A Personal View and The Collector's World. The photographs are beautiful and I've borrowed some of Ohrbach's ideas about how to display different collections.

This is the story of six-year old Krysia Petrowski's voyage to America.              <br />Krysia's father was already in America to make a new life for his family.  When he had a job and a home, he sent for his wife, daughter and two sons.  The decision to leave Poland,  their homeland was difficult; leaving behind family and friends was not an easy thing to do.  The children could only take necessary items and each child was allowed to bring just one toy. Their clothes, blankets, shoes and toys were knotted up in a sheet to be carried over the shoulder. Krysia had a problem choosing between her two beloved dolls.  She took Basha because she was the smaller of the two dolls and would take up less space.<br />After leaving their village, it took the family four days of walking to arrive at the port where a large steamship was there to take them across the ocean. The difficult sea voyage involved poor sanitation, sickness and lack of decent food. After about fourteen days, the passengers finally view the Statue of Liberty and depart at Ellis Island on Christmas Eve. <br />On Ellis Island, the immigrants went through many inspections, which included medical examinations for each family member. The paperwork and examination usually took three to five hours to complete. Passing the examinations meant that the immigrants were allowed into the country.  Those who did not have the proper papers or failed their medicals, were delayed for days or even months and could be sent back to their original countries. <br />This well written and carefully illustrated little book is ideal for children who are studying the history of America or the story of their own family.	2003-01-27

Along the way she met Jondalar another traveler, and fell in love. Together they have had many adventures in the previous books. In this most recent story, Shelters of Stone, Jondalar takes her to meet his family, the Zelandonii tribe.  <br />Jean Auel has again completed a lot of research and written a very thoughtful story of what Cro-Magnon men and women might have been like.  Some of the actions of the prehistoric people rang true to me and others seemed a little too sophisticated for that time in our evolution. The pace of this book is a little slower than the previous stories and it seemed to me to be too heavy with descriptive passages. All things considered, it is an interesting story and I applaud the author for her fortitude and diligence in continuing Ayla's saga.<br />Even though I've read the all of the books about Ayla, the first story, The Clan of the Cave Bear continues to be my favorite.	2003-01-20

It's the the story of Leah and Sadie Ebersol who are Amish sisters and ready for rumschpringe. That's the time when Amish teenagers are granted some freedom from their parents.  They go to singing parties and other social events and get to know the different young men on the buggy rides to and from the  gatherings. It's the hope of their families that the young people will be meeting the partners that they will eventually marry in a few years.  This is also the time right before they formally decide to join the Amish community and agree to abide by the strict rules of that church.<br />The sisters are quite different.  Sadie at nineteen wants excitement and isn't sure she wants to be Amish.  Leah who is sixteen is quite sure that the Amish way is best, and she already knows who she wants to marry. When beautiful Sadie decides to date a boy who is not Amish and pursues a forbidden romance, Leah agrees to keep her secret hoping that Sadie will come to her senses.  They both know that the consequences of Sadie's relationship could ruin her life.<br />Hannah and Mary Ruth are the two younger sisters in the Ebersol family and the reader is also drawn into their lives.

Frances Catherine's mother had died in childbirth and she had the fear that the same fate awaited her. The two friends made a pact that whenever Frances Catherine was married and ready to have a baby; Judith would be with her. Neither girl anticipated the fact that the Scottish lairds hated all things English and did not warm to the idea of having Judith visit Scotland.<br />After a lot of debating, several Scotsman, including Laird Ian Maitland, go to England to bring Judith to her friend's assistance. Judith and Ian are immediately attracted to each other, but both fight the love and affection that seems inevitable. This is a good love story, but I also found the information about birthing and mid-wives to be interesting. The horror that women faced when dealing with childbirth in the dark ages was unbelievably barbaric and often tragic.<br />Good read!	2003-01-02

She manages through her stories to explore the lives of ordinary people and provide insight into their minds and their dreams. This imaginative story takes us into the life of a young Polish-American woman named Lily Wilk who is a loving daughter, great friend, good stepmother and a very unique artist.   <br />Lily knew since she was ten years old that she was going to be an artist. A grab bag gift of a drawing kit was given to her and it contained three instructions, which she followed.  Then she was told, \\"Congratulations, now you are an artist.\\" Lily never questioned the idea and of course she became an artist.  Her calling card is printed with a Lily of the Valley flower and she always has some type of work to do. Not only does Lily do the traditional canvas painting, she paints signs, fire hydrants, does fancy lettering, and is proud that she's providing needed services to her community. She has even given art lessons when asked.  The odd-job type of work supports Lily, but she desires and wants to do some type of a personal masterpiece.<br />Even the richest woman in town is aware of Lily's talents and commissions her to do a painting of her family, Lily replies \\"I can make for you whatever you want.\\" Her no nonsense approach to life is very refreshing. and the quaint speech patterns that she and some of the other characters use are reminiscent of my own Polish-American experience, and give an authentic flavor to the story.  As with the other works by this author, SELLING THE LITE OF HEAVEN and HOOPI SHOOPI DONNA, the ending is unexpected.  <br />This is a well-written and original story.	2002-11-27

One of the Scots who she meets is Brodick Buchanan, a handsome warrior who lets her know from the beginning that he's very interested in her and does not plan to let her return to England.  The attraction between them is pretty intoxicating and Gillian falls in love with him; however, she's determined in her quest to find her lost sister and return the box to England.  Brodick and the other Scottish warriors have their own ideas on how to deal with Baron Alford.<br />This is the first book that I've read by Julie Garwood and I found it to be a fast-paced and exciting story.

Gramma Dove is still fighting with her sister Garnet and they drive the entire family crazy by their dueling. The kitchen is their battleground.  All foods are made twice....

Her life is filled with unanswered questions.<br />One day Ruth finds some pages written in Chinese that LuLing had written and given to her years ago.  Her own Chinese is not up to interpreting the writing, so she turns to a translator for help in reading the pages.

When Ruth reads the transcript of LuLing's words, she finally understands her mother, and all of the mysteries in LuLing's life are revealed. <br />I especially enjoyed the recorded book because the author joined actress Joan Chen as a co-narrator.	2002-10-30

She thinks that the punishments for the sins and transgressions of the congregation are too severe.

James is her sister's stepson and not a blood relation to Ninah.

The reader, Alexander Adams was absolutely wonderful!<br />Jake Barnes is the narrator of this story of disillusioned American and British expatriates who live in Paris after World War I.  Jake was wounded in the war and is in love with the beautiful Lady Brett Ashley.  Though never completely explained, the reader is led to believe that because of his war injury their love can never be fulfilled. Brett is reckless and goes from one love affair to another and I found her character very difficult to like. On the other hand, Jake is considerate, good to his friends and tries to help Brett out of the difficulties that are the result of her poor choices. Even when his own actions of helping Brett are somewhat despicable, Jake never explains or tries to condone his conduct.<br />Along with their friends, Robert Cohn, Bill Gorton and Britt's fiance, Mike Campbell, they go from bar to bar and restaurant to restaurant drinking and eating the days away. The group finally ends up going to Spain and attending the bullfights in Pamplona where Brett seduces a handsome young bullfighter.<br />At first, most of the characters seem like people without much depth or purpose, but then you realize that they have all been damaged in one way or another by the past and tragic war. Their carousing and fast living are a means of dealing with their problems. The friendships between the various characters is one of the most endearing parts of the story.<br />Hemingway has given me more of an understanding of that time in our history and of the lost generation. Worth reading!	2002-09-26

I purchased this small  manual in 1989 and continue to use it as a source of reference. The author, Craig Tufts wrote it while he was a naturalist for the National Wildlife Federation.<br />The book covers a lot of different material and there are six chapters:   MAKING A PLACE FOR WILDLIFE---FEEDING BIRDS---WHO'S WHO AMONG YOUR BACKYARD BIRDS---IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE---MAKING OTHER VISITORS WELCOME and WOOING WILDLIFE WITH WATER, FLOWERS AND SHELTER.<br />The information provided is just what I was looking for. I've used the easy recipe for making  hummingbird nectar for years and I keep four feeders going all summer. A great thrill was seeing seven hummingbirds at one time all hovering for a place at a feeder. You can also learn which plants are best so that you can entice these lovely little birds to your garden.  The little \\"Hummers\\" are attracted to bright colors and prefer flowers that are tubular in shape such as lobelia and trumpet vine.<br /> Most people are familiar with the marigold plant, but besides being easy to grow, the flowers also provide food for several bird species. This book is also chock full of fascinating information about butterflies, birds, bugs and various other creatures.  Oh, one last teaser, you can also learn the identity of the Tomato Bandit, the robber and thief of many gardens.<br />I did have the opportunity to meet the author when we both attended a butterfly count a few years ago.

She was the second of four daughters born to British parents who made their home in India. She tells magical stories of her life in India and how the colorful and lush country influenced her as a writer. The family seemed always to be traveling between England and India.  The early part of her story is filled with the support of her warm and loving family. Her writing began as a child and continued throughout her life. Besides writing, she also loved to dance. As a young woman, she taught dancing and also ran several dancing schools.<br />Her marriage to Laurence Sinclair Foster took place in 1934. He was a stockbroker and a good deal of his life centered around social and athletic interests. She gave birth to two lovely daughters, but she ended up being their sole support because her husband was constantly in debt and deserted his family. BLACK NARCISSUS, which was her first truly successful book was  published in 1939. Europe was in a turmoil and World War II was about to begin.  Not the best time to begin a career as a novelist.<br />Godden spent the war years in Kashmir.  She sustained her life and that of her children by renting Dove House which was an abandoned house far removed from the closest village. She grew her own food, and lived on very little money.  Godden and her daughters suffered health problems because of the deprivation that they experienced during that time. Her strength and courage was impressive to read about. She wrote constantly and always spoke lovingly of her years at Dove House.<br />The book ends with a very hopeful  Rumer Godden arriving back in England with the finished manuscript of THE RIVER tucked under her arm.	2002-08-04

The teenager plans to spend several months studying in London. On the drive home, Blake surprises Annie by asking for a divorce. Annie is shocked and totally falls apart. She leaves California and retreats to her hometown of Mystic, Washington. In Mystic, she meets up with her old boyfriend Nick, and immediately rekindles a romance. Nick has problems of his own and is haunted by his wife's death. Izzie, his six year old daughter is so upset by the loss of her mother that she no longer has the ability to speak. There are several different subplots going on and the author manages to juggle them quite well. The dilemma of the child Izzie was by far the most interesting and creative part of the book.<br />In a lot of ways this was quite an ambitious story, and Kristin Hannah gave an excellent account of the emotions that her characters experienced. She also wrote beautiful descriptive passages about the beauty of the Olympic Peninsula. However, Annie the main character was a little frustrating to read about. She was just too perfect. She's attractive, smart, thin, rich. talented, a great mother and a really nice person! Wow! I also had a difficult time believing that a wife would not have a clue to the fact that the man she was married to for 20 years had consistently been unfaithful to her for ages. Come on Annie, a man can't be working late every night! Perhaps that was Annie's flaw, she was so wrapped up in her daughter and in creating a perfect home that she ignored the signs of a husband who had little loyalty or real interest in his family.	2002-07-22

As the child danced, Babci would start to reminisce about when she was young, and would tell Gabriella stories about her former life in her native country, Poland. She told of dancing with her husband Dziadziu and how handsome he looked in his white shirt. Another of her favorite stories was how the family raised chickens and had to paint their feet blue to distinguish them from their neighbors birds, and she then would talk about the difficult trip across the ocean to America. The book ends with Gabriella and her mother preparing to give Babci a wonderful Easter meal.<br />The detailed illustrations are memorable. There is one of Babci on board a ship coming to America, and she's trading her Polish pottery teapot for food. Another illustration is of Gabriella braiding Babci's long hair. Each picture is a special treat! The drawings were beautifully done by Annika Nelson. This wonderful story would make a worthy present for any person who has had a loving grandmother. I still have a great memory of my Babci tucking me under a huge feather bed when I was six years old, and kissing me good-night.	2002-07-08

It was a nice surprise to see how attractive Queen Elizabeth was as a child and young woman. I had the impression that taking on the crown of England turned a pretty 25 year old woman into a matron much older than her years. I think that the pictures speak for themselves in how well they reveal the character and strength of the Queen. This is an enjoyable book, even if you're not an Anglophile.	2002-07-08

There's the quilting interest, because the main character, Benni Harper is the curator of a small folk-art museum in California. In fact, the story starts with Benni getting ready to have a quilt show. The mystery comes in when Benni discovers the body of a local artist in the museum. Finally, a little romance is provided by the attractive detective who's investigating the murder. He's Police Chief Gabe Ortiz and seems to have more than a little interest in the curator. We also meet  Benni's grandmother who adds the humorous touch to the story. <br />Earlene Fowler has made her characters into real personalities and provides us with a fun and enjoyable read. I'm looking forward to the next book in this series.	2002-06-30

Once I got into the story, I had a wonderful surprise. Laura Hillenbrand has written a detailed account of Seabiscuit, and managed to made it incredibly interesting and very exciting.<br />The author starts by giving the biographies of the fascinating men that had the most to do with Seabiscuit's rise to fame.  They were Charles Howard, Tom Smith, Red Pollard and George Woolf.  Each of these men contributed to the greatness of the famed horse.<br />Seabiscuit himself was not the most beautiful of horses and, in fact was a pretty difficult animal to deal with. Trainer Tom Smith saw something in the horse that he knew was worth tapping and encouraged Charles Howard to purchase Seabiscuit.  Red Pollard and George Woolf were the jockeys who rode him into fame.  By the time I was reading about the races, I couldn't put the book down until I found out which horse won that particular race.  <br />This is a great American story!	2002-06-30

My husband and I listened to the audio tape which was beautifully read by Hope David.<br />IN MY HANDS is the autobiography of Irene Gut, a 17 year old Polish Catholic girl. The book begins with lovely recollections that Irene had of her early life in Czestochowa, Poland, where she was surrounded by her four sisters and loving parents. When the Nazi's invaded Poland in 1939, Irene was living away from her family in Radom where she was studying to become a nurse. When Radom was bombed, the Polish Army had to retreat and asked that some of the medical staff come with them to help take care of the wounded. Irene volunteered to go, and eventually ended up on the other side of Poland which was under Russian rule. Many miles away from her family, and eventually separated from the other hospital staff, Irene faced life alone, and saw the country that she loved controlled by brutes and killers. <br />At first this young woman saw the worst in the Russian soldiers and later she also met the German invaders who showed her another side of brutality.  Despite the threat to her own life, Irene risked everything so that many others had the chance to live. This very inspiring memoir compares to HIDING PLACE the story of Corrie Ten Boom and her family.	2002-06-19

This story was inspired by Eyam, a real village in England which is referred to as Plague Village. Brooks visited there several times and did extensive research for this novel. <br />This is historical fiction in it's purest sense. The author tells the story of one Derbyshire village that was devastated by the bubonic plague. The main character is Anna Firth, a maid in the home of the local vicar, Michael Mompellion and his wife, Elinor. When the plague arrives in the village, the vicar preaches that the town's inhabitants should seal themselves away from the rest of the country and stay in the village. As time passes, and more and more deaths occur, the villagers can no longer cope and start to become involved in witchcraft and other barbaric practices. The two women, Anna and Elinor are the true strength of the community, and learn as much as they can about herbal lore and try to ease the pain and suffering of the victims. Once into the story, I did not want to put it down. It really shows the strength of the human spirit and how we have a bond that is shared by those who went before us. Although, this is a very painful story to read, it's written well and Brooks conveys true compassion through her main characters. After reading this book, I feel like I really visited that place and that time in our history.<br />The ending was totally unexpected, but all things considered this is a great read and an unforgettable tale.	2002-06-15

Kathy Sheldon has a nice easy style of writing and makes her book informative and pleasant to read.<br />The book covers just about every question that one might have on the subject of different kinds of garden barriers.  There are six chapters:  FUNCTION &amp; DESIGN - Discusses your particular needs. WALLS - Different types of material to use,  stone, brick, concrete, or timber.  FENCES - Various kinds of fencing, board, lattice, basket weave, post &amp; rail, bamboo, stick, wattle, chain link, and woven willow.  HEDGES and TALL PLANTINGS - Making border divisions by using bushes, flowers and trees.   PLANTS and BORDERS -  Choosing the right plants to go along with your wall, fence or hedge. ENHANCING BORDERS - Ways to decorate your garden walls and fencing.<br />There are color pictures on almost every page, and instructions for building the various walls and fences are written and then illustrated with drawings. Even if you already have some type of fence or wall, this book provides a lot of ideas about how to enhance an already existing border.  I liked reading about the living willow fence which sounded like a an interesting project to try.  Also, the unusually named ha-ha wall provided a little history. It's an ancient design that was used around large estates to enhance the view, but keep the farm animals contained.	2002-06-05

It's beautifully packaged with a neat title, attractive cover and interesting story line, but Jennifer Chiaverini did not develop her characters or deliver a believable story. <br />The main, character, Sarah McClure moves to a small Pennsylvania town with her husband, Matt who works as a landscaper.  Sarah's not happy about the move, does not get along with her mother, and can't seem to find a job that she wants. She does a lot of whining about her various problems which is a big bore. Matt introduces Sarah to his client, Sylvia Compson, a mature lady who is an accomplished quilter, and has a beautiful old estate, called Elm Street Manor.  She employs Sarah to help prepare the house for sale, and agrees to give her quilting lessons as part of her salary.  The premise of this story is excellent, but Sarah is so self-centered and boorish that it was impossible for me to care about her, or Mrs. Compson who is also difficult to like. By the time that I did start to feel an interest in the characters, the story was almost over.<br />This book had so much promise, but the author dropped the ball. Perhaps her next book will show her characters to have more depth and not be so childish.	2002-06-03

Each time, we've visited a different part of the country. Our most recent trip was in April/May 2002. We all have several different travel books about Poland that we've purchased over the years. However, without consulting one another, three of us carried their copies of this book with them, and pulled them out when we met in Warsaw. We all agreed that this is the best book on traveling in Poland. As we toured through the country, we would read about the places that we would be visiting the next day.  The book's information was always good and easy to locate. Even now that we've returned, we're still exchanging phone calls with advice to read a certain page in the LONELY PLANET- POLAND book for some information that we'll need for our next trip.<br />This is the only book you'll need for seeing Poland. By the   way, Poland is a wonderful place to visit with gracious people, historical buildings, great restaurants, beautiful cathedrals, and ancient cities with remarakable towns squares.	2002-05-24

THE CREATURES' CHOIR was  written quite a few years later and these last poems are more like letters to God, where the animals refer to their daily problems. The author did not write sentimental verse. The poems of the animals seem to radiate with truth.<br />I was first introduced to PRAYERS FROM THE ARK in 1977 by my sister, Susan who lent me her book.  Since that time, I've purchased two copies myself, and have given several as gifts.  The original book was written in French by Carmen Bernos De Gasztold, and published in 1947.  The famous author, Rumer Godden discovered the work and was so impressed with the poems that she translated them into English.<br />There are over fifty beautiful poems in this book where each animal speaks to God in his or her own voice revealing their individual traits and personalities.<br />The Dove--\\"The Ark waits, Lord; it has endured. Let me carry it a sprig of hope and joy.\\"<br />The Dog--\\"No one but You and I understands what faithfulness is.\\"<br />The Ladybird-- \\"Thank You for having made me so that no one is afraid of me.\\"<br />This is a charming book for an adult to read and a wonderful way for a child to learn that every creatures' life has dignity and purpose.	2002-05-22

It was a very nice surprise.  It's written for the American of Polish descent and is filled with a lot of interesting data. Growing up in Virginia, my family were a long way away from any Polish American districts, and this book highlights the sense of ethnic community that I wanted to experience.<br />POLISH TOUCHES is a quick  way to get the feeling of Polish culture.  Starting with a brief history of Poland, the book covers early immigration, Our Lady of Czestochowa, Polish folk arts, traditions, music, Polish heroes, achievements of American Poles, cooking, recipes and other general information. In fact, I was amazed to learn that Chicago has \\"more than 100,000 Polish immigrants,\\" who arrived in the 1980's. We're told that \\"Chicago also has approximately 40 blocks of Polish-American businesses.\\"<br />Being a history buff, I was pleased to find two of my favorite American Revolutionary War heroes mentioned. Brigadier General Count Kazimierz (Casimir) Pulaski was a cavalry and guerrilla warfare expert. His corps, the Pulaski Legion included Light Horse Harry Lee, the father of General Robert E. Lee. Pulaski was wounded in the Battle of Savannah  and died aboard the Wasp, an American ship. He was thirty-one years old.<br />The other short, but concise biography is of Brigadier General Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a brillant military engineer and an aide to George Washington.  He's known for his engineering feats which include the fortifications at West Point.  Washington presented his own sword to Kosciuszko, who was also awarded American citizenship.<br />A book that provides what it offers, a touch of Poland.	2002-05-20

The show, supposedly about village life, is really just going to focus on old scandals that certain people thought that they had lived down. The residents are angry and Constable Hamish Macbeth is also upset because he knows that many innocent people will suffer because of the nasty news reporter dragging up hurtful information.<br />A pretty new town resident, Elspeth Grant has taken more than an interest in Hamish, but he's still moping over his lost love, Priscilla. When a murder takes place, Constable Macbeth pulls himself together to track down the killer.  As usual, the Strathbane police authorities advise Hamish to keep out of the murder investigation, but obsessed with his own theories, he stays in the middle of it all. When a second murder occurs, Hamish is committed to finding the killer.<br />These light, but charming Harmish Macbeth mysteries are always fun to read.	2002-05-15

This particular book was a gift from my son and I have to say it's one of my favorite books about herbs. Because this is an English book, you'll have to take your climate into consideration with some of the suggested plantings. <br />THE COMPLETE BOOK OF HERBS has gorgeous photographs and illustrations.  In the Herbal Index section there are over 60 different plants pictured.  Each illustration shows the entire plant with close up pictures of the seeds, flowers and often the root when it's usable. The section on Herbs in the Garden offers different designs with suggestions of which plants are complimentary partners. One interesting picture that I particularly liked in this section was of a moonlight garden.  Beautiful and serene! <br />There are also sections on: growing & harvesting, herbal healing, beauty care, and cooking with herbs.  The recipes are pretty diverse. The foods look so good that you'll want to try them all.  I especially enjoyed the Oregano Tomatoes; Garden Herb Omelette; Melon, Tomato & Mint Salad and the Lemon Balm Cheesecake. All delicious!<br />If you just want one book on herbs, this beautiful and concise book is it!	2002-05-14

The stranger that asks too many questions, stares at you, or seems to be following you are all reasons to be cautious. The former boyfriend or ex-husband who won't give up, the employee who was fired, the applicant who does not comprehend why you won't give him a job.  Anyone who does not seem to understand the word \\"no\\" could be a problem.  Mr. De Becker says to follow your instincts and teaches survival skills that could save your life.    <br />The narrator, Tom Stechschulte did a wonderful job and made the tape very easy to listen to.

Throw in several children, add tours of duty to Japan, Central and South America and you have a lifetime of various adventures. The author, Bina Cady Kiyonaga writes with feeling, and tells the story of her marriage to Joe Kiyonaga with a great deal of candor, even describing the racial prejudice that her husband had to endure. Her rich descriptions of the various places that the family lived really enhance the story and give it an extra dimension.<br />Bina has an easy style of writing and describes her life with a great deal of wit and humor.

Bernelly's an independent country mouse who loves her life. Her jaunty attire of red scarf and black boots suit her life style as a fly-fishing instructor.  She spends her leisure time tying flies and reading.  Her library has an eclectic group of books that include, THE KENYON REVIEW, HENRIETTA, and THE VILLAGE, which indicate that she's a well read young mouse. Of course, her favorite books are about fly-fishing. When Bernelly realizes that she needs new boots, she decides to visit her cousin Harriet for a shopping trip to the city. Harriet's a stylish city mouse who wears gold loop earrings, and has a distinctive flair for clothes. Her sophisticated life as a famous artist allows for exotic travel and shopping. She's delighted to have Bernelly visit and takes her all over town seeing the sights. Bernelly's a bit overwhelmed and home sick, and invites Harriet to visit the country. When the city cousin visits the country, she's not overwhelmed, she's a little bored with the fly-fishing, gardening and the slow pace of life. In spite of the fact that the two mice have different life styles, they seem to enjoy an affectionate relationship which adds a nice warmth to the story.    I enjoyed the detail that Elizabeth Dahlie put into her illustrations. My favorite images are of Bernelly and Harriet walking hand in hand down a cobblestone city street where a flower pot reflects a house number--a delicious tea, served on blue and white china at Putney's Tea Shop-- shopping at an expensive shoe store--and, a mixed group of Bernelly's friends sharing a conversation at dinner. Each page of this enchanting book is filled with wonderful pictures.      A well done book that children will love.	2002-04-15

The book is beautifully done, useful, and very pleasant to read. <br />The first section provides general information about feeding, housing and gardening for the birds. In the second section, we learn about courtship, baby birds, territory, and migration. The third section gives specific data on individual bird species, and finally, a small appendix provides lists of favorite foods, egg identification, and habitat requirements.<br />Here are a few bird facts that I thought were particularly interesting: Mourning Doves mate for life and are excellent parents. - The Kildeer is very unusual because they often make their nests on unpaved driveways which is confusing because the eggs look like small pieces of gravel. - The beautiful Indigo Bunting frequently uses the same nest by just making yearly repairs. - One very unpopular bird is the Brown-Headed Cowbird. They like to lay their eggs in the nests of other birds and leave all of the work and rearing to another mother. -  The Winter Wren builds several nests which he shows to a possible mate for approval. The female then picks her favorite nest.  Unwilling to let the other nests go to waste, he shows the remaining nests to a second female and ends up with two families.<br />If you enjoy feeding the birds, you'll love this book.	2002-03-28

She starts by informing  us about an archaeological site that dates back to 550-400 BC. The site was discovered in the Bydgoszcz province in1931.  It was determined  that the early inhabitants grew several types of grain and used herbs in medicinal preparations and  for flavoring foods.<br />The author also tells us how herbs were used in  the pre-Christian era and how those practices were integrated into the Christian celebrations that came later. Due to the geographic location of Poland, many travelers following the trade routes passed through her borders and introduced exotic new plants to the country.<br />There's an abundance of data offered about the herbal gardens in the monasteries. Those gardens were in many ways the most advanced and useful because the monks had links with their fellow orders from all over Europe. Therefore, the different formulas for herbal medicines were passed back and forth between the monasteries.<br />Palace gardens are also discussed. Since the royal families made marriage alliances with neighboring countries, the spouses often brought different plants and trees with them to be planted in their new home. Italian style gardens and vegetables such as tomatoes and cauliflower were introduced by Queen Bona who was born in Italy.<br />I particularly liked the information given about the cottage gardens. We're told \\"that a lovely garden was the spirit of the housewife.\\" These kitchen gardens were much simpler than their formal counterparts. The lady of the house would grow the herbs that she liked best. \\"There was marjoram for sausage, dill for pickling, and parsley, sage and fennel for enhancing soups and stews.\\" The illustrations in this part of the book intrigued me, and I really enjoyed the folk-style drawings. I thought that the different types of bee skeps were very unique. Sugar was a luxury and the common people kept bees so that they would have honey to use as a sweetener.<br />Finally, even the  glossary of herbs and flowers presented some absorbing and entertaining passages.  The customary usage for the various plants are offered and a few recipes and remedies are also included. The names of the plants are given in English, Latin and Polish.  There's even a recipe for Benedictine which sounds very intriguing!<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about Poland.	2002-03-11

He's very attractive with black fur, a white chest, and white paws.  The little feline wonders through a neighborhood hungry and weak,  seeking a safe place.  He meets some children and their mother who appear to admire him, but because he's wearing a collar they assume he belongs to someone in the area. The truth is, he's been lost for a long time and he has no home. The collar, once placed on him with care, is now outgrown and is causing him a great deal of pain. He does not remember how to get home. Months pass and the cat is slowly starving to death because he's too weak to hunt. One day,  the exhausted cat is confronted by a large and aggressive dog. What happens to the cat and how he gets his name is a story every child will love. <br />This beautifully told narrative is well accompanied by memorable and touching illustrations. The fact that this is a true story makes it very powerful and reminds us that a stray animal may need help.	2002-03-10

A particular TV station always had wonderful classic movies on Sunday afternoons. Our favorites were always the movies that featured Cary Grant.  We happily munched our potato chips and moved to Hollywood for a few hours.<br />The author tells us in the beginning of the book that this is not a biography. It's more of a tribute to Cary Grant.  The book skips around through the years and not always in chronological order. The author does give us Grant's background, growing up in England, and the sad story of his mother.  She was committed to a sanitarium after she suffered a nervous breakdown when Grant was 8 years old, and he did not see her again for more than 20 years. He believed that she had died and did not know until he received a letter from her in 1937 that she was still alive.  <br />Grant made dozens of films with some of the most beautiful leading ladies in Hollywood. Always a gentleman, Cary would never say which one was his favorite actress. He retired from  films when he was 62. He felt that he was too old to be cast as the romantic lead which was always his forte.  <BR> <BR>Nancy Nelson approached Grant in 1981. She asked him to consider doing some unrehearsed appearances in front of audiences where he would  answer questions about himself and his movies.  It took her some time to convince him to do it, but it finally came about in a one-man show called A Conversation With Cary Grant. Grant made 36 public appearances from 1982 until his death in 1986 at the age of 82.  This book highlights Grant's own words in discussing dozens of topics. It's also filled with insightful quotations from Grant's famous friends.   <br />Most of  us seem to remember Grant saying:  Judy, Judy, Judy, but Grant never said that in a film and there are various explanations about where it came from. One version, was that in a night club show, comedian Larry Storch was doing an impersonation of Cary Grant.  During that part of his show Judy Garland walked in and Storch imitating Cary Grant, said  \\"Judy, Judy, Judy.\\"<br />Grant's friends saw him as a generous and caring person. If you liked Cary Grant, you'll enjoy this book which gives fascinating recollections of his life.  For instance, he loved the telephone, generally answered it himself and was famous for making calls to people who would not believe it was really Grant and hanging up on him. He also wrote articulate letters which he usually signed, with \\"Happy thoughts!\\" <br />Happy thoughts to you too, Cary from one Judy.	2002-03-05

The sisters, Patricia Anne and Mary Alice are hilarious. <br />In this mystery, Mary Alice's daughter gets married and the wedding guests are varied and include Meg March Bryan, a very successful genealogist, and a guest from the groom's side of the family.  Patricia Anne and Mary Alice become chummy with Meg and have a luncheon date with her.  The luncheon goes well, until their guest hurries away without her two briefcases.  Shortly after that the sisters learn that Meg has taken her life by jumping off the 9th floor of the building across the street. The sister detectives get involved with her death which they don't believe was a sucide.<br />What makes this book so charming are the sisters.  Patricia Anne, a former English teacher, and married to Fred for over forty years, is a tiny and proper lady.  Her sister,Mary Alice is almost her opposite in every way. She's big, beautiful and men seem to love all 250 pounds of her. She describes herself as being 5 foot 12 inches tall and she's looking for a fourth husband.  The first three are all lying in the cemetery, side by side. Mary Alice calls Patricia Anne, Mouse and tells people that little Mouse is anorexic. I laughed out loud over the verbal exchanges between the sisters.<br />I read this very quickly, and I can't wait to read more books in this series.	2002-03-05

We listened to the audio book and were very impressed by the stories that were used to illustrate different virtues. While much of the anthology was intended for very young children, there were also selections that people of any age could enjoy. The many stories gave examples of: Hard Work; Compassion; Honesty; Friendship;  Loyalty; Persistence; Courage; Faith; Self-Discipline and Responsibility.<br />The tape had many excellent narrators, but it was extremely entertaining to hear Tom Selleck, Charleston Heston, and Michael York do readings of various pieces of literature.<br />We started with the idea of just listening to a tape or two, but enjoyed it so much we did the entire book.  I really think that this would be a loving gift to give to a young family!	2002-02-24

It's a great  reference to have for both residents and visitors. I spent the first two hours just looking up points of interest and trivia about the Old Dominion. Virginia has so many historical sites that touring the state is like taking a class on the formation of America. A tourist can visit Revolutionary War Sites, Civil War Battlefields, scenic old towns, and the beautifully restored great houses, like Mount Vernon in Alexandria , Monticello in Charlottesville, Oatlands Plantation in Leesburg and, of course, the James River Plantations.   Williamsburg is a must see for everyone. <br />This book's Introduction gives a little background of Virginia and some general history. The handbook is then divided into the five regional areas of the state.  They are the Northern, Central, Coastal Plain, Southwest and the Shenandoah Valley.  Within these divisions information is given on the counties and major cities. In each place, the historic sites, annual events, shopping places, museums, hotel accommodations, recreation areas, dining and local transportation are all listed and given detailed descriptions.<br />I think that the best way to truly critique a guide book is to read about an area that you know pretty well and see how the authors handled that region. All of the major sites were mentioned in my area and  the accommodations and things to do were all covered.  I checked out the restaurants listed and there were eight mentioned.  I would have left out two. One major restaurant was not included. Other than that minor point, the authors gave a pretty accurate description of my area.  This book is very concise and I believe it to be a very helpful guide to traveling in the great state of Virginia..	2002-02-08

Each morning, along with our coffee, we had breakfast with John and Abigail Adams. They both made a lasting impression in my mind.  David McCullough did a fantastic job of bringing John & Abigail Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Ben Franklin to life. The historical facts became more interesting when interjected with the feelings and reflections that the founding fathers had on the various events. The author used excerpts from countless letters that passed between Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Washington, and other great men, to give us their thoughts in their own words.      John Adams seemed to have been brilliant, pompous, very likable and extremely exasperating. His personal integrity noted by many people was one of his most prominent features. From a country  lawyer in Massachusetts, he went on to become a member of the Continental Congress, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He secured loans from the Dutch for the fledgling American government, helped to negotiate the peace treaty with Great Britain and, for three years served as our first minister to the Court of Saint James in London.  He was our first Vice President serving under George Washington and, of course our second President.    Many pages are devoted to the often troubled relationship between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. They made their peace in the last years of their lives, and the letters that passed between these two American icons, were wonderful. In the end, they shared one final day. They both died on July 4, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.    McCullough even gives us a love story thats told through the letters and diaries of John and Abigail. The love and sacrifices they made for their country during and after the revolution is something that seems to be unparalleled in any other historic couple. Abigail appeared to be an equal partner in her relationshipwith John. Because of his appointments and positions, she was on her own and managing their property for months and years at a time, and made many choices and decisions that greatly influenced their lives. She not only helped her husband become the second President of the U. S., she also raised a son, John Quincy Adams who became the sixth President of the United States.      This well researched book gave me the feeling of witnessing the birth of my country. The book's narrator, Nelson Runger did an  excellent job.	2002-02-01

Her excellent reading ability and voice added even more to this lush and beautiful story.<br />There are three different narratives taking place in this book:  Deanna Wolfe is a wildlife biologist who's employed by the Park Service.  She lives alone and works on Zebulon Mountain.  Deanna is a very single minded woman who's main focus is protecting the wildlife and vegetation on the mountain. This summer, her awareness of a family of coyotes in the area makes her very protective and concerned for their welfare. Her involvement with Eddie Bondo, an attractive hunter complicates her life, but gives her the intimacy that she's been missing.<br />Lusa Maluf Landowski lives in the valley.  She's a bright young city girl who moved to the area when she married a local farmer. Lusa who's an entomologist seems to have nothing in common with her husband's family and feels isolated from life.  After a tragic event takes place, she learns more about herself and her in-laws than she ever expected.<br />I especially liked the narrative about two elderly characters,  Garnet Walker and Nannie Rawley who are valley neighbors.  They've known each other for years, but have different views on just about every topic.  Their encounters add humor to this colorful saga.    Garnet, a retired, teacher has a lot of faith in the past and is doing his best to introduce a variety of blight resistant chestnut trees to the valley.  Nanny, an independent lady who despite old gossip about her personal life, has always followed her own instincts.   She's an organic gardener and hates pesticides which causes problems for Garnet's chestnut seedlings.   <br />This is very rich reading!  Recommended!	2002-01-30

It's a treat to<br />just look at the photographs.  If you feel so inclined,<br />the instructions are given for making some of the<br />quilts, rugs and pillows.<br />It's interesting to view the home environment of a<br />successful working artist and to see how different<br />objects are collected and used as sources of future<br />inspiration.  I particularly enjoyed the pictures of<br />Mr. Fassett's blue and white pottery collection which<br />is also a favorite of mine.  I also liked seeing his<br />bookcase, which from the point of view of a book<br />collector, looked well used and filled with cherished<br />books.<br />The section of the book called Museum Tour, shows<br />various exhibits of Mr. Fassett's work as a textile<br />artist.

Little is known of their lives except for what we've read in the Bible. Over the years, many stories have been written concerning the Magi, but I feel that this is the most beautiful of them all.<br />This poignant fable concerns Artaban who was a member of the ancient priesthood of the Magi. He had been watching the heavens and had seen the signs that it was the time for an old prophecy to be fulfilled. \\"There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall arise out of Israel.\\"<br />Artaban sold his house and all that he owned and purchased three beautiful jewels to be given to the new King of Israel. The gifts were a beautiful blue sapphire which was like a piece of the night sky; a ruby that was even more red than a sunrise; and a pearl as pure as the peak of a snow mountain. Artaban was to meet and travel with three other members of the ancient priesthood, Balthazar, Caspar and Melchoir, so they could follow the new star of Israel together.<br />On his way to meet with his friends, he stops to help a dying man and is never able to catch up with the other Magi. Artaban spends his life helping others, but always seeking Jesus. The beautiful ending is worth waiting for. A very inspirational story!	2002-01-07

I liked<BR>the fact that I could go back and forth between the<BR>two translations and learn a few words in Polish.  <BR>I also enjoyed the many illustrations that were done<BR>by Barbara Swidzinska, but I wish that all of the<BR>fables had been illustrated.<br />The subject matter is much more complicated than the<BR>titles imply.  Here's a sampling of the fables:  In the<BR>tale of THE HUMBLE LION, when a king asks his subjects<BR>to speak the truth, it could be a deadly mistake.  Or in<BR>FRIENDS, the story of a hare who was a kind and good<BR>friend to all.  When the hare needs help, he's given a<BR>lesson in his choice of friends.  Finally, with the fable<BR>of THE HERON, THE FISH, AND THE CRAB we all learn <BR>that a traitor eventually gets caught.<br />As a group, these fables were published after the death<BR>of Ignacy Krasicki in the year 1803. Although, we're<BR>told that many of these pieces were individually<BR>published at an earlier date.  Krasicki (1735-1801) was<BR>referred to as &quot;the Prince of Poets&quot; by his contemporaries.<BR>Most of these pieces have political connotations and were<BR>written after the first partition of Poland when the<BR>surrounding countries of Russia, Austria and Prussia<BR>conquered and divided Poland among themselves. <br />I'ts a pleasure to have this literary work translated for<BR>us by Gerard T. Kapolka.  My thanks to him.	2001-12-30

His request was denied and the<BR>conference ended.  This part of the story is true.<BR>The author used that historical base to write his<BR>story of what it would have been like if the brides<BR>had actually been given to the Indians.<br />We're first introduced to May Dodd on a train bound <BR>for the Nebraska Territory.  She had been confined to<BR>a mental institution by her wealthy father and diagnosed<BR>with Hysteria and Promiscuity. Her sin was to leave her<BR>influential family and live with a working class man to<BR>whom she was not married.  The fact that she bore that<BR>man two children further enraged her father, and he had<BR>her committed to an asylum.  In order to leave the<BR>institution, May had agreed to be part of a government<BR>program that provided white wives for Indians.  Thus,<BR>the story begins.<br />The events of life on the prairie are told through May's<BR>journal and various letters that she wrote to her family.<BR>The characters come alive on the pages of the book.  The<BR>various brides all have their own reasons for joining the<BR>program.  Some, like May were from institutions confined<BR>there for various reasons.  Then, there were the ones<BR>looking for a new life and/or adventure.  A few others had<BR>been in jail and pardoned if they agreed to join the <BR>&quot;brides&quot; expedition.<br />Through May's writings, I even had a glimpse into the daily<BR>life of the Indians which gave me more of an understanding<BR>of their culture.  The brides had to learn to live in an<BR>entirely different world where protocol, morals and even<BR>justice were measured by unknown standards.  This is an<BR>amazing story and I had to keep in mind that it was a work<BR>of fiction during the time that I was reading it.<br />The author, Jim Fergus did his job in giving this novel such<BR>an authentic feeling.  I highly recommend it to anyone who<BR>wants to read an exciting and well written story.	2001-12-30

The book takes place in<BR>Edinburgh, Scotland.  In the town square there's a drinking<BR>fountain with a statue of a dog on the top.  The bottom part<BR>of the fountain has a water basin so that the dogs of the <BR>town may also have a drink.  The fountain was placed there<BR>in memory of Greyfriar's Bobby who died in 1872.<br />This is a retelling of a true story about Bobby, a terrier<BR>dog who remained loyal to his master, Jock even after his<BR>master's death.  There are apparently several books written <BR>over the years telling the story, but this particular<BR>publication has some of the most beautiful and touching<BR>illustrations of Bobby.<br />Packaged as a book for children, this is a warm and loving<BR>story of devotion and can be enjoyed by children and adults.<BR>Every dog lover should see and read this book!	2001-11-29

The ladies of the 1800's<br />left us their stories in diaries and letters.  They also left<br />us their beautiful quilts.<br />The hardships of life on the American frontier was helped by the<br />quilting projects that the women used to fill their time.<br />In 1831, Lydia Marie Child wrote, &quot;The true economy of<br />housekeeping is simply the art of gathering up all the<br />fragments, so that nothing be lost.  I mean the fragments of<br />time, as well as materials.  Nothing should be thrown away so<br />long as it is possible to make any use of it, however trifling<br />that use may be...&quot;  This is certainly an idea that is far<br />removed from today's thinking where we throw away many useable<br />items.<br />The quotations that are used throughout the book are poignant<br />and very interesting.  These words from our history are set against the background of pieces of quilts and wonderful photographs of ladies, and the various accoutrements of sewing.<br />The longing to keep connected to her young married daughter is<br />reflected in the following letter from a mother. In 1850, Hannah Shaw wrote to her daughter, &quot;I have been looking for something to send to you, but I could not find anthing that I could send in a letter bitt a piece of my new dress...&quot;<br />This is an easy and charming way to reflect on our American<br />history.	2001-10-14

This little book teaches a lesson in love and trust.<br />I liked this story and feel it would add great value to a child's library.

It takes place in Holland during the years 1664 to 1676.  The author, Tracy Chevalier has used a beautiful painting by Johannes Vermeer to spin a beautiful story.  She's named the girl from the painting Griet, and made her a 16 year old maid in the Vermeer household. The artist is famous for his sunlit domestic scenes and considered one of the greatest of the Dutch painters.<br />I liked the fact that Griet is intelligent and seems to have an instinctive understanding of humanity.  Her quick mind helped her to traverse through a household of jealous and mean spirited people.<br />Chevalier has learned her craft well.  The characters have been so fine tuned that I felt that I knew everyone myself.  I've read a little about the life of Vermeer and it seems to me that the author did her homework.  I'll look forward to her next novel!	2001-07-26

Now, after reading it, I'm encouraging everyone to do the same.    The story begins in 1937 when a Dutch family is preparing for the 100th birthday of the family shop, Ten Boom: Watches. Flowers are being delivered and friends are calling to help celebrate the day.  The conversation centers around Germany and the Jews who are coming to Holland for asylum.  The Ten Boom's and their guests could not have foreseen what was to come.  Their world had changed.    This is the autobiographical story of Corrie Ten Boom and how she and her family worked for the Dutch underground movement  during World War II.  The family were Christians and took a very strong stand against the Nazi persecution of the Jews.  Corrie's father, a kindly, religious man, summed up his thoughts on the Nazis by saying, \\"I pity them Corrie.  They have touched the apple of God's eye.\\"    Corrie and her sister, Betsie were two ladies aged 45 and 52  years of age, respectively.  They are the unlikely heroines of this story.  Never married and rather innocent of the world, they proved the old saying that \\"you can't tell a book by its cover.\\"  Both sisters risked everything they had including their lives to save people they didn't even know.    In today's world of \\"me first\\", it's so encouraging to read a story of a family that truly lived their faith and practiced the Golden Rule.	2001-04-14

The story has an historical setting with a suspenseful plot and the book is just long enough.<br />Verity Grey is an archaeologist who has the opportunity to work on an ancient Roman site in Scotland.  She's smart, attractive and very dedicated to her work.  The project is an interesting one, and she's working with 3 other archaeologists who all have different backgrounds.  A wealthy older Irishman, a deadly<br />handsome Englishman, and the fascinating Scotsman.  Of course, there is a romance which is not overdone, but portrayed with just the right touch to keep the reader interested.<br />The story is enhanced by Robbie a young boy who lives nearby and has the second sight.  The child often sees the ghost of a Roman Sentinel.  Verity's trapped by her rational side as a scientist, and her desire to believe that the boy is actually seeing a ghost.

It's also a companion book to DOOYARD HERBS.  The author has a distinct style of writing and makes you wish that she lived on your street so that you could drop in for some cake and tea, and of course some gardening advice.<br />This is not just a book with recipes.  Mrs. Rago tells us in the beginning of the book that &quot;Herbs are the soul of flavor,&quot; and advises us that fresh herbs are best.  She encourages the reader to grow their own plants, and helps by giving some simple designs for herbal gardens.  A list is also provided  of the various herbs that are used in the recipes so you can check and see if you have them growing in your garden or packaged on your pantry shelf. <br />The herbal blends in stores are pricey, but here were given the specific herbal blends for: Herb Salt, Herb Pepper, Instead Of Salt, Herb Sugars, Fine Herbs and the Herbal Blends for Poultry, Lamb, Pork, Beef and Seafood.  I was also happy to learn the ingredients for Italian and French Herbal mixtures.<br />The recipes are presented in monthly groupings.  Each month of the year is discussed and appropriate recipes are presented. For January, Linda says &quot;After a lingering purple sunrise even the little herb garden is ice-edged with cold, as though the magic of high summer never was.&quot;  Among the recipes given for this month are four kinds of soup, including Savory Lentil Soup and Herb Soup With Cheese.  One of my favorite recipes from the book, Oatmeal Pound Cake is also in this section and the author goes on to say that, &quot;January baking calls for something to nibble with a steaming cup of tea.  This is a rich satisfying pound cake with a crisp outside.  What I also like is the addition of rolled oats and yogurt to help fortify us against the weather.&quot;<br />This enjoys a special place with the favorite books that stay near your most comfortable chair.	2001-03-06

Tonic Herbs, Respiratory Ailments, Digestive Problems, Nervous Disorders, First Aid, Skin Problems, Aches &amp; Pains and the characteristic Problems of Women and Babies.  The individual<br />conditions within each of these categories has its own specific herbal pot. For instance, cholesterol control would be under  Tonic Herbs.  One section of the book gives the recipes for making teas, tinctures, ointments, syrups and infused oils.<br />All of this useful information is packaged in a handy concise reference that is easy to use and small enough to carry with you to the nursery.

The arrangements are for piano, guitar and recorder.  I personally had less than a year of piano, but can slowly pick out a few of these pieces.  I'm sure that someone with just a little more training would be able to play everything.<br /> My friend Jan, gave me this as a Christmas gift because I love to sing and it reminded us of a time when a group of friends spent time around the piano singing carols together. One of the nice points about this book is that in many cases up to 6 verses of the songs are given so that you can spend as much time as you like on your favorite carols without repeating the words.<br />What really makes this book exceptional are the wonderful illustrations that accompany each composition. These are of paintings that are in the National Gallery in London.  A few of the pieces are:  Christ Glorified in Heaven by Fra Angelico; The Madonna of Humility by Lippo di Dalmasio; and A Winter Scene by Isack van Ostade.  The index of the book gives the artist, and a bit of information on each of the paintings.<br />I highly recommend this book to musicians and anyone interested in art.	2001-02-27

There are many that most of us will remember but a few that I had never read before. Some of these poems are the very ones that were read to us as children:  &quot;THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT,&quot; &quot;THE DUEL,&quot; and  &quot;LITTLE ORPHANT ANNIE.&quot;  Reading these old favorites again brings back memories of my sister, Joan who always had time to read to me.<br />I also enjoyed encountering a few of the poems that my teachers made me study: &quot;THE LOST CHORD,&quot; which was turned into a hymn and often song by Enrico Caruso; the very inspiring &quot;INVICTUS,&quot; and the sad but lyrical &quot;ANNABEL LEE.&quot;  It's rather amazing how much more meaning you can take from the poems when you read them as an adult.<br />There are also very interesting short biographies of each author and these are not the versions that we learned in school.  They make the poets seem real and not quite so lofty.  Unfortunately, many people never learn to appreciate poetry, but I think that perhaps they may not have realized that the key to poetry is their own imagination.	2001-02-14

The main character, Theodosia Brown is a charming young American woman who is visiting her English relatives. At first the story has the appearance of a light romance with the young heroine being swept into English society against her will, but the author, Meredith Bean McMath takes us away from that by the many twists and turns in her plot.<br />Theodosia is very homesick for Virginia and proud of America which she speaks of with longing. She generously tries to encourage some of the poorer people that she meets that they would have a better life in America. Because of her lack of sophistication, and love of her homeland, Theodosia's relatives treat her with disdain. Her Aunt Selda has the aura of Cinderella's wicked stepmother and has no love for her niece. Although, she meets several young men, she is pushed by her Aunt into an engagement  to a man she does not care for and caught up into a web of unusual circumstances. <br />There is a very strong Christian theme throughout the story and this is enhanced by the character of Reverend Pickett who is somewhat of a fairy godfather and guides the impetuous Theodosia through many pitfalls. The kindly Reverend also councils Theodosia's young man and teaches them both how to trust in God.<br />A book that both entertains and inspires.	2001-01-16

The majority of them were given no choice in their marriages and were only pawns in making the alliances between the great powers of Europe.  Most of these women were raised knowing that they were of royal lineage and could one day have power over a king and possibly over an entire country.  A few of them achieved this goal.  Reading about their lives is rich and fascinating.<br />My favorite is Queen Eleanor who came from Aquitane, a region of SW France.   She was very accomplished and exerted great influence throughtout her entire life.  Eleanor was born in 1122 and was married to King Louis of France when she was 15 years old.  While married to King Louis, Eleanor accompanied him on the Second Crusade to the Holy Land.  They had 2 daughters, and (possibly due to the fact that there was no male heir), they later divorced.  That same year, 1152, Eleanor married Henry of Anjou who became King Henry II of England.  The bride was 12 years older then the groom and both had very strong personalties. Their reign was filled with court intrigue and scandal.  The murder of St. Thomas a Becket at Canterbury Cathedral was attribued to Henry. The monarchs had 7 children together, including the nasty King John from the Robin Hood tales and his crusading brother King Richard the Lion-Hearted.  Eleanor and Henry even argued over which of their sons would be the future heir, and this promoted civil war.  <br />Eleanor was such a strong individual that according to her moods signed her letters either: &quot;Eleanor, by the grace of God, humbly Queen of England or Eleanor, by the wrath of God, Queen of England.&quot;<br />I've always read English historical novels and these biographies have served me well over the years as a great source of reference in understanding who were the actual people behind the characters in the books I was reading.	2001-01-07

It was late one winter night and I couldn't sleep.  I turned on the television and found a story with a play type of format.  The film had been on for who knows how long, but no matter, I was intrigued by the characters very quickly.  The television guide had no listing for what I had seen.  I almost felt as if it was a story meant for me alone.  After it was over, it haunted me for quite some time, and it took some library research to find out the title and that it was written by Truman Capote. Since then, I've read this story many times, and always enjoy each and every page.<br />This is such a heart warming tale and the simplicity in which it's written is truly brilliant.  It's told through the words of a seven year old boy and relates his memories of Miss Sook Faulk, and the Christmas tradition that they shared during the Great Depression years.  The story is autobiographical, and the boy is Truman Capote.<br />Miss Faulk was Truman's elderly cousin, but she always called him &quot;Buddy.&quot;  This was in memory of another Buddy who died long ago when she was a girl. Miss Faulk remained a child herself in many ways.  The story centers around their Christmas tradition of making fruitcakes for the people that they admired and loved.<br />This book can be read to or by all ages.  The story endures because the love between the characters is so real, and the delight that they have in sharing with others is what we all want Christmas to be.	2000-12-31

MY SISTER RECENTLY REDISCOVERED THE BOOK AND TOLD ME HOW MUCH SHE ENJOYED IT.   I AGREE, THE SECOND READING IS EVEN BETTER.<br />IN 1939, HITLER INVADED POLAND AND WORLD WAR II BEGAN.   THIS IS THE STORY OF A YOUNG ENGLISH WOMAN WHO IS VISITING POLAND AND STAYING WITH A POLISH FAMILY.  SHE'S ENCOURAGED TO LEAVE BECAUSE THE NAZIS ARE INVADING, BUT GIVES UP HER OPPORTUNITY TO GO  BECAUSE SHE'S BECOME SO INVOLVED WITH HER FRIENDS AND POLAND'S STRUGGLE TO REMAIN FREE.<br />THROUGH THE STORY, SOME OF THE HISTORY OF POLAND IS REVEALED AND THE CONSTANT FIGHT THAT COUNTRY HAS HAD TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE FROM FOREIGN AGGRESSION.   SHEILA MATTHEWS, THE MAIN CHARACTER, JOINS THE POLISH UNDERGROUND AND WORKS AGAINST THE NAZIS.  THE TRAGEDY OF THE POLISH PEOPLE WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONE AND WAITING FOR HELP FROM THEIR ALLIES IS SAD, BUT VERY COURAGEOUS.  SHEILA IS ALSO INVOLVED IN A ROMANCE WITH ADAM WISNIEWSKI, A WEALTHY LANDOWNER WHO IS ALSO A RESISTANCE FIGHTER. <br />THE PACE OF THIS BOOK IS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN WE MODERN DAY READERS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO, BUT THE AUTHOR REWARDS US WITH THE METHODICAL MANNER IN WHICH THE STORY AND PLOT ARE REVEALED.  I HAD THE FEELING OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE LIVING IN WARSAW AS THE CITY IS EXPERIENCING BOMBARDMENT.  THE DAILY EXPLODING BOMBS, THE NEWS OF THE DEATH OF FRIENDS, THE LACK OF HEAT, ELECTRICITY AND WATER WERE ALL A PART OF THE RUIN OF WARSAW. FINALLY, STARVATION AND THEN THE INVADING GERMAN ARMY MARCHED INTO THE CITY.<br />THE TITLE OF THE BOOK COMES FROM THE OPENING WORDS OF THE SONG OF THE POLISH LEGIONS WHICH LATER BECAME THE NATIONAL ANTHEM OF POLAND.   THE POLISH ARE ACTUALLY SAYING THAT &quot;AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE, POLAND WILL NOT DIE.&quot;   THE SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE ENDURED!<br />THIS NOVEL WAS WRITTEN IN 1944, AND I FOUND IT INTERESTING TO LEARN THAT THE AUTHOR, HELEN MacINNES WAS THE WIFE OF A BRITISH INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.   TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF STORIES WRITTEN THAT DEAL WITH THE SUBJECT OF THE POLISH UNDERGROUND.   THIS STORY IS WELL WORTH READING AND A GOOD BOOK FOR AMERICANS WHO WANT TO READ SOMETHING ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF POLAND IN THE EARLY PART OF WORLD WAR II.	2000-12-27

If you're enthusiastic about the use of color in patchwork, than this is the book for you.  There are over 25 different patchwork designs that are pictured and displayed in gorgeous settings.  There are no shortage of color photographs and most of the designs are pictured close up and then pictured again being used in the home decor.<br />Kaffe Fassett puts a new spin on some of the traditional quilt patterns and his creations are fresh and original.  Rich velvets and brocades are turned into 4-patch curtains which are suprisingly elegant.  These same materials are used to make a luxurious throw that looks fit for a king.  His &quot;Red Diamonds Quilt&quot; is vibrant with patches of sunflowers, grapes and a multitude of floral designs.  Of course, the directions and suggestions are given for all of the projects in the book.  He even gives ideas on how the pictured designs might look in other color schemes.<br />I'm almost finished making my version of his &quot;Frothy Table Cover&quot; which is made of cotton in a combination of floral pastels cut into triangles.  This particular design is photographed in a garden with the table set with china filled with fruit, flowers and confections. A feast for the eyes!<br />The patterns in this book are really another dimension in creating patchwork possibilities. This is a beautiful book!	2000-11-03

Starting with the haunting faces of the young women who are pictured on the cover, to the many illustrations through out, we learn of the thoughts and activities that occupied the daily lives of the women of the Confederacy. This book is filled with wonderful diary excerpts, parts of letters and interesting photographs.  Through these means we are given an insightful look at the way Southern women lived during the most tragic of times, our American Civil War.    I've read a great deal about this particular era, but learned so much from this book. For instance, I had no idea that many men wanted their wives to accompany them off to war.  Some of these women did just that and lamented about leaving their children behind with relatives. One young woman said that her husband was \\"ordering me to Mississippi\\" in the summer of 1862, and how brokenhearted she was because she feared that her baby would forget her while she was away.    Another interesting fact was that numerous ladies wrote personal letters to President Jefferson Davis and requested that their husbands or sons be sent home because they were needed by their families.  Other ladies wrote directly to their husbands and clearly told them they had given enough effort to the war, and it was time to come home.     Some of the other information that is discussed is how women were often forced to move in with relatives and how their days were filled with unfamiliar work.  They also were required, with very little experience, to manage their slave labor and operate plantations or farms. Some women seemed to enjoy the challenge, and for others the burden was too much.    The blockade of goods going to the South was another problem to deal with because so many of the items of necessity were manufactured in the North. One of the reasons that the hoop skirt went out of fashion was because a vast amount of material was needed to cover a hoop. Cloth was so scarse that the ladies were making it themselves, and there was little to spare for elaborate clothing. Even the hoops were no longer obtainable after they wore out.  Working hard and making do became the way to survive and these women became the mothers of invention.    Drew Gilpin Faust has done an enormous amount of research in compiling all of this information and I believe that it was a labor of love and she is to be commended.  I will admit that at times I thought her writing style was a little stiff, and I  sometimes resented the conclusions that she made.  I thought that the material spoke for itself and needed very little  explanation. These are minor criticisms because she has put together a unique and wonderful book.    I believe this book will stand the test of time, and be read for many years to come.I chose it to be read by my book group and it generated a lively discussion and we all felt we benefited by reading it.	2000-10-25

He starts us off with some lovely prose and then introduces us to this collection by saying &quot;A Fairy-tale is knocking.&quot;<br />This is a very interesting assemblage of legends.  Each of the little stories touches on some part of the history of Poland. Every story is complemented by a wood engraving made by J.  Sekalski. The engravings give the book a charming Old World feeling.  When I visited Poland several of these legends were mentioned in the brochures describing various landmark sites.  This book offered me the opportunity to read the entire story in English<br />With the legends, the reader will learn:<br />1)  Why the capital of ancient Poland was called Gniezno and        the reason the eagle is the symbol;<br />2)  About the downfall of wretched King Popiel;<br />3)  How the city of Krakow was named and the evil dragon         destroyed;<br />4)  Why Queen Wanda threw herself in the Vistula River;<br />5)  How the Piasts dynasty was started;<br />6)  The story of Mieszko and how Poland became a Catholic        country;<br />7)  The legend of St. Adalbert;<br />8)  The details of Emperor Otto's visit to Gniezno;<br />9)  Why King Boleslaw and his Knights are just sleeping;<br />10) The story of two brothers who disobeyed the King;<br />11) and my personal favorite, the tale of the Trumpeter of       Krakow and how, to this very day, he continues to inspire       the people of Poland.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good and unusual story, and to all visitors to Poland. If you do have the opportunity to  tour the city of Krakow, take a little walk on the wild side, and climb the tower of the Church of the Virgin Mary and stand at the very place where centuries ago, the Trumpeter played the famous hejnal. Yes, it's a long walk to the top, but well worth the effort.	2000-10-16

The various travelers on Noah's Ark each have a distinct prayer to God. The simplicity of these prayers ring with truth as they tell of the work and difficulties that the animals endure. The author must have had great insight to write such simple, but beautiful verse.	2000-10-09

It combines the useful information about plants with ancient lore.  The author advises which foods are best enhanced with various herbs and you will also find recipes for teas, breads and jellies.<br />The first section of the book covers the months of the year.   Information is given on how to plan, plant and harvest your garden.  Each corresponding month is full of suggestions for the use of herbs.  For instance, Linda's Moth Mixture is advisable  for protecting your woolens and the reader can also learn how to make a potpourri, wreath or herb pillow.<br />The second section of the book is a compendium of favorite herbs and gives wonderfully explained descriptions of over 35 herbs. You'll learn the history of the plants, the soil requirements, and rhymes and bits of poetry that are centuries old.<br />The writing style of Linda Ours Rago is really the secret ingredient of DOORYARD HERBS.  You almost feel as if you are  sitting in her garden while she is telling you about all of the different plants. In speaking of thyme she says, &quot;In fact the fairies are said to lay their sleeping babies in the tiny cradle shaped thyme blossoms.&quot; Her reference to marigolds is also quite lovely, &quot;Enjoy the noble marigolds, and give them an open corner of the garden where they can worship the sun in their time honored way.&quot;<br />This is the one herb book that I consult all year long!	2000-10-08

This story is another achievement for the author.  She continues to keep the saga fresh and interesting in her 4th Harry Potter book.  Harry and his  friends seem like real children and the active mind of the writer always  has something new and exciting waiting ahead for them in the wizard world.  Yes, this is a big book, but what a wonderful accomplishment for a child to  have tackled and completed the story. Parents and teachers should be  thrilled  because once the world of books is opened to the mind, the  interest in reading will continue.  Bravo, to J. K. Rowling for making our  children want to read.	2000-09-05

My interest was enhanced by my amazement  in finding the names of 3 men who shared my family name and who had died at  Auschwitz.  They were Polish freedom fighters.<br />This book explains the  controversy surrounding a convent of Carmelite nuns who went to Auschwitz  to pray for the people who had died there.  The seemingly innocent idea  became an international news story with Christian and Jewish groups at odds  as to whether the nuns should be allowed to stay.  All concerned had  heartfelt and valid reasons that formed their opinions and the history of  Poland and Auschwitz were at the center of the conflict.<br />Auschwitz was  first opened in June 1940 and for the first 21 months only Poles were  housed there.  They were mostly the intelligentsia and 270,000 of them were  killed at the site. Later, it became a death camp for the Jews, and  Birkenau, which was nearby, was built for the elimination of the Jews taken  there.  The Jews of Europe felt that they had been the group who had  suffered the most at the hands of the Nazis; however, the Polish people  felt that they had also been pin pointed for extermination.  Actually, more  Jews were killed in the death camps of Germany, but most of those camps  were destroyed before the end of the War II.  Since Auschwitz is intact, it  has become the symbol of Jewish martydom for Jews of the world.<br />As an  American, I grew up seeing films of the holocaust and have always been  aware of the terrible sufferings of the millions of European Jews who were  killed.  I really had no idea that Poland and her people were also chosen  to be eliminated.<br />In 1939, The Boundary and Friendship Treaty was signed  between Stalin and Hitler.  The Treaty had provisions for the extermination  of the Polish people who opposed and fought against either Russia or  Germany.  Early in 1940, 45% of the officers of the Polish Army were shot  and any Pole with a secondary education was considered a danger within  occupied Poland.  Killing the leaders and anyone with an education was the  rule for the subjugation of the Polish people.  The penalty for trying to  save a Jew was death for yourself and sometimes for your entire family.   <br />Since both the people of Poland and the Jews of Europe suffered within  the confines of Auschwitz, all concerned consider Auschwitz their history.   <br />This is an excellent book.	2000-08-14
US	51731994	RSPBWJ2VCG11G	0618004165	366885060	Henrietta	Books	5	6	7	N	Y	Intelligent Pig Perseveres	Henrietta is an endearing story of a young pig who wants an education very badly.  She specifically wants to study law at a good institution. In her pursuit of learning, she attempts to use libraries and tries to attend  lectures, but is often thrown out of those places of discovery because,  after all, she is just a pig. This is a new look at prejudice!    This story  is presented as a story for children and I really liked the fact that the  vocabulary chosen by David Mamet is not the usual fare. Some of the words  will need an explanation which adds another dimension to the book.     The  little fable is greatly enhanced by the illustrations of Elizabeth Dahlie  who makes Henrietta real and shows how she looks in good times and in bad.  One drawing in particular made me laugh out loud and the image has remained  in my mind. The book has general appeal and could even be a \\"coffee  table\\" book.	2000-06-04

I approached this book with the idea that I would not like it and was only reading it because my book club had chosen to read it.  There are so many stories written about the human condition, but I have to admit I had read few others that had the effect that this one had on me.  The author presented the story by simply giving the facts of what life was like for that group of individuals and the few choices that were presented to  them as a race. I felt genuine sorrow for all those who suffered the same type of hopelessness and despair.  This book truly gave me an insight that I had never experienced before.	1999-10-15
