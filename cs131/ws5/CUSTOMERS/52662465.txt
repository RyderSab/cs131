Somerset Maugham weaves an intriguing tale of love and betrayal in his critically acclaimed &quot;Of Human Bondage.&quot;  Maugham uses the tale of Phillip, an innocent, sensitive crippled man in Victorian era Europe as a front for his own autobiography.  Maugham's brilliant prose and insights into the human psyche make this book a true classic.    Phillip Carey was left an orphan at a young age and was continually taunted for his club-foot and the limp that resulted.  His early rejection from society gives him time to seek out his purpose in life, and we follow him as he travels across Europe.   Maugham gives beautiful descriptions of England, France, and Germany along the way.    Phillip's troubles begin when he meets a cold, stand-offish waitress named Mildred.  Phillip is consumned with a burning passion for this girl, and gave everything he had to make her his.  Though he was constantly rejected, humilitated and used by Mildred, he continued to return to her.      This book is truly great for the indepth examination of love and the human animal.  Any lover of psychology will find this novel to be a facinating read, as would anyone who can appreciate a good book.	1998-05-19

The story entitled &quot;LOOSSING THE US,&quot;  I especially liked because it dealt with getting over the pain of loosing a loved one.  This book is not only for teenagers. It contains many life long lessons that benefit everybody. Eor example, &quot;A LONG WALK HOME,&quot; deals with the issue of lieing and guilt. My mother also read this book and enjoyed it very much. Chicken Soup for the Teenage soul is a great book. So if your in need of some inspiration, some advice, or just a simple smile, I strongly recomend that you read this book.

Anybody who has any interest in music owes it to themselves to read this book.  In this definitive guide to musical enjoyment, Aaron Copeland takes a look at how to listen to music intelligently.  Two questions are addressed in this interesting, in-depth study:  Are you hearing everything that is going on?  Are you really being sensitive to it?<br />    It doesn't matter what kind of music you enjoy, everyone can get something out of this book.  Though relating more closely to classical music, Aaron Copeland's ideas for listening to music will give the reader a better appreciation and understanding of whatever music they listen to.<br />    From reading this book you will gain insight into the creative process of a composer.  In laymen's terms, the book describes the way composers write music as well as how they actually listen to it.  It explains that there are three separate planes upon which music is listened to.  They are the sensuous plane, the expressive plane, and the sheerly musical plane.  Copeland goes on to tell how music is heard on each plane and explains how each works, which I found very interesting.<br />    Overall, Aaron Copeland's What To Listen For In Music is a good book that I recommend to anyone who has an interest in music or enjoys listening to it.  A whole new level of listening ability can be gained from reading this book.  It explains music from the composer's point of view, giving you insight into how music is composed, and how to listen to it, which gives you a deeper appreciation of music.	1998-05-18

Blending his patented wry humor with acute social insight presented in an absurd fantasy world, Vonnegut has written an exceptional novel of love, lies, and the self destruction of mankind.   The story centers around the narrator, Jonah, who is called by name once in the entire book. We are told in the beginning that he is writing a book on the events of the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan. His research leads him to a correspondence with Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of Doctor Felix Hoenikker, father of the atomic bomb. After meeting with Newt, destiny leads our protagonist to the impoverished island  republic of San Lorenzo, where among other adventures, he finds religion, falls in love, and becomes president.   All of this by itself would make for a very entertaining book, but it is not in the story line that Vonnegut's genius lies. Cat's Cradle is rife with painfully accurate insights into the institutions that our society holds so dear, such as, religion, politics, and science. Vonnegut invents for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo a brand new religion based completely and admittedly on &quot;foma&quot;, or lies. This wouldn't be so shocking, except for the fact that this &quot;bokonism&quot; seems to make perfect sense. Other Vonnegut ironies pervade the book and are too elaborate to go into.   Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite author of all time. Cat's Cradle is one of his funniest, most absurd, and frightening novels. This book truly causes one to stop and think about the things that one holds as unquestionably true. All of the incredible people, places, things, and ideas in Cat's Cradle are intricately woven into a perfect tapestry that sums up and spells out many of mankind's self-created problems in 191 pages.	1998-05-18

The manner in which the novel was written caught my attention just from the start.  Twain combined his distinctive dry humor with some of his exaggerations creating the Mark Twain style.  The Adventures of Huck Finn was a sequal of The adventures of Tom Sawyer.  Upon reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer I decided to read The Adventures of Huck Finn.  The novel starts off telling us about the end of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.  In conclusion Tom and Huck find a treasure so Huck is put a home living with Widow Douglas.  Here Huck is'nt so happy.  She is trying to teach him all of the proper ways.  Soon after his drunken father finds out he has a treasure and beats him almost to death so Huck will give it to him.  Huck runs away to an island where he meets a runaway slave, Jim.  He and Jim become friends and decide to run away to the free states up north.  They find a raft so they can travel by river.  Hoping not to be seen, Huck and Jim travel by night.  A little while later they encounter a ferryboat which recognizes that they are runaways.  After selling Jim to be a slave again, Tom and Huck decide they must free him.  In the conclusion of the book,  Jim is freed because his prevoius owner had freed him just before she died.  The Adventures of Huck Finn was an excellent novel.  This work along with The Adventures of Tom Sawyer forever placed Mark Twain amongst the ranks  of the greatest writers on earth let alone the United States.  The Adventures of Huck Finn, often mistaken as a children's book, has since its creation instigated widespread timult.  It and Tom Sawyer were banned in various places around the world for their &quot;questionable&quot; racist content.  Nontheless, these novels made powerful statements about the anti-bellum South, in a manner that only Mark Twain could convey.	1998-05-18

Via cunning scandals, stories of love, and bold acts of vengeance, the Pillars of the Earth captures the most rambunctious sides of the Middle Ages. Reading it, one could easily come to feel intense emotion spurred by some of the characters in it. Despite the impressive size of the book, it keeps the reader wanting more of the tales woven into one massive master plot.     Even though the beginning of the book leads one to believe it is about a man named Tom Builder, it soon turns into a lengthy series of plot developments and twists. The one thing that remains throughout the entire story is the desire to construct a magnificent cathedral that Tom had begun to build near the beginning of the book. Every character ends up having something to do with the great structure, making it a very symbolic element in the novel. Also, that means that the seventy-five years of plot covered includes a great deal of character-building (a fair trade-off). Don't fret, though. Everything seems to work together perfectly in spite of all the happenings that occur in the book.      All in all, a satisfaction of having read a terrific book is what happens after the final page. The ending is conclusive, the plot is tremendously developed, and the characters are (sometimes unfortunately!) very believable. This novel is most certainly one of the most thought-provoking and unique ones that I have read. I guarantee that anyone who reads the Pillars of the Earth will at least respect its thoroughness.	1998-05-18

John Stienbeck's OF MICE AND MEN is a powerful book about the things we do for people for love. It is a simple book, done in Stienbeck's laid back, visual style. However, underneath the simple story is a powerful fable of guilt, hope, and love. The story is about two men, George and Lennie, drifting laborers of the American West, searching for work in the the hard times of the Great Depression. George is a small, intelligent, tough, suspicious man, Lennie is a tall, strong, man, a good worker, but with the mind of a child. Together, they form a team, George with his brain and Lennie with his strength. The story follows George and Lennie as they get work at a farm in Northern California, meet the other workers, some of which they become friends with. Gradually, as the book moves along, we begin to sense how the relationship of George and Lennie works. We see the protectiveness of George for Lennie, the pride he feels for Lennie's accomplishments. George needs Lennie just as much as Lennie needs George. So, when Lennie gets into trouble, through no fault of his own, jeopardizing George's future at the farm, we recognize the pain and frustration George feels, as well as the tight position it puts him into. The shattering ending, not only teaches us a lot about the things we do for the people we love, it also shows how Stienbeck has brought us close to these characters, making us care about what happens to them. In it's plot, OF MICE AND MEN is a simple, childish almost. But it evokes feeling and conversation that are far from simple and are felt by anyone who has ever loved. I highly recommend OF MICE AND MEN, a simple book with a powerful message.	1998-05-18

Before you pick up this book, go read James O'Barrs original comic book series. If you like that, then watch the movie. If you enjoy both, pick up a collection of Edgar Allen Poe, or at least read &quot; The Raven&quot;. If you survived all of that then pick up this book.       Now you are ready. This story is a story of love and revenge. It is about a man doing something he knows is wrong but does it not for good or evil, but to bring peace to his soul. In it, David Bischoff parallels the lives of the characters to the life of Poe and his writings. His unique method of foreshadowing through use of quotations instills the excitement of knowing what will happen next, but to what extent?  This in combination with the characters depth makes the book very fun to read.         Finally, for all of you who were discouraged or confused by the movies( or just fans looking for a change), this book starts at the beggining of the story and works all the way through. (P.S. For a more bizzarre style, but still a good story, check out Poppy Z. Brite's &quot;The Lazarus Heart&quot;.)	1998-05-18

The beginning of the book includes an exciting hostage situation that brings about changes for the main character.  This sets up the book but becomes the most exciting scene in the story because of the relatively dull plot. *Grisham never was able to develop the plot's quality equal to that of the characters.  Grisham continued throughout the story to develop characters that were real and entertaining.  The characters were interesting and not shallow.  Each one had their distinct personality that was consistent throughout the novel.  Michael Brock, the main character, was particularly entertaining because of his slightly sarcastic sense of humor and the way that he dealt with the situations brought to him by the plot.  The characters were one of the better points of the book. *It seemed as though Grisham was already thinking about making the book into a movie when he was thinking of a few of the characters; for example, Mordecai Green seems to be a natural James Earl Jones.  He is a large and respected man who can get attention by the sound of his voice.  His appearance and personality are key to the book. *The setting also contributed to the positive expectations that Grisham failed to meet because of the plot.  Grisham chose the setting as an excellent backdrop for a good David and Goliath tale.  Michael Brock, the main character, has a revelation and decides to quit his job at one of the biggest national firms in Washington D.C.; the novel's setting.  He begins to work for the homeless in the nation's capital where it is a major problem and a hot issue.  He takes on his former employer, who represents the other scale of the social class system, in a city where politics and publicity are key and do come into play. *The developed characters, Grisham's entertaining voice and style of writing, and the perfect setting of the book helped make a book that appeals ! to the reader, somewhat, in entertainment value, but more to the reader's emotions toward the homeless.  The Street Lawyer is a great book to motivate one to start in homeless volunteering.  The book showed a little bit about what goes on in the minds of the homeless and how to help them.  It shows how the homeless have no real bounds of where they stay.  They just pick up their few belongings and leave.  The book shows where the homeless tend to live.  Grisham had his homeless characters sleeping in cars, volunteer and government projects, or anywhere to shield them from most of the elements.  The book is more effective as motivation for volunteering than of an entertaining story.	1998-05-18

Buffett's variety of short stories range from a cowboy from Wyoming seeking the good life to an Alabama high school football teams rise to the top.  Every story in the book whether a true story or fiction seemed to capture my interest quickly with illustrious storytelling. Optimistic tales of the tropics along with humor, romance, and adventure reflect the style that Buffett is best known for. One of the better stories in the book and also the longest is called &quot;Take Another Road&quot;. It follows the story of a Wyoming cowboy named Tully Mars, who decides to pursue his dream of a life in the tropics. He gathers his things, grabs his horse and hops in his truck as his travels across the country begin. Tully keeps a journal that you read from city to city along with the narrative and dialogue. Buffett shows the transformation of Tully Mars well as he makes his way to the Caribbean. A few of the other more interesting stories in the book are &quot;Boomerang Love&quot;, &quot;AreYou Ready for Freddy&quot;, and &quot;Hooked In the Heart&quot; one of the non-fiction stories in the novel. All of which have the same enjoyable read. You do not have to be a Jimmy Buffett fan to enjoy this smooth reading collection of stories.

At times the novel had high points with me on the end of my chair, and others I found myself dozing off.  All in all it was okay.  I love her other story &quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot;, and I enjoyed that novel completely.  My enjoyment in that book lead to my interest in reading some of her other work, unfortunately to find out it was not as good. The story had a big deal with teenagers and their lives, which added to my interest in this novel.  The story just wasn't that good.  Not so much for a specific reason. It just did not grab my attention like many mystery novels can, and have done so in the past.   A young girl was forced to move right before her senior year having to leave her friends, boyfriend, and daily activities.  The move was part of a relocation program in which she had to leave everything behind and even change her name and everything about her. The drastic life change was because the girl's father was involved in a drug case, and so many people wanted him dead.  She never wanted to leave her regular life, so she tries to find ways to get it back.  This story is more for a middle school childs interest, but everyone is different with many different interests. This story was okay.	1998-05-18

So many books have fairy tale endings these days, and while a fairy tale is fun to read, it is also good to read about real life.  For those of you searching for reality, you will definately find it in My Antonia.  It is a book with a heart; a heart that aches, and wants, and hopes, just like any other heart.  This is a book without sappiness, but not without sweetness.<br />My Antonia defies the outline of most novels in that its two main characters are a man and a woman who do not fall in love.  It's so refreshing to hear truth in a time when everything has a sugarcoating.  This book shows that it is ok to write about life and heartache.  Yet while giving us a look at hard life, Willa Cather still manages to portray the benefits of hard work and strong love.<br />When I finished this book, I realized how many lessons I had learned about life.  For instance, life may be difficult, but it's the good times that make us stronger.  I realized also that, because the pace of the book is not fast or furious, it allows the reader to sit back and reflect on what the author is trying to express.  I believe that Cather did an excellant job of portraying the meaning of this story.  She has shown that a pure heart may often be broken, but it will always find a way to be content.	1998-05-17

What I found was a moving piece of literature.  This book made me think I was in the trenchs with Kat and the boys.<br />What makes this book so good is you live the times through a young man.  While you get to know him personally you see what times where like.  It really tells you why it was called the &quot;Lost Generation&quot;.  This book does have a strong message but never feels like propaganda.<br />The best thing about the book is it makes as much sense now as it did 70 years ago.  Its message about war is something we should all learn.  I hope you read the book.	1998-05-17

Clear and Present Danger by Tom Clancy is an exciting book that you can tell was very well researched.  The feelings of treachery, death, grief, fear, and many others are well portrayed, as U.S. soldiers are sent deep into the heart of enemy territory, and then abandoned.  Though the plot is complex, it is easy to tell what is going on, because of the intricate descriptions of characters, the tools they use, and the environment in which they operate.  This book is excellent, and I recommend it to anyone who likes fast-paced action.	1998-05-17

Ken Follett's writing talent really overdoes itself in Lie Down With Lions.  He somehow adds the violence of a war, the heat between two nemesis' and a woman, romance, and even a little bit to laugh at, into one book.  Lie Down With Lions is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. Based mainly on Ellis Thaler, the American, Jean-Pierre, the frenchman, and Jane Lambert, the beautiful English woman whom they have both fallen for, Lie Down With Lions takes you from the terrorism and lies of Paris, to the violent war in Afghanistan.  Ellis lies to Jane about what he does for a living, and she ends up marrying Jean-Pierre and leaving with him to Afghanistan.   But after some intriguing words from his ex-wife,  Ellis is determined to get her back. Lie Down With Lions is romantic adventure and twisting suspense at their best, and I highly recommend it to anyone.  This book guarantees to keep you on the edge of your seat, and if not, its because it made you fall off.	1998-05-17

The mysterious Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley, seems to be the focus of the story early on, but later, a new topic shows the point. *The ideal father, Atticus, seems to be the only man in Maycomb County willing to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman.  This is very important because the story takes place in the deep South during the Depression. The trial helps the kids (especially Jem) realize that even the town they've lived in all their life, is not as it seems. *My favorite quotes come from Sheriff Heck Tate and Scout, the two quotes are unrelated, and won't make sense until the whole story has been read.  Tate says, &quot;...there's just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy to 'em.  Even then they ain't worth the bullet it takes to shoot 'em.&quot;  Scout says, &quot;Mr. Tate was right...it'd be sort of like shootin' a mockingbird, wouldn't it?&quot;  The quotes alone are enough to read the book, and I know that once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down; I know I couldn't.	1998-05-16

Ward and Jane Cooper Hong is the first fantasy adventure book I've ever read.  We've all seen the fantasy movies like &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal,&quot; but I've never actually read books like this.  I was very surprised at the way Ward's and Hong's words painted vivid pictures in my mind.  This is what I liked most about the book.  It wasn't drawn out and boring like many other descriptive books, but full of action.  Their words were fast paced so the action &quot;scenes&quot; were fluid in my mind.  Most of the action takes place in battles in which a band of three warriors, Shal, Ren, and Tarl, fight their way to Tyranthraxus.  The book takes place in another world; a world that you and me does not exist.  But Ward and Hong bring this other world to life through the median of thier own use of the descriptive style of writing.  Whether it's a forest, a town, a tavern brawl, or a castle dungeon, the journey comes alive and one will experience it with all five senses.	1998-05-15

Every time you began to think you know what is going to happen there is another horrific murder that eliminates your main suspect.  The characters personalities and traits were all spectacular but, my favorite character was Professor Liam O1Connor.//  Having this Irish born Professor be so deeply superstitious was a noticeable trait from the beginning.  Every time he forgot a superstition he would react as if someone had got him.   You began to notice this behavior after, and just before, he marries his new love Sarah;  Liam has an incident.   A long purple tongue stretches from his mouth and his normally brown eyes turn blue.//  This is the first sign that leads you in the correct direction.  A direct  path to the Professor that is also a monster.  He must kill every so often to maintain being human most of the time.  If he is not happy or if he does not observe every superstition he will remain the monster permanently.//  The idealism, originality, and unique characteristics of this plot were astonishing.  I loved and pizzazz of the fire inside each character ( Sarah1s unique ability to always pick the wrong guy).  The plot was exciting and horrifying all at the same time.  I wish I could have jumped into the story and been one of the police officers investigating the murders!	1998-05-15

Brite, was in the spirit of other books she had written.  This book was based on the the dark comic, The Crow, by James O'Barr.  The Lazareths Heart is a bit difficult to follow, because the chapters alternate between differant characters.  As the book progresses, the stories tie together.  Poppy throws in a few clues and things to think about along the way.  This book was about revenge, lust and a deep love that not even death can take away.  It shows that the pain from a love taken away from you is strong enough to take over everything.  This book was very well written.  I dont reccomend it for younger readers as it touches on the subjects of homosexual relationships, transgender and necrophilia.  I strongly reccomend it for mature readers though.  I wasnt able to put it down.	1998-05-15

This dark and thoughtful tale is pulsing with moral uncertainties and will leave you thinking long and hard about the death penalty. A thrill ride from start to finish, it is impossible to put down.

His amazing insight into the human spirit will leave tears in your eyes.  The Chamber draws you in and sweeps you up in a whirl-wind of emotion. It will linger on your mind long after you've flipped the last page. The basic principles debated in this heart-wrenching story will spark intellectual conversation and permeate every reader to the core.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is unsure how they feel about legal execution, and even to those who think they have their mind made up. This book exceedes expectations and goes far beyond entertainment. It is definitly one of Grisham's best!	1998-05-15
