For many, maybe most, modern life just is. There is little understanding or even interest in the forces that shape, or more perniciously control, lives. That ignorance in no way disestablishes corporations as the most powerful, self-serving entities of the modern era. However, this book is not particularly concerned with all of the ramifications of their immense power to influence and control society.<br /><br />The book primarily examines the profound change in the legal standing of corporations that occurred in the last half of the nineteenth century and into the first decades of the twentieth. Though not heavily argued, the author contends that Americans in the colonial period were very leery of corporations. After the founding, corporations came into existence only via state charters that specifically detailed and limited a corporation's activities with the real possibility of charter revocation acting as an effective incentive for compliance. But business interests began to battle those limitations, especially on the legal front.<br /><br />The Santa Clara County case decided by the Supreme Court in 1886 was the case on which the subsequent legal empowerment of corporations was based. Though not specifically stated in the opinion, it is commonly held that after that decision, corporations would be viewed as \\"persons,\\" the subject of the fourteenth Amendment, whereby all persons are entitled to due process and the equal protection of laws. Even the great John Marshall in 1819 had asserted that corporations are an \\"artificial being ... existing only in the contemplation of law.\\" Now the artificial nature of corporations was being disregarded, clearing the way for consideration as the equal of any citizen with all of the same rights. The fact that corporate resources overwhelm those of any one person appears to not have been considered.<br /><br />In the laissez-faire, Social Darwinist atmosphere of the early twentieth century individuals were left to compete with their corporate \\"equals.\\" Time and again legislation that sought to ameliorate dreadful workplace conditions was struck down as interfering with liberty of contract, ignoring the one-sidedness of employer-employee exchange.<br /><br />The same thinking is seen in decisions regarding participation in the political process. The author shows how the courts have subtly distorted the meaning of the First Amendment as protecting corporate \\"speech.\\" In actuality, the amendment protects speakers - real people, not entities. The real speech of corporate stakeholders, such as customers, has routinely been suppressed. For example, a quarterly consumer's section in an energy utility's newsletter was disallowed, despite the utility's monopoly of the region.<br /><br />The author shows that legal decisions regarding corporate personhood have since Santa Clara been very inconsistent and even contradictory. One would have thought that the author would have weighed in on the \\"strict construction\\" arguments that have been the  rage over the last few decades. The reading of corporations as persons by the courts is a definite distortion of original intent. Moreover, the original intent of constructing a nation of self-governing citizens has been seriously eroded by allowing monolithic entities to dominate arenas where citizens participate, like elections.<br /><br />The author notes that several movements at the turn of the nineteenth century attempted to counter corporate power, namely the Populists, the Knights of Labor, the IWW, and the socialists. Virtually all of them ran into the power of the state and reactionary forces that contained and eliminated the movements. Some of this material is rather sketchy.<br /><br />In recent years corporations have gained tremendous advantages by being able to relocate internationally facilitated by any number of trade agreements. Through the WTO and other bodies, corporations are able to force nations to rescind legislation that they see as impacting their profitability. The modern anti-corporate movement often takes the form of anti-globalization, perhaps best seen in the Seattle demonstrations against the WTO. In addition, the author hopes for cooperatives or economic democracy as alternatives to corporate power. Such efforts have had little impact.<br /><br />Any number of authors have addressed the dominance of corporations, such as Bakan, Greider, Hartmann, Korten, Schweickart, etc. This book is less comprehensive than those by the authors mentioned. It is a reasonable and readable overview of the legal shenanigans and rationalizations that have occurred concerning the rightful place of corporations in our society over the last 125 years. In an era where conservative movements have gained ascendancy, it is doubtful that any of this literature has a wide audience.that they see as impacting their profitability.

Though FBI agent Rachel Walling supposedly shot the serial killer of policeman several years before, most realized that he had staged his own death and was at large (Connelly's The Poet). Now years later a GPS device has been mailed to FBI headquarters addressed to Walling with the Poet's fingerprints on it. The set of coordinates stored on the device reveal a grisly desert scene of long buried bodies, which coincides with the timeframe of the mysterious disappearance of several men visiting Las Vegas over the last few years. Why has the Poet now contacted Walling?<br /><br />Longtime Connelly protagonist, Harry Bosch, now ex LA homicide detective, is asked by the widow of Terry McCaleb, former FBI profiler, to look into Terry's sudden death while conducting a charter fishing expedition. Bosch in his usual mode of leaving no stone unturned finds photos of a mystery customer on McCaleb's boat and other evidence that leads him to the desert outside of Las Vegas. Harry now meets Rachel and the FBI.<br /><br />The disillusioned Bosch circumvents the FBI and takes the lead on this case; Walling banished to the hinterlands of the Dakotas by FBI higher-ups for alleged indiscretions is allowed to monitor Harry, while being mostly bait for the Poet. The Poet makes the smallest of mistakes to lead to a resounding conclusion involving the rainstorm run-off system in LA known as the narrows.<br /><br />What would a Bosch book be without Harry's halting interpersonal relations. Harry finds it best to visit his daughter Maddie when Eleanor, his ex-wife, is out gambling in the Las Vegas casinos. Harry sees Walling as a kindred spirit, but does the job get in the way of a relationship.<br /><br />The Narrows is a typical Connelly book. There is substantial time devoted to police procedure. The plot is complexly drawn and executed. But it is the look, feel, and characterizations of the police world that make his books so compelling. And there is a special ending turn.ending turn. <br />	2005-10-04

Eric Lavender, a mid-forties bachelor from New York, is in LA attending to the death of his father, when Colleen Golden, a divorce attorney from Scarsdale, NY, who just happens to be staying at the same upscale hotel as Eric, begins a subtle but very successful pursuit of him. Eric allows her vague claims of victim hood to temper his questions about her past, especially in light of her exquisite appearance.<br /><br />Eric marries Colleen and her daughter Zoe after an \\"accidental\\" baby is on the way, but she continues to be for Eric \\"unknowable.\\" He does know that she has co-authored a successful book on divorce and has a successful practice. But Colleen makes a series of mistakes. First, she unknowingly becomes the divorce lawyer for the wife of one of Eric's patients in which exaggerated claims are made. Then, despite the conflict of interest, she belligerently refuses to step aside in the case. Earlier doubts about Colleen are now resurfaced with Eric.<br /><br />Eric, from a Scarsdale jail cell, put there by a false accusation by Colleen, looks back on all of the little deceptions that have made his life with Colleen mostly a lie and put him in serious jeopardy. This aspect of the book is very interesting and suspenseful, watching Eric continually ignore his encounters with Colleen's trickery.<br /><br />\\"Deceit\\" flows better than \\"Almost,\\" Benedict's previous novel, (there is a discernible plot) but is similar in that it is an exploration of our ability to understand relationships. \\"Deceit\\" does lose a little steam towards the end as the deceit is played out. The book is entertaining and thought provoking.	2005-09-27

Only four days after that murder, there was a daring theft from a movie set of the same production company of two million in real cash, where Harry, there to investigate the earlier crime, actually shot one of the perpetrators and watched as he was dragged into the getaway van. Harry has always known that the two events are related. Like he says, there are no coincidences. Now he is determined to get to the bottom of the case.<br /><br />Harry, no longer a LAPD detective (see City of Bones), has no badge to squeeze information from people. Furthermore, he has inadvertently tripped over a Homeland Security matter by pursuing the cold case and is handled overly brusquely by any standards. But Harry relies on his old network of cops and friends, even ex-wife and ex-FBI agent Eleanor Wish, to gain enough leverage on the Homeland Security guys to operate.<br /><br />Harry as ex-cop does not work as well as Harry the cop. One of the elements of Harry the cop was his conflicts with the police establishment. Now that edge to his character has been taken away. The story takes quite a while to get moving and in the end revolves around information that should have been obtainable years before. In addition, the bad cop angle was blatantly obvious from page 1. Harry's tentative reconnection with Eleanor after several years seems overly awkward in light of certain realities revealed.<br /><br />Of course, the appeal of the Bosch series is not the action, it is the interaction: the dialog, the feel, and the descriptions. The life of a cop now totally disabled and dependent is portrayed only too well. But between Bosch as ex-cop and a pretty simple story, the book is not one of the better books of the Bosch series.	2005-09-24

There are wonderful, succinct descriptions, observations, insights, etc scattered about. Most of these come from the perspective of Sophy Chase, a moderately successful novelist (autobiographical?) , but more importantly \\"almost\\" divorced from Will, her husband of ten years.<br /><br />Sophy is in the midst of a new, highly sensual,  relationship with a New York art dealer Daniel that is causing her some concern, when a phone call at an inopportune time informs that Will has died unexpectedly. Her anxiety level is turned up considerably as she is forced to reengage with the world she has just left. She returns to the Northeast island, Swansea. There she agonizes over her involvement in the death. Was it a suicide? What happened to Henry, her dog given as a substitute for children?  And there is the added burden of mingling with the society types of the island and their attitudes and problems.<br /><br />If Sophy is any indication, life for this author is awkward and somewhat unknowable. The story moves in fits and starts as Sophy interacts with ex-lovers, step-children, Will's first wife, and the mysterious Crystal who had dealings with Will shortly before his death and has to deal with her attraction to alcohol.<br /><br />It is all rather inconclusive. Sophy hardly comes to any great understanding. Her connection to Daniel's adopted Vietnamese daughter Vicki seems to be about the best that she can expect. Ironically, author Benedict, has author Sophy preparing to write a novel about Benedict's story. Got that?	2005-09-22

Sam Walton found that underpricing the other guy worked, but his stores fifty years ago were rag-tag affairs. He and his associates finally realized a need for sound organization. He used K-mart, Target, and others as examples, and then surpassed them. Wal-mart developed an immense computer system to track sales, inventory, product location, etc. It carries an immense variety of products, which can be resupplied quickly with its efficient distribution system. It has become the largest corporation in the world in terms of sales and employment.<br /><br />But size is hardly the only reason for the characterization: \\"The US of Wal-Mart.\\" Wal-mart is also a part of a new business paradigm that is a shift away from the one established by major corps after WWII. Then, vast numbers of workers, both blue- and white-collar, often as members of unions, joined the middle-class with good wages and benefits. By the time of Reagan, that era of good will was over, as amply demonstrated with the busting of the PATCO union. Wal-mart, which arose out of the poor, rural South, where unions have never been tolerated, has thrived in and even helps drive the new business environment.<br /><br />Wal-mart has become so big and influential that its manner of conducting business cannot be ignored. It pays near poverty-level wages with few benefits. US taxpayers end up having to subsidize Wal-mart workers, from EITC, food stamps, emergency medical care, etc. Wal-mart forces the same conditions on suppliers often resulting in outsourcing and loss of jobs. It is a habitual violator of US labor laws ranging from anti-unionization, failure to pay for hours worked or overtime, and discrimination against women. Of course, all of these practices are vigorously denied. Wal-mart has had to back off of claims that it sells at the lowest prices and that it emphasizes American-made goods.<br /><br />Communities pay a large price when Wal-mart moves in. Local businesses are often forced to close and infrastructure has to be significantly upgraded. But then the threat of Wal-mart moving on, leaving a damaged community behind, becomes very real. Much of the protests against Wal-mart are based on adverse community impacts. However, according to the author's data, very few are successful. Wal-mart contends it is a huge job creator for communities. See above for the type of jobs. Furthermore, the author's data shows that Wal-mart jobs created scarcely equal those that it eliminates.<br /><br />The author acknowledges that the primary American identity is as a consumer. Shopping and finding the best deal is a national obsession. The conditions under which goods are made and sold and the impacts on workers are not part of the national consciousness. Wal-mart seems to weather such controversies as the Kathy Lee Gifford clothing line being produced in sweatshops with nary a hiccup.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the American political and economic system has been undergoing huge changes in the last twenty-five years. Yes, Wal-mart is a huge player. But the entire right-wing mantra of free markets and anti-government politics is bigger than Wal-mart. The media, educational and religious institutions support and promote the new thinking. Gone are the views that corporations have societal obligations and that government exists to control excesses and provide a safety net. That is the space in which Wal-mart fits. Few observers, including the author, see any sort of reversal on the horizon.

A doctor out with his dog finds a long-buried bone of a young boy, who, upon thorough examination of the entire body, was obviously severely abused over a long period of time. Gritty detective Harry Bosch knows evil only too well, but given his own disturbing childhood, child abuse cases are especially distressing to him.<br /><br />Connelly's books are so interesting, despite the lack of great action, because he is an expert in capturing the subtleties and feel of police procedures and investigations. Beyond technicalities, the reader gets to see turf battles, spin control, rivalries, unspoken protocols and deference, petty rules, publicity seeking, the incessant media, etc. The psychological toll of police work is always right there.<br /><br />Harry has had a difficult time through the years maintaining relationships, but he immediately makes a connection with a rookie female cop at the scene of the buried bones. But the apprehension of a childhood acquaintance of the abused boy takes an inexplicable turn that hits Harry hard.<br /><br />The resolution of the case is entirely unsatisfying to Bosch. There are degrees of guilt among several parties with suitable punishment or accounting proving elusive. He feels compelled to respond in a manner that seems like the only course that he can take. Another good Connelly effort.	2005-09-18

The motivation for the book is the somewhat recent phenomenon of white-collar unemployment, a situation normally experienced by blue-collar workers. Ehrenreich changes her last name to Alexander and sets her sights on a Public Relations job in a corporation paying $50K with benefits. The exercise is more than a little flawed because she, as a free-lance journalist and part-time academic, has no corporate experience in any capacity, let alone PR. Furthermore, jobs such as PR and marketing have a more nebulous skill set than many more technical jobs, and as such, may require far more in the way of personal connections to attain. She had to creatively construct and repeatedly fine-tune a resume that undoubtedly came across to corporate recruiters as lacking. But frankly there is a bigger picture here that is not well discussed.<br /><br />Despite her flawed credentials for a corporate PR position, her actual experiences in locating a job have probably been experienced by many regardless of line of work. Starting from scratch in her job search, the author encounters all manner of charlatans, hucksters, and exploiters, armed with dubious thinking and strategies, intent on charging high fees with no results promised or realized. Employment coaches, counselors, and resume \\"tweakers\\" insist that finding a job is all about \\"you.\\" Discover your true personality via standardized testing of questionable validity; be perky and upbeat all the time (even though that is not your true personality); define your ideal job and aggressively find it. It is in expensive \\"boot camps\\" where the old, flawed self is supposed to transcended. In another variation of blaming the victim, a failure to find a job becomes an indictment of \\"you.\\" There is no acknowledgement of economic or corporate forces and practices that overwhelm individuals - even causing the unemployment condition now trying to be remedied. And it borders on blatant dishonesty to suggest that corporations are concerned with one's self-actualization in the workplace; in fact, conformity is absolutely required in all corporations, not personal growth.<br /><br />\\"Networking\\" is the huge buzz word in the job-seeking world. Perhaps some now with jobs in the corporate world can network (most are not in such a position), but the author found attending meetings of the unemployed presented few opportunities to \\"network.\\" Many of the group leaders dominated the proceedings with an agenda - usually to sell something to the attendees. Church-hosted groups of the unemployed emphasized religious themes, mostly exploiting those in a desperate situation. It seems that some think that religious themes should be free from criticism, but organizations that claim to be offering help should be judged on the delivery of such. In addition, spur-of-the-moment networking is troubling; generally using others for one's ends is unacceptable, regardless of justification.<br /><br />The author found that failing to find a corporate job with benefits basically leaves two alternatives. Commission-only sales jobs with no benefits that require the salesman to supply the place and equipment for the job are in abundance, such as selling real estate or insurance. Some take the route of operating a franchise. The failure rate of these endeavors is very high. Or one can take any number of unskilled labor jobs with guaranteed downward mobility.<br /><br />The author bemoans the reneging on the implied contract that once existed between corporations and employees: become broadly educated, channel your efforts on behalf of the corporation, and your sacrifices will be honored with long-term employment. The corporate rationalizations of outsourcing, downsizing, rightsizing, etc are mentioned. But looking at the bigger picture, what else could anyone expect? Corporations dominate the economic and political landscape. The media, think-tanks, and educational institutions have made the corporate agenda mainstream thinking. Corporate activity is hidden under the rubric of \\"free markets,\\" a benign sounding concept. But the actuality is that corporations dominate the rule/law making thereby acquiring enhanced \\"freedom,\\" at the expense of citizens and employees with reduced powers. Free trade and investment agreements are prime examples of the corporate agenda being enacted. And then there are the various visa programs that permit technical workers to be displaced by those paid reduced salaries under the guise of a technical worker shortage. Unchecked illegal immigration has also eroded well-paying jobs, though not necessarily white-collar.<br /><br />Ehrenreich does urge white-collar workers to unite in some manner to combat the power of corporations to discard them at will. But she recognizes that there is no trend to do that other than some groupings by professionals to form unions, the effectiveness of which is not discussed. She should have noted that the white middle-class of America has been lining up in droves to vote for political candidates that are completely committed to the corporate agenda - a distinct case of shooting one's self in the foot. Furthermore, there is no indication of what could be done with the exercise of political power. One really needs to look no further than to Europe to see what could be done.<br /><br />In contrast to the pathetic departments of labor throughout the US, employment centers in Europe actually help people transition back to work. In the first place, corporate jobs must be posted with the centers - not hidden (networking not required). If a person cannot be placed, training can be prescribed with adequate replacement pay. Workers usually cannot be dismissed in Europe without \\"cause.\\" Even with cause, adequate notice must be given with the additional obligation of paying at least 60 weeks of unemployment. Age discrimination is especially monitored. Within workplaces, works councils are present whereby employees consult with upper management and in some cases make joint decisions. Labor courts adjudicate disputes. This pro-worker system is mandated through legislation.<br /><br />The entire American system of obtaining employment needs to be scrapped. No more having to put up with parasitic consultants, being unable to determine the availability of jobs, and having resumes discarded. Americans are ingrained with the notion that governmental intervention in the economy represents a loss of freedom. Well the government intervenes now - on the part of corporations. Corporations have the freedom to run roughshod over society's best interests, while workers get the short end of the stick. The question really is \\"On whose part will the government intervene?\\"<br /><br />Perhaps Ehrenreich is not personally the best messenger for her message: she was not well qualified for the job she was seeking and she is at retirement age. Her various comments on corporate culture are based on little more than her frustrating job seeking experiences, which is not directly connected. However, the book does detail well the humiliating and depressing nature of trying to find a job in America. The obvious conclusion should have been drawn that the entire employment system needs to be changed in favor of those who do the work.

(4.5 *s)	Disabled FBI profiler Terry McCaleb is two months into recovery from a heart transplant, when he is presented a case that he cannot refuse, despite his doctor's dire warnings about risks to his health. Graciela Rivers, the attractive sister of his donor Gloria, has discovered through a \\"Where are They Now?\\" newspaper feature that McCaleb has to be the recipient of the heart, and furthermore may have the expertise to reinvigorate the investigation of her sister's killing in a convenience store holdup. McCaleb is unable to resist Graciela's entreaties to become involved.<br /><br />McCaleb quickly discovers similarities with other holdups. He runs largely on emotional energy in his investigation as he combats a weakened state, extensive medication needs, and hostility from some LAPD detectives. However, he finds support from Jaye Winston, from the sheriff's dept. Connelly is a master at revealing and connecting shreds of evidence, and with that accumulated evidence, McCaleb begins to realize that his role in this case goes far beyond merely investigating.<br /><br />The story is well constructed and moves well. McCaleb has to deal with conflicting emotions as he finds himself attracted to the sister, as well as putting his own health at risk. Eventually, his years of expertise and intuition result in an exciting and satisfying conclusion.	2005-09-13

When a vociferous police critic, black lawyer Howard Elias, is gunned down on an LA trolley, the Angel's Flight, racial tensions come to the fore. Detective Harry Bosch knows that damage control is a top priority when he is assigned to the case with his two black partners, Rider and Edgar. But his actions are constrained by the IAD and the FBI being assigned to the case, with Asst Chief Irving being apprised of every move.<br /><br />Since Elias' current case involved police brutality, it is widely assumed that a cop gunned down the attorney. Bosch has to walk a tightrope in avoiding a rush to judgment and following the trail left by Elias. From a series of anonymous letters, the situation in which Bosch finds himself veers in the direction of pedophilia as the cause of a young girl's death, with ramifications for Elias.<br /><br />The book moves slowly at first, with much time devoted to getting warrants and searching offices, apartments, etc. In the midst of all of this, Bosch's new wife (see Trunk Music), Eleanor, decides that she prefers a world of gambling to that of a policeman's wife. Justice is finally served, with deserved high costs to a leading LA family and not-deserved costs to a cop's family.<br /><br />Bosch is his usual skeptical self, daring to question assumptions and superficialities. He is able to obtain a measure of justice for the community, while his personal affairs unravel. Another good Connelly book, but not the best.	2005-09-08

(3.7 *s)	Detective Harry Bosch, like his namesake medieval painter Hieronymous Bosch, has always been aware of life's cruelties.  Bosch throughout his lengthy career has exhibited a profound sense of justice and a need to rectify criminal wrongs. Consequently, he has little tolerance for bureaucratic rules that hinder his pursuit of justice and often sidesteps or ignores them.<br /><br />In this latest Bosch saga, he is playing a leading role in the trial of a Hollywood director accused of murdering an actress and suspected of killing others. In a seemingly unrelated affair, retired FBI profiler Terry McCaleb is asked to examine a ritualistic murder scene. It turns out that Bosch has been trying to crack the victim, sleaze-bag Edward Gunn, for the last six years over a questionable death of a prostitute, including the night before his death when he was in the city's drunk tank. The murder scene is constructed with any number of similarities to the paintings of Bosch, the artist. From these details and given Harry's obsessions and willingness to cut corners, McCaleb draws the astounding conclusion that Harry is the prime suspect in Gunn's death.<br /><br />The story thus involves the resolution of that mistake, and the discovery that the two murders are related. It seems that the movie director tried to extend his scene management skills into areas beyond the acceptable. Any yarn with the gritty Bosch is not all bad. But the story line is not particularly good, especially the profiling angle based on little more than coincidence and dubious analysis. In addition, other than mention of Harry's estranged wife, Eleanor, there is, uncharacteristically, no female interest for Harry.<br /><br />The book was not entirely disappointing. It is hard to write consistently great books; this one is just okay.	2005-09-08

Supposedly, within the middle-class there may be a variety of interests and perspectives, but none of them are so powerful as to gain permanent ascendancy. All of this is in accordance with the Jeffersonian ideal of independent, nearly equal citizens controlling their destiny. It is theory of a balanced, self-regulating society.<br /><br />C. Wright Mills punctures this romantic view. As of 1955 Mills found that perhaps a few thousand people holding top economic, political, and military positions essentially dominate American society, thus forming a power elite. Nearly all of them have upper-class backgrounds, attended similar schools, belong to the same clubs, and are in agreement over basic values. There is movement in and out of this elite group, but since they self-select, there is little change in perspective or agenda.<br /><br />Mills notes that the development of the huge corporation after the Civil War shifted the control of American society from local, landed elites to those owning and managing the corporations - the corporate rich. Corporations began to invade all areas of life, including the political process, as they do today. WWII and the Cold War raised the importance of the top generals and admirals. In addition to the top positions, there exists a vast array of support personnel consisting of lawyers, financial people, public relations men, and a host of various technical experts, all of whom perpetuate the positions of the dominant few.<br /><br />Traditionally, a well informed public is the counter point to entrenched power. But that implies a public capable of independent, interpretive thought and the free flow of ideas via various media. Mills claims that publics have been replaced by thoughtless, manipulated mass society. Educational institutions downplay thought in lieu of job skills, and information is controlled and sanitized by consolidated media. Political participation is manipulated with the same techniques used in product advertising: appeals to insecurities and fantasies.<br /><br />The book was a corrective to the myth of general citizen empowerment in the economic and political realms. But it seems at times rather vague. The \\"whys\\" of this occurrence are largely missing. In addition, there is little commentary on exactly what it is that the power elite do with their dominance. Now, as then, it may not be obvious. But it is no accident that corporate and so-called free market values have totally penetrated and changed American life. Yet, gutting the country of its economic viability by shipping millions of jobs overseas scarcely raises any interest. Huge inequalities of remuneration continue unabated. The average worker is persuaded to become an \\"owner\\" or investor through 401K plans. The fact that the amounts invested from shrinking paychecks are a pittance and are often incompetently managed seems to not dissuade identification with the interests of the rich. The family physician has long since been replaced by health care providers, drug companies, and insurance companies that grossly inflate costs while trying to limit coverage to the healthy.<br /><br />Mills wrote at a time when Nazism had been defeated, but the McCarthy red-scarce was in full swing. Both were assaults on freedom. But Mills found the control of a populace to be far more pernicious and subtle than those aberrant situations. There are some voices expressing these views today, but Mills' work stands up well in comparison, though written fifty years ago.sanitized by consolidated media.

It looks like \\"trunk music,\\" or a mob hit. But curiously, the Organized Crime investigative unit of the LAPD is not interested. Harry and his two partners Kiz Rider and Jerry Edgar quickly find a connection with a Vegas mobster.<br /><br />This is not the most compelling of the Bosch series. A lot of it seems rather standard: casino gambling, strip clubs, strippers, mobster henchmen, crooked policemen, and undercover surveillance. The plot dragged a bit with the developments not entirely unexpected.<br /><br />But Harry is his usual irascible self, ignoring orders to leave the case in the hands of the Feebies. Interestingly, Harry hooks up again with old flame Eleanor Wish (Black Echo) in Vegas, where she has some connection with Aliso and/or the mob. Their romance is somewhat haltingly rekindled. The book has the same gritty feel as the others in the Bosch series. It's not quite a four star book. But it certainly does not dissuade from reading the next installment.	2005-08-16

But problems can arise when one or both of the partners, in essence, move beyond the initial dependency. The theme is rather unnerving in that one might conclude that it is inevitable that most marriages/relationships will fail.<br /><br />The author covers the signs of a relationship ending: fights, irreconcilable differences, boredom, emotional distance, and affairs. The stages of ending a relationship from \\"I Can't Believe This is Happening to Me,\\" through anger and placing blame, to some form of acceptance are discussed.<br /><br />Despite its one-sidedness, the book is a legitimate and insightful examination of relationships and their ending.	2005-08-12

Harry was disciplined by his own department for his \\"cowboy\\" approach on the apprehension, but now he is standing trial in a civil suit by the surviving wife for use of excessive force. Not only is he facing tough female attorney \\"Money\\" Chandler, but a body, a \\"concrete blonde,\\" has just been found buried in concrete with the same MO used by the Dollmaker. Did Harry kill the wrong man?<br /><br />This story proceeds on two fronts: the courtroom and an intense LAPD investigation into the impossibility of a dead man committing another murder. From the court proceedings, Harry realizes that a Follower has been copying the Dollmaker even before the shooting. But only an insider could have exactly duplicated the Dollmaker's crime scenes. Harry must now proceed cautiously in not falsely targeting a fellow associate, yet quickly as it becomes clear that Follower will strike soon. The tale is gripping and well-constructed with any number of twists that fit well in the story line. Of interest is Harry's delicate relationship with police widow Sylvia Moore.<br /><br />The Harry Bosch series delivers and shows no sign of a let down.	2005-08-05

Her technique involves answering a series of diagnostic questions, much as a doctor would proceed, thereby supposedly avoiding the balance-scale technique of seeing how the evidence to stay or leave tilts the scale. But of course human relationships are not straightforward, scientific matters. The answers to almost all of the questions involve gray areas, which require weighing evidence, with the likely possibility of no clear answer.<br /><br />The questions fall into several overlapping areas. One series of questions involve basic compatibility, respect, sharing, agreement, intimacy, etc: \\"Were times ever good?; do you share at least one interest?; is your partner's personality okay? Possibly these areas have eroded over time, but may be difficult to clearly answer. Also important are questions of communication, adaptability, acceptance, forgiveness, and support of individual needs. Does one partner shut the other one out? More significant may be questions concerning the existence of dominance, abuse, power, disrespect, and humiliation, which are more likely to be used to justify leaving.<br /><br />Then there are questions that merely corroborate that a decision has already been made to leave, like the partner has violated one's \\"bottom-line.\\"<br /><br />The entire tone of the book is to exercise caution. The author seems to suggest that even a small possibly of resolving or accepting problems is an indicator to stay. A decision to leave is left for only the most egregious of transgressions. For those who are clearly justified in leaving or who have already made the decision, this book is unnecessary. For others seeking clarity, the questions may stimulate thought but there is no clear path to a decision to stay or leave	2005-08-05

The reader first sees Tess in this book plying her trade, photographing a wayward spouse outside a sleazy motel in Baltimore, while staying unnoticed. Meanwhile, her band-member boyfriend has opted for Texas. But the arrival of a picture of Crow from Texas with a caption of \\"In Big Trouble\\" alarms her and Crow's family enough for her to set off to Texas for some sleuthing.<br /><br />The limitations of Tess' modus operandi immediately becomes obvious. Having no well-defined police investigative expertise, she relies on seat-of-the-pants efforts. Finally, with Crow's picture and some good fortune in bumping into evidence, Crow is located. But it is his involvement with a multi-generational dysfunctional family that sends Tess into high gear consisting of more rather unfocused intensity and a great deal of intuition and luck. The conclusion is more outlandish than anything.<br /><br />This book falls into the category of chick lit. Tess is well-meaning enough. She's cute and is a rower. Beyond pluck and being a woman, she has no qualifications. The plot is conveniently weak. A complex plot would require an investigator that had a clue. For those that are used to reading well-developed works in this area, this book will be well below those standards.	2005-08-01

Harry, an outsider detective within his own department, cannot accept convenient coincidences or inconsistencies. He is forever on the lookout for situations that are painted or constructed to be what they are not. This skepticism is exactly what is needed on Christmas night when Harry intercepts radio traffic about a death in a seedy motel room in his district while he is on call. But Assistant Chief Irving has rushed to the scene and quickly concludes, too quickly for Harry's liking, that the death of narcotics detective Cal Moore is a suicide - end of story.<br /><br />But Harry finds several cases that seem to be much too conveniently attached to Moore, suggesting that Moore may have been a target. Bosch almost methodically pieces together the connections. The evidence in all the cases finally points to a drug operation involving black ice in Mexicali, Mexico. Harry has to use all of his expertise in surviving this case.<br /><br />The Black Echo and The Black Ice are too very good entries into this genre. There are some references to the first book, but not overly so. With the creation of Bosch and his complex, well-paced stories, Connelly's success is unsurprising.	2005-07-31

But that is precisely the tale that Baldacci has concocted in The Simple Truth.<br /><br />The villains in this case are almost too formidable: too powerful, knowing, and menacing. The good guys, lawyers and law clerks for Supreme Court justices, are for the most part over-matched. It is only through the actions of the accused in an improbable escape and the aggressiveness of the older brother of one of the murdered clerks, as well as an infatuated female law clerk, that a massive cover-up finally starts to be unraveled. The development of that relationship, between the brother and the clerk, in trying circumstances has some appeal.<br /><br />The story line stretches probability at several points, but for the most part moves right along. The machinations within the Supreme Court among the justices are interesting but are only marginally central to the story. The main difficulty is that the level of mayhem and ineptitude on the part of a variety of officials crosses over into unbelievability. Overall the book is okay.	2005-07-26

Of course, the basis of that success is the compelling figure of Harry Bosch, a besieged LAPD detective. He is not a so-called team player - going along with the spin of the day. He is hard-working, thorough, independent, irascible, and highly successful in cracking open hard cases. But is forever having to defend himself against department higher-ups. Harry also has demons. He had a troubled upbringing and went to Vietnam at an early age, where he became a \\"tunnel rat\\" - someone who descended into the darkness of tunnels to root-out Viet Cong, experiencing \\"black echo.\\"<br /><br />In this novel, Harry is on duty when a dead body is reported being found in an overflow tunnel near a dam in Hollywood. It seems like a simple case of drug overdose, but Harry is very concerned with inconsistencies at the scene. Furthermore, he recognizes the victim as a fellow tunnel rat from his service years before. He cannot accept that this is merely a coincidence. Harry teams with enticing yet demure FBI agent Eleanor Wish to investigate not only this murder but a well planned bank robbery of the previous year for which the victim was also a suspect. Harry has to contend with not only surveillance from Internal Affairs, but also the nagging thought that a police insider knows his next move. This is a well-paced,  interesting story with an ending that places Harry back in a labyrinth of tunnels, but perhaps with one too many twists. But Harry lives to fight another battle with the bad guys and the LAPD.	2005-07-20

Warshawski book, I was expecting to learn what makes this character compelling. Alas, I did not. Private-eye Warshawski seems to need no sleep, conducts her affairs in a hectic manner that crosses into unbelievability, short-changes her clients due to her disorganization, can circumvent most any barrier, human or otherwise, thrown her way, and has a personality that is at times weirdly over-aggressive. She seems tone deaf: in dealing with a distraught teenager, she makes comments like, \\"You little mutt\\" or \\"Put a sock in it\\". The reader never learns if she is dumpy, frumpy, attractive, fit, or what. The scaling of a brick wall of a house is worthy of a mountain climber, not your nondescript female private-eye, not to mention navigating an underground storm sewer in total darkness.<br /><br />The tale starts simply enough: the investigation of lights seen late at night in an abandoned mansion. But the story is immediately ratcheted up by V.I. falling into a pond and bumping into a dead man and her tackling a young female lurking on the grounds. At this point her pace becomes exhausting as she finds herself involved with the quirks and secrets of rich, interconnected Chicago families, which revolves around intrigue about Communist activities, investigations by the HUAC, and providing information and blacklisting some forty years prior. Added to the witchhunt of years ago, is the harboring of an Arabic teenager who has been labeled as a terrorist. However, after all of the sorting out of these intricacies, the story reaches a rather unsatisfactory ending.<br /><br />The author's concern with blacklisting and infringement on civil liberties is a key element of the book, but is not as distracting as some claim. The main difficulty is that the central character and the story line are not well-drawn.	2005-07-20

Fortunately for the citizens of LA he is. But in The Last Coyote, Harry has pushed his effete lieutenant's head through a window for interfering with one of his cases. Of course, immediate suspension follows with mandatory counseling.<br /><br />Harry now has time to consider himself and his life - what should he be doing. He is forced to confront some of those issues with his counselor with whom he is at first defiant, but later grudgingly accepts. Foremost is that his mother's murder left him alone some thirty years before. He has been psychologically unable to look into his mother's death, but now that becomes his mission. Not even the counselor can dissuade him. Harry has to grapple not only with his emotions as he becomes aware of the involvement of others in the death, but also with the leaving of his long-time girlfriend and the meeting of another girl who has her own issues.<br /><br />The story is well constructed, flows well, and is interesting. Harry slowly gets to the bottom of his mother's death. The ending is unexpected, but not illogical. The book is definitely a very good read.	2005-07-06

She exhibits unreal expertise, coolness, and ability to manipulate. Furthermore, she maintains at least four identities/lives at once with no slip-ups. It is all most implausible.<br /><br />Once she finally attracts the attention of the FBI, a super agent is assigned to her case who also juggles multiple identities. Of course, the agent is sucked into her web. These characters seem to be from pages of a comic book.<br /><br />The book is fast-paced, but don't expect much beyond the superficial regarding the characters. Where is the introspection and motivating factors? The typical Patterson three and four page chapters don't permit such. Nora does have a prodigious gift for bed-hopping with no guilt pangs shown.<br /><br />As the book closes, the plot gets a bit awkward and more contrived, especially the bit about campaign funds finding their way to off-shore accounts. That just seems to be a tack on. The book is formulaic. It deserves to be read fast, passed on, and forgotten.	2005-06-28

To this mix, add a most perceptive whale, who seemingly travels the Atlantic seaboard in response to various characters' distress on the mainland.<br /><br />The book begins with the disappearance of a young pregnant wife from her New England home some nine years prior. One detective Patrick Murphy has pursued the case for all of those years remaining skeptical of evidence that seems to point to a violent end. But the mystery really is paper thin, even with an extra twist added toward the end.<br /><br />The book is mostly about emotional support be it from a women's club called the Nanouks in a Nova Scotian community or from the aforementioned understanding male. There are any number of anguished moments toward which all of this \\"goodness\\" can be directed. Much of the emotional outpouring is connected with the ongoing heart problems of nine-year-old Rose. Rose and her friend Jessica exhibit more emotional strength than do the adults.<br /><br />Rather than suspenseful or gripping, the book is far more maudlin. The author makes every effort to draw the reader into the emotional maelstrom of her characters as they attempt to move past their various traumas and insecurities. That is its essential appeal, as is the case with most of Rice's work.	2005-06-21

But the book must be judged on its merits, notwithstanding the history of the series.<br /><br />It's a nice touch to have Harry exhibit some rust in his return. He botches an interrogation; more surprising are his miscommunications with longtime partner Kiz Rider. However, the drastic consequences for a suspect that Harry is dogging and has under surveillance receive rather minor attention.<br /><br />Interleaved with a perhaps excessive attention to police procedure, is the continual focus on racism that presumably infused LA in the late 1980s. First is the case of the murder of the multi-ethnic girl with racial overtones that has been reopened after seventeen years. Then there is the neo-Nazi gang that was bent on creating mayhem by harassing non-whites. Finally, there is the question of whether the LAPD but a lid on the cold case years ago to promote the illusion of racial harmony. If the book becomes a bit plodding or one-track, the anguish of the parents still seeking answers after all of the years provides the most haunting moments of the book.<br /><br />The book is not particularly gripping. In fact, the story is largely one big tangent. The reader is really left with no clear understanding how this case went unsolved years ago. The conclusion is a bit of a let down.	2005-06-21

The reader is shown the Thai sex industry in all of its settings, from bars to sex change clinics; the completely corrupt Thai police force seen as simply another business center; the drug trade, in particular the trade in \\"yaa-baa,\\" or meth; and the trade in precious stones, namely jade. In addition, Thai culture is contrasted with that of the West, with the former generally coming out ahead in this version. Westerners, or \\"farangs\\" in Thai terminology, are seen as materialistic, fearful, aggressive, moralistic, and accepting of terminal blandness, in contrast to the free flow of Thai life.<br /><br />The main character detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep, the son of a Thai prostitute and American serviceman, is the philosophical narrator in this journey through Thai culture. But his wanderings do have a purpose: he has a murder to solve. A larger than life black Marine, attached to the US embassy, has been subjected to the horrifying death of being attacked by drugged deadly cobras. The FBI has sent agent Kimberly Jones to investigate the murder. It is interesting to watch her attempt to make advances on Det Jitpleecheep, a Buddhist and nearly a saint in his refusal to join the corruption associated with his job: more cultural disconnect.<br /><br />The mystery is attention-grabbing but it has to compete with the collage-like descriptions of Thai life, which at times tend to bog down the flow. The story verges on unreality with its depiction of some characters as too powerful, rich, in-the-know, etc, which is not entirely consistent with the general seamy tone. The \\"girlfriend\\" Fatima of the Marine and a central character is a bit tricky to grasp.<br /><br />While the book is interesting, it may be just enough different to be unappealing for those who like their mysteries to keep the focus on the case - forget the sociology, let alone Thai sociology. But then some like Thai cuisine.	2005-06-08

Even ignoring the disenfranchisement of women and the subjugation of twenty percent of the population to slavery, that is a questionable belief. Many elites in the colonies, including many directly connected with the revolution, wanted to roll back any unleashed democratic impulses.  The landed gentry, lawyers, the educated, merchants and creditors, and the like assumed that their superiority entitled them to control society's institutions including government. In their view, it was in the best interests of all if the unlearned population deferred to the better element of society. That was Thomas Jefferson's assessment of the political culture in the early years of the US.<br /><br />According to the author, one of Jefferson's main achievements was countering this presumption of elite control of society and politics. Though an aristocrat and intellectual, Jefferson developed a respect for the political rights and participation of the average citizen. Jefferson along with democratic political clubs infused with admiration for the French Revolution and a vigorous oppositional press formed an unofficial political party, the Republicans, to oppose the entrenched elites, known as the Federalists. The passage of the Sedition Act under Adams confirmed the Federalist fears and disdain for true political freedom.<br /><br />Jefferson dispensed with all symbols of aristocratic pretension when assuming the Presidency. Under Washington and Adams, the protocols of the European courts were rigorously followed. Jefferson understood that the style of his Presidency made a statement about whom or what was truly important.<br /><br />Jefferson was also very interested in the expansion of the US into the West beyond the Appalachian Mountains. He saw the West as a tremendous opportunity for hard-working average Americans, and not the province of elite speculators. The Louisana Purchase and the Lewis and Clark expedition were bold and promising acts.<br /><br />The Jefferson Presidency had to contend with the wounded Federalists, including their personal attacks concerning Jefferson's religion and character. In addition, the French-English conflict escalated in his second term and resulted in wholesale predations on American commercial ships. The Embargo Act, enacted to curtail opportunities for conflict, was highly unpopular and unsuccessful.<br /><br /> The author does discuss the contradictions of Jefferson. Jefferson extolled the essential equality of all men and promoted widespread political participation. Yet he could not extend that concept fully to Negroes or to native Indians. It is a troublesome inconsistency, but the huge impact that Jefferson had on the direction that the political culture took in the US cannot be overlooked. It is inaccurate to suggest that the author excoriates Jefferson through a political correctness lens.<br /><br />The book is not an exhaustive study of Jefferson; it is not supposed to be. Jefferson does deserve to be rated as a president just behind FDR or Lincoln. His Presidency represents a decided shift from an elitist political culture to one far more democratic, hardly an insignificant development in a democracy. The author makes that point quite well.ase and the Lewis and Clark expedition were bold and promising acts. <br /> <br />The Jefferson Presidency had to contend with the wounded Federalists, including their personal attacks concerning Jefferson's religion and character.

The author admits that it is a loose concept with any possible analysis being unavoidably \\"procrustean.\\" His primary technique of getting at the essence of bulls... is by comparison to terms like \\"humbug\\", \\"bull\\", and \\"hot air\\", as well as to good old-fashioned lying. Most will find that the author's commentary is the typical philosophical dancing on the head of a pin: many words - no real clarity or closure.<br /><br />A main point that can be discerned is that bulls... falls short of direct lying on the truth continuum. That revolves around the speaker's knowledge of the truth and intent to distort the truth. In the author's view, to a bulls...(er) the truth is almost an irrelevancy. Furthermore, it all seems rather benign in his construction.<br /><br />It seems that a mighty wide net is being cast to locate bulls... . One example given, is that statements such as \\"I feel like I have been run over by a dog\\" by a sick person is a form of bulls... . This is an obviously nonsensical statement, issued more for colorful depiction, clear to all - both the speaker and listener. This is not bulls... . Modern advertising is also depicted as a more \\"careful\\" form of bulls... . But that invites the question: Is all propaganda bulls... ?<br /><br />Perhaps nonsensical, empty, or flamboyant speech is one side of the bulls... speech phenomenon. But the author does not address a more pernicious view of bulls... . Bulls... is often regarded as a situation or interpretation created through misrepresentations that is harmful, obnoxious, etc - not benign. For example, the arbitrary (though elaborately or legalistically justified) imposition of a set of onerous rules. Or the mounting of plausible, but phony, evidence to justify an action. The justification for the Iraqi invasion comes to mind - surely an example of bulls... or worse.<br /><br />It took a lot of nerve to publish the musings of a magazine article as a book. The book is  food for thought mostly because it is very incomplete and vague. Admittedly, the title was catchy.

First, the author wants to make the overwhelmingly obvious point that American corporations are undemocratic hierarchies and that no outbreak of democracy is going to occur anytime soon. Apparently, those comments are meant for idealistic academics, because working people are well aware of the continuing master/slave nature of corporations. Secondly, the author continually flip-flops between discussing hierarchies as authoritarian control structures and as a means of organizing tasks; those are two distinct subjects. Democratic governance does not preclude hierarchies or other organizational forms. Speaking of corporations primarily as hierarchies and not as bastions of authoritarianism verges on dishonesty.<br /><br />Curiously, the author readily admits that authoritarian hierarchies are un-American in their disenfranchisement of people and in subjecting them to a control regime little better than a ruthlessly run feudal estate. Corporate America infantilizes employees, creating fear, dependency, and conformity. The much heralded claim of efficiency is gained at a high cost: the reduction of intelligent beings to timid, tunnel-vision followers. It can hardly be ignored that corporations are constantly going off track, making bad decisions, if not engaging in criminal activities. Perhaps thinking, empowered employees could head off such disasters, even if less \\"efficient.\\"<br /><br />The author seems to contend that authoritarian corporate hierarchies are inevitable: that's the way that it has to be. Nothing could be more wrong. The US as a democracy has the political means of imposing all manner of restrictions on corporate behavior. The rise of unions in the WWII era was a countervailing power to the unilateral power of corporations. European works councils, legislatively mandated, have rights of information, consultation, and codetermination over many corporate decisions and do wield real power. Trade policy, visa administration, and job outsourcing are all in the purview of politics. But the perversion of American democracy through the infusion of corporate dollars and all manner of propaganda precludes its exercise to curtail corporate unilateral, anti-citizen actions. Countervailing power seems to have been thoroughly suppressed in the US, reminding one of suppression regimes which the American public regards as inferior cultures.<br /><br />The author notes that corporations attempt to hide their nearly absolute hierarchical power, employing any number of participation and teamwork schemes. He sympathizes with managers caught in the corporate hierarchy that are expected to encourage \\"participation.\\" He engages in a discussion of leadership versus management, which are the techniques of \\"humanizers\\" versus \\"systemizers,\\" in other words, people-first versus organization-first philosophies. But those arrangements are so much window dressing; unilateral authority is not diminished. Urging middle-managers to be what they are not really permitted to be seems disingenuous, if not perverse.<br /><br />The author suggests that a positive aspect of corporate hierarchies is the benefits both material and psychological that employees derive from the current corporate regime. No alarm in the author is detected. Do we simply aspire to becoming happy sheep?<br /><br />The author claims to be a humanizer, but his commentary gives him away. Authoritarian, corporate hierarchies (or any other organizational form) are not defensible in a country that claims to be democratic, unless of course, our democracy is paper thin, more formal than actual. Maybe that is the case. If our current form of corporate organization is here to stay, and there is good evidence for that and is the author's point, maybe we really are a pseudo-democracy. Apparently organizational psychologists are unwilling to squarely face that point. The book can beread simply to see how shallow organizational theory can be.book can be read simply to see how shallow organizational theory can be.  <br />	2005-05-24

Depending upon what point that poignant fact is finally learned, the writer has choices, but with psychological costs: simply slipping away is an option, or perhaps the more risky path of concealing one's limitations is taken. On the other hand, it is also sad when a person with talent is not in a position to express it, whether due to personal reasons or external pressures. \\"The Wife\\" is a very keen look at the world of writing and authorship and the impacts on those with and without talent. In addition the politics of getting published and accepted, especially in regard to gender, is explored, as well as the subtleties and demands operating within marriages of authors.<br /><br />The marriage of Joe Castleman, a creative writing professor, and Joan, a totally smitten student, examined over forty-plus years, serves as the vehicle for exploring all of these themes. What could be more joyous: Joe, at the pinnacle of a highly acclaimed and rewarded career, is finally receiving the prestigious Helsinki Prize for fiction. But the beaming Finnish hosts have not a clue at the high costs that have been exacted on the long journey from the grungy Greenwich Village apartment that Joe and Joan shared. Compromises have been made with rippling consequences.<br /><br />The book is sharply written, with great insight and even a touch of subtle humor. One might have wished for a slightly deeper plumbing of Joan's thoughts along the way. Is there a surprise ending? Yes and no. Regardless, the story grabs the reader and won't let go.	2005-05-19

It's not really clear why book-lover Eva married dyslexic Mark, other than physical attraction. But the distance between them was obvious with the sudden termination of the marriage upon Eva's learning of Mark's infidelity. She would have none of what a later, mature friend Gracie would call \\"bumps in matrimony.\\" But Miller ratchets this story up a notch.<br /><br />The carefully constructed contentment that Eva eventually finds is shattered with the accidental death of second husband John, a publisher of books. John's death is not only devastating to Eva, but teen-aged daughter Daisy is especially traumatized, being unable to express grief. Finding paths to move beyond this tragedy is the essence of the story. Both Mark and Eva are forced to deal with rekindled interest in each other.<br /><br />One unexpected direction taken is the seduction of gawky, leggy, but budding beauty, Daisy by an older family friend. For the author, her sexual awakening serves, at least in the short term, as some sort of substitute for the absence of good parenting, whether through divorce or death. One is left wondering why this lengthy affair with the immature Daisy did not destroy many parties rather than seemingly heal.<br /><br />The end of the book is unremarkable. Life is continuing. Many may feel an absence of development or depth in this relatively short book. As it is, we have a sensitive glimpse at coping and growth in a world that can and will throw most anything our ways.	2005-05-17

There is not much of the history of the labor movement prior to WWII, with the obvious exception of the Wagner Act, the principal defining legislation of the right to be represented by labor organizations, and brief references to WWI labor relations and the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Though mostly completed by the early 90s, it is interesting that the precipitous decline of unions is hardly mentioned in this book. The author is more concerned with the changed nature of unions and the shift in focus to wages and benefits from shop floor conditions and control.<br /><br />The curtailment of strikes was the foremost concern of governmental bodies that were coordinating wartime efforts, not to mention the constant drumbeat from the business community. After unsatisfactory efforts by other agencies, the WLB, created by executive order, was given the responsibility and power to set labor policy in the United States. Though it may be counterintuitive, the WLB looked to centralized, bureaucratic unions to curtail worker unrest on the shop floor, especially wild cat strikes. The WLB promoted the inclusion of grievance-arbitration clauses in labor contracts as a substitute for rights to strike, though that right was fundamental in the Wagner Act. Under those clauses, the only recourse for workers dissatisfied with managerial actions is to file a grievance (complaint) with no withholding of work permitted while the legal process unfolds under the control of union and management bureaucracies. Union members were not allowed to quit unions (other than during narrow, one-time windows) and union dues were regularly deducted. Thereby, union leaders were less reluctant to enforce contract provisions on recalcitrant employees. In addition, the WLB disallowed managerial prerogatives from being bargained. In other words, businesses could run their firms as they saw fit with only issues of wages, benefits, and job conditions subject to negotiation.<br /><br />In the post-WWII era, the NLRB and the court system generally reinforced and extended virtually all of the policies and decisions of the WLB. Labor unrest was a discredited idea. Labor \\"peace\\" fit nicely into the view of \\"pluralistic\\" thinkers that society consisted of competing, though essentially equal, interest groups with similar interests, differing only at the margins. Furthermore, labor relations were legitimized under a \\"rule of law,\\" that is, a contract (constitution) with a dispute settling system. Workplace regimes could even be regarded as democratic, with the legal system of the workplace paralleling that of the broader society. Everyone is equal before the law, even employer and employee.<br /><br />However, the author is critical of this labor accord. In actuality, grievance systems were largely overburdened, misused, and generally insufficient. In the first place, only contract issues could be grieved. Many of the concerns of workers over the nature of work and workplace control never made it into contracts. There was a good deal of worker unrest and dissatisfaction, perhaps peaking in the late 60s and early 70s, that could only be voiced through spontaneous worker actions. In other words, the accord really did not work. Containment of workers trumped worker empowerment and justice.<br /><br />It has taken several decades for the flawed nature of the labor regime rooted in WWII labor policies to be fully realized. A legal process that papers over or ignores fundamental issues or relationships is destined for failure. Employment in the US is in the midst of vast changes, mostly initiated by employers and detrimental to working people. The failure of labor contracts to fully address workplace situations and relationships is a key part of the decline of the standing of working people.<br /><br />The author is not inclined to make much in the way ofrecommendations. But it is important to understand the \\"box\\" into which labor organizations have been placed to understand their ineffectualness. The state of working people involves much more than an inadequate labor relations regime. One needs to look at the dominance of corporations over society via such mechanisms as the mass media and educational systems, as well as control of the political process. Given that kind of social and political control, there is no chance that labor relations will be adjusted to address most workplace issues and elevate the standing of working people.the way of recommendations.

Lukacs, an eminent conservative historian, wanders disjointedly over the political landscape of the last two hundred years making any number of observations, assertions, and rather blunt criticisms of other chroniclers of the era, including historian Richard Hoftstadter and Hannah Arendt, the author of \\"The Origins of Totalitarianism,\\" described as a \\"muddled and dishonest writer.\\" A burden is placed on the reader to sift through the fragmented commentary to separate substance from overstatement and inconsistencies and to locate, if not construct, main themes.<br /><br />The subtitle, \\"Fear and Hatred,\\" gives some indication of the direction that the author is headed. It is thought processes and psychology that are important in a mass democracy: \\"our concern must be with how people think, how they choose to think, including how they are influenced or impressed to think and speak.\\" Fear and hatred are central concerns. He rejects the Freudian notion that they operate subconsciously, rather than being purposely chosen.<br /><br />The author tags 1870 as a time of fundamental rearrangement of political forces.  The rise and attraction of socialism and nationalism basically shoved aside the older liberal, conservative debate, though that debate lingers today. Interestingly, and probably correctly, he points out that none of the political parties in the 19th century US were truly conservative.  The rise of socialism, or the Welfare state, merely reflected the new Darwinian perspective of constant social \\"progress.\\" The author's assertion that the entire globe is now socialist is not much of an overreach.<br /><br />But the emergence of populist nationalism is more relevant to understanding the 20th century. Nationalism is not synonymous with patriotism; it is a mutation of patriotism. It is \\"aggressive\\" and based on a vague \\"myth of the people\\" that takes on feverish religious overtones. Nationalists are anti liberal. They take offense at liberal open-mindedness and tolerance, especially for foreigners. For the author, 1914 represents the time when the weakness of socialism relative to nationalism finally became clear.  \\"... class consciousness melted away in the heat of nationalist emotions and beliefs.\\"<br /><br />Populism, at least as it has evolved in the last century, is a mutant form of democracy. Tocqueville already saw mass conformity to public opinion as a problem for democracy. But Lukacs is more concerned with the manipulation of public opinion. The media of 1914 pandered to nationalistic sentiments. In addition, the US government got into the propaganda act by creating departments to promote the War. Ultimately, \\"nationalist hatred [trumped] class hatred.\\"<br /><br />Hitler clearly demonstrates where populist nationalism can wind up. He fanned hatreds for the \\"enemies of German nationalism both within and without.\\" The author explains that the old \\"Right,\\" at one time, feared popular sovereignty. But that has been reversed in this century as the Right has assumed the populist nationalism mantle, appealing to and creating a fierce nationalism within populations.  And that is the basis of the Right's advantage over the Left - a main point of the book. The Left and Democrats have never been sufficiently nationalistic.<br /><br />It is a conceit within the Right that they support a higher morality. The author, a true conservative, is having none of that. Clearly, the cultural products of the US have smashed social and moral standards worldwide. The author decries the \\"stunning transformations of personal and sexual and civilizational behavior\\" within American culture. So-called conservatives have been prime promoters of technology and \\"progress,\\" and more importantly economic policies of neoliberalism, which give global corporations a free hand in upsetting the social order by such actions as offshoring jobswithout the hindrance of environmental or labor regulations. The impacts on families, whom conservatives claim to value much, and communities have been profound, not to mention on the environment.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the author has a blind eye about other aspects of capitalism. For example, his claim that 20th century nationalists shared with socialists a dislike, even hatred, for international financiers and capitalists. Or his contention that corporate executives do not form a new aristocracy. What is a plutocracy (which surely exists in the US) other than a moneyed aristocracy? There is little evidence that the populist Republican Party favors restrictions on international capital. At one time the Pat Buchanan wing of the Republicans showed some interest in those areas. On the other hand, the minimal social disapproval of white collar crime is noted - surely, a conservative contradiction.<br /><br />The author is concerned that parliamentary democracy is at risk in the US due to a large deficit in the free flow of useful information. The press no longer performs a role of assimilating and reflecting the political views of the public. As with other media, its focus is on entertainment. He is especially concerned about the potential for the public being manipulated by television, which now dominates news and entertainment, through the subtle distortion of words and speech. There are only limited avenues for unaltered oppositional voices.<br /><br />As the author suggests, there has been a degeneration of democracy into nationalist populism in the US. There is one slight reference to the original populists in the US, the farmer revolt in the South in the late 19th century, who correctly identified oppression by business and government and attempted to ameliorate their situation through economic and political means - a true democratic effort. The measures taken to suppress that movement were extreme, and not discussed by the author.<br /><br />The author misses the opportunity to reflect on the difficulties that truly ground-up democratic action faces. It seems that pseudo-democracy, or the kind of populism that the author discusses, is really all that can be \\"successful.\\" But that is a result of manipulation by elites. It is not deliberative, and is usually fanatical. He does recognize that spectacular sporting events encourage \\"accumulations of hatred,\\" which can be exercised politically.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the author can only hope for some sort of revival of true conservatism. The chances of the Left successfully combating the forces of the Right are virtually nil.s offshoring jobs without the hindrance of environmental or labor regulations.

They don't take the easy way out to solve cases. Even a whiff of something not adding up sends them digging, no matter whose toes are stepped on. Their professional determination does come at the high price of difficult home lives, which makes them even more appealing. And then there are the contrasts: Sam being a crusty veteran, and Liska being a petite female with lots of nerve.<br /><br />Why does Internal Affairs of the Minneapolis Police Dept blow them off when inquiring into the current work of Andy Fallon, an IA officer, after he is found hanging in his home? Why is the beautiful Lt. Amanda Savard of IA so incredibly icy and aloof?

When these developments hit Stratton, the largest employer in Fenwick, Mich, Nick Conover, local sports star and now CEO, gets referred to as Nick the Slasher in the local press after eliminating five thousand jobs. He is routinely shunned in public places.<br /><br />But the community's scorn takes on a more serious tone as his family in their large home in a gated community is threatened by break-ins and vandalism. Obviously feeling under siege, Nick reacts - perhaps overreacts - to a laid-off and schizophrenic former Stratton worker that he finds on his property. Moreover, Nick's woes at Stratton are added to when he discovers that his policies are being undermined by the board of directors with its own agenda.<br /><br />Though corporate shenanigans form the backdrop, the story primarily revolves around African-American police detective Audrey Rhimes and Cassie Stadler, daughter of a long time Stratton employee found shot to death in a trash bin in a drug-infested part of town. Audrey is relentless in following evidence that points to Nick, despite the many roadblocks thrown her way.<br /><br />Cassie, a girl with a shadowy past, intrigues Nick with her counter-culture motif and understanding. What started as a courtesy call of consolation by Nick turns into much more. Cassie's displays a remarkable ability to revive Nick's family situation, which had become dysfunctional since the death of his wife.<br /><br />\\"Company Man\\" is a cut above the author's last work, \\"Paranoia,\\" although the plot is less ambitious - probably for the best. Corporate skullduggery is a common theme, but the main characters are more compelling. One can quibble with some aspects of the book. Some of the scenes, both corporate and family, are too-oft repeated. While high-tech is not a huge part of the book, it gets a little fanciful in its power.

Many were attempting to grasp the significance and the nature of the democratic changes that were occurring. Tocqueville, a French aristocrat, took it upon himself to describe and explain in great detail to his fellow Europeans the American experiment in democracy, which had lasted a half century at the time his treatise \\"Democracy in America\\" appeared.<br /><br />For Tocqueville, the essence of democracy was equality. First political and social equality, but in addition rough equality of condition. But he was very concerned with issues of the power of the majority and centralization of government. It wasn't just formal governmental power, but the power of majority opinion to restrain independent thought that troubled him. He also thought that the liberty that people enjoyed under a regime of equality led to excessive individualism with the potential for forming an economic elite - a contradiction for a democracy.<br /><br />Commager touches on these concerns of Tocqueville. With the advantage of a century and a half of hindsight it is possible to quibble with Tocqueville and Commager does some of that. For example, Tocqueville's claim that only a democracy can form a just order is countered with obvious examples of injustice. Commager is surely correct in noting that the federal government has a better record of broadening individual rights than do local governments. But those observations do not really detract from the relevance of Tocqueville's insights.<br /><br />The book is far more a platform for Commager's views in the same areas. He finds the modern national security state to be akin to the  paranoia of the slave-holding Southern aristocracy in its manner of dealing with threats - perceived or real - with an equal potential for aggressive action. He contends that American democracy has been essentially short-circuited by the consistent failure to take seriously the general welfare clause of the Constitution, the main exception being FDR's New Deal. He sees private enterprise (Tocqueville's individualism) as creating all manner of environmental and other problems that threaten our very survival.<br /><br />The book is really a compendium of Commager lectures.

Lily Owens, raised in rural South Carolina by a negligent and harsh father after her mother's sudden death ten years prior, has managed to maintain an inner strength and curiosity about her mother and the natural world, especially the habits of bees. Now fourteen years of age, she draws upon her inner resourcefulness to not only escape her stultifying life, but more importantly to aid her black housekeeper Rosaleen in eluding law enforcement authorities, who permitted her to be beaten nearly to death for daring to register to vote shortly after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<br /><br />At this point, the reader may be anticipating a heavy dose of race relations in the backwards South of forty years ago. While racial tensions do appear, the book becomes much more a fairy tale of discovery in tune with the rhythms of Southern life. Lily and Rosaleen are taken in by a family of three middle-aged colored sisters, who not coincidentally are beekeepers. The oldest sister, August Boatwright, gently leads Lily on a path to discovery through becoming totally sensitized to the needs and characteristics of bees and through home-grown religious rituals.<br /><br />The book can be criticized as improbable and unrealistic. But the central characters, Lily and August, hold the reader's attention. August is almost saintly in her kindness and understanding. Lily has suffered and is struggling to make sense of her life. Hope is alive and well, at least in fairy tales.	2005-04-05

And there is the constant speculation as to whether the accused, Jennifer Witt, did or could have killed her abusive husband along with her only son with Hardy doing most of the wondering while balancing a faltering home situation.<br /><br />Beyond the trial, Dismas works on the \\"other dude\\" theory: someone else did it. The list of suspects is hardly compelling: Jennifer's abusive family members, a family who blames Jennifer's husband for a botched abortion, and those involved in a sleazy financial deal involving the husband's medical facility. The end is not necessarily predictable, but one may rightly feel that the last minute realization could have come much earlier and easier. At times the book becomes a bit laborious, but overall it is okay - not quite four stars.	2005-03-25

But how much of that idyllic view is based on maintained appearances, facades, convenient fictions, and close-mindedness? Innocent people can be made to suffer when illusions and deceptions are substituted for actuality. That is the author's story.<br /><br />It all seems so innocent, normal, and decent in this small town: teenage girls giggling, awakening to their attractiveness, and having crushes on teachers or coaches; high school football players with a swagger of invincibility, picking the prettiest girls; the town fathers maintaining community order and morality, rooting out deviance and deviants; and the legal system providing official enforcement of community standards. On the other hand, where does a handsome, young teacher, accused of predatory behavior, turn in the face of unexamined assumptions of community goodness? Where does a teen-age girl turn when \\"selected\\" by the football stars against her will as an object for gratification? How does anyone who is \\"different\\" withstand the morality police, rumors, and vigilantism? Are the most self-righteous hiding the worst of transgressions? If truth cannot be discovered in a court of law, is it forever lost?<br /><br />The book is an interesting look at the consequences of illusions, deceptions, and morality held to excess. Unfortunately, the characters are not as compelling. They remain somewhat distant and in some cases are exasperatingly inconsistent. Basically the book is a good, it not disturbing, story.	2005-03-14
US	52280224	R2DYYVG0TB0900	0520235657	725684223	Reorganizing the Rust Belt: An Inside Study of the American Labor Movement	Books	4	5	8	N	Y	The realities of social movement unionism	The unenthusiastic accommodation reached after WWII between employers and labor unions began to be shredded in the late 1970s as employers took advantage of the weak labor laws of the US to de-unionize and defeat new organizing efforts. Anti-unionism now permeates the corporate world with devastating effects on unions. Labor theorists and academics, unions, and union members have absolutely been at their wits' end in coming to grips with the siege on labor and in devising strategies to resist employer onslaughts. _Reorganizing the Rust Belt_ is one man's attempt to do just that. In a research project, the author, a graduate student of sociology, is permitted to become an organizing intern on the staff of Local \\"A\\" (not the real name) of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), generally operating in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, to assist and report on efforts to organize a nursing home. Choosing the SEIU to follow is highly pertinent because the service sector now dominates the US economy and the SEIU is virtually the only union that has substantially gained membership in an era of precipitous union density decline.<br /><br />Large elements of the labor movement are now proponents of \\"social movement\\" unionism. It is a rather fluid concept but it has at its core the mobilization of rank-and-file workers. The importance of union staffers is supposedly reduced as workers constitute the organizing committee, orchestrate face-to-face home visits, and conduct any number of workplace solidarity enhancing exercises like tee-shirt days, leafleting, petitioning the boss, etc. Another element of the \\"social\\" approach is drawing upon community interests and resources to enhance labor's position. In one case described by the author, an attempt to privatize a cluster of nursing homes was seen by the community as potentially threatening to elderly residents due to the clear implications of reduced services. A coalition involving the union and progressive and religious groups in the community defeated the proposal, but the self interest of the union was a secondary factor to those community activists. A contract campaign later conducted by the union did not resonate with the community, though it was successful largely because of the earlier rebuke of the county officials. In the more general case, the dispersion of workers' homes from the vicinity of a firm would make community support problematic; where is the commonality? The author did not stress that forming labor-community coalitions is difficult and usually involves special circumstances.<br /><br />Though the author is a staunch advocate of social movement unionism, his analysis clearly shows that so-called business unionism is well entrenched. Labor unions have been sold for decades to workers as providing bargaining and contract enforcement services. Union staff people, perhaps assisted by member stewards, are expected to perform the work. If unions are not successful in providing those services, or even worse, unionized factories are shutdown, members or potential members are inclined to place blame on the unions. The author repeatedly encountered disenchantment with unions on the organizing drive.<br /><br />A contradictory fact is that social movement unionism requires more staff, not less. Rank-and-file mobilization does not just spontaneously occur. Union staff or paid member organizers have to carefully nurture an activist workplace mentality. And that is costly to unions. An earlier unsuccessful attempt to organize the author's nursing home was attempted through the less staff intensive methods of mass mailings and sparsely attended union meetings. Union staffers are often disinclined to get involved in worker motivation preferring to provide the services for which they are obligated. In addition, activist workers can often undermine the more limited, but predictable, power base of union officials. Costs and the concerns of staffers and officials will continue topart of the union dynamic, stated or otherwise.<br /><br />The author is concerned with not only the sustainability of worker mobilization from a psychological standpoint, but also whether unions even know how use worker activism beyond organizing or contract campaigns. He finally seems to be content with the notion that workers once mobilized can be ramped up again when needed. It is an irony that a key component of business unionism, servicing the contract, remains most important once mobilization has passed.<br /><br />Is the successful nursing home campaign applicable to other sectors of the economy? Clearly, the author's experiences demonstrate that the general public is concerned with conditions in nursing homes for both residents and employees, but working conditions for Wal-Mart workers seem to be of minimal interest. In addition, closing a nursing home to avoid a union would tend to be less tolerated than shuttering a retail establishment. Despite the difficulties, organizing a nursing home is one of the more favorable situations that exist in today's economy.<br /><br />The author does not really probe the SEIU version of worker mobilization in terms of its limitations and what it could be. Achieving enough solidarity to vote for a union is commendable, but hardly exhausts worker solidarity or empowerment. A vote for union representation will not change the fact that workers have no say in a business beyond wages and some aspects of working conditions. It was not that many decades ago that US workers were concerned with actual worker control in workplaces. Even now the codetermination found in European workplaces gives workers more real voice in workplace decisions than do contracts that largely seek to constrain workers. Worker input is definitely not tolerated.<br /><br />The author makes much of his findings that movements are defined by what they must overcome as opposed to the view that movements take advantage of existing conditions. The point seems rather minor as the campaign on which the author worked had both situations. The book is sad commentary on the status of working Americans. So much effort must be made to simply achieve a place at a bargaining table where decisions that have long-term consequences for workers cannot even be discussed. Corporations, if they must, will make that trade every day: a few cents an hour in exchange for nearly complete control of the business and its profits.inue to part of the union dynamic, stated or otherwise. <br /> <br />The author is concerned with not only the sustainability of worker mobilization from a psychological standpoint, but also whether unions even know how use worker activism beyond organizing or contract campaigns.

When Jordan Glass, a photographer known for seeking dangerous assignments, finds the lifeless form of her missing twin sister depicted in one of the paintings that are part of an exhibit of \\"sleeping women\\" in Hong Kong, little does she know that she is about to embark on a perilous journey searching for the connection between one or more artists and a series of kidnappings of women in New Orleans, including her sister.<br /><br />Having been stonewalled by law enforcement personnel when her sister first disappeared, Jordan insists on being an integral part of an intensified investigation now conducted by the FBI. Through her eyes, the reader is treated to an inside look at FBI processes, including psychological profiling and the identification and questioning of suspects.<br /><br />The characters are well sketched, including the suspects. The peculiarities of the art world and the predilections of its inhabitants is well explored. The dialogue can drag a bit, but not to the point of distraction. Jordan is a compelling character with the edge taken off her tough-girl routine just enough in her relations with FBI agent John Kaiser. The book does generally have a good pace with the ending flowing well from what has transpired. This book shows why Isles is regarded as one of the better writers in this genre.	2005-03-02

He has ended up there after his job as a cop in Los Angeles, alcohol, and his ex-wife have forced him to redirect his life. Parker's Stone is an appealing character. He takes it one day at time, is a man of principle, and takes his new job seriously.<br /><br />It is Stone's calmness and instincts as a cop that serve him well in investigating a series of seemingly linked killings in Paradise - something new in this small town. Though the strong, silent type, his sensitivity is evident in his handling of a sexual assault case in the local high school.<br /><br />Stone has managed to get his alcohol abuse under control, but his ex-wife Jenn, a local TV personality, continues to bedevil him. He simply cannot move on without her, and this is despite his obvious appeal to other attractive and smart women.<br /><br />The character of Jesse Stone is the reason to read this book, though it is mildly disappointing that the author really gives us little of his background. In addition the perpetrators of the murdering spree remain mostly a puzzle. How did they get to this point? Basically the book is a quick and enjoyable read.	2005-02-26

After a one-time luncheon outing to the country-club - only taken because Leigh, the status challenged one, is old enough to drive - the girls come upon a traffic accident, where a boy who they all knew from their school has died. The stage is set; where is the author going with all of this. Unfortunately, mostly nowhere.<br /><br />The author follows the girls for fifteen years, rotating among them with separate chapters. The two well-to-do girls float through life: Chandler eventually becomes a lawyer, but quickly abandons that venture, and Sarah maintains the illusion of being a budding actress. Their romantic interests are both brief and unsatisfactory. Both live on their families' resources. Leigh is stuck in dead-end jobs, eventually becoming an assistant manager in a gourmet food store, and appears to be set to duplicate her mother's unhappy existence by marrying a wanna-be, no-talent rocker. Only one of the girls is able to get off the treadmill to nowhere, and that seems contrived.<br /><br />The author does throw one monkey-wrench into Chandler's life, but even that hardly rescues the book from terminal blandness. The traffic accident from their high school days disappeared immediately as any kind of stimulatory event. The reader is treated to endless descriptions of hair: wet, dry, blonde, etc; alcohol and food consumed, and states of dress: none, nightwear,  appropriate, etc. Some say this is not Chick Lit - wrong, it is, but only if vacuous books fall into that category. As for those who cannot be trusted if some chapters do not move to tears: there are many who are going to have to make appointments due to being emotionally challenged.	2005-02-25

He contends that it is cooperation, or non-zero sumness, among entities, be they cells, humans, or societies, that leads to advancement and survival. He downplays the success of pure competition as a means of long-term survival.<br /><br />But it is the increased complexity of organisms and societies that results from cooperation that favors them in the natural selection process. Contrary to some reviewers, the author's descriptions of the advancement of simple one-cell organisms to complex one-cell organisms and on to multi-cellular globs over a span of a couple of billion years seem to comport well with his basic idea.<br /><br />Most of the book is devoted to the advancement of human societies at the levels of hunting-gathering tribes, Big-Man societies, chiefdoms, and states. The author's arguments are far more persuasive when discussing elementary societies. The pooling of resources, often resulting in technological advances especially in areas that facilitate information flows, among disparate groups has often lead to the survival of the newly formed, larger group. At the level of primitive societies, it seems that these small social advancements are rewarded by a natural selection process similar to the one picking winners and losers among simple organisms.<br /><br />What is most worrisome about this book is whether processes that operated over billions of years, or hundreds of thousands of years concerning hominid societies, often in very halting manner, can be applied to cultural evolution over the last two thousand years. The last time that natural selection was a factor among human societies was in the extermination of the Neanderthals by more adapted Africans. Can one really view the raids of northern European barbarians or the Mongol hordes as examples of non-zero sumness. But then the author tends to see advance in most collapses or subjugations of societies.<br /><br />The author is of a mind that the tremendous advances in communication and transportation technologies and  the huge rise in global commerce with its attendant supra-national controlling bodies in the modern era are the height of  non-zero sumness. He little notes very real concerns. Technologically based cultures have severely stressed the environment with matters worsening every day. Where is the concern for the propagandistic potential and realities in communications, often passively enjoyed. Globalization, as well as national economies, is basically being driven by essentially criminal conspiracies, often referred to as corporations. The author takes little notice of a global elite that drives commerce and governments with token concern for most of mankind. Our vast technological and cultural advances seem to contain destructive aspects that may well threaten our  survival.<br /><br />In the last chapters, the author is given to speculation as to whether one can find evidence of divinity, or at least some kind of higher purpose, in the growth of complexity that he has described. He does not address whether complexity equals human-centered progress in these modern times. Humans drive cultural changes now; drawn-out, obscure natural selection no longer is the primary means for change. Natural selection may be harsh, but it has worked somewhat consistently. Human selection may be far worse, even ultimately self-destructive. The author needed to address that real possibility instead of trying to find divinity in the WTO and the World Wide Web.non-zero sumness.

(2.5 *s)	Not being a steady follower of the author is a huge disadvantage in trying to grasp his ideas concerning a transcendent explanation of human societies. Time and again the author refers to his previous works in lieu of further explanation. Secondly,  it seems like his promise for a theory of everything gets lost in his extremely complicated descriptions that supposedly lead to his higher-order integral visions. There are layers and layers of classifications and hierarchies of individuals and societies that overlap in complex fashion. While somewhat outside the basic purpose of the book and difficult to follow, those classifications are used to good purpose in offering historical understandings of the orientations and actions of societies and nations.<br /><br />The weakest part of the book is the author's failure to put forth a strong transcendent theory to which human societies should aspire. For the most part, there is not much of an attempt. The higher-order layers of soul and spirit in what he calls the \\"Great Holarchy\\" are barely touched upon. These layers supposedly coincide with what he calls a second-tier meme, which in turn is a world centric and post conventional orientation. The pieces of the theory are displayed in rather complex fashion, but there is no real closure on his ideas. For the uninitiated, the book is complicated enough to require flowcharting. This book is a good example of an author not being able to place himself in the shoes of the reader trying to understand.	2005-02-11

The author proposes a seven week program, called base camp training,  to get ready for a week of thought exercises, which she refers to as a sabbatical. The weekly themes include such subjects as getting a good night's sleep and relaxing, organizing personal finances, optimization of health and exercise, simplification of one's life, and letting go negativities and increasing love in one's life. Common to all of the weeks is a back to nature recommendation: taking walks on nature trails, watching sunrises and sunsets, etc. The trainee is even advised to take a refreshing shower every morning as well as bubble baths.<br /><br />All of this preparation is for taking a week-long trip to a quiet spot to complete any number of thought and writing exercises to determine who one is and where he or she should or wants to go with their life. It is a \\"journey of self-discovery.\\" One is supposed to get in touch with personal goals, talents, motivations, likes and dislikes, and values. At the end, a plan of action is required.<br /><br />The book is pretty basic. It is a comfort book with a definite slant toward women. Like most books of this genre, it is very short on practicalities. It is one thing to understand one's self, but it is an entirely different matter to translate that into gainful employment. And then there are issues of finances and age, to name two. If one has never read a book like this, it may be helpful. But otherwise, don't expect any unique insights.	2005-02-11

It is far more likely to find a book that makes utterly simplistic assumptions about these matters and basically puts it on the back of each individual to overcome the dysfunctionality found in many of our primary institutions. And this is such a book.<br /><br />No - people do not work long and hard at their jobs because they are workaholics, need imposed structure, are non-creative, are afraid to lead balanced lives, and insist on living an extravagant lifestyle, as the author claims. Perhaps the most ridiculous contention of the author is that due to the willingness of boomers to be workaholics, employers can downsize their workforces - no mention of coercion, no lack of employee empowerment to set limits. For the author, the inability of someone to accept being laid off for its potential for individual growth is a sign of lack of character. He gives glowing accounts of several non-workers living on six thousand dollars a year - of course, where that money comes from is not detailed. Perhaps the author, a Canadian, is unaware that an American family could not so much as purchase health insurance for that sum. Should one forget about food, housing, transportation, clothes, etc? He fails to come clean on his target audience. At times he seems to be talking mostly to vagabonds, not families. Maybe we should all pedal around New Zealand on our bicycles for six months and live on the dividends and interest from our portfolios of stocks and bonds that he does not mention or on the proceeds of lousy books. Or, in another case, become a singer on a street corner.<br /><br />Find out who you are - what is your essence. Do what you really want to do. That all sounds good. If you can't do that, the author lists 300 things to do, most of which are so utterly trite as to be silly. Virtually none of them would result in any kind of payment. Too bad we all can't have jobs that give great independence and self-satisfaction. Most of us need our jobs that are not some kind of ultimate experience. That does not mean that we are workaholics, are incapable of leading balanced lives, and insist on being extravagant. And yes, for us multi-dimensional people, the loss of a job is life destabilizing, if not threatening. And that has nothing to do with character flaws. But then the author would contend that those in that boat should have been preparing for their new idealistic career presumably using all of that free time, extra wages, and insight.<br /><br />The principal advice of the author to be fully engaged in what you do, whether that is inside the workplace or outside of it, is not bogus, if given in the context of realities. It is not necessary to chide people for their insecurities - there is a basis for them. The workplace does not have to a bastion of power, even of tyranny, where arbitrary acts against employees are the prerogative of management. The European system of works councils and a realistic safety net is empowering to employees. It prevents the most egregious forms of scrap heaping that American employers insist upon.<br /><br />I doubt if this author is capable of writing the kind of book that needs to be written. It is obvious that he feels immensely happy with having escaped from the system in some sense. He does not recognize his unique position, or sheer luck and the impossibility, in the current political and legal climate, of most people being able to follow in his footsteps. The author even invokes Tolle's \\"Power of Now\\" to suggest that most of us worry too much about our stultifying lives and should become present-oriented in our new harmonious situations.

These villages are the bases of rich, busy, and stable lives, but it is the restlessness and misfit that exists just below the façade of tranquility that interests Updike. In many ways, according to the author, villages are female-centric: the wives preserve the apparent order, but are not disinclined, and have the strength, to engage in risky, though satisfying, extra-marital behavior.<br /><br />It is through the life of Owen Mackenzie that these villages are explored. Now at age 70 with his second wife Julia of twenty-five years, Owen reflects on both his childhood and his life in Middle Falls, Conn, where he enjoyed professional success in a computer business and, more importantly to him, tried to fill a void in his life by engaging in lengthy clandestine affairs with several of the women in his community. However, given Owen's naivet&eacute; and deprived childhood, it is somewhat puzzling that he managed to graduate from MIT, where he pursued Phyllis, an aloof brilliant math student, whom he married upon graduation.<br /><br />The commentary on Mackenzie's world often is rambling, veering beyond informative - the reader must sift through the wordiness to find the core observations. Many may not find Owen to be a particularly compelling character; one can wonder about his ability, and even motivation, to navigate his various trysts given his perpetual detachment and clumsiness. Disappointingly, Owen's shift to a more chastened life with Julia receives little attention. The book does have its interest - there are gems of insight - yet one is left with a feeling that Mackenzie's world has long since been bypassed.	2005-02-07

Both of the families have suffered through varying crises, but that incident from years before takes on new and dramatic significance in this most sentimental of books.<br /><br />When Jane Porter finally decided to take a sabbatical from her bakery in NYC and return to her childhood home to deal with her traumatic loss from years before, little did she realize that her path of discovery would be so intertwined with Dylan Chadwick, who has been in mourning for many years after having lost his wife and daughter in a shootout on the streets of NYC. But it is Dylan's niece Chloe, a sensitive fifteen year old, who loves nature, is a bit of an animal rights activist, and has a magnetism that defies her years, who becomes the healing force for both Jane and Dylan.<br /><br />Rice's books are not without their troubles. They are full of weepy, anguished moments. Not only do her characters over emote, but also the author can't let the dialog stand on its own. She is constantly compelled to add her own emotion-based spin on what has just occurred. The reader can easily feel that his or her heart is being gratuitously tugged at. An unexpected incident involving the pure Chloe with a bad boy is a guaranteed tearjerker.<br /><br />Yet, despite all of the emotion - grief and anxiety being most common - her good-natured characters seem to find happiness at the end. Flawed characters, facing predictable failure, are not part of her repertoire. Former US marshall Dylan aggressively confronting some teen-age trespassers with a loaded shotgun is not a sign, in the author's depiction, of perhaps some deeper problems.<br /><br />Rice is obviously appealing to a certain audience. For them, her predilection for making precocious children - wise beyond their years - the centerpiece of her stories is a surefire device. Her books are basically a pleasant, though maudlin read. Reading a couple of those a year might not be such a bad idea.stories is a surefire device. Her books are basically a pleasant, though maudlin read.

And then there are differences concerning where one lives, habits, tastes, dress, speech, recreation, beliefs, etc. The author contends that these differences work to segment American society into identifiable classes, ranging from upper classes, a middle-class, and several layers of proletariat or lower classes. American is not the classless society that our myths suggest.<br /><br />There is a real basis for being pegged at a certain level of class. One does not simply self-select class level; inter-class change is difficult and fairly rare. The hardball nature of class divisions is readily seen in the economic power asserted by the upper classes in employing or managing the lesser classes that preserves extant class distinctions. The middle-class, perhaps the largest of the classes, suffers, by far, the most anxiety from their class standing, in terms of both preserving their standing and adopting behaviors that emulate the upper middle-class, which hopefully will permit some degree of entry. The critique of the middle-class is often devastating as the author notes purchasing decisions, educational choices, and speech patterns, etc, designed to enhance status that invariably fall flat, even looking ludicrous at times. The lower classes are no less ridiculed, but they are more comfortable with their culture. Ironically, they often have more economic independence than does the middle-class.<br /><br />To demonstrate the disconnect across classes, the author presents the scenario where a middle-class person congratulates a college professor on being a \\"famous educator.\\" The fact that a professor considers himself an intellectual and not an employee, as educators most certainly are, never enters the mind of the person attempting to bestow praise. The professor is offended, not honored by the comparison. That is one small example of the cultural class-divides of which the author speaks.<br /><br />The author suggests that the society is generally becoming more proletarianized, as mass culture is aimed at the lowest common denominator. Though written over twenty years ago, perhaps the term Wal-martized is what the author is after. The ramifications of that are unclear.<br /><br />The author backtracks from his placement of everyone in a class by suggesting that \\"category X\\" people have come to the fore that resist categorization into the class framework. They are generally urban, independent, self-assertive, often self-employed, well-read, dismissive of popular culture, and free of status anxiety. They are remindful of the \\"cultural creatives,\\" a group detected in recent years by some sociologists. It may be debatable as to whether \\"X\\" people deserve special consideration. After all, all class members partake and reject parts of the broader culture, exhibiting some \\"X\\" characteristics. Furthermore, power realities do not just disappear. An \\"X\\" writer must still deal with powerful corporations that are not reluctant to assert class power.<br /><br />The basic message of the book is not diminished despite its publication over twenty years ago and the change of some minor cultural details. Recent developments, such as the ubiquity of cell-phones and CD/DVD players and the rise of the hip-hop/rap culture, would hardly undermine the author's ideas; in fact, they would corroborate them. The reality and confusion of class are easily seen in the presidential election of 2004. A class (the lower classes) was organized (propagandized) to reject the candidate of part of the upper middle class (liberal elites) based on so-called elitist cultural habits. The full dimension of that class divide was carefully not discussed; it should have been. And that is a weakness of the book: the politics of class is not discussed.ison.

And to add to Bobby's distress at having to kill another man, he is immediately attacked by Jimmy's father, Judge James Gagnon, a powerful Boston personage, for acting rashly and caving in to the manipulations of Catherine.<br /><br />But what is it about the past of Bobby, Catherine, and Jimmy, and even the Judge, that has led to this point? Lisa Gardner expertly combines the unfolding of traumatic disturbances in their lives with rapid fire developments in the present. Given her history, could Catherine, one with elegant, fragile beauty, orchestrate her own husband's death? Maybe Bobby knew more about the Gagnon's then he is telling - are his actions completely innocent? Why is the Judge's and his wife's past shrouded in mystery?<br /><br />This is Lisa Gardner's best book, and most of her previous books were quite good. The plot is great and it moves. Yet the characters get the right amount of attention. And there are some nice twists. This latest effort by Gardner will disappoint few.	2005-01-27
US	52280224	R3UUPV4C5LM4B2	1582344256	878087683	Why Read?	Books	3	16	20	N	Y	Insightful, yet ultimately a disappointing critique	\\"Why Read?\\" is a further elucidation of a student's (or anyone's for that matter) journey to self-knowledge and understanding of the world that the author began in \\"Teacher,\\" an auto-biographical account of high-schoolers in a working class environment being given the opportunity to expand their horizons through the encouragement of an unconventional teacher. In the present case, the author has moved to the college classroom where literary classics are ideally read for their potential of answering such questions as: \\"Who Am I?\\" or \\"What Is Life?\\" There is the implication that the student at the college level feels a need to move beyond conventional socialization. This all seems to be standard practice - why write a book?<br /><br />The author is more than a little concerned that the university has essentially adopted the values and the modus operandi of the broader consumer and entertainment society. A certain superficiality has engulfed our society. Being \\"hip\\" and \\"cool,\\" that is projecting an image, must be the foremost stance taken in life, which excludes both passion and doubt. Multifarious information, often obtained via the Internet, displaces wisdom. That is what students expect within the university. Future technocrats and businessmen need an instrumental, factual education, not a \\"useless\\" wholesale examination of values. That entire orientation is to be contrasted with the author's view that \\"the function of a liberal arts education is to use major works of art and intellect to influence one's Final Narrative, ..., the ultimate set of terms that we use to confer value on experience.\\" The self-doubt and introspection crucial to developing a Final Narrative is outside the boundaries of ubiquitous casualness.<br /><br />Beyond disinterest in the classics, in criticism directed more towards the humanities professorate, there is the additional concern that literary works are being interpreted with a political agenda, which distorts the original authors' intents and, furthermore, interferes with the educational value of the works. For example, Dickens' novels concerning the horrid social conditions in early industrial England are used in hegemonic critiques not intended by Dickens. Nonetheless, the chiding of those advancing a Foucaultian \\"normalization and control\\" of society agenda by grafting such analyses onto literary works, comes across as more than a little disingenuous given the author's overall views.<br /><br />\\"Democracy and democratic humanism\\" - those are the components of the author's \\"religion.\\" He invites us to \\"imagine a nation, a world, where people have fuller self-knowledge, fuller self-determination, where self-making is a primary objective not just in the material sphere but in the circles of the mind and heart. We humanities teachers can help create such a world.\\" There is no disagreement with the nobility of the goal here, but where is the reconciliation with the realities of a superficial, consumer ethos and Foucaultian control. In a world of artificiality, how does a student become aware of a need for self-discovery? How can a student possibly know whether such a search is possible in an institution without the assumption that awareness has already been obtained? And then there is the very real possibility of such an enlightened student wrecking on the realities outside the university. We can't all have the safe haven of college tenure to widely explore and espouse eternal truths. At one point the author recognizes that seeking truth is a subversive endeavor. But there seems to be little appreciation for the consequences.<br /><br />The author disclaims that his approach is one of personal therapy. Yet it does seem to be very much one of personal growth and personal interpretation of the classics. He especially advocates the reading of poetry as being foremost in finding personal truth, which in the view of many is a particularly subjective endeavor. Literature comes before history in his view. Presumably that same ordering applies to any body of knowledge. He seems to require that a work engenders an emotional response, that the work of art can be lived, for it to be considered essential for self-discovery. He specifically discounts works that merely \\"teach us something about the larger world.\\" This is a most curious position. Broad, historical understanding of political, economic, and social systems would seem to enhance anyone's pursuit of trying to define a life to live. Constructing a personal reality based on the personal interpretation of literary works, devoid of significant context, seems to merely self-indulging, with little to do with attaining intellectual heights.<br /><br />\\"Why Read?\\" is thought-provoking, but puzzles because of the author's unwillingness to complete his analysis. It is clear that the author understands much: the culture is dumbed-down; the university system makes little effort to advance the growth and wisdom of attendees; a business mentality permeates our society; democracy, humanistic or otherwise, is a tenuous project in our society; and tremendous risks are incurred if one confronts this hegemonic situation.<br /><br />What is to be inferred here? Does the author accept the fact that substantial wealth is a legitimate litmus test in allowing attendance at his employing university, which ultimately will amount to little more than gaining a credential to enter the business world at an elevated position? Where is the call for reform? Where is the political critique? Is he genuinely interested in democratic empowerment?<br /><br />The book is ultimately just not that satisfying because even though the author is well aware of the landscape, he doesn't seem to be going anywhere with his understanding. What a waste.resumably that same ordering applies to any body of knowledge.

The story resumes twenty-seven years later with the girls having inevitably lost contact many years before.<br /><br />Now the focus is on trying to recapture some part of those idyllic days as the author reunites most of those characters, but only after life's realities have taken their toll. Conveniently, an inter-family marriage, not at first revealed, provides the basis for the return to the same beaches. But the real driving force in overcoming the gulf of many years of separation is the rather worldly nine-year-old daughter, Nell, of one of the beach girls. Time and again the young girl provides the push to get the old friends to take the next step in renewal and even growth.<br /><br />The story is a bit sugary with a good bit of tugging-at-the heart scenes. There really are no villains - just people hesitant and unsure about relationships. The tale is not without some questions. For one, one of the beach girls takes a tangential turn in her life that is not well understood. The author's desire to have matters turn out well seems to drive a somewhat improbable connecting of a technocrat (sorry, no more details) to one of the beach girls, turned earth mother. But on the beach, all is possible. The characters are the focus of the book, but one could have hoped for slightly more in-depth portrayals.	2005-01-24

Madison was small in stature, somewhat sickly, and not particularly socially adept. He preferred to make his influence felt by operating in the background of legislative halls. His inability to judge and lead men was part of the reason that his presidency reeked of ineptitude.<br /><br />The author shows Madison at his intellectual best in his advocacy of the separation of church and state and his profound work in orchestrating the Constitutional Convention and the construction of the document. But it is rather evident that Madison exhibited ideological tendencies in addition to his studied rationality. He shifted rather dramatically from extolling a strong central state with the ability to veto state legislation to the republican position of Jefferson in the span of a few years. While president his Anti-Federalist and anti-British biases constantly led him down the wrong path. His convoluted dealings with Britain and France, his fascination with embargos, and his inability to select competent Cabinet officers and emissaries led unnecessarily to the War of 1812. His policies regarding the raising of an army, the selection of generals, the use of naval power, the financing of the war effort, and an obsession with invading Canada could have easily led to Britain defeating the US.<br /><br />Despite the obvious shortcomings of Madison's presidency, the author is inclined to rate Madison rather highly as a leading figure of the Revolution. But there are chinks in that belief. The document that Madison receives most credit for has had problems. The Constitution in many ways rolled back the republicanism of the Revolution. It's potential for maintaining gridlock is unmistakable. The ability of elites of one persuasion or the other to dominate government has been evident since 1789.<br /><br />The book is brief. There is no coverage of the lead up to Madison being elected president in 1808. One wonders why he even took that step. He was not the right man for the job. Perhaps the brevity of the book does not give a sufficiently balanced presentation to appreciate Madison. Many readers will wonder how we survived Madison's presidency. It makes one think of the current presidency in terms of its choices of personnel, policies, agendas, and ideological tendencies.ince 1789.  <br /> <br />The book is brief.

A Leap in the Dark is an excellent exposition of the efforts, difficulties, conflicting interests, and justifications that were factors in the various colonies moving away from the protection of the mother state and achieving a stable, although somewhat fortunate, political presence. The leading figures (and some lesser figures) of the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary era are seen having to deal with highly complex and divisive issues.<br /><br />A lot of ground is covered in this book. The book opens with Benjamin Franklin, as an attendee of a multi-colonial conference in the mid 1750s, proposing that the colonies form a national body primarily for defense against the French and Indians. But the various colonies were far too protective of their quasi-independent standing to seriously pursue unity, not to mention the uneasiness of England in such a proposal. It took a series of incredibly heavy-handed edicts initiated by Parliament and British ministers from 1764-74 to create a sense of unity and common resolve among the colonists that countered their vast geographical and informational separation. But unanimity against the British hardly existed.<br /><br />A constant theme in the book is the interplay of conservative, elitist, and aristocratic interests versus those more popular and democratic - that is republican. That divide also was part and parcel of the interplay of rural and urban interests; farming, artisanal, and mercantile interests; the interests of northern, middle Atlantic, and southern colonies; etc. It was no small feat to gain sufficient support to realistically declare independence; predictably new problems emerged. The newly emergent United States had to contend with an ineffectual national structure (the Articles of Confederation); inadequate funding of the war effort coupled with rampant inflation; and a series of military blunders - which taken together could have easily lost the war for the US.<br /><br />The more conservative of the founders recognized the precarious position of the United States in the world community after signing a peace accord with Great Britain and pushed for a constitutional convention. The same differences and perspectives existed as before, but now the conservatives had the upper hand. The author clearly sees the US Constitution as a triumph for conservatives by the creation of a document that clearly was structured to check republican reform. The contentious ratification of the Constitution was a mere harbinger of what was to come in the next twelve years. During the presidencies of Washington and Adams, foreign affairs and the potential for alignment or warfare with Britain or France exacerbated existing differences and led to the more formal formation of the Federalist and Republican political parties. The American Revolution seemed to get off track with the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 at the behest of Hamilton and his supporters. But that zeal to restrict hard-fought freedoms is seemingly turned around as the author closes with the ascendancy of the republican forces, that is, Thomas Jefferson, to the presidency.<br /><br />No one book can capture the complexity of the American Revolution. By necessity this book excludes at least some of the events and facts of that period. The author is far more concerned with capturing the thinking, contradictions, and the power of the different interests to propel their vision in that era. To cover such a complex thirty-five year period is an ambitious undertaking and is about as successful as could be expected.

As it turns out, with certainly some innate ability and a lot of luck, mostly in the form of a somewhat eccentric new teacher, Frank Lears, newly graduated from Harvard, who managed to get a small class of high school seniors to start thinking about issues of the day and broader subjects, it is possible. The book is not about the pedagogical techniques of Lears. It is far more a commentary on working class life and its obstacles to learning.<br /><br />Working class life for the author and his contemporaries was nothing short of wandering in a wilderness of ignorance and self-destructive behavior. School was seen as little more than a place to avoid learning and to disrupt if possible. The arena of football was a place to prove manhood, which also extended into the larger world. Aspirations were not to know \\"something,\\" but to know \\"someone\\" to get ahead. Television was the by far the most pervasive cultural influence in working class homes. Parental authority and wisdom were not to be challenged. Actually, street smarts were far more important to acquire to function in communities, not to mention navigate such tensions as those racial.<br /><br />Frank Lears arrived in the tumult of the late 1960s at the author's working class high school. But the new teacher, generally dressed in too-large suits with a paper clip on his lapel, was not there to dispense great amounts of wisdom to the unwashed. His method was Socratic, that is probing and questioning. Getting kids to think independently was unheard of in those kinds of schools, and there is probably more lip-service paid to that goal, even in contemporary times, than is actually practiced. Lears endured considerable resistance from the students, but was patient enough and made enough efforts to eventually have an impact.<br /><br />The author is at great pains to emphasize the profound changes that occur in becoming a thinker and an independent obtainer of knowledge. He essentially lost contact with his adolescent community, including his family. Lears is an obscure figure in the book. Little was known about him when he came to teach. As far as his current status, the reader learns only that he left teaching after one year and moved to a small town as a lawyer. Similarly, little is told of the author's classmates. What was the impact of Lears on them? We can only guess. Despite any gaps in following up, the book is really a wonderful story in exploring how an improbable shift in intellectual orientation can occur in a culture that almost completely devalues an empowered, thinking individual. As far as the negative reviewers - Yes, there is some professorial showmanship that perhaps could have been avoided. The author is profoundly aware that Lears changed his life and that is well told. The author's tale expresses well the obstacles that Lear faced.an impact. <br /> <br />The author is at great pains to emphasize the profound changes that occur in becoming a thinker and an independent obtainer of knowledge.

If you loathe yourself or your other self, as the author claims to have at one time, then try living solely in the joyous Present, or Now, devoid of connections to the past or future. And that means turning off the analytical mind and avoiding virtually all emotions, which arise due to misguided thinking. When the author had his epiphany concerning the Now, he sat around on park benches for two years contemplating the grandeur of trees, and such. How nice for him, but probably not believable.<br /><br />The entire book gives new meaning to the \\"ignorance is bliss\\" maxim. There is no profundity in stating repeatedly that actions and thoughts occur in the present. What is utterly simplistic is to dismiss their context and ramifications. The idea that people will develop fears or anxieties in contemplating the past or imaging the future is exaggerated. Growing up does involve learning to cope with those realities. Suggesting the blissful acceptance of \\"what is\\" seems no more than happy ignorance.<br /><br />The author makes no effort to explain the basis of his depiction of people having a true self and a discordant self that thinks and emotes. He proposes that the true self \\"watch\\" the thinking self and thereby transcend that limiting behavior. One wonders if any thought is involved in the watching. It all seems like trite psychobabble or Freudian distortion. Though two hundred pages long, the book endlessly repeats its nonsensical contentions and could easily be reduced to no more than ten pages.<br /><br />The author finds much of society dysfunctional. He might get no argument there. It's hard to see those withdrawn to an inner, true self, contemplating pure \\"Being\\" doing much about it. Thankfully many understand that society is a work in progress that requires much effort and thought in dealing with realities and that is very messy.<br /><br />This is an easy-way-out book. Operating in a state of delusional nirvana is self-centered, fairy-tale stuff. We should be talking about getting smarter, citizen empowerment, ecological sustainability, reining in corporations, and the like. Living in the escapist Now/Me world is just pathetic.perating in a state of delusional nirvana is self-centered, fairy-tale stuff.

The approach of this book, like many, is to describe the format of the various layers of the DoD or OSI network models. The author uses the output of a network sniffer to illustrate some of the protocols at the various levels. It is a plus of this book that more detail is given for some of the protocols than is normally seen in this level of book.<br /><br />Not all of the protocols are described as well as others. For example, the section on the ICMP protocol is really botched by sniffer frames of ARP being shown. That is an inexplicable mistake by the publisher. Twenty percent of the book is devoted to routing and it does get tedious. The section on HTTP is not done well.<br /><br />But details of protocols is a small part of the network story. What is missing is the glue that holds it all together. What processes or services on the various computers are servicing these protocols? How are they triggered? What is the flow among the layers and protocols for, say, running an E-Mail client. The reader is pretty much left in the dark on that question. It does seem that the author has taken several of the Internet Authority's RFC's (Requests for Comment), standards for the Internet, and put them in readable form, which is why the book has a disconnected feel. All in all, the book adds to information about networking with the TCP/IP suite. The four-star rating is probably generous. It does seem that many books are needed to grasp this subject. And writing software has not even been mentioned.	2004-12-28

That seems innocuous enough, but the author clearly shows that corporations go far beyond that narrow focus by now dominating our social, economic, and political affairs, not just as business entities, but as legal persons with all the rights of genuine people. Their immense resources permit them to overwhelm average citizens in all of the realms in which they are active, advancing their agendas, but perhaps most notably in the political process. They are the main force behind the developments of globalization, immigration, out-sourcing, privatization, and de-regulation that have largely eliminated checks on their relentless pursuit of profits, despite the consequences, or \\"externalities,\\" to the general population. The author contends that such a devotion to self-interest, to the exclusion of impacts on others, would be regarded as pathological in normal people.<br /><br />Of course, corporations are not unaware that they need to soften their image as being beyond control. They devote considerable resources to public relations, \\"branding,\\" and charity - to the convincing of being socially responsible. But the author points out that the charity comes as a cost to taxpayers and is an undemocratic determination of whom should benefit. Furthermore, the charity can be withdrawn on a whim. The drive for profits will always trump greater social concerns.<br /><br />Substantial inequality of resources and power do not bode well for democracies. It is clear that the modern trans-national corporation undermines the influence of average citizens. As late as the mid-nineteenth century, corporations were chartered for specific public tasks with the charters subject to renewal or revocation. Now corporations view themselves as \\"partners\\" with the state, not subservient.<br /><br />The author debunks the idea that market forces can reign in corporations. In the first place, wealth has the upper-hand in markets, which violates the one man, one vote basis of democracy. Secondly, the ability of random citizens to acquire enough information and to then act in concert to regulate corporations is a chimera.<br /><br />The Corporation is a succinct discussion of the fiction that corporations are somehow persons, entitled to be regarded as the equal all citizens. The author, as a legal scholar, seems to be concerned that corporations, by charter, cannot be socially responsible, as are normal people, and any such behavior is only a means to the end of increasing profits. But even a perfect track record of doing good cannot eliminate the fact that corporations are internally tyrannies, through and through. Citizen empowerment should begin within companies and then proceed to overall societal control.orations.

Kimberly Quincy, daughter of legendary FBI super agent Pierce Quincy, has single-mindedly pursued a dream of becoming a FBI agent. Now in the intense sixteen-week training at the FBI Academy, her goal is severely setback when she discovers the body of a young female in a woodsy area while on a training run on the supposedly secure military base. Not only does the victim resemble her older sister Mandy insidiously murdered six years before, but she meets GBI agent Mac McCormack who has been led from Georgia to Virginia in the pursuit of a cunning serial killer and is certain that this is his latest killing. Kimberly feels called to put her future FBI career in jeopardy by taking an unprecedented leave of absence to help in the investigation with Mac, though they are not welcomed by the agencies in charge.<br /><br />The author reintroduces Pierce Quincy, whose specialty is profiling, and Rainie Connor, partners in a private investigating firm, to help in this puzzling case because of its \\"insider\\" implications. In addition, Quincy's expertise is needed to contend with the operating motif of the killer, which is to purposely leave clues on the victims to point to the next one and to leave cryptic messages in newspapers.  Some readers may be disinterested in the scientific details of the killer's clues, but they are reasonably well integrated into an interesting plot, though the perpetrator remains incompletely drawn. The Kimberly-Mac relationship takes center stage in the book. For those familiar with The Next Accident and The Third Victim, Kimberly parallels Rainie in having issues that inhibit her from becoming deeply involved with a male, regardless of the attraction. In addition, Quincy and Rainie unexpectedly have some questions about their relationship.<br /><br />This is another good Lisa Gardner effort, though it is not quite as compelling as say The Survivors Club. But it is recommended.	2004-11-27

How can a dead man, who had been assassinated early in the morning in clear view of the public while being delivered to a courthouse for trial, leave bodily fluids at a crime scene later that night?  The closure that the prosecutors, the policemen, and the three victims of this serial rapist sought and needed was now cruelly denied and the public was nearly in a panic. Perhaps it was understandable for anyone so brutally attacked to plot revenge against her perpetrator. But now had the three victims, who had formed the Survivors Club, railroaded an innocent man, and, worse yet, had him killed? State police detective Roan Griffin feels echoes from his past in this bizarre case. It seems just a bit too convenient for this to be happening on his first day back on the job after being away for a year and a half to recuperate from a breakdown suffered in the pursuit of a murderous pedophile.<br /><br />The book is really well constructed. The plot moves quickly with any number of interrelated developments that are high in plausibility yet surprising. The lives of the main characters, the three victims and Sergeant Griffin, leading up to this point, are well explained and integrated into the plot. The book is well worthwhile for those interested in well-written mysteries.	2004-11-24

The book is not really a scathing indictment of the process or of individuals. Through the use of personal experiences as a political reporter, the author gently criticizes the trends and results of the political process.<br /><br />The author identifies nothing that would be a surprise to anyone with even a minimal interest in politics: mindless and informationless campaigns; the ascendancy of television and visuals; nitpicking and \\"gothcha\\" journalism; empty and evasive notions of objectivity and fairness; ill-conceived and distorting polling; etc. What is unique about the book is the author's ability to flesh out these developments with personal anecdotes. He bemoans the fact that journalists and politicians, as a rule, no longer can have close relationships. Without the element of trust, it becomes less likely that a reporter can penetrate campaign propaganda. Voters are hardly given a free pass; ultimately it is they who must make the process work.<br /><br />With the exception of a concern, briefly mentioned, of the importance of money in political campaigns, the author has little to say about the growing dominance of corporate and financial interests in the country as a whole and in the political process. One would have expected, especially since the author is a liberal, some comment on the rise of such issues as free trade, outsourcing, privatization, deregulation, the massive decline of labor, tax cut mania, etc and their minimal and inept questioning by the media and lack of salience in elections. He does decry the rise of the religious right and its role in the installation of a patently unqualified individual in the White House.<br /><br />The Fat Man is fed up, it seems, mostly because of the loss of collegiality and standards of conduct among political operatives of all kinds. However, there are millions of people in this country way more fed up than the author with the rightward, fundamentalist, pro-business turn in economic and political affairs that threaten to undermine the American way of life that has been carefully fought for and constructed over many decades.

This book sketches his life from birth to death focusing on those aspects that pertain to establishing the nation's political identity. Also, despite its brevity, the ambiguities of Jefferson are not ignored. Jefferson was a slave-owning aristocrat, yet he championed liberty for all people, at least in theory. However, Jefferson could not bridge the racial divide and he was hardly an advocate of any significant democratization of social and political affairs. His relationship, or lack thereof, with Sally Hennings, a household slave of Jefferson's, is mentioned several times (too often actually) with no hard conclusions drawn. If a brief, yet somewhat comprehensive, biography of Jefferson was needed, this book is a fine contribution.<br /><br />What is obvious is that Jefferson and others constructed a basic, raw framework for a nation and its government. But in Jefferson's lifetime alone, the operation and even the distribution of power within government was an evolving process. In addition, much to Jefferson's dismay, American life was beginning to change from being mostly an agrarian society of small producers. It would be interesting to see a Jeffersonian scholar speculate as to the possibility of Jefferson understanding and accepting the vast changes in American society over the last two hundred years. Would the vast private power of corporations in an industrial society be of concern? What would he prescribe to countervail that power? Would he have accepted gender and racial equality?<br /><br />One has to wonder about the legitimacy of directly invoking Jefferson to support positions on either the right or the left in today's complex society. Jefferson, like anyone else, was a man of his times, constructing ideas and dealing with issues in that context. What is really interesting is that Jefferson strongly suggested that the Constitution be rewritten every nineteen years. He seems to have known what we do not: that documents written to govern the affairs of men are not so sacred as to be untouchable. It makes the strict constructionists of our era appear to be silly. In reading this book, it is obvious that this nation has benefited greatly from a group of very insightful men from the eighteenth century. One would hope that similar wisdom can find a voice in a world where ideas have to compete with sophisticated public relations and propaganda of many forms.: that documents written to govern the affairs of men are not so sacred as to be untouchable.

US	52280224	R12LT5ZYLWD7LD	0446604844	473671370	Total Control	Books	3	61	66	N	Y	Interesting, but a little implausible; 3.5 *s	Total Control begins with two high-tech companies, both in need of technological infusion,  pursuing a smaller firm whose advanced technology will guarantee future success. The potential for conflict is immediately evident as the same high-powered law firm is representing both companies in their bids. Attractive corporate attorney Sidney Archer is handling the affairs for one company, but it just so happens that her husband Jason is the main person collecting records pertinent to the sale for the same company.<br /><br />Matters quickly fall apart when in the midst of a high level meeting involving all the principals of the deal, Sidney discovers that her husband has supposedly met his death in a plane crash, after having told his superiors that he would be home doing odds and ends. Suspicions multiply when the loss of millions from corporate accounts is discovered, not to mention the death of a high-level banking official on the same flight.<br /><br />The story kicks into high gear when crusty FBI agent Lee Sawyer tries to make sense of it all. Of course, what would a story set in the cut-throat world of corporate high-tech be without the obnoxious, ruthless CEO; the brilliant, but slighted, guru; and lots of corporate security involving former CIA and FBI agents. Sidney is desperate to discover the truth about her husband. She finds herself somewhat clumsily navigating through building security systems, surveillance, phone taps, cryptic E-mails, computer security, and strange phone calls. It becomes evident that more than a Bonnie-and-Clyde caper is underway, and the bad guys have vast resources and are playing for keeps.<br /><br />The book is entertaining but not without some problems. For this reader the writing seemed stilted or awkward - it didn't flow too well. There were these constantly introduced little twists like \\"Sidney did not see the man lurking across the street.\\" It feels like reader manipulation. Some of the high-tech seemed either fanciful or was made to seem more difficult than it is. It is understandable that a shrewd attorney would have the wherewithal to pursue the mysterious death of her husband, but the slippage of her role into one of wonder woman, physically confronting truly bad guys, was not convincing. FBI agent Sawyer was probably the most compelling character. For such a lengthy book, the ending takes far too predictable of a turn, but it also manages to be incomplete, as the reader will see.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of love it or hate it reviews. Yes the book was too long, a bit unrealistic, and somewhat predictable. But it compares favorably to most books of this genre. There are not many Le Carre's or Clancy's out there. It was an acceptable read. I'm not dissuaded from trying another one of his.l or was made to seem more difficult than it is.

But he had already been somewhat involved in struggles against oppressive conditions in Great Britain, where he had become acquainted with Benjamin Franklin. Having paid his way to America (not arriving as an indentured servant), Paine quickly became a key figure in revolutionary Philadelphia through his writings for a newspaper, his position being secured by a letter from Franklin, and through the publication of \\"Common Sense,\\" perhaps the most influential and widely read pamphlet of the times. The author makes clear that Paine did not accept the commonly held view that the balanced government of Great Britain involving monarchy, nobility, and commoners was the ideal form. In \\"Common Sense,\\" he denounced the entire idea of hereditary monarchy and advocated for republican government with near universal voting rights, of course, only among free, white men. In his scheme, the main element of government should be a unicameral legislature, eschewing the notion of conflicting class interests. He made clear that there were no valid reasons to not seek independence.<br /><br />Philadelphia had been dominated by the merchant elite in the time before Paine's arrival, but the impending conflict with Great Britain began to unleash new social forces. A considerable portion of the book is devoted to exploring the conflicting interests of merchants, farmers, artisans, and laborers in Philadelphia and the colonies. The formation of a local militia was especially upsetting to the status quo, as the militiamen, originating from the lower orders of society, demanded recognition for their sacrifice. The issuance of paper money by colonial governments to finance the war resulted in rampant inflation. Inflated, free-market pricing versus traditional \\"just\\" prices became a controversial issue, which was intertwined with claims of producers withholding or monopolizing products. Attempts to control prices met with little success.  Debtors were less concerned with that inflation (except for higher prices) than were merchants and master craftsmen who advocated for private banking based on tight credit. The author notes that Paine, while a republican, was an advocate for free commerce. He backed the Philadelphia merchant, Robert Morris, in establishing a bank in Philadelphia in the early 1780s. That controversy foretold the many banking controversies that have occurred throughout American history.<br /><br />The author follows Paine as he returned to Great Britain and revolutionary France in 1787. The \\"Rights of Man\\" and a sequel became as influential in Great Britain among artisans in the early 1790s as had his earlier pamphlet in America. He had to escape to France to avoid prosecution for denouncing the crown and advocating taxing the nobility and ending their state pensions. Paine was celebrated by one faction in revolutionary France and was elected to the new National Convention, even though he spoke little French. His failure to support the execution of Louis XVI landed him in prison for a year when the Jacobins seized power from more moderate forces. Paine's tract on deism \\"The Age of Reason,\\" begun while incarcerated, was, in part, an attack on Christianity and its reliance on \\"revelations and miracles.\\" But as the author says, \\"In America, far more critics of society spoke the language of revivalist Protestantism and Christian perfectionism than of deist rationalism.\\" Paine's arguments were far better received in France with a secular, anti-clerical tradition.<br /><br />Paine returned to American in 1802, but his anti-religious views did not sit well with clergy and devout followers. Many of his former friends, including Jefferson, would have nothing to do with him. He died nearly alone in 1809. This book is hardly a conventional biography of Paine. Its intent is to understand the social and political environment in which Paine was able to exert influence. Much ofwhat Paine had to say was not necessarily original, but he had a direct manner of writing that made his views accessible to all social layers. The author also notes that Paine's radicalism did not have the class element that was a part of the radical critique of the industrial revolution in later years. In Paine's view commerce was a unifying social force, not one that created capitalists and a working class at profound odds. Paine is a somewhat obscure and forgotten man. His peripatetic nature, his limited years in the colonies, and his not holding any significant political office - all serve to relegate Paine to a secondary role, at least in perception. But the author contends that Paine had substantial influence in American thought, even if subtle and not well recognized.to exert influence.

The tragic death of Quincy's eldest daughter, a recovering alcoholic, mentioned in the first novel becomes a disturbing murder investigation over a year later in this one. Soon, it becomes obvious that a psychopath is targeting Quincy, who undoubtedly has acquired numerous enemies in his FBI career.<br /><br />The modus-operandi of the antagonist is especially insidious, as he becomes intimately involved in the lives of his victims using a variety of impeccable disguises. The victims never see their demise coming. In addition, he is able to place suspicion on Quincy. The story is gripping and moves quickly. The Rainie - Quincy relationship is given much attention and is ever evolving.<br /><br />In the end the reader may not be satisfied that anyone, regardless of the level of deviancy and motivation, could combine the powers of manipulation and lethality that Quincy's opponent seemed to have. But then again someone with ordinary powers would not instill great fear in potential victims and investigators. Basically the book is another good Lisa Gardner effort.	2004-11-08

The colonial settlers thought themselves to be entitled to all of the constitutional rights of Englishmen, especially the rights to liberty. When Parliament sought to enhance its poor revenue collections by imposing extra taxes on the colonies by the Sugar and Stamp Acts of 1764-65, the colonists immediately invoked rights to be directly represented before taxes could be imposed. The author shows that it was those acts that started a reexamination of the colonies' relationship to Great Britain.<br /><br />Though those acts were repealed, Parliament was fixated on imposing its authority on the colonies. The colonists rejected the notion of \\"virtual\\" representation, and moved from a position of rejecting taxation yet accepting general legislation to one of questioning any jurisdiction by Parliament. The author distinguishes the American Revolution from more far-reaching social revolutions and from nationalistic impulses. The colonists in their minds merely wanted the freedoms enjoyed by all Englishmen.<br /><br />But opposition to a central government proved to be an insufficient basis for establishing a viable political entity. The Articles of Confederation proposed in 1777 left the Congress without any teeth to enforce its provisions, especially in collecting revenues. The securities that Congress offered to fund the war soon became greatly debased because of the Congress's unsound financial basis. Even after having defeated England through some timely help by France and British ineptitude, governing realities and existing in a world of hostile nations forced colonial leaders to call for a constitutional convention in 1787 a mere four years after signing the peace treaty.<br /><br />In many ways the Constitution was more controversial than declaring independence. The author discusses any number of conflicts that arose: small states versus large states, where a compromise was reached subordinating the equality of men to the equality of states in determining the basis of representation in the Senate; slave states versus free states, where each slave was counted as three-fifths of a person for representation at the cost of banning further importation of slaves after 1808; an independent executive and judiciary elements were established with some power to override the Congress; and the financial interests of the well-to-do were protected in having the value of securities upheld. It is clear that the idealism of the language in the Declaration had been considerably reduced.<br /><br />Despite its brevity, this book sufficiently explores the events and the mindset of the colonists from the Stamp Act to the Revolution, through the Revolutionary and the Articles period, and into the Constitution making stage for the reader to gain a good understanding of how a content people could find themselves living in an independent nation with a Constitution that has withstood the test of time, though suffering some shocks along the way - all in the span of twenty-five years.ber of conflicts that arose: small states versus large states, where a compromise was reached subordinating the equality of men to the equality of states in determining the basis of representation in the Senate; slave states versus free states, where each slave was counted as three-fifths of a person for representation at the cost of banning further importation of slaves after 1808; an independent executive and judiciary elements were established with some power to override the Congress; and the financial interests of the well-to-do were protected in having the value of securities upheld.

Theresa Matthews, pretty high school cheerleader in a small town, had to endure her demanding and violent father. J.T. Dillion and his younger sister Marion had to deal with the harsh discipline and incestuous acts of a career military father. A key component of the book is the continuing impact of their childhood traumas. Can one ever really escape such detrimental pasts?<br /><br />Theresa could have never anticipated that her marriage to a handsome local cop, Jim Beckett, would turn into a nightmare, not to be believed. The psychological warfare perpetrated on Theresa for her alleged wifely imperfections paled compared to her realization after two years of marriage that her husband was the massively sought, local serial killer of women. Her husband nearly killed her in his capture six months later, and, despite his incarceration, she was convinced of his ability to exact revenge. Now, two years later, her name change to Tess Williams and her constant moving become a matter of life and death when her ex-husband kills several guards in escaping from a maximum-security prison.<br /><br />Tess makes the gutsy decision to reject police protection, but, through the referral of the detective on the case, seeks out the help of ex-marine, tough-guy, J.T. Dillion to prepare her to resist the onslaught that she knows is coming. But J.T. is in the midst of a weeklong drinking binge, attempting to drown his sorrow over the hit-and-run death of his wife and child several years before. The arrival of Marion, now a FBI agent, results in all manner of recriminations and the fighting of demons from the past. The immediate needs of Tess become almost secondary to the bigger question of whether these three individuals can move past their harmful pasts to deal with the very real threat of the future. It is an interesting aspect of the book to observe the tentative attempts to help and heal on the part of these characters.<br /><br />But the book is not all just examining personal distress. The plot moves quickly as the \\"perfect husband\\" indulges in a far more perfectly developed criminal intuition to stay ahead of the authorities and wreak havoc on their mental state and lives.

The language and meaning of the Declaration are analyzed in the context of the times, which were at the height of the Enlightenment. In addition, some factual basics of the Declaration are reexamined.<br /><br />The book is equal parts the Declaration and the thinking of Thomas Jefferson and others. Contrary to the view of many in the 20th century that Jefferson was a Lockean individualist who stressed private property rights, the author shows that Scottish moral philosophers, the leading intellectuals and teachers of the mid 18th century, exerted by far the most influence on Jefferson. An essential aspect of their thinking was that man had an innate moral sense which resulted in the exercise of \\"benevolence\\" towards their fellow men. It was a distinctly social orientation. The author is rather convincing in demonstrating that the Declaration gains meaning only when understood as reflecting that thinking. Jefferson's original effort, which he much preferred, is contrasted with the final version, edited by the whole Congress, throughout the book and reinforces the author's insights.<br /><br />There are any number of other clarifications. Petitioning the King or Parliament to seek redress for wrongs was a well-established tradition. The Continental Congress in 1774-75 did just that. Those petitions were enumerated in the Declaration. The American Revolution was viewed as similar to the Glorious Revolution in England in 1688, where an oppressive king was dethroned. The American Revolution was not considered to be a rebellion or a revolt, but an exercise of the rights of Englishmen. The Declaration of Independence was a restatement of the actual independence that was declared by vote by the Continental Congress on July 2, not the Fourth. Furthermore, the signing of the Declaration by most, but not all of the attendees of the Congress, occurred on August 2, not the Fourth. Interestingly, the Declaration during the Revolutionary period was not the exalted document that it has become. In many ways it was regarded as basically necessary to secure a treaty with France to support the colonies' war effort; it was a means to an end, not the end.<br /><br />There is much to learn in this book, but it is not without its problems. The chronology and the discussion of important documents surrounding the Declaration during the time of the Congress in the mid-1770s are deficient. The new science of the era, especially all of the observing and cataloguing of details, receives far too much emphasis. The author is continually taking a detour here and there to explore some thought of the times with the yield often not worth the detour. A subject not broached whatsoever, is the legitimacy of the Scottish views of innate moral sensibilities. Those along with natural rights thinking would be considered by many to be no more than ungrounded optimistic faith, hardly anything to base fundamental understandings on.

But beginning with the Constitutional period fissures appeared in that unity. Without the demands of war narrowing the focus, it became evident that the meaning of the revolution differed among the colonists. The main political groupings were the Federalists and the anti-Federalists, later to be known as the Republicans. Many of the mythic figures from the founding era, or in the words of the author: the \\"founding brothers,\\" were leaders of those two factions that determined the direction that the new nation took in the 1790s and into the 19th century.<br /><br />Not only does \\"Founding Brothers\\" examine key ideas and issues of the early republic, but it also looks at the personality and character of the key political actors of the time, those being John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison. The author uses several incidents: the Hamilton-Burr duel in 1804, a Hamilton-Madison dinner arranged by Jefferson in 1790, the introduction of abolitionist petitions into Congress, also in 1790, Washington's Farewell Address of 1796, the presidential election of 1796, and the fourteen year correspondence of Jefferson and Adams at the end of their lives as stepping off points to examine the issues of the day, especially in terms of their support or deviation from republican principles. Such issues as the centralization of power, the role of the \\"many\\" versus elites, business and urban interests versus those of farmers, foreign relations with England and France, the presence and influence of political parties, and freedom to criticize the government were vigorously debated. The author also describes the convenient shelving of the slavery issue because of its volatility.<br /><br />The book is hardly exhaustive in its examination of various issues and personalities, although the insight provided is not to be minimized. The author is not bent on casting any of the principals in an especially bad light, but the warts are there: the aloofness of Washington, the abrasiveness of Adams, the aggressiveness of Hamilton, and the deceptions and fantasies of Jefferson. But clearly the author finds their contributions to the early years of the republic as outweighing any flaws.<br /><br />Frankly, it is rather puzzling to see the book being denigrated by some reviewers. It was not intended to be an exhaustive tome of a period, episode, or individual. If anything the book will undoubtedly stimulate some to indulge in further reading, although it stands on its own as a source of information. The reconstruction of the Hamilton-Burr duel and various interactions of Adams and Jefferson are the highlights of the book.provided is not to be minimized.

There is the billionaire who, while focused exclusively on his business dealings, has gone through many wives and countless mistresses, and (surprise, surprise) has produced greedy, self-centered kids with no redeeming qualities. At the end of his life, he is fed up with them and literally casts them aside in his last will and testament. Of course, that invites a huge legal furor on the part of the children with all of the predictable backstabbing among themselves and their lawyers. And the typical out-of-the-mainstream Grisham lawyer encounters all of the expected difficulties, weather, logistics, injury, disease, etc, in tracking down the heretofore-unknown main beneficiary in the Brazilian jungles.<br /><br />Despite the formulistic aspects of the book, the trials and tribulations of Nate O'Riley, the dispatched lawyer, both past and present, make for an interesting story. Perhaps the reader could wish for a greater role for the missing heiress; her story is inspiring and maybe a little puzzling. All in all, a good Grisham effort.	2004-09-22

It is a slightly more interesting read because the story line is a bit more intriguing and complex. The ending does have its surprises. However, more so than with many authors, reading the books in order is, if not mandatory, certainly helpful in understanding all that happens.<br /><br />Most of the characters have appeared in the previous two novels, but new and often sinister facts come to light. Former Detective Lena Adams and now campus security guard is the central character in this go around. As in all of the other novels, the character depictions and interactions seem a little off. Lena remains traumatized from a rather egregious incident in her fairly recent past, but her dealings with an ex-skinhead on campus are hard to understand. And then there is the constant bickering between Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver and his ex-wife Dr. Sara Linton despite their professed love for each other. It is almost grating.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the novel can get a little gruesome in describing all of the violence and death that occur. Perhaps it could be said that the author does not shrink from hard reality in not only describing physical violence that can be perpetrated but also in bringing to light life's daily miscommunications and misunderstandings.	2004-09-02

How does a thirteen year old girl have the wherewithal to confront a fellow teenager in a parking lot with a gun and resist the intimidating presence of Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver drawing a bead on her at close range? How can it be that an incestuous relationship in a family resulting in a pregnancy can go unnoticed for six months? How can it be that a collection of low-lifes could be so skillful in escaping detection and avoiding authorities in their sordid business? And what would a pornography story be without the stereotypical moral man turning out to be a prime participant in exploiting children for gratification? And of course, the obligatory scene of veteran policemen gritting their teeth to keep from killing a child molester is present.<br /><br />A secondary theme of Kisscut is the rehabilitation and deterioration of Detective Lena Adams. But without reading Blindsighted the reader is mostly in the dark as to the background of her mental state. The reader is left to wonder how a veteran policeman can extract so much valuable information one minute and be on the verge of a breakdown the next.<br /><br />The story is not particularly well-constructed. The who and when of all of the abuse is confusing. It is not enough that Tolliver finds the house where pornography filming was occurring; no, a door is blown off of its hinges when it is opened. Pornographers are booby-trap experts?<br /><br />Blindsighted was not without its troubles, but Kisscut is a step backwards.

The plot is reasonably intricate with unsuspecting connections to Dr Sara Linton's past as a resident in a large hospital. Some readers claim to have solved the murders early on, but the murderer did not really rise to a level of evil consistent with the crimes and fixations. The ending reflects the fact that the murderer does not have a strong lethality about him or her.<br /><br />\\"Blindsighted\\" begins the description of the relationship between Sara and Chief of Police Jeffrey Tolliver. Even though having been once married to each other, their interactions seem to lack consistency and are overly acrimonious considering that they work together, have generally patched things up, and express high regard for each other. For that matter a lot of the dialog and interactions among several of the characters seem to be on the tone-deaf side.<br /><br />The author does leave behind some unsettled issues with detective Lena Adams as well as with Jeffrey and Sara. \\"Blindsighted\\" is interesting enough to justify reading the next in the series, \\"Kisscut,\\" to see where she is going with her story.	2004-08-25

Equally central to the novel is the on-again-off-again relationship of medical examiner Sara Linton and police chief Jeffrey Tolliver. Sara and Jeffrey are caught in the police station assault, which leads to an extensive examination of the earlier events involving both of them to some degree while being interleaved with the ongoing crisis.<br /><br />There is a slight feel that the bricks of the story don't quite fit which no amount of mortar can cover up. In addition, there is way too much emotional back-and-forth between Sara and Jeffrey: is there love or not; is there trust or not; are they compatible.<br /><br />The weakest and briefest part of the book is the current police crisis, which not only strains plausibility but also ends somewhat unsatisfactorily. There is more character development in Slaughter's work than by some writing in the same genre. Unfortunately some of the dialog is just off-key or even unnecessary.<br /><br />Despite any shortcomings, the book was very readable and well-paced. The word \\"riveting\\" is probably overreach.

The book consists of over 100 two and three page chapters that give it a most chopped up and superficial feel. The character development is minimal and the characterization of the antagonists seems distorted - the author never exploring a radical mindset developed over several decades. The radical as weak and klutzy is the preferred presentation mode. And Lt. Boxer's interpersonal relations with her co-workers and others are underdeveloped.<br /><br />The involvement of one Boxer's close friends in the main plot seemed quite a stretch. How does an author go from marital victimization to radical victimization in the span of a few pages? The police work is flimsy; the plot turns on out-of-the-blue information and guesses about potential subjects. The book is a rather blatant attempt to capitalize on the concern for terror in the post-9/11 era, all in a rather trivial manner.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said that the book is an anomaly - not up to usual standards. Let's hope so.	2004-08-13

This is an oft-repeated story all across America. Why Grisham departs from his legalistic formula is puzzling; he really adds little to this well-known phenomenon.<br /><br />As often found, life in the small town of Messina revolves around the football team. Tales of Coach Eddie Rake's excesses are ignored or justified. But Coach Rake, as so often happens, is knocked from his perch when he crosses a boundary that even the most fervent of supporters cannot ignore, yet some did.<br /><br />Now former players have returned as Coach Rakes lies near death. In their nightly gatherings in the bleachers overlooking their field of triumphs, some have kept the faith through the years, but others have struggled in their relationship with the past and Coach Rake. Neely Crenshaw, perhaps the most gifted of the coach's former players, saw his path to the pros abruptly terminated with a debilitating injury in college. Clearly the psychological duress of the Rake regime left Crenshaw unable to cope with life and left him estranged from his Messina past, including Coach Rake.<br /><br />Crenshaw is followed by Grisham as he revisits old haunts, but the experience is hardly rejuvenating. He rather awkwardly attempts some sort of reconciliation with an old sweetheart that he unceremoniously dumped at the height of his high school glory. Perhaps Crenshaw finds some peace in the end - the reader can decide. What Grisham undertakes to tell us in this book is rather modest. A more challenging task would be to shed some light on whether we are capable of playing hard and walking away from it, maintaining perspective. And when do the adults of such small town places start acting like adults instead of being stuck in high school mode?	2004-08-10

(3.5*s)	\\"Breathing Lessons\\" perhaps should have been entitled \\"How to Continually Make Life a Wreck.\\" Ira and Maggie Moran are on the road to attend the funeral service of her old best friend's husband. Through the adventures on that trip and remembrances of twenty-eight years of marriage, the reader is constantly startled at the rationalizations, miscommunications, bizarre behaviors, and disconnections from reality that the characters exhibit, especially Maggie.<br /><br />In Tyler's novels, life is not a bowl of cherries; coping and readjustments are required. But Maggie seems incapable of coherently directing her life. She comes across as mostly inept in virtually all areas of living. There is little affection and support in her family. Her husband Ira is the reticent type. Her son is essentially a failure, and her daughter has practically disowned her. Maggie operates in a mode of always trying to patch up her mistakes and shortsightedness, as well as life's complications, with little success, if not actually making matters worse.<br /><br />Maggie is a somewhat sympathetic character despite her wacky behavior, but she just seems a bit overdrawn at times. The happenstance nature of Maggie and Ira marrying is remindful of \\"Amateur Marriage,\\" Tyler's most recent work. In both books, the marriages were handicapped from the start, but \\"Amateur\\" is a more persuasive examination of family incompatibilities.	2004-08-02

The workplace ? is just an adult version of high school.? To support that proposition, the authors present a lengthy list of behaviors and personalities that supposedly are observable in high schools and are then transferred into workplaces. Their claim that these reflect ?core? traits of an individual is somewhat undermined by a call for readers to ?reinvent? themselves by altering these core approaches. Can one simply change a core trait?<br /><br />There are desirable and undesirable ?archetypes.? On the plus side are the ?A Student, Class Clown, Rebel, Jock, Teacher?s Pet, Geek, Party Animal, Loner, Cheerleader, Straight Arrow, Go-getter, Class President, Thespian, Activist, and Underachiever.? On the negative side of the ledger are the ?Snob, Complainer, Prima Donna, Gossip, Brown-noser, Know-it-all, Bully, Cheater, and Player.?<br /><br />It may strike some readers that this breakdown of types, especially for high school, is overly complicated with too narrow of distinctions. Typically, in high schools there are smart kids, jocks, cheerleaders, and regular kids. The negativities that the authors discuss are not appreciably evidenced. However, high school cliques can be far more harshly enforced than among co-workers.  An area that the authors do not go near is the impact of family wealth in differentiating high school kids. The pecking order in high school largely conforms to social standing in the greater community. The more well-to-do kids are generally more socially adept and have more resources and the support to join various teams and clubs and perform better in the classroom. Of course, some overcome their economic disadvantages. In so far as distinctions in high school do reflect economics, it would be hard to make a case that various roles and behaviors necessarily reflect a person?s core.<br /><br />It would have been interesting for the authors to comment on the usefulness of their analysis of personality and behavior compared to such evaluative tools as the Briggs Myers Personality Indicator based on the four dimensions of extraversion (E) vs. introversion (I), sensing (S) vs. intuition (N), thinking (T) vs. feeling (F), and judging (J) vs. perceiving (P). Does it mean more to say that someone is an ?A student? as opposed to being an ?ISTJ? type?

The list for adults could be larger. The Habitual Parent and the Back-stabber come to mind. The authors also contend that the structure of businesses and high schools is such that students and employees find them selves in a similar position. But the workplace environment is far more complicated. Navigating mine fields is often required to get ahead; school in its core function does not. Grades more or less comport with performance, but promotions and pay reflect far more than performance. Teachers do not fire students on a whim; bosses can and do. There really is no equivalent in high school to the one-sided distribution of power in workplaces and the consequences for employees.<br /><br />It may well be that there is a correlation between the role or behavior of an individual in high school and his or her position later in a workplace.

Powers Hapgood, born in 1899 into a Progressive family, was, like many of his Harvard contemporaries, interested in the standing of the working class. But he, unlike them, sought to actually join with workers in their struggles.<br />After a certain amount of wandering around, Hapgood ended up playing a not insignificant role in the massive mine workers strike of 1922 from the base of Somerset County, PA, where he mostly provided assistance to miners and their families, including fund raising and creating public sympathy through writing articles for progressive publications. He became known in Progressive circles and developed friendships with any number of reformers. In addition, he became lifelong friends with John Brophy, a miner, working class intellectual, and UMW labor official. The capitulation of John Lewis, the head of the UMW, to the mine owners was disconcerting to the idealistic Hapgood,  bringing home the facts that a union could be a personal fiefdom and that a just cause could be crushed.<br />The author suggests that this book should be required reading for not only college students taking on summer jobs with unions but also for those running those programs. They need to know, as Hapgood found out, that organizational demands of unions trump worker empowerment every time. The post-WWII labor framework rested on government sanctioned administrative processes, not worker activism. Though the radical politics of Hapgood placed him even further outside labor officialdom, he suppressed his idealism sufficiently to work on the CIO organizing drives of the mid-1930s, re-uniting with Lewis, and even became a regional director for the CIO in the later 1940s. But he was purged from his position in 1948 in the anti-Communist hysteria of the times. He was a longtime member of the socialist party, but had many friends in the CP.<br />Worker democracy is a constant theme of the book, but it is only vaguely identified. At times it seems to be worker voice within unions and at others within workplaces, although the extent of any empowerment in not made clear. The labor contracts that are generally negotiated under the NLRA legalistic framework are at least as restraining of workers as they are of giving workers any power. In fact, bargaining over wages and working conditions leaves employers free to make all general business decisions regardless of any harm to their workforces. It is hard to conceive of worker democracy as anything less than co-management.<br />Hapgood had few moments where he felt as though he really belonged to the working class and could make a difference. His life was a series of frustrations, which led to alcohol abuse over the last fifteen years of is life. He also had a complicated romantic affair with the labor radical Rose Posetta, which only added to his problems. He died at the early age of forty-nine in 1949.<br />Although Hapgood was not overly happy with the results of his efforts in the labor movement, it is difficult to even imagine students of the modern era being able to find the opportunities to immerse themselves in workers' struggles as did Hapgood. The political climate is so anti-labor and conservative that the mere fact of union survival is a precarious proposition.

How can it be that substantial segments of the working class have become the allies of elite market conservatives in a largely successful drive to turn the American political system to the right, where government is held to be, at best, undesirable. That is what Thomas Frank seeks to understand. There is no economic rationale to this confluence; it is a subjective, value-driven phenomenon. It seems as though many working people have been subtly persuaded by elites that they must defend or establish a set of values supposedly not shared by morally challenged liberals. But elevating personal values as the chief concern of politics seems to be contrary to American tradition. Call it what you will, value or principle, but the foremost idea of the American founding was a profound belief in freedom: to make all manner of personal choices in life, to participate in self-government, and to be free from subtle and overt coercion from powerful public and private entities. It was a clear rejection of old-world aristocratic and church control of society. Instead, the nation was seen to rest on virtuous, engaged small, independent producers and farmers.<br />However, as the author points out, it was precisely the slippage of that ideal that spurred the populist movement of the 1890s in Kansas and throughout the South and West. A largely farming population saw the power of large business interests to control prices and to influence the federal government to maintain hard currency policies as destructive of a way of life as independent produces. They advocated for substantial governmental intervention in the economy to combat this loss of freedom. As the author notes, it was a movement of \\"producers versus parasites.\\" Later, the labor movement became a powerful force in American industry in the post-WWII era precisely because it gave workers at least some voice in their economic destiny, if only over wages and benefits. By 1950, nearly four in ten private sector workers belonged to unions.<br />Why did the farmers and factory workers of fifty to one hundred years ago not disparage the Progressives, or liberal elites in today's lexicon, who largely drove the sweeping changes of the first half of the twentieth century that curtailed the most significant abuses of large businesses? The author hints at the answer: republicanism, or the philosophy that emphasized the virtues of free producers, still dominated the thinking of most people. Progressive actions were seen as preserving freedoms and not as imposing unwanted values. But \\"producerism\\" was already giving way to an entirely new focus. The working class was subtly being persuaded through a massive expansion of advertising in an ever-consolidating mass media that becoming consumers in free markets now defined a good life. Forget the fact that workplace regimes were inhospitable and bastions of control; the opportunity to freely indulge in materiality was touted as more than an adequate replacement for any losses in job satisfaction. Most conveniently for elites, the new vocabulary of markets hid the old hierarchy of capitalists and workers. Now buyers and sellers are seen as essentially equal in the marketplace regardless of differences in resources and actual power to impact markets.<br />The rise of consumerism and the notion that markets are free and neutral, devoid of power dynamics, aligns perfectly with business interests. Intrusions into the marketplace, such as environmental regulations or labor standards, are now held to be harmful to consumers, as well as businesses. It is routinely suggested that policy makers, now derisively referred to as liberal elites, must have some kind of un-American agenda to interfere with the making, selling, and buying of goods in free markets. Taxes, which fund these specious depredations on the marketplace, are accordingly cut. But a critique of liberal elites based solely on economics is not sufficiently motivating to spur enough voters to support the business agenda. The policies and judgments of liberals, either in or out of government, are now attacked as evidence of a deficiency in morality. With this demonization of liberals, a powerful voting alliance is formed.<br />Liberal respect and policy implementation for such measures as reproductive freedom, the exclusion of religious symbols from public life, alternative lifestyles, artistic expression, and actual equal opportunity are cast as morally reprehensible intrusions into ordinary lives. This view is pandered to and exacerbated by business elites through think tanks and the media, especially talk radio. But the author shows that it is a cynical position. It is a fact that many business elites share the same cultural background and tastes, as do liberal elites. In addition, it is large corporations that package and sell much of the culture that the working class finds so offensive. But these contradictions go unnoticed. The unrelenting demonization of liberals neatly obscures the tremendous economic costs that the working class has incurred in the new laissez-faire economy. A further irony is that while the business agenda achieves legislative success, the shrill values' debate is relegated to secondary status after elections.<br />The author clearly shows that Kansans should be concerned about the loss of good-paying industrial jobs and the squeezing of family farmers by large agri-business concerns. The rate of unionization has plunged to less than one in ten private sector workers, mostly under Republican administrations. While some modern Kansans express a desire to simply be left alone, that is wishful thinking. The Kansan economy is being drastically eroded right from under their feet. Their economy has truly become \\"at will\\" - the unilateral will of large corporations.<br />The author is best at detailing this puzzling phenomenon. His explanations are perhaps less clear, though still quite edifying. Conservatives contend that it is they that uphold cherished American values. But the U.S. has, for the most part, been a liberal society, intent on preserving the most freedom for the most people.

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	4	31	39	N	Y	The Cynical Exploitation of Working Class Obsession; 4.5 *s	The central concern of this book is the seemingly irrational flocking of sizeable segments of the working and middle classes to the Republican camp in the last two decades. Economically, that political shift makes no sense. By focusing on the particulars of this political development in his native state, Kansas, Frank provides keen insight into what appears to be the self-immolation of the working class.<br />The author begins by pointing out that Kansas was in the forefront of the populist movement of the 1890s. The largely farming population was aggrieved by low crop prices and exorbitant costs imposed by furnishing agents and railroads. They found business interests to be their primary oppressors and called for governmental intervention in the economy. It was a decidedly leftist movement of \\"producers versus parasites.\\"<br />The 1990s also were not kind to \\"producers.\\" Heartland America was subjected to deindustrialization, off shoring, and stagnating wages, while elites prospered. But strangely, these disruptions no longer generated withering economic critiques; market forces were seen as perhaps causing dislocations but were held to be blameless.  Instead working people began to feel strongly that such cultural issues as abortion, gay liberation, vulgarity in entertainment, and even public education were to blame for disturbances in their lives and in society at large. But these same people are unwilling to squarely pinpoint the origins of culture in the U.S.<br />Huge corporations largely dictate culture in the US. Unsurprisingly, cultural directions set by media and entertainment concerns are determined by what sells. Universities and government mostly reinforce business interests. But these structural connections are generally not the concern of those feeling socially besieged. These new populists are most concerned with the imagined lifestyles of the so-called liberal elites of these despised institutions. The influence of latte drinking, wine and cheese tasting, European vacationing, and liberal sexual practicing snobbish liberal elites, who of course are staunch Democrats, must be vigorously resisted by supporting conservative political forces. The fact that business elites share the same cultural background of the loathed liberal elites goes unnoticed. Those business elites further obscure their role in culture by making the claim that they too are helpless against the liberal cultural assault. <br />The alliance of moderate business elites, from whom the leaders of the Republican party are frequently drawn, with a conservative base of working people is one of convenience if not outright cynicism. Business leaders and their spokespersons tolerate, and sometimes join in, conservative railings against liberal culture thereby gaining the voting support to carry out a pro-business political program. It can hardly be doubted that the deregulation, privatization, and union-busting agenda of corporate America has been greatly harmful to their base of supporters. As the author notes, the fanning of the flames of cultural discontent have make good business sense. But it is also interesting that the political process seldom delivers on conservative promises to roll back morality practice. <br />Perhaps this turn to cultural issues is not too surprising. The producerist ethic was well on its way out by the late 1920s. An economic analysis of society based on class was replaced by classless consumerism where everyone had equal rights to consume. Markets are now regarded as neutral, if not benign. Discontent must be due to reasons other than economic structure. The author also notes that both the media and entertainment industry perpetuate this sanitized, mechanistic version of economic workings, where people cannot be blamed for disruptions. The theme of working stiff as a victim of cultural perversity and excess has become a very powerful rallying cry. The strength of that explanation is maintained by the continual feeding ofexamples of cultural decadence by conservative spokesmen, especially talk-show hosts.<br />The author, in the end, finds that the deterioration of the economic landscape for a working class obsessed with cultural issues will continue in any foreseeable future. As he says, \\"Kansas is ready to lead us singing into the apocalypse. It invites us all to join in, to lay down our lives so that others might cash out at the top; to renounce forever our middle-American prosperity in pursuit of a crimson fantasy of middle-American righteousness.\\" This book is a strong indictment of the strength our democracy. If people cannot get beyond delusions, no way can a society operate in a coherent, rational manner.	2004-06-30

But Tim is sharply questioned by the police and his old office and realizes that he has been implicated in some clandestine scheme concocted by Larry and his old Russian contacts.<br />The book follows Tim's thoughts as he is constantly examining the past, questioning his remembrances and his understandings in his dealings with Emma and mostly Larry. He is both wary and envious of Larry's capacity for action and his ability to capture others, in this case, Emma. At times the introspections and doubts bring the pace of the book to a slow crawl.<br />Tim is forced into a game of investigation and evasion. The trail leads to support for the cause of the oppressed Ingushetians of the Caucasians. However, the resolution of the entire affair may leave many readers grasping for a more definitive conclusion.<br />As usual Le Carre is unsurpassed in capturing the subtleties and tone of the spy world and its uncertainties. But that may not be enough to rescue this book.	2004-06-21

His books are fast-paced with plenty of plot intricacies and interesting characters. I've never been able to put one down, once started.<br />The shattering of Grace Lawson's domestic tranquility by an out-of-place, strange photo in a packet from a fast-photo mart and the abrupt departure of her husband after seeing the photo grabs the reader immediately. But, by examining telephone records and using the Internet, Grace is able to make a beginning in sorting out her husband's disappearance and his connection with the photo taken some fifteen years ago. The investigation moves into high gear with innumerable interactions with an assortment of friends, policemen, lawyers, criminals, and mafia types, some with intricate ties to the time of the photo. Grace learns that her past is also intimately connected with this turn of events.<br />The plot does get a bit tangled toward the end, as well as stretching plausibility a bit.

Pearl, the mother of Cody, Ezra, and Jenny, never recovered from the abrupt abandonment by her husband Beck after fourteen years of marriage, some thirty-five years prior. But Pearl has problems beyond a marriage gone awry. She is unusually harsh and critical, and even abusive, with her children, exhibits almost no understanding of them, is quick to take offense or misconstrue situations, and is obsessed with appearances, hers and theirs, even pretending for years that her husband had not left. Cody is absolutely malicious in his dealings with his younger brother Ezra dating from his teenage years into middle-age. Jenny, after two failed marriages, manages to get through medical school but not without first being physically abusive towards her own daughter and then becoming strangely oblivious to the needs of her family in a third marriage.<br />Ezra, the balancing humane element of the book, becomes a partner, with a worldly, elderly lady, in a restaurant near his childhood Baltimore row home, where he still lives with Pearl,  despite his mother's abhorrence at the idea. After becoming the sole owner, Ezra remakes the restaurant in his own image, making it unpretentious and home-like, hence the Homesick Restaurant. Ezra makes several attempts to gather the family for dinners at his restaurant through the years. In an apt metaphor for the book, those meals are never completed, as squabbles, usually initiated by Pearl, break up the gatherings.<br />It may be argued that many families are essentially dysfunctional, but the uptightness and antagonisms of the Tull's are a step beyond. Jenny's concern for her patients and Pearl's grandmotherly kindness softens the otherwise harsh picture somewhat. But Pearl has already had her familial influence.<br />Has the author captured and shed light on a realistic or probable situation? As usual, she is highly consistent and not squeamish in examining her characters. Although the story is certainly grim and stark, it has a feel of legitimacy. And that is the book's appeal.

It is where two uniquely attracted people can supposedly fully realize true love. Yet, half of all marriages do not last. That fact coupled with the actual characteristics of surviving marriages leads the author to a rather strong critique of the entire institution.<br />The author finds that passion and attraction, those things that make courtships so exhilarating and that are considered to be core elements of marriages, disappear rather quickly. Frequently, what remains are relationships bubbling with rancor that have become deadened. All manner of surveillance of the marital partner is used to squash any possibility of infidelity. Large doses of blame are doled out because of  perceived failures to attend to, and even anticipate, the psychological and emotional needs of the partner. The reactions are withdrawal, subservience, or hostility. Among the counselor community this state of affairs may need adjustment, but is regarded as basically normal. The author derides the notion that this state of affairs is in any way normal and all that is needed is \\"hard work\\" to increase marital harmony.<br />The author compares the control regime and lowered expectations of marriages with workplace environments and even citizenship. In an era of economic dislocation, the admonition to work harder is hardly liberating. Rebels, meaning those who actually attempt to grasp for more and counter established authority, are dealt with harshly. This is the context in which the author places adultery. When passion suddenly appears, many will take large risks to escape marital suffocation. The author, well aware of the risks, does not advocate adultery, but does find it to be far more than a spur-of-the-moment whim.<br />The book is witty and unfortunately captures the reality of many, if not most, marriages. It is a valid criticism to say that the book is one-sided; however, the author does acknowledge that some marriages manage to escape the strangulation syndrome. The writing style is a little difficult, but not impossible. It is pretty hilarious to see some reviewers so offended by the book; if the institution of marriage is so strong, surely it can take hits from critics.author does acknowledge that some marriages manage to escape the strangulation syndrome.

The only option is to follow the rules; then it is swim or sink. Furthermore, there is no doubt that forming farm teams for professional leagues with substandard students has no place in a university.<br />The author shows through his survey data that major sports teams in Division 1-A of the NCAA give a focal point to the incessant partying that occurs at most major, large universities. It is the essential point of the book that college administrators are more than willing to give undergraduates \\"beer and the circus\\" of big-time sports in lieu of drastically overhauling undergraduate programs. The need for tuition dollars leads large colleges to pack freshman courses, virtually precluding a chance to learn. Sports and partying is the cynical substitute.<br />Clearly, the prestige focus of top college officials precludes quality education for most students. It is all about image and reputations. Good sports teams increase recognition. So do adding prestigious faculty, engaging in research for corporate America, and having special, honors education for a select minority of undergraduates. The author makes abundantly clear that well-known faculty and elaborate research do not benefit the typical student. Furthermore, athletic programs are invariably a drain on the finances of the university. Even with Fat TV contracts, athletic programs are net losers.<br />The author breaks down the main student subcultures into \\"collegiate, vocational, rebel, and academic.\\" They have different goals and different problems interacting with the substandard educational regime. The fact that the party element, the collegiate group, is content, or resigned to, with the current educational situation hardly justifies the de-emphasis on education.<br />The author does briefly touch on the purposes of college education. Is college mostly a social experience; is it to obtain job skills; or is it to be liberally educated. And do colleges actually support all of those goals for all students.<br />There is much wrong with universities and the author makes some effort to shed light on the problems. But much more can be said. Should universities perform a special social role, or are they simply big corporations looking out for the bottom line, cutting costs where they can, while paying lip service to a grand mission?

An unfaithful husband and a life thrown into disarray is the stimulus for Susan to turn to her family, mostly her older sister Maggie, and to reexamine her childhood lived on the Island in a large, much added to, house now occupied by Maggie and her family.<br />The author is a bit too facile in creating events and characters that strain in-depth reflection. In the midst of the racist South of 1963 Livvie arrives in the Hamilton household as a daily housekeeper, who is both exceedingly wise and kind and willing to put aside the prevailing racial divide, all the while developing a great loyalty to the Hamilton household. The origin of the suggested racial progressivism of Susan's father is unexplored and is somewhat undermined by his wanton philandering and his quick temper resulting in the abuse of his wife and children. Her mother, largely confined to bed with chronic depression and too large dosages of meds, is startingly renewed as a pseudo-socialite in the pursuit of the physician father of a border that has been taken in as a means of making ends meet after the sudden death of Susan's father. And Susan and her young siblings seem to have a remarkable understanding of these various dysfunctions.<br />The author steps between the past and present using the device of similar scenarios as connectivity. For example, it is during fierce hurricanes that important actions occur in both Susan's past as well as the present. Reviewing the past is certainly rejuvenating to Susan. In her pre-infidelity days, Susan was a frumpy, overweight woman victimized by her husband, mother to a rebellious teenager, and employed in a thankless librarian's job. She emerges with a new svelte body gained from walking to work along with other appearance enhancements, a command of her separated husband, a repaired if not idyllic relationship with her daughter, and a new job as a syndicated columnist of humor pieces. Part of the redemption process for Susan is the remembrance and heeding of the Gullah philosophy dispensed by Livvie, and the discovery through some fortuitous evidence that members of her childhood community associated with the Klan murdered her father.<br />The book is not without its appeal. It is a nice package of island culture, the essentiality of family, and moving beyond disappointments.

Now at age forty her life suffered from terminal blandness. Her teen-aged children ignored her, even treating her with disdain, and her husband, an unaffectionate sort, took her for granted. A chance encounter with a younger man in a supermarket sparked a self-assessment that led to Delia simply walking away from her family on an annual outing to the beach with nothing more than a bathing suit, a robe, and a few hundred dollars.<br />Hitching a ride to a remote town in her home state, Delia begins to slowly eke out a new existence. The quiet resolve and good nature of Delia is a constant. Her whereabouts are discovered soon after her disappearance, which forces her to reflect on her former existence as she is contacted in one manner or another by several of her family members. Interestingly, Delia becomes more than a little attached to a new family as a housekeeper/nanny to an educator and his twelve-year-old son.<br />A return home for her daughter's wedding unexpectedly presents Delia with decisions concerning her new and previous lives.

Fifty-year-old and newly divorced Linwood Scott did not want to move back to her childhood home in Mimosa Branch, GA to live with her overbearing, elderly parents and an aunt, uncle, and brother - all with medical or personal problems. But Lin's life had taken a dramatic left turn when her husband of thirty years completely depleted the family's financial resources in an out-of-control pursuit of an exotic dancer.<br />Though leery of the closeness and nosiness of her hometown, Lin quickly finds support among old friends, even finding work in a drugstore where she worked as a teenager. The author has a keen eye for the Southern manners, think, and talk that Lin had gotten away from in her life as a suburban matron. But the nagging issue for Lin is to come to grips with her apparent lack of understanding of men.<br />The author conveniently supplies the male element in the form of the smooth, handsome owner/pharmacist of her drugstore. Lin, despite many misgivings, simply cannot resist his charms and her own needs for self-reclamation. Though Lin gains strength from an affair, it is done at the sacrifice, as many readers may feel, of the doc to stereotypical characterization.<br />In addition, the concerns of the political corruption of Mimosa Branch, a not uncommon fact of small-town Southern life, provide a useful device for the repair of Lin's self-assurance, as she becomes a part of a vigorous campaign to combat the forces of city hall.<br />There may be just a bit too much feel-good about this novel. It is not totally implausible that many long-standing family issues can be resolved, a completely disconsolate and rejected woman finds herself and triumphs over an insensitive male, and the town's boss is sent packing, all within a few weeks, but belief may be stretched.

This book examines the transformation of traditional society into market society: the necessary pre-conditions and steps. The author reminds us that, despite the material advances of modern society, some key economic ideas still apply. All societies must be organized for the material survival of its members. The inter-dependencies among societal members in simpler societies have not been eliminated in market societies, despite the hyping of the independent, self-maximizer by modern theorists; in fact, the complexities of modern societies may well create more dependence, not less. And market societies do have some inherent problems.<br />The author points out that any society must have a coherent system for producing useful goods and services and then distributing them in a manner sufficient for society's perpetuation. Man has relied upon combinations of tradition, command, and markets to solve those production and distribution problems. Tradition uses time-honored methods of work, \\"allocated by heredity,\\" which are reinforced by \\"law, custom, and belief.\\" Change and competitiveness are not tolerated. Command is authoritarian control of economies and is mostly associated with economies operating in rapid catch-up mode, such as the Soviet Union. However, even democracies use elements of command during periods of crisis. In market societies, the aggregation of supply and demand guide economic functioning with no distinct center of control or allegiance to past practices.<br />Manorial estates and the guilds dominated life in the Middle Ages along with the Church, but the author points to small beginnings of a more commercial world. Itinerant merchants established a small niche for commercial activity in some urban areas. The more successful of them came to be key financiers of monarchs keen on expanding their authority. The gold and silver realized from 16th century New World expeditions stimulated commercial activity. Calvinism, in contrast to the Catholic Church, sanctified hard work and the accumulation of wealth as an indicator of spiritual worthiness. Gradually, feudal society became more reliant upon money as a basis of social exchange. No longer were manorial lords obligated for the overall well being of serfs. The displacement of peasants by the enclosure movements was justified by the opportunities for the landed aristocracy to use their estates as sources of cash revenue.<br />The author identifies several changes that are necessary for a market economy to emerge. Virtually every task, good, or service has a monetary reward. The anticipation of financial reward guides such decisions as where to labor or what to produce. A society of contracts supercedes a society of status and traditional social bonds. With those changes, a certain amount of social uncertainty is introduced. Yet a market society is not without its own forms of control. The competitions of seller versus seller and buyer versus seller are constraining forces on economic behavior.<br />Generally it takes a market economy to substantially change the material well being of an entire society. In the first place, traditional societies are not unhappy with the status quo. What is needed are investments in capital goods, or \\"tools, equipment, machines, and buildings,\\" to increase human productivity leading to higher living standards. And it is the hope for profits or higher wages that spurs investment of money and labor in those goods. But investment implies savings, which, in turn, generally requires a sacrifice in consumption and lower wages. The author suggests that the growing pains of industrialization, mostly on the backs of the working class with the \\"forced emigration of the peasantry by enclosure and heavy-handed exploitation,\\" could not have been avoided. He undercuts that argument slightly by acknowledging that the forces of democracy in the 19th century ameliorated conditions for the working class.<br />Scientific and technological advances are oftenlarge factors in the development of capital goods and increased productivity. English industrial production literally exploded based on the inventions of such men as Wilkinson, Watt, and Arkwright. The factory system came to dominate English life. New technologies have often literally transformed market societies. The automobile, for example, drastically changed residential patterns, facilitated social independence, and was a massive generator of employment. Can anyone doubt the impacts of electricity, airplanes, television, and computers?<br />However, the author points out that market societies do not necessarily operate according to the basic theory. \\"Consumer power\\" is a first principle of classical economists; according to that notion, consumers force products to be sold \\"at the lowest price compatible with continued production.\\" But market societies invariably tend to be dominated by a few large firms, where economic efficiencies can be attained. These large enterprises often agree among themselves to set pricing above truly competitive levels. In addition, because much of what is produced in modern economies is non essential, consistency of demand must be created through advertising. While large firms may be needed, consumer sovereignty is mostly a fiction.<br />Stable market economies must maintain the balances between production and purchasing and savings and investment. Workers' purchasing power must be consistent with production volumes. In addition, savings ought to be converted into investment, or capital formation. The Great Depression was brought about by workers being underpaid and capital investments not being made.

English industrial production literally exploded based on the inventions of such men as Wilkinson, Watt, and Arkwright. The factory system came to dominate English life. New technologies have often literally transformed market societies. The automobile, for example, drastically changed residential patterns, facilitated social independence, and was a massive generator of employment. Can anyone doubt the impacts of electricity, airplanes, television, and computers? <br />However, the author points out that market societies do not necessarily operate according to the basic theory. \\"Consumer power\\" is a first principle of classical economists; according to that notion, consumers force products to be sold \\"at the lowest price compatible with continued production.\\" But market societies invariably tend to be dominated by a few large firms, where economic efficiencies can be attained. These large enterprises often agree among themselves to set pricing above truly competitive levels. In addition, because much of what is produced in modern economies is non essential, consistency of demand must be created through advertising. While large firms may be needed, consumer sovereignty is mostly a fiction. <br />Stable market economies must maintain the balances between production and purchasing and savings and investment. Workers' purchasing power must be consistent with production volumes. In addition, savings ought to be converted into investment, or capital formation.

Oftentimes, it takes a triggering event for a change to be made. For Michael Brock, a lawyer on the fast track to partner status at a large Washington DC law firm, barely surviving being taken hostage along with eight of his associates by a homeless man, who asks some penetrating questions of the hostages, opens his eyes to the existence of an entire group of people without resources and hope.<br />Shortly after the hostage incident in which the homeless man was killed, Michael is the recipient of clandestinely delivered information that describes a file in possession of the firm implicating the firm in the illegal eviction of the hostage taker and others into the harsh conditions of a Washington winter. Michael then undertakes a clumsy late night sortie to steal the file. \\"Street Lawyer\\" is ostensibly about the frantic efforts of the firm to retrieve the file, keep a cap on their culpability and preserve their reputation, and Michael's efforts to bring the firm to legal account.<br />The book, in actuality, is about Michael's growing sensitivities to the plight of homeless people and his increasing involvement in the activities of a legal clinic that provides basic legal assistance to the poor. His guide, as he feels his way in a world unknown to him, is Mordecai Green, homeless advocate and founder of the legal clinic. The reader senses Michael's amazement and distress at the devastated lives that he finds in the homeless shelters.<br />In some ways, the book is a little too pat: a big time lawyer with a doctor wife undergoes a wholesale change and terminates a dying marriage; his family is only concerned with his career, not him; the principal partner of the law firm after seeking to wreck Michael's life seems to have a change of heart. The book is best at exploring an alternative view of what being a lawyer is all about and who does and does not usually benefit from the work of lawyers and big law firms.enefit from the work of lawyers and big law firms.	2004-03-30

But that discussion never occurs as Ray Atlee, a law school professor, arrives to find that his father has died in his sleep. In addition a last-minute will is discovered. His wayward younger brother Forrest is little concerned other than for Ray, the named executor of the estate, to not cheat him out of his share of what seems to be a rather modest estate. But Ray's simple administrative task gets abruptly complicated when he discovers millions in boxes stuffed in a cabinet.<br />Ray decides to remove the money from the Judge's house, place it in a storage rental unit in his Virginia college town, and determine the source of the money and who knows about it. He almost immediately becomes concerned that he is being watched. \\"The Summons\\" basically follows Ray in his inter-state travels and his paranoia over the stash of money. Break-ins of his apartment and photographs of the storage unit received in the mail intensify his apprehension. He is able through some skillful subterfuges to narrow the potential list of sources of the money as well as those who may know of it.<br />As some reviewers have noted, the book becomes a little repetitious in following Ray's journeys and his incessant moving and guarding of the money. The plot borders on the too simple with such concerns as the authenticity of a last minute will not being timely examined. And the ending is almost predictable and slightly confusing at the same time. This is hardly the most gripping Grisham novel that I have read to this point.	2004-03-25

But the book, in actuality, is an in-depth look at the manipulation of the jury selection process and the possibilities of jury tampering once a jury has been selected.<br />Nicholas Easter's name has shown up on the potential juror pool. But he is a mystery man to the jury consultants who have examined his past as described on the juror forms, photographed his every move, and even tried to penetrate his anonymity by enticing him with attractive female agents. But Nicholas is strategically placed in the jury pool and neither side is able to strike him from being selected.<br />Early in the trial, the jury begins to panic the consultants through such independent actions as insisting on reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in court and requiring first class service on catered lunches. Someone is driving the jury and that person is Nicholas. It turns out that he has help in the person of his girlfriend and shrewd operator, Marlee, in controlling the jury. Simultaneously, the defense has identified several jurors who have vulnerabilities that can be exploited through spousal contact.<br />The key interaction is between Marlee and Fitch, the ruthless, unofficial head of the defense team who will stop at nothing to ensure a favorable verdict for his clients, the tobacco industry. As Fitch and his operatives scramble to learn the true identity of Nicholas and Marlee, can they afford to ignore the ability of this enigmatic pair to control the jury?<br />The book was interesting, but it was not particularly gripping. The plot moves along fairly slowly and even predictably as the impacts of Nicholas and Marlee and Fitch and cohorts on the jury are played out. One is left with the inescapable conclusion that there are few limits when attempting to undermine the legal process.	2004-03-22

She had intellectual aspirations as a history major at a small college, and was \\"engaged to be engaged\\" to Will Allenby, a serious physics student. But her life was about to undergo a profound change. She met Joe Davitch, the operator of this house turned party and meeting hall. Joe adroitly, though unknowingly, changed Rebecca's self-perception as a quiet student to someone who enjoyed the fun of parties. Though doubts lingered, Rebecca accepted a new approach to her future and married Joe within weeks of meeting. She became an instant mother to Joe's three daughters and a partner in the business of providing space and entertainment for all manner of clients in the downstairs of their row home.<br />Now at this point in her life, Rebecca is seriously considering that she is not what she seems to have become. At heart, she is convinced that she remains the contemplative, serious student of her earlier days. She understands that Joe had subtly shifted her outlook and altered the course of her life. With Joe having died many years before, Rebecca is free to reengage with Will, now the head of the physics department at the same small college. What she finds out about herself and Will hardly reaffirms her fixation on her past and her imagined better life. The author wants us to consider, at what point does a life lived define the real person, despite any fanciful self-definitions?<br />In \\"Grownups,\\" Rebecca's search for her true self is interleaved with all of the daily affairs of running a business and her dealings with the now large Davitch clan.

He had derailed his chance to rise in the legal world of property and contracts by going way over the line separating lawyer and clients in his dealings with an alluring Latin beauty. The  prestigious law firm that had employed him as a fledgling lawyer could not tolerate the negative press, when she turned up dead and her past was revealed.<br />Now Jack is forced to violate his law professor's best advice: \\"Avoid criminal law like the plague.\\" He is reduced to being a court appointed attorney for all sorts of low-life's engaged in drugs and petty crime. Jack gets a call from the judge's clerk that a client, Doug Townsend, old college friend and rehabilitated meth user, has turned up dead from an apparent overdose. A search of Doug's meager apartment reveals some real surprises. He apparently had an obsession with a renowned opera singer, Michele Sonnier, and had traveled extensively to see her perform. The next bombshell is that a low-life computer hacker, one Nightmare, whose arm Jack has twisted, discovers that Doug, also a computer hacker, had been extensively accessing the computer files of a small, innovative pharmaceutical company. That fact coupled with the fact that Michele's husband is the head of large Horizn Pharmaceuticals takes Jack on a precarious investigation through the streets of Atlanta including the notorious projects, McDaniel Glen, trying to make sense of these \\"coincidences.\\"<br />Again Jack's strictly legal approach is compromised by his attraction for Michele. The Last Goodbye is a good mystery but is equally good at peeling off the layers of the comfortable, correct façade of important, public personalities and in exposing the extent to which business entities will go to preserve their markets and profitability. The story lines moves fairly quickly, but the book is a little deeper and grittier than some of this genre. I don't have any trouble recommending it.	2004-03-05
US	52280224	RZPACE19LKTZM	0743254686	98660942	We Are Lincoln Men: Abraham Lincoln and His Friends	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Supplementary to Donald?s Biography of Lincoln	Donald, in his great biography, \\"Lincoln,\\" emphasized Lincoln's character and interpersonal dealings. This book is a more intense and critical look at some of Lincoln's closest friendships. But for this reviewer, it would be difficult to believe that this book would have much meaning for those who were not well familiar with Lincoln's history.<br /><br />Lincoln grew up in extremely difficult circumstances. He lived an isolated, poor life in rural Kentucky and Indiana, and, furthermore, had to endure the death of his mother at an early age. Lincoln apparently had no friendships as a child or adolescent. Yet Lincoln seemed to have the ability to draw others to him. He developed a great capacity for story telling. In his twenties he was elected captain of a local militia in New Salem, Illinois, which was formed to fight a small Indian uprising. The explanation for this seeming contradiction rests on Lincoln's physical prowess and sharp mind, neither of which he pushed on others.<br /><br />The author uses the Aristotelian categorization of friendship: \\"enjoyable, useful, an/or perfect or complete\\" to look at Lincoln's relationships. Clearly most of his friends fell into the category of useful, though not exploited. The book looks closely at Lincoln's friendships with Joshua Speed, an operator of a general store, William Herndon, a law partner in Springfield, Orville Browning, a fellow Whig in Illinois, William Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State, and John Hay and John Nicolay, his personal secretaries during his presidency.<br /><br />Lincoln formed his closest friendship with Speed, as they were both young men trying to find their way, but with Speed's marriage they drifted apart. The political controversies of the day often upset friendships. Both Herndon and Browning became less close to Lincoln over the issues of slavery and Lincoln' s presidential policies. In addition, political patronage intruded in some friendships. The tremendous strength of Lincoln's personality is perhaps best seen in the subtle manner in which Lincoln transformed a political rival, William Seward, into an unabashed admirer and devoted follower. Nicolay and, especially, Hay provided Lincoln with an outlet during his trying Washington days regarding not only the War but also the difficulties of his family.<br /><br />The author devotes some of the book to examining the correctness of supposedly first-hand accounts of Lincoln's actions and words - many of them authored by the six previously noted individuals. Those details of weighing the historical record do show the difficulty of capturing a complex personality. In addition, the author does examine the closeness of the living arrangements that Lincoln had with some male friends, especially Speed, and concludes that one must put that matter in the context of the times.<br /><br />Having previously read \\"Lincoln,\\" this book was interesting in its additional detail concerning some of Lincoln's relationships. But really there is no doubting which book is of more significance. The complete biography is nearly a masterpiece; this book is supplementary.aps best seen in the subtle manner in which Lincoln transformed a political rival, William Seward, into an unabashed admirer and devoted follower.

It is also the opportunity for the newly arrived Willie Traynor, fresh from dropping out of an \\"Ivy League\\"college after five uninspiring years and the surprising new owner (even to him) via his kindly grandmother of the county newspaper in serious decline, to make something of himself.<br />The Ford County Times dramatically increases circulation as it follows the Padgitt affair. The author follows Willie and his ad hoc assemblage of employees and his dealings with courthouse hanger-ons. By far the most interesting part of the book beyond the murder and its fallout is the relationship that Willie developes with the Ruffin family of the Lowdown section of town, especially with the matriarch, Miss Callie. Willie draws strength from the resolve of that family in overcoming the racial barriers of the South in those times.<br />The last chapter of the Padgitt affair begins with the release of Danny after only serving nine years of a life sentence. Everyone's worst fears are realized when a series of what seems to be revenge murders begins. The author brings the threads of Willie's newspaper ownership, the Ruffin family, and the Padgitt situation to an agreeable conclusion.	2004-02-09

For some, the rise of the stock market, low unemployment and inflation, and budget surpluses, when taken together, are proof positive that the Clinton years were as good as it gets for the economy. But not so fast says the author.<br />Clinton ran a \\"putting people first\\" campaign, but at some point a \\"center-right, Washington Consensus\\" direction was pursued. It was a neoliberal agenda that emphasized smaller government, free trade, and deregulation of financial markets. Inflation, fueled by wage demands, was kept in check through the threat of outsourcing jobs. Welfare rolls were drastically reduced by forcing welfare recipients to work at sub-poverty level wages. The Clinton administration and Alan Greenspan made no attempt to curb the speculative excesses of the financial markets. Stocks rose to unsustainable price to earning ratios. The economy was driven by both increased consumer debt and private investment. The obsession with larger and larger budget surpluses precluded making needed investments in infrastructure and education and training.<br />Part of the Washington Consensus is the participation of globally-oriented financial and trade bodies, such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO, who impose neoliberal policies when possible. The opening for these international bodies is when debt-ridden countries find themselves in untenable positions. But relief from these bodies is not unconditional. The countries are forced to privatize, eliminate subsidies for domestic purposes, cut government spending, and remove all restrictions on foreign investment. In addition, the countries are invariably pressured to pursue a strategy of producing for export to acquire the cash to pay off debts. Keeping wages low by disciplining workers is part of the strategy of exporting and attracting foreign manufacturers. The author shows that these neoliberal policies have had harsh effects in many countries, such as Mexico and Argentina.<br />Of course, the stock market bubble collapsed. The Federal Reserve had failed to exercise its power to limit speculation and now was unable to spur a recovery with huge cuts in the Federal Funds interest rate. The excessive investment during the Clinton boom had created excess capacity. The author continues with the Bush administration, which is even more committed to pursuing a neoliberal program. The massive tax cuts that are being pursued by Bush have added to the huge increase in inequality that occurred in the Clinton years. The resulting huge deficits preclude any increase in domestic spending but do allow the pursuit of a military agenda that seems geared to benefit multinational corporations. Again, it is hoped that inflation will be checked by worker insecurities.<br />It seems rather obvious that neoliberalism is unsustainable in the long-run. In an interesting take, the author presents neoliberalism as presenting problems that Marx, Keynes, and Polanyi delineated. He calls for the re-regulation of financial markets, limits on free trade, and more domestic investment, including full employment. But it is a glaring shortcoming of the book that no attempt is made to describe how such a redirection could or will come about. Can it happen only politically or must a major collapse on the scale of the Great Depression first occur?<br />For those who need convincing that the Clinton years were not as good as they seemed, this may be the book for you.e had harsh effects in many countries, such as Mexico and Argentina. <br />Of course, the stock market bubble collapsed.

But Patrick, aided by his new found love, Eva, is so far ahead of his pursuers that he orchestrates his own recapture in South America.<br />The book essentially recapitulates Patrick's elaborate planning in undercutting his partners and in faking his own death. Interrogations and interviews by lawyers and law enforcement personnel are the mechanisms for piecing together the story.<br />The author at times tries to portray Patrick as a victim, but his cocky personality does not support that position. Patrick's ability to be two moves ahead of everyone else borders on the unbelievable, a good example being his certainty that he could be recaptured and beat all charges against him. The book loses tension because it becomes obvious that Patrick is bullet-proof in that he has already thought of every eventuality.<br />In the end, the author comes close to undermining his entire book with an ending that is simply baffling in the context of all that has transpired.

It is not an analytical time; differences lying just below the surface are not allowed to detract from the fortuitous moment. And so it was with Michael and Pauline just after Pearl Harbor in 1941. Pauline is rushed into the small grocery of Michael's family in inner-city Baltimore for emergency first aid. Michael, the epitome of calmness, practicality, and orderliness, is smitten by the vibrant, impetuous, and emotional Pauline. Her spur-of-the-moment influence immediately exerts subtle pressure on Michael to join the Army. But he was out of his element and was essentially a failure, receiving, perhaps luckily, an early discharge after a training accident. This episode was only a small harbinger of what was to come in their marriage.<br />\\"The Amateur Marriage\\" is a truly insightful look at a marriage in perpetual conflict, where neither person really understands how to overcome their personality tendencies so that they can live in peace, hence an amateur marriage. Of course, the impact of the discord extends to the rest of the family, especially in the case of the oldest daughter Lindy. The author's account is not judgmental; however, it is clear that the volatility of Pauline has a more pronounced discordant impact than does Michael's somewhat plodding nature.<br />The novel covers sixty years with the story picking up every so many years. Is there an intriguing plot? Not really. It is a journey of two people struggling with their incompatibilities and the effects on their extended family. The book is actually a larger study in the disconnects among people. It is not just Pauline and Michael that the author turns her attention to. There are any number of miscommunications explored. The author has a real talent for capturing deficient interactions. Personally, I did not find the book to be \\"simplistic\\" as a reviewer claims. To the contrary, there is a lot of wisdom in this book.<br />In his later years, Michael does have the chance to be involved in a more harmonious relationship. The reader is left to ponder whether the new relationship fully erases the memories and pull of the past, despite the difficulties.e \\"simplistic\\" as a reviewer claims.

But Mundy is obviously disengaged from his job: he entertains, yet there is a distance and wariness about him. Mundy's stance becomes understandable when he merely senses the presence of Sasha, his \\"absolute\\" friend from the past and partner in radical politics and espionage, at one of his \\"performances\\" for the tourists.<br />Yes, Sasha has brought a furtively delivered message for Teddy, but first Le Carre must devote the first three-fourths of the book to exploring the paths that Ted and Sasha have come down leading to this moment. Essentially, Mundy lived his early life as an outsider. His birth was the result of the ignominious relationship of his father, a major for the British army in India, with a servant girl. The crumbling of the British Empire in India punctured any remaining illusions of self-importance for the major. Back in England in public schools, Ted survives his casting as an \\"Untouchable\\" and even thrives via adopting a nonconformist approach to the school, his studies, and his selection of acquaintances.<br />The Sasha phase of Ted's life begins with his arrival in Berlin after failing to complete his studies at Oxford. Ted leads a communal existence with like-minded radicals led by Sasha, a somewhat unappealing character with any number of skeletons in his closet. The group's petty activism inevitably brings a crackdown by the authorities and Ted is uprooted once more. He eventually finds himself working for the British Council, which involves foreign travel to support the British arts. At this point Ted becomes a successful double agent for England with Sasha as his East German interface. But the fall of the Wall and the governments of the East destroy the spy networks and Sasha is lost again.<br />Fast forward to the present. Sasha has met a shadowy character Dimitri interested in reopening Ted's failed school of language for the purpose of reeducating the populace in superpower excesses, such as those surrounding the Iraqi invasion. It is at this point that the myriad of intelligence forces from the past converge in a somewhat perplexing final confrontation involving both Ted and Sasha.<br />\\"Absolute Friends\\" is not best viewed as a book of action. Le Carre is more concerned with examining convenient illusions and deceptions, both perpetrated and self. Of course, espionage is the perfect vehicle for such an examination as it most certainly involves the art of promulgating and uncovering deceptions. Who best to participate in spying than those who have been forced to deal creatively with reality, as both Ted and Sasha most assuredly had through their years. As usual, Le Carre's use of language exquisitely captures the nuances of the British spy-world.<br />The reader's ride in \\"Friends\\" is not without its bumps, however. There is some disjointedness in the scrambling of Ted and in his losing and regaining contact with Sasha. Perhaps the murkiness of their actions is an apt metaphor for the world of espionage. Some may find some excess in the author's obvious displeasure with real-world superpower power. Le Carre aficionados will undoubtedly be able to overlook the plot disconnects and enjoy the overall feel of the world of spying that the author captures so well.Sasha has met a shadowy character Dimitri interested in reopening Ted's failed school of language for the purpose of reeducating the populace in superpower excesses, such as those surrounding the Iraqi invasion.

Caught in a minor scam at Wyatt, Cassidy is strongly persuaded to engage in industrial espionage at the rival company Trion Systems to prevent prosecution. But despite his considerable gifts at deception, his dicey charade seems to run into complications rather quickly.<br />Set in the telecommunications industry, most of the characters in this book are either scheming or engaged in some kind of one-up behavior.

Token attempts at depth of character, like the occasional second thought about being on the corporate fast track, don't come across well.<br />\\"Paranoia\\" has a pretty simplistic plot with characters often fortuitously driving the story onward. Telecom junkies could be amused or informed by the high tech focus.

But this author contends that areas in Georgia that were strongholds for the Alliance were not where the Populist Party was strongest in Georgia. This book examines the Populist Party from a Georgian perspective, focusing on its core members, the \\"wool-hat boys,\\" and their leaders.<br />The wool-hat boys were hard-working farmers increasingly under economic duress due to economic forces out of their control, including poor soil conditions, depressed prices for their cash crops, and the crop-lien system that kept them in virtual servitude. They are contrasted with the \\"silk-hat boys,\\" or city slickers who lived by exploiting the wool-hat boys. They were not primarily sharecroppers or tenants.<br />A new party in the South had to contend with the strength of the Democratic Party which had led the South into the Civil War and had led the resurgence against Reconstruction. A majority of farmers could never desert the party of their fathers. They were willing to remain with the Democrats even when looking for economic reforms. Nonetheless in the early 1890s, Populism was a significant political force.<br />The Tenth Congressional District in northeast Georgia was the center of Populism in Georgia. The author shows that the district had a long history of alternative politics, often supporting the Whig Party before the War. The district had been home to Alexander Stephens and Robert Toombs, two distinguished politicians who often took independent stances. The leader of the Populist Party in the Tenth District and the entire state was Tom Watson, himself a well-to-do farmer and lawyer.<br />The book focuses on the various personalities and factions of the Georgian Populist Party as they tried to gain ascendancy over each other and over the state government. One is struck by the crudeness and violence in the political campaigns of the late 1900s in Georgia. In addition, the issue of race played a prominent role in those campaigns in Georgia. Both the Democrats and the Populists used intimidation in controlling voting among blacks. As the Populist Party declined at the turn of the century the era of Jim Crow was advancing.<br />This book does not attempt a general overview of agrarianism and Populism, but it does add to the general understanding of Populism. The book is easy to read. A map is provided of the counties and districts of the 1890s showing populist strongholds. The book largely focuses on personalities, especially Tom Watson. One gets a sense from this book that Populism was not the profound democratic movement claimed by others, especially Goodwyn. The party was mildly reformist at best.ns of the Georgian Populist Party as they tried to gain ascendancy over each other and over the state government.

For Hofstadter, populists suffered from irrational status anxiety in a changing world; Populism was unjustified extremism. For Goodwyn, the agrarian movement was entirely rational having identified several financial structures and practices as leading to unfair outcomes for farmers.<br />Barnes is definitely in the Goodwyn camp. But whereas Goodwyn attempted a wholesale coverage of Populism, Barnes confines herself mostly to the Texas Alliance and the Populist Party in Texas. The closer examination of the cooperative methods used by the Alliance is a useful extension of Goodwyn's work.<br />The author, like Goodwyn, is concerned with the basis and nature of protest movements. Protest movements are examined under the categories of a structural strain perspective and a mobilization perspective. The first perspective is associated with the Hofstadter school. The author is especially concerned with debunking the idea that protest mobilizations that have any longstanding impact somehow \\"just happen\\" without formal organization.<br />The book is a very analytical assessment of mobilization theory using the agrarian movement and Populism as the laboratory. It provides key refinements and correctives of earlier work. It is highly recommended for understanding the phenomenon of Populism.	2004-01-04

These themes extolled the virtues of the independent working man, fully able to produce his own and society's well-being without being dependent upon or under the control of others. It is doubtful that this idyllic state has ever been achieved in America, but there is no doubt that in the 1870s and 80s small farmers in the Plains states and in the South suffered from the vicissitudes of both natural and economic forces undermining any sense of being in control of their economic destinies.<br />This book explores the actions of besieged rural Americans, first through cooperative efforts based on dense community ties, and then through political efforts, to counter the forces of industrialization. It is a complex story involving a variety of agrarian and labor organizations, though dominated by the National Farmers' Alliance with its beginnings in western Texas in 1878 and to some extent the Knights of Labor, ranging from the far West, through the Plains and the Midwest, and through the entire southern belt. Agrarian reformers were forever in a contest with the forces of orthodoxy from community values to the agendas of the Democratic and Republican parties; a contest that they would eventually lose.<br />The author admits to drawing upon the vast work of historians concerning Populism or agrarianism. The book is somewhat complementary to the work of Lawrence Goodwyn, author of the \\"Democratic Promise. He finds little agreement with those who view Populists as reactionaries, unwilling to accept the demands of progress.<br />While Goodwyn finds the core of Populism to be located in the southern Farmers' Alliance and is somewhat dismissive of agrarian movements in other regions, McMath is more generous in his estimation of the forces of reform in the western and northern plains. In addition, he pays more attention to organizations and movements that were forerunners to the agrarian movement. They both agree that the demise of the Alliance and the Knights of Labor eroded a base of activism and undermined the chances that the Populist Party could succeed.<br />Despite its relative brevity, this book is a highly readable and insightful overview of the Populist movement.

According to the author, the agrarian movement of the late 1880s, otherwise known as Populism, was in fact the last such great challenge. Beyond the history of the movement, the author is much concerned with the implications for future democratic movements.<br />The small farmers in western Texas in the 1880s recognized that the economic cards were stacked against them. The crop lien system and the \\"furnishing\\" merchant, the exorbitant prices paid for goods combined with low prices paid for cash crops, and the price gouging of railroads - all of these inspired some farmers to begin forming local alliances that would try to use cooperative methods to bypass those powerful interests that placed farmers in economic thralldom. Lecturers that spread across the South, and even westward and northward, drew upon close-knit farming community ties to eventually establish some 40,000 \\"sub-alliances\\" involving two million people, all finally part of a National Farmers Alliance. Through local trade stores, warehouses, and state exchanges, these sub-alliances attempted to buy and sell in bulk. But these efforts met with varying and limited success. Banking interests, grain elevator operators, and stockyards, among others, refused to deal with these farming groups, to accept their notes based on their cash crops and land.<br />It is hardly surprising, given their radical critique of economic interests, that agrarian organizers would turn to political action to seek redress for farmer grievances. Yet the turn to politics was a highly complicating development for agrarian reform. The agrarian platform was highly radical for the times involving such issues as land reform, labor rights, government ownership and control of transportation and communication, and banking and currency reform with the elimination of the gold standard. But the hold of generational allegiances to the Democratic and Republican parties prevented many farmers from shifting to independent politics despite the fact that their traditional parties were resolutely opposed to many of the farmers' measures. Attempts at reform through the traditional parties were met by cooptation and demagoguery.<br />The People's Party was formed at Omaha in July, 1892. The party's platform was the agrarian platform containing not only the National Alliance's sub-treasury plan, which was a plan for the issuance of greenbacks, but also calling for the free coinage of silver, both planks having the effect of increasing the money supply. Electoral success was limited. The Democratic Party through coopting of the silver issue and flagrant electoral fraud was able to defeat the Populists throughout the South, where they had their greatest support. In 1896 the People's Party through pre-convention intrigue actually nominated a staunch silver Democrat, William Jennings Bryan, for president, thus essentially ending the Populist movement. According to the author, Populism had become a \\"shadow\\" movement, a mere shell of its former orientation.<br />For the author, democratic mass movements that take issue with core aspects of society face almost insurmountable odds. In the first place, there are the assumptions that the \\"system\\" works, that the system contains mechanisms for continual progress and for overcoming problems. In fact, there exists an entire school of thought among historians that contends that the Populists were cranks unwilling to accept social progress and sought only to maintain an antiquated way of life. That school of thought is most closely associated with historian Richard Hofstadter. However, the author finds that the Populists' grievances were real enough while admitting the difficulties of overcoming the received culture. In addition, the author contends that the hierarchical nature of social structures and the accompanying deferential behavior make independent thought and action exceedingly difficult.<br />Genuine mass movements cannot be top-down driven. The formation of a mass movement that can achieve political viability must proceed from the ground up. Key to any such movement is the establishment of an independent institution that through the participation of its members develops an ideology and strategy that counters prevailing authority. The counter organization must educate and recruit new adherents. The agrarian movement was based on the sub-alliances and their cooperative ventures and achieved extensive recruitment and education through a lecturing system. The politicization step is often difficult to take and sustain because member activism takes on an indirect element in that it is geared to electoral success allowing party elites to then fully engage in the governmental process. Populism was ultimately unable to successfully take the political step.<br />The author suggests that the failures of Populism essentially defined the boundaries of the possible in fundamentally changing basic structures of American culture. First Progressivism and then liberalism all operated on a basis of incremental reform. In other words, the system works. The policies forming the Federal Reserve, allowing the constant rise of farm tenantry, and permitting the continued centralization and rise in influence of corporations all rejected or minimized the scope of the Populist program.<br />This book is a short form of the author's complete work, \\"The Democratic Promise.\\" At times the book takes on the feel of an overview. For example, it would have been interesting to see far more details concerning the actually workings of the various cooperative efforts at the sub-alliance level. And following the twin threads of the Alliance and the People's Party across many states and conventions over a ten year period can be a little sketchy.<br />The author's insights into forming mass democratic movements and mounting cultural challenges are outstanding. Those insights add to the understanding of Populism. It should give anyone pause when considering the ability of modern movements to impact the status quo.thought and action exceedingly difficult. <br />Genuine mass movements cannot be top-down driven.

The idea of republicanism originated in Roman times, was elaborated upon by Machiavelli, found a following among the educated English gentry in the 17th century, and is a somewhat plausible description of the first one hundred years of U.S. society. But the book is only minimally interested in detailing any real-world implementations of republican ideas past or present.<br />Traditionally, republicanism has focused on the rights of civic-minded, virtuous, and independent elites to be free from the tyranny of emperors, kings, and the like. Those economically dependent on others (and most are) were not suitable candidates for the enjoyment of republican freedom. The Jeffersonian era is often described as republican because of a large base of independent farmers. Republicanism does not actually imply a precise form of government. A benign monarch can be seen as honoring republican ideas as much as a democratically elected government. At least historically, republicanism does seem to imply limited government with a large civic sphere. But public life in the modern era exists in a truncated form. The author scarcely discusses the isolation and privatization of modern life. It cannot be ignored that the rise of huge corporations has walled off more and more of society's daily actions from public view and control.<br />The author eschews the liberal idea that republican freedom consists mostly of the lack of interference from those powerfully situated. Instead, he emphasizes the lack of domination, even the potential for domination, as the key element of republicanism. The possibility, regardless of how remote, of arbitrary interference undermines the full development of republican freedom. Such a possibility requires that defensive strategies be employed to avoid the powerful or to curry favor with them. In addition, in the author's conception of republicanism, all of society should be free from even a chance of capricious domination.<br />This level of republican freedom requires both the rule of law backed by a strong state and a presence in such private institutions as the family and corporations. Republicanism, either in the ancient or in the author's version, is not a theory of participatory democracy. Yet republicanism requires an active and virtuous citizenry ever vigilant for the use of arbitrary power. For the author the power of democracy is in the ability to contest actions and not in the construction of citizen friendly laws and customs. Why citizen empowerment on the front end is problematical but is necessary on the back end is bound to be puzzling to many readers. Is the citizenry virtuous and capable or not?<br />As other reviewers have noted, the book is exceedingly repetitious with endless, minute distinctions being made between republican freedom and freedom as non-interference. The author never makes clear how a government of divided powers and a regime of law that is clearly self-constraining can penetrate the broader society, especially in the private realm, to establish republican freedom, or non-denomination. How can the author not be aware of, or at least not address, the immense power of corporations and institutions of the media and education to shape and direct the direction of government and all of our lives. The theory of republicanism, even in the expanded form voiced by the author, seems woefully inadequate for the comprehensive tyrannies of the modern era.hould be free from even a chance of capricious domination.<br />This level of republican freedom requires both the rule of law backed by a strong state and a presence in such private institutions as the family and corporations.

(4.5 stars)	It could be said that our economy functions at a level that has basically eliminated scarcity, but Greider is concerned with the tremendous costs imposed on the greater society and on the environment by our economic system. His argument is that corporate capitalism with the complicity of government at all levels has had significant deleterious effects notwithstanding the obvious material abundance. Greider is improbably optimistic that isolated actions of dedicated citizens - he calls them pioneers - or socially-oriented bodies can modify capitalism and its destructive consequences through grassroots approaches or special leverages.<br />The author emphasizes that corporate capitalism is in fundamental conflict with society in its consideration of human beings. Corporate employees are little more than factors of production, essentially divested of their humanity. Individual and social concerns are secondary to the almost obsessive corporate fixation on the bottom line. The author makes it exceedingly clear that the \\"master-slave\\" relationship imposed on workers in virtually all private companies stands in distinct contradiction to the notion of \\"free American citizens,\\" able to fully participate in all social affairs. Lost in corporate thinking, is the fact that corporations are in fact small societies.<br /><br />One would scarcely know today that the general citizenry once indirectly controlled corporations. Corporations were chartered by state legislatures for specific, limited purposes with public obligations. But in an attempt to attract corporations, some states began eliminating those limitations. The Supreme Court, in 1886, solidified corporate standing by declaring them to be legal \\"persons\\" with 14th Amendment rights to due process. As the author notes, society now must react after the fact to corporate excesses rather than exerting up front control.<br />Greider contends that for workers to be able to exercise the democratic-like rights necessary to ensure that companies operate without harming the larger society or the environment, it is fundamental that they become \\"owners\\" of their firms. Beyond \\"do-no-harm\\" standards, corporations need to take the initiative to become more efficient, to develop biologically degradable materials, and to recycle their products. However, authentic worker ownership is extremely rare in the United States. The author readily admits that ESOPs, a touted form of employee ownership, do not carry with them any inherent rights to participate in corporate decision making.<br /><br />The financial system in the United States, consisting of investment and banking institutions, among others, has become ascendant over the last thirty years in shaping the nature of American capitalism. Those institutions emphasize short term profits and rising stock market prices while downplaying the long term interests of both the economic system and society. The author suggests that it is mostly a convenient fiction that these pressures are exerted to benefit anonymous shareholders. However, CEO compensation and the ability to leverage buyouts are rewarded by the short term manipulation of stock prices.<br /><br />The author suggests that structural conditions do exist within the financial system that have the potential to exert reforming pressures on corporations. Pension funds are huge owners of corporate financial assets. Those ownership stakes can often enable funds to force corporations to not opt for short-term gains achieved by such measures as downsizing workforces or degrading the environment. Pension funds do have the fiduciary responsibility to act in the long-term interests of their beneficiaries, that is, employees. In addition to pension funds, the author points to investment funds that rate corporations on the socially beneficial effects of their operations.<br />Though the author points to new ownership forms, socially conscious investing, and positive environmental actions, he makes no claimthat those efforts are widespread or having much impact. And the political system, as it is presently constituted, will not hold corporations accountable for the \\"externalities\\" that they generate. The political process has been captured by special interests (mostly big business) that produces, at best, pseudo legislation loaded with loopholes designed for evasion by those same special interests.<br />However, it is difficult to understand the author's greater confidence that political action at the local and state level can readily alter corporate practices. Politicians at those levels are in competition with similar governments to gain favor with corporations. It was, in fact, the federal government that mandated inescapable, nation-wide reforms that brought the country out of the Great Depression. Of course, corporations have increasingly defeated or avoided that regulatory framework that was concerned with \\"legal rights for workers, antitrust standards, and social and economic regulations.\\"<br />The author recognizes that American capitalism subtly encourages the distancing of citizens from the operational centers of key social and economic institutions. The citizenry is scarcely aware that its formal democratic control of society has been usurped by autocratic corporations. Consumerism has essentially replaced the practice of democracy as the primary exercise of freedom. However, all is not well.<br /><br />There are feelings of distress in our modern society. But for a public debate to occur concerning the structure and purpose of corporations, there has to be a perception that they may be at the root of societal dysfunctions. The reform efforts that Greider has noted cannot be discounted, but contrary to his hopes, there is no doubt that it will take a New Deal type of effort through federal legislation to counter corporate power. Fundamental is the need to surpass the scope of current labor law and establish formal democracy within corporations for workers. Citizens must have a voice in our primary economic institutions that have such large societal effects. From that must flow other corporate reforms such as ecological sustainability.<br />It is a mild criticism of the book that little direct attention is paid to the profound ability of media conglomerates and educational institutions to greatly sway public thinking. It is hardly surprising that American capitalism is, for the most part, unquestioned. The author's optimism for reform is ultimately tempered: \\"As it presently functions, the economy is certain to generate still greater inequality, still more pointless impoverishment of lives, more social destruction, more empty political combat, and more wreckage for future generations to clean up.\\"t those efforts are widespread or having much impact.

The book contains scattered reminisces of Miller's childhood and long political career, generous amounts of \\"down-home\\" moralizing, and assurances, as far as core Democratic issues go, that \\"he has been there and done that.\\" He claims to have personally lived in meager circumstances (in today's lexicon, in poverty), to be a committed conservationist, and to not have a discriminatory bone in his body, rejecting his publicly-spoken racist statements as a young man. In other words, Miller wants to convince us that he is the true Democrat, in touch with the issues and, above all, values of middle-America. However, it is extremely odd that a book that is so assertive in its condemnations makes little effort to examine numerous contemporary economic issues that are having an impact on working Americans and are traditionally addressed by Democrats.<br /><br />Millions of manufacturing jobs have been replaced by low-wage service work; free-trade agreements have resulted in a substantial drain of jobs to overseas locations with harsh working regimes; a variety of visa programs are both putting downward pressures on wages and stealing jobs from many technical and professional Americans; and out-of-control corporations operate with impunity to manipulate markets, loot retirement accounts, and redistribute income upwards as never done before. Not only are these, and many other, extremely important and harmful core Democratic issues not discussed by Miller, but one does not learn how Democrats are handling them.<br /><br />There is so little analysis of what national Democrats are actually thinking, saying, and doing, that the reader is left to puzzle over Miller's strong disapproval of them. To Miller, Democrats are \\"die-hard liberals\\" and members of the \\"loony left\\" and would require him to keep his \\"left turn signal blinking and burning brightly\\" were he to follow their lead. This sort of gratuitous labeling is designed to stop understanding political issues in its tracks.<br /><br />Miller claims that Democrats are captured by many \\"special interests,\\" which he derisively labels as the \\"Groups.\\" It is absolutely true that Democrats attempt to represent a greater variety of societal elements, some better organized than others, than do Republicans. For example, labor unions and environmental groups bring informed interest to bear on real problems, which apply to Southerners, as well as to Northerners. Miller's fixation on the detriments of \\"groups\\" undercuts his willingness to recognize and address legitimate issues. However, Miller is totally silent on the impact of the largest interest group on politicians, and that is the massive big business lobby. The groups trying to influence Democrats only wish that they could have the insider status that business lobbyists do. The regulatory bodies in this country have been captured by industry insiders. The financial harm done to ordinary citizens by the failure of S&L regulators, the SEC, and utility regulators, etc has been enormous. Of course, corporate PAC money dwarfs that contributed by all other bodies in election cycles. These are issues for \\"true\\" Democrats.<br /><br />It is perfectly clear that Miller has not been a life-long Democrat because of a careful study of the pros and cons of various parties. Actually, Miller inherited his Democratic leaning from his mother, a die-hard Democrat. She was, in Miller's words, a strong supporter of FDR and disliked Hoover, who essentially abandoned working people in the Great Depression. Miller seems to be completely unaware of the ironies here. FDR and his band of Progressives implemented by far the most radical economic program that this country has ever seen. Many Democrats of that day were to the left of today's \\"liberals\\" that Miller is now so keen to castigate. Yet he finds no fault with FDR. How inconsistent can one get?<br /><br />Milleris especially disingenuous in his explanations for the demise of national Democrats in the South. The national Democratic Party accommodated the racist, Southern wing of the party until the mid-1960s. After Johnson's Great Society initiative, it was first Goldwater, then the Nixon Republicans, who began to capture the old-South vote with subtle racist appeals. More recently, Southern suburbanites have been captured by the free-market mantra and tax-cuts of the right. Republicans have also tried to capture the \\"values\\" argument. The relatively greater affluence of Republican supporters helps them to avoid some of the social dysfunctions of poorer people, who are scapegoated as having poor character. Democrats, by association with their lower income support base, get labeled as lacking \\"values.\\" But it is an insidious conceit to claim moral superiority.<br /><br />In a real stretch, Miller accuses national Democrats as simply writing off Southerners, regarding them as back-woods ignoramuses. Furthermore, he attaches disproportionate importance to national Democrats not being intimately familiar with details of Southern culture. They are supposed to know how to eat catfish correctly, and indulge in all other arcane Southern habits. Of course, none of that has any connection to politics.

The national Democratic Party accommodated the racist, Southern wing of the party until the mid-1960s. After Johnson's Great Society initiative, it was first Goldwater, then the Nixon Republicans, who began to capture the old-South vote with subtle racist appeals. More recently, Southern suburbanites have been captured by the free-market mantra and tax-cuts of the right. Republicans have also tried to capture the \\"values\\" argument. The relatively greater affluence of Republican supporters helps them to avoid some of the social dysfunctions of poorer people, who are scapegoated as having poor character. Democrats, by association with their lower income support base, get labeled as lacking \\"values.\\" But it is an insidious conceit to claim moral superiority.     In a real stretch, Miller accuses national Democrats as simply writing off Southerners, regarding them as back-woods ignoramuses. Furthermore, he attaches disproportionate importance to national Democrats not being intimately familiar with details of Southern culture. They are supposed to know how to eat catfish correctly, and indulge in all other arcane Southern habits. Of course, none of that has any connection to politics.

US	52280224	R2ZZ4YYLDFXPYB	0801488702	568960113	The Next Upsurge: Labor and the New Social Movements (ILR Press Book)	Books	3	19	29	N	Y	Upsurge Fantasy	The central premise of this book is that a progressive \\"political-social-economic reversal\\" is likely to occur in the United States and will be driven by a transformed and advancing labor movement. This contention is made against the fact that the unionization rate of private sector workers in the US has dropped from 39 to 9 percent in the last fifty years. The author's optimism is based on some recent organizing successes and on the possibilities of drawing upon a social movement paradigm. However, it is problematical that the author does little in the way of exploring the ideological or political basis for any such upsurge.<br />In the 1990s some unions took advantage of the community support systems of \\"ghettoized\\" Latinos and blacks doing low-wage service work to apply militant pressure and win labor contracts for such workers as janitors, nursing home attendants, and dry-wall workers, etc. In a different vein, Harvard clerical workers were able to develop a potent solidarity over the course of fifteen painstaking years of developing relationships resulting in a unique and cooperative contract with Harvard University. However, few workers now live in small urban communities where many may work for the same or similar employers. Suburbanization has undermined that key basis of worker solidarity. The focus on immigrant communities and unique organizing situations seems to write off the vast majority of American workers.<br />The author casts a longing eye on the civil and feminist movements of the past as possible paradigms for a renewed labor movement. But he does not acknowledge the fundamental difference between movements trying to exercise basic political rights and one that is cast as infringing on private property rights, which is exactly how corporations view unionization drives. The Civil Rights movement led to general public pressure to stop the deprivation of basic rights to all citizens. Any number of other movements such as the 1960s anti-war movement, the environmental movement, and more recently the anti-sweatshop movement has successfully illuminated various flaws or hypocrisies in our political and economic systems. However, none of those movements has posed a fundamental challenge to the capitalistic economic system.<br />In the decades prior to WWI, before the resurgence of labor in the 1930s, sizeable segments of the American working class were well aware that capitalism took away control of their economic destinies. The Knights of Labor, the IWW, and the socialists all contested this loss of control. But their influence had largely disappeared by the late 1920s. It was, in fact, the extreme excesses of capitalism, coupled with the fact of an urbanized working class, which led to the resurgence of labor in 1930s. Despite unemployment rates of 30 percent, the state and economic elites were able to contain discontent by creating a labor relations system whereby unions partnered with management in a social accord where adequate wages and benefits were the quid pro quo for restraining worker activism. The grievance systems found in most bargaining agreements were elementary forms of workplace systems of justice. However, in no sense, did workers achieve democracy within workplaces.<br />What is to be learned about the labor upsurge of the 1930s? As noted, a sizeable minority of the working class gained mostly material benefits along with some job security. But a majority of the working class was not included in this compact, especially blacks and women. Was there a transformation in the political thought of the working class? At best, this labor upsurge resulted in a short lived, mildly social democratic slant in the larger political system. In the last 30 years the American working class has supported politicians who have constructed a global neoliberal system that has been highly detrimental to their interests.<br />A key theme in the book is that had the labor movement joined with social movements over thepast decades, the economic terrain would now be favorable to workers. But the constituencies and relationship to the remainder of society of unions and single issue movements are sufficiently different to call into question any synergistic joining together. The author continues this theme by calling for a \\"fusion\\" of labor with progressive movements. Other than a few isolated instances of labor-community actions and some middle-class college kids smearing egg on the face of some oblivious college administrators, the nature of how this fusion would work is not addressed. Actually, some critics see serious shortcomings in emphasizing the mobilization of close-knit communities in union campaigns, calling it \\"militancy without democracy.\\" Worker democracy to many is no less than the full participation of workers or elected representatives in most workplace decision making.<br />This author, like most labor advocates, does not address whether American labor unions effectively serve the interests of the working class. The labor-friendly institutions of European social democracies provide one measuring standard. A combination of labor-influenced political parties, works councils, and active employment policies surpass the minimalist American system. Furthermore, those bodies and structures serve the entire working class and not the small minority found in American unions. European unions operate within the confines of this system.<br />In addition, labor commentators seldom comment on the political sophistication and participation of the American working class. Given the fact that economic and political elites have generally constructed a political and economic system that immensely benefits them, it is difficult to understand a labor strategy that does not directly and substantially attempt to transform that system. Ad hoc organizing or single issue mobilizations are unlikely to substantially alter the status quo.<br />The reader is left wondering what is the basis for any sort of progressive upsurge. The forces and thinking for such an upsurge simply do not exist. The labor movement has not in 80 years led a radical challenge to the current economic system that favors the few over the many. Of course, if unemployment ever reaches 30 percent again, there will be an upsurge of some type. But the author's suggestion of an upsurge is not based on that occurring.past decades, the economic terrain would now be favorable to workers.

US	52280224	RLKXNJ7A9XSV4	038072880X	937357785	High Crimes	Books	3	7	8	N	Y	Is your husband who you think he is? (3.5 stars)	High Crimes begins with great promise: idyllic lives are shattered with the sudden appearance of federal agents with the intent of arresting the husband of successful attorney and law professor, Claire Heller Chapman. The arrest warrant is for Ron Kubick, not Tom Chapman, the name by which Claire had always known her husband. To add to Claire's astonishment, Ron/Tom escapes from the agents through a series of highly athletic and violent escape moves that an investment consultant could scarcely possess.<br />As it turns out, Ron has evaded answering for war crimes that he allegedly committed some thirteen years prior as a member of an ultra-secret special operations unit. Part of the evasion was the creation of an entirely new person. Claire, convinced of her husband's innocence, decides to defend him despite her ignorance of the workings of military justice. About half of the book is concerned with the actions of Claire and her two attorney partners, one a black man rescued off of a scrap heap and the other a young JAG officer, in dealing with military trial procedures and is somewhat interesting.<br />The plot, though perhaps a bit on both the unbelievable and predictable sides, moves fairly steadily. It is in the area of character development and interactions that the book exhibits some shortcomings. Some of the characters' actions just do not feel right. A petite attorney kneeing her husband in the groin after a reunion under trying circumstances seems bizarre. The interactions with the six year old daughter are especially grating. Numerous other exchanges seem spliced together. One reviewer comments on the improved dialog. There is still a ways to go.<br />High Crimes has a good overall story line, but the discontinuities, as noted, do not help it. Not having read other Finder books, it will be interesting to see if a smoother presentation can be found in other and future books.	2003-10-10
US	52280224	R1SOG1ODQAAU8H	0060524367	287340205	The Middle Mind: Why Americans Don't Think for Themselves	Books	3	24	37	N	Y	Pseudo Artistic Interest and Propagandistic Control	The principal point of \\"The Middle Mind\\" is that imagination, thought, and creativity are in short supply in our culture, which results in distortions and limitations in such areas as art, philosophy, politics, etc. While many books of this genre tend to broadly criticize society, the approach here is directed mostly towards the upper layers of society. The author defines the \\"middle mind\\" as \\"a vehicle that promises a culture of intelligence, seriousness, and care.\\" The middle mind supports PBS programming, environmental protection, and the arts; it is generally liberal minded. But the author contends that this support is of dubious significance.  Because the middle mind is lacking as noted above, it generally is not capable of distinguishing between those matters and items that have genuine quality and merit and those that are merely a pretense. So high culture does not benefit, but suffers, from the influence of the middle mind.<br />The author cites numerous examples from the entertainment industry that to him represent the workings of the middle mind. A somewhat controversial inclusion is NPR's \\"Fresh Air\\" program, hosted by Terry Gross, described as \\"charming and banal.\\" The \\"Antiques Road Show\\" of PBS \\"has turned arts and antiquities into crude commodity fetishism.\\" Ken Burns' PBS documentaries meet the middle mind's requirement that art be \\"entertaining, fun, and interesting,\\" irrespective of any intellectual content, which is highly limited in Burns' productions. Steven Speilberg's film, \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" is subjected to a withering analysis by the author for its failures to contest the premises and conduct of war. The author notes that a primary function of entertainment is to \\"stabilize the inevitability and naturalness of the present disposition of things.\\"<br />In the author's estimation, academia, especially in the area of the humanities, has become \\"unwitting allies of the Middle Mind\\" by assailing unfettered imagination. With the rise of Cultural Studies programs, art and literature are \\"read\\" with the political and social agenda of the critic being the foremost criterion of the analysis. Art is not permitted to stand on its own, but must make a congenial social statement. Furthermore, the artist is expected to purge any historically incorrect thinking from his or her work.<br />The author devotes a not insignificant part of the book to multi-page, biting criticisms of other cultural critics and commentators. In one case the author of a \\"no-brow\\" social critique is subjected to the author's disdain. Finding fault in the subtleties of argument may be a reason for academics to declare victory, but a large dose of that is not necessarily all that appealing to the general reader who is not even aware of the various targeted critics' work.<br />Moving beyond the realm of entertainment and cultural criticism, the author recognizes that politics, militarism, and business have immense effects on the imagination. Scientific and technological thinking dominate the world of business and the military and have thoroughly penetrated and narrowed the American imagination. A \\"reverence\\" for technological thinking squeezes out a broader social imagination. The author castigates a view that holds that this is an age for creative \\"geeks.\\" He maintains that capitalism co-opts creativity into \\"vocationalism\\" or into a narrow job focus. The \\"creative economy\\" does not require artists, but only those that are \\"stupid-smart.\\"<br />The rise of the middle mind may seem at first glance to be innocuous enough. Who cares if the ability to interpret and appreciate art is in short supply? But all is not so benign. Entertainment and the media, in accordance with a middle mind mentality, obfuscate the \\"inescapable\\" contradictions of capitalism. This is done primarily by flooding cultural space with a \\"frenzy of communication and information.\\" The difficulty of penetrating this communication deluge is not be minimized. For instance, thereis the \\"truth\\" of technical progress that is accepted without question in the US. The fact that most of our advanced technologies are accident-prone is concealed beneath layers of misleading statistics.<br />The political system is a full partner with global capital in bypassing the nation-state as the location of political and economic power. NAFTA, IMF, WTO, and EEU all transcend nations with profound effects. The author contends that we have as a nation adopted a form of unconsciousness regarding the true nature of globalization. At some level, we know that \\"our lifestyle has for the last half-century been the equivalent of a state of war between ourselves and those folks who will provide us cheap, cheap natural resources and, more recently, cheap, cheap consumer goods.\\" But politicians and the media are skilled at wringing \\"sentimental patriotism\\" from the public in support of military actions to maintain a world order that supports our extravagances.<br /><br />Surely the author is not wrong to emphasize the fact that imagination and thought are essential to any sort of progressive, rational, and just society. The essentiality of art is perhaps less obvious. A failure to interpret or appreciate a work of art with the same degree of expertise as the author is not properly an indictment of the overall intellectual capacity of an individual.<br />The book is not especially well organized - it seems patched together at times. Its message is not clear. Incompetent artistic appreciation is unsatisfactorily intermixed with the propagandistic efforts of large institutions. The commentary on inadequate artistic vision often seems quarrelsome and petty. The large institutions, like the military and corporations, are not analyzed in any systematic manner for their effects on imagination. Political parties, public education, and the labor movement do not appear in the book. The working class is non existent. It's not certain that, in the end, the \\"why\\" of not thinking is adequately addressed. And the book has no index, which is important because of the myriad of names mentioned.<br /><br />I would say this is a niche book. For general commentary on the impact of powerful institutions on society, better books could be found.

US	52280224	R2I37MQ7ZU4909	0807127426	46332283	Grant, Lee, Lincoln and the Radicals: Essays on Civil War Leadership	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Interesting Glimpses at some key Civil War Issues	This is a slim volume of four essays that turn their attention to three issues of the Civil War: the significance of Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee in their conduct of war for the Northern and Southern sides, and the relationship of President Lincoln with the Radical Republicans during the War. These essays probably assume readers already well versed in the history of the times, although they are not too obscure for the general reader.<br />Author Bruce Catton establishes immediately that the Civil War was not the classic \\"war of professionals, with set rules, established values, and recognized limits.\\" The Civil War was all-out warfare fought by soldier-citizens for whom the only acceptable outcome was total victory. It was Grant, after a series of failed generals, who finally dealt with the exigencies and peculiarities of the war and devised a strategy leading to victory. Grant was aggressive in his pursuit of the war and understood the need to destroy the other's army and not simply gain strategic points through maneuver, all done with untrained, yet willing, troops. It is clear that the North had an immense advantage in resources, but it was left to Grant to devise a multi-pronged, total war effort and use this advantage in resources by continually pressing the enemy.<br />Lee was dealt a difficult hand to play in the Civil War. He was outmanned two or three to one; his advantage of internal rail lines did not prove to be that beneficial; Southern localism detracted from a united front; and the defense of the Southern agricultural system dependent on slavery required that troops be dispersed much too widely. The author, Charles Roland, points out that Lee was not given command of all of the Southern army until the war was essentially over, though his advice to Jefferson Davis was valued. As commander of the Northern Virginia army, Lee had an uncanny ability to predict Northern strategy and troop movements. His strategy to penetrate into Northern territory to strike fear into the civilian population, aid Northern peace advocates, and perhaps end the war was a bold initiative. But the Southern army was routed at Gettysburg in July of 1863, partially due to poor strategy and execution; it was not Lee's finest moment. The author suggests that Lee did not, at times, control his subordinate officers sufficiently well to prevent uncoordinated or ineffective battlefield actions. After Gettysburg the Southern war effort was doomed, but Lee prolonged the Confederacy for a year (1864-65) by resisting the final push of Grant towards Richmond with a series of excellent counter moves and stands. The author calls that effort \\"one of the most prodigious military efforts of the modern age.\\"<br />The essays by David Donald and T. Harry Williams are brief, but in depth, looks at the Radical Republicans and their influence on President Lincoln. While the essays are interesting and informative, they are actually a continuation of an insider dispute among academic historians as to the significance of the Radicals during the War. Donald claims that all Republicans generally shared the same beliefs and that it is virtually impossible to identify a group of Republicans or a set of policies that can be definitively labeled \\"Radical.\\" He holds that differences among members of a party are normal. However, he does not disagree that there was widespread disagreement, even disapproval, with Lincoln by many Republicans. Williams, on the other hand, finds that a group of Republicans were doctrinaire about their beliefs concerning the eradication of slavery, opposed to the more pragmatic approach of Conservative Republicans. These Radicals even made attempts to usurp executive authority and privilege in the conduct of the war and in the choice of Cabinet members. Lincoln was largely able to deflect such pressures. The post-Civil War period is not covered in these essays, but it would seem that what influence the Radicals may have had was fleeting given the return to dominance of the white elite in the South.<br />All of these essays are mere glimpses into the Civil War era. Perhaps they would be clarifying for some or stimulate more investigation by others.ven the return to dominance of the white elite in the South. <br />All of these essays are mere glimpses into the Civil War era.

But history is not pure subjectivity; historical truth is a \\"reasonable approximation of the past.\\" Despite the title of the book, the author does not directly address the issue of \\"ownership\\" of history. There is the question of who produces history. Is history mainly produced by academic historians, which slowly filters into the public's consciousness? Or is historical understanding dominated by large institutions such as the mass media, think tanks, and the education industry, many of whom are inclined to promote an historical agenda? The author acknowledges that \\"for years historians have been aware that historical traditions are invented and manipulated. In addition, \\"forgetting some aspects of the past is as much a part of historical understanding as remembering others.\\" This may be due simply to ignorance or poor scholarship. Or more disturbingly, historical distortion may be a sinister effort by various social and economic elites to dominate and manipulate social understandings.<br /><br />The United States is a nation founded on the ideals of liberty, political equality and democracy. We are not a traditional society where unquestioned myths passed down from generation to generation are the glue of society. Openness and informed debate about all matters, including those historical, are essential in a society based on rational decision making. Not understanding our principles, how we have lived up to them, and where we need to go is not an option. Yet, it is clear that the injection of bogus historical views into our national understandings has plagued our society in the past and continues to do so today.<br /><br />Three essays deal with the legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction. A determined Southern elite and a complicit Supreme Court essentially negated the citizenship rights that blacks had achieved in landmark legislation after the Civil War. But that history is often buried or distorted. Prominent Northern historians of the times validated the Jim Crow era by suggesting that blacks lacked the capacity for self-government. The focus on nationalism, or the right of white Anglo-Saxon America to become an imperial power at the end of the 19th century, further obscured the suppression of rights for some American citizens.<br /><br />It is this decades-long willful amnesia of the Reconstruction era that has permitted the Supreme Court in the modern era to see unfairness in racial preferences while ignoring the history of racial injustice. Conveniently, judicial decisions are now supposedly rendered on the basis of \\"original intent\\" or \\"strict construction.\\" However, the author notes that the language of the Fourteenth Amendment was purposely \\"broad and indeterminate\\" to give maximum leeway to the judiciary in the implementation of the amendment. The narrow legal judgments of today in this area actually ignore original intent in their rush to yield to political exigencies.<br /><br />In one of these essays, the author critically examines Ken Burns' nine-part PBS series on the Civil War. The author finds that \\"Burns recapitulates the very historical understanding of the war `invented' in the 1890s as part of the glorification of the national state and the nationwide triumph of white supremacy.\\" For Burns the Civil War was a \\"family quarrel among whites, whose fundamental accomplishment was the preservation of the Union.\\" The abolition of slavery is scarcely mentioned, not to mention the failure of Reconstruction to secure civil rights for former slaves. In the final segment Burns focuses on the friendly reunion in 1913 of white veterans of Gettysburg. In a devastating comment, the author notes that in that same year President Wilson segregated federal office buildings in WashingtonD.C. As the author says, \\"Accurately remembered, the events of Reconstruction place the issue of racial justice on the agenda of modern life - but not if the history of that era and the costs paid on the road to reunion are ignored, misrepresented, or wished away.\\"<br /><br />In another essay, the author examines the impact that globalization is having on the definition of the long-cherished American ideal of freedom. Transnational institutions and corporations through their think tanks and control of the media have redefined freedom as participation in a global free-marketplace. Gone are the \\"elements of freedom such as self-government, economic autonomy, and social justice\\" that were a part of the republican tradition in America. Strong national governments attempting to regulate economic matters are portrayed as impediments in a global economy. The author admits that freedom is constantly subject to redefinition, but freedom defined as merely competing in global production ignores American traditions of freedom. It may not be an overstatement to contend that \\"the relationship between globalization and freedom may be the most pressing political and social problem of the 21st century.\\"<br /><br />In other interesting essays, the career of historian Richard Hofstadter is examined and the oft-asked question concerning the absence of socialism in American is reviewed. Hofstadter gets tagged as a \\"consensus\\" historian because he noted that the \\"virtues of individual liberty, private property, and capitalist enterprise\\" were broadly agreed upon by most Americans. The author notes that Hofstadter did not celebrate this uniformity, finding it to be a \\"form of intellectual and political bankruptcy,\\" which echoes the findings of Tocqueville one hundred years earlier. Yet consensus theories do have resiliency. The absence of class-based activism and turns to socialism are partly answered by the existence in varying degrees of republicanism or \\"producerism,\\" the absorption or cooptation of protest, the substitution of consumption as empowerment, the divisions and stratifications of the working class, and winner-take-all elections.<br /><br />Clearly the concept of history is hardly as straightforward as may be thought at first glance. \\"Who Owns History?\\" is an excellent attempt at getting a handle on historical interpretation and the ramifications thereof.rately remembered, the events of Reconstruction place the issue of racial justice on the agenda of modern life - but not if the history of that era and the costs paid on the road to reunion are ignored, misrepresented, or wished away.\\"    In another essay, the author examines the impact that globalization is having on the definition of the long-cherished American ideal of freedom.

Practiced by huge transnational corporations and financial institutions with vast support from central governments, neoliberalism essentially transforms entire societies, destroying traditional ways of life and forcing individuals, sometimes with violence, to conform to its dictates. Not surprisingly, capitalistic institutions unleash immense propagandistic efforts to tout capitalism's unmatched outputs while obscuring the demands and burdens that it places on societies and individuals. \\"Naming the System\\" penetrates these purposeful obfuscations and describes the actual workings and impact of capitalism.<br />The field of neoclassical economics provides a theoretical basis for the workings of capitalism. Though now dominant in universities and economic institutions, the author repeatedly takes issue with its essential premises.  Especially irritating is the unwillingness of neoclassical economists to acknowledge the \\"contradictions\\" of capitalism, that is, its failure to deliver as predicted. It is difficult to not come to the conclusion that the entire discipline of neoclassical economics is subservient to the business class.<br />Neoclassical economic theory posits \\"individuals,\\" all seeking to maximize their self-interests by freely operating in various marketplace settings, as the core actors in capitalism. According to the theory, this \\"free-market\\" activity operates within the context of fundamental laws of supply and demand, and will result in socially optimal outcomes. However, to regard all market actors as essentially equal \\"individuals\\" is highly misrepresentative. Multi-billion dollar corporations often can monopolize markets, manipulate consumers through advertising, and otherwise leverage their tremendous advantages in resources. But neoclassical economists are loath to admit that the dynamics of power, inequality, and coercion can tilt markets.<br />A huge gap in the theory of the general benevolence of markets is that a society of self-interested maximizers will often fail to generate even basic, needed social outcomes. Conveniently, neoclassical economists leave it to governments to fill in where markets fail by doing such things as building roads and bridges, providing for national defense and public schools, and providing a legal structure and the enforcement necessary to conduct business. Neoclassicists are far less sanguine about the need to regulate or otherwise deal with the side effects of marketplace actions. According to the theory, self-interested businesses do not have to deal with the social effects of causing environmental degradation in production, laying-off workers, or paying poverty-level wages, because the marketplace will. However, it is simply not likely that the random acts of relatively uninformed and powerless individuals will be aggregated sufficiently to affect social outcomes through the marketplace. Neoclassicists insist that market actors always exercise \\"free choice.\\" Of course, they have to ignore the fact that such factors as the lack of actual equal opportunity to be well educated and to associate with employment enhancing individuals and the subtle coercion of a large pool of unemployed workers are not freely chosen conditions and do undermine free-market activity.<br />The author insists that capitalism, or its latest incarnation as neoliberalism, be judged on its worldwide economic performance. Many Third World nations, in exchange for economic assistance, under directives by international, neoliberal economic bodies, such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the WTO, have accordingly opened their economies to global corporations and liberalizing economic forces. But results have hardly been encouraging. Since 1980 there has been no growth in per capita GDP in these countries and they have fallen further behind rich nations, not drawing nearer as predicted. Structural adjustment policies have forced millions of peasants from their lands into sprawling urban ghettos with only sporadic contingent and informal sector work available. It is hard to resist the conclusion that neoliberalism is a mechanism to disadvantage working people and to permit global corporations to exploit them.<br />The author acknowledges that capitalism can produce a vast array of goods, but that productivity comes at a cost to societies and individuals. Though neoclassicists declared capitalism to be recession proof in the 1990s, capitalism has always lurched from crisis to crisis with a lot of discomfort being delivered to the working class with each recession. Loss of a job can be devastating, but capitalism also relentlessly redefines the nature of work. Capitalism is unconcerned about the inherent worthiness and importance of having and doing meaningful work. It persistently deskills jobs by breaking them into sub-tasks and subjecting them to automation and mechanization. Fewer and fewer workers are permitted to conceptualize, plan, and execute their work in a complete process.<br />Neoliberal spokesmen often hold that capitalism and democracy are essentially one and the same. But the author points out that it is a fundamental contradiction of capitalism that the freedom that both employers and workers supposedly enjoy when meeting in the labor market disguises a regime of total control within workplaces. It is that unchallengeable control that permits owners to squeeze excessive profits from workplaces. The author digresses with an explanation of Marx's labor theory of value, but the issue is really one of relative power.<br />Capitalism subtly redefines freedom and democracy. Democracy is no longer located in the political realm involving decision making; it has become the freedom to participate in the marketplace, to act in one's best interest. Social or collective concerns need not trouble an individual self-maximizer - the market will do that automatically. But it has been the collective actions of labor unions and worker-centered political parties that have attempted to tame the worst excesses of capitalism. But the effectiveness of labor unions has often been reduced through both repression and cooptation.<br />Some radicals contend that the contradictions of capitalism are becoming so evident that it is a foregone conclusion that the working class will become a potent force in their own liberation. But the author is not so enamored of those prospects. The reaction of workers to the depredations of capitalism is often psychological self-destruction, not some form of activism. In addition, capitalism has proven to be highly resilient to challenges. It can usually call upon the full power of the state to defend its interests. And the ideology of consumerism is pervasive and subtly distorting, even equating shopping with revolutionary actions.<br />Understanding the nature and contradictions of capitalism is certainly a place to begin to contest it.

It seems that much more attention is paid to debating the causes of the Civil War, but as this slim volume of essays reveals there are any number of varying and subtle arguments for explaining the outcome of the Civil War.<br />It is probably the common view that the North winning the Civil War was inevitable, that the overwhelming preponderance of the North in terms of supplies, industrial infrastructure, and manpower ensured victory. Only one of these authors somewhat accepts the thesis of Northern material superiority. These authors are far more mindful of the fact that mismanagement or deep-seated flaws within the losing side of a conflict can be larger factors in the ultimate outcome than positive actions by the winning side.<br />The authors all note some inherent advantages of the South: a need to only defend territory, the vastness of the South, a transportation network, the ability to produce large quantities of foodstuffs, a commodity, cotton, of great value in the international market, a huge labor force of three million slaves, and a certain psychological advantage in the defense of a way of life.<br />But these authors discuss any number of factors that led, not necessarily inevitably, to the defeat of the South. The authors point mostly to both military and political malfeasance, as well as personalities and inherent characteristics of Southern society, as leading to defeat. The manner of financing of the War produced tremendous inflation; the supplies of cotton were mismanaged both as a source of revenue to fund the war effort and as a tool to force European nations to recognize the Confederacy; food supplies were confiscated at below market prices; and manpower was poorly utilized both in recruitment to the Southern army and in the deployment of labor on Southern farms.<br />The states rights and independent political stance of Southerners seemed to prevent a coherent national posture being formulated in winning the Civil War. One of the authors points to the anti-statist views of all Southerners as interfering with producing a disciplined army. Southern units elected their superior officers and were disinclined to follow orders with which they disagreed. In contrast to this aggressive independence, some of the authors point to a general weakening of the Southern psychological state and even a &quot;loss of nerve.&quot; The Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, is viewed by one author as a huge factor in the defeat of the South. Davis incompetently micromanaged the war effort, pursued flawed economic strategies, was personally difficult to engage, and exhibited an ineffectual indecisiveness and conservatism in times needing forceful and visionary actions. But the one-party system in the South prevented the rise of an effective opposition that could have addressed the original poor choice of President.<br />Beyond any material advantage, the authors generally contend that Lincoln and Grant were trump cards for the North. Both were better suited to their jobs both in temperament and competency than anyone in the South. Some would almost suggest that Lincoln and Grant being on the Southern side could have reversed the result.<br />This book was reissued in 1996 after first appearing in 1960, but it is as readable and relevant as anything being written today. There is some overlap in the material covered in the essays, but the ideas are interesting and challenging. You won't see all of these ideas in a general book on the Civil War.oints to the anti-statist views of all Southerners as interfering with producing a disciplined army.

US	52280224	R2RX3LIVRJFNJ2	0853459290	238801472	Why Unions Matter	Books	4	38	42	N	N	On Further Review	The author makes it abundantly clear that without the backing of a labor union, most workers stand little chance of countering unilateral and capricious employer actions. A collective bargaining agreement is a quasi-constitution that provides for due process for workers in many workplace situations. Otherwise, employees simply work &quot;at the will&quot; of employers with no recourse to challenge decisions.<br />The author explores the steps that generally need to be taken to form a union under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. Beyond those procedures, he repeatedly stresses the class and workplace solidarity needed to form an effective union.  But the main American labor movement in its evolution has never developed a coherent stance on the class nature of capitalism. Bureaucratic, bread-and-butter, business unionism describes the American labor movement after WWII. It is an orientation that does not seek to transform the essential dominance of American capital over the American working class.<br />It is clear that the American labor movement has since the Civil War faced incredible opposition from both employers and the state, including the police, the armed forces, and the judiciary. In addition, the various media empires portray unions as un-American or criminal in nature. Nonetheless, the author is unhappy with the conservatism of the labor movement regardless of any practical reasons for that stance. He views the purge of left-wing elements from unions and the lack of union internal democracy as developments that greatly weaken the ability of unions to fully represent the working class.<br />The key structure of unions is the local union that is centered on one or more workplaces in a geographical area. Naturally their concerns are with local issues and generally not on broader working class concerns. The author wishes to see a far more aggressive labor presence in the political realm. Issues such as employment as a right, national health care, shorter work hours, greater equality in pay, and democratization of workplaces need to appear on the political agenda of organized labor. The author does not really address the issue of what would be the role for labor unions if the American working class actually became powerful enough to implement pro-worker legislation. For example, what would the role for unions be in worker-dominated firms?<br />Yes, unions do matter. No other organizations even remotely afford workers the voice and protection that unions do within workplaces. But there is wide variability in their effectiveness. Furthermore, it is rather obvious that the labor movement as presently conceived has been quite limited in its ability to counter the global forces of capitalism that have been playing havoc with the world's working classes.  Basically, the author is not quite as pro-union as it might seem at first glance.health care, shorter work hours, greater equality in pay, and democratization of workplaces need to appear on the political agenda of organized labor.

US	52280224	RVB88T31DLGTC	0812925793	317395295	Over the Hills: A Midlife Escape Across America by Bicycle	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	An interesting journey through rural America	Over The Hills is the author's narrative of his 3000 mile, 60 day bicycle journey from Washington D.C. to Santa Monica, California in the mid-1990s. Though being 54 years old, the trip was not undertaken to salve any kind of midlife crisis. The motivation for the journey was a continuation of the author's sense of adventure perhaps overly developed by years of overseas assignments as a reporter covering dangerous situations. He was not a particularly fit or experienced bicyclist, but the trip was reasonably well planned in terms of equipment and supplies, the route, and overall and daily strategies.<br />The book is pretty much devoid of precise statistics and numbers. Not one date is cited; daily mileage is only occasionally mentioned; and outside of an occasional reference to miles per hour, little bicycle technical data is given. However, there is a surplus of daily minutia, such as the laborious exercise of washing clothes, oiling his bicycle chain, drinking milkshakes, eating coconut custard pie, etc.<br />In addition, the book consists of the author's observations, both on his psychological state and on his surroundings. The state of rural America is a constant theme. Most of the journey consists of passing through unevenly dispersed, decaying towns sitting on what were once main highways, but now bypassed by the Interstate system. Though life in those towns seemed to be isolating and difficult, he found an essential goodness in those he encountered. The author's own eating, smoking, and drinking habits did not put him out of step with the locals, who were mostly indifferent or unaware of cosmopolitan society.<br />The journey was by no means easy. The author admits to suffering from both loneliness and nagging doubts concerning his ability to complete the trip. The hilly and mountainous terrain, especially in Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas, proved to be very taxing. Occasionally, the planned route had to be deviated from or in some cases proved to have some unanticipated dangers. Despite these difficulties, the author seems to only partially appreciate his incredible luck on this journey. He had no serious bike troubles, experienced no crashes, was not once ill or injured, enjoyed unusually peaceable relations with motorists and individuals, and was not rained on even once in sixty days. On some occasions he was able to fortuitously obtain lodging.<br />As sort of complementary information concerning his trip, the author injects bicycle history into his commentary. The bicycle has an odd history. In the 1880s and 90s bicycling became immensely popular only to decline rapidly with the advent of the automobile. And though bicycle sales have surged in recent decades and tens of millions claim to ride bicycles, bicycles remain as a peculiar fit in our society.<br />The trip seemed to be ultimately satisfying to the author. It was an adventure that he successfully completed. Beyond that not much remains. No enduring relationships were formed. No contact is made with those encountered on the trip. The interest in bicycling has ebbed to pre-trip levels. Yet the experience does remain.<br />For the various readers interested in rural America, in an extended and difficult venture, or those contemplating a similar journey, the book has merit. Just being able to come along on the author's journey and experience second hand what he encountered is very interesting and even useful. Even though the routine was pretty much the same on a daily basis, the book did not really get bogged down. And there is a map of the journey including a breakdown of the trip into segments with roads taken.some unanticipated dangers.

Then his life was turned upside down. He awakens in a hospital, as it turns out days later, only to learn that he had been shot and left for dead. Likewise his wife had been shot and killed and his six-month-old daughter has disappeared. None of this makes any sense. He heard or saw nothing unusual that day. His marriage was perhaps in trouble, but nothing pointed to an almost double murder.<br />The doctor never gives up hope of finding his daughter despite a failed sequence of ransom note and payment. The novel kicks into high gear with another communiqu&eacute; from the alleged kidnappers eighteen months later. Now he enlists the help of his college girlfriend and ex-FBI agent, Rachael, in his pursuit. As they scramble to track down emerging information, they find themselves in a race with the police as a lot of evidence points to first Marc and then Rachael as the masterminds of this crime. Worse yet, they seem to have a betrayer in their inner circle as their every move seems to be known by the bad guys.<br />Coben has been largely successful in his three efforts of novels independent of the Myron Bolitar series. Tell No One, Gone For Good, and No Second Chance are all page-turners. They all have their assemblage of strange, demented characters that have to be overcome, and they have a style and pace that is riveting. Having read all of them, as well as the Bolitar series, this reviewer will have to wait for the next Coben novel.	2003-07-03

It is not his mission to propose technical fixes for the current system; in fact, he is basically suggesting the elimination of public schooling, as it is presently constituted. In lieu of &quot;schooling,&quot; he calls for non-institutionalized education that occurs in the context of the traditions of individuality, family, and community. Many readers may question whether the author's libertarianism or free-market solutions are adequate ideas for addressing education in our present-day society.<br />An educated person, by the author's standards, is self-reliant, understands himself and his community, and is capable of critical, or dialectical, thinking. According to the author, modern schools emphasize most, if not all, of the following: regimentation and conformity, standardization and limited curriculums, initiative killing dependency on teachers, and the parsimonious and conditional building of self-esteem. This type of warehousing of kids for twelve years can hardly produce &quot;educated&quot; citizens. But this particular form of schooling has been developing, at the behest of educational gurus and the business community, since the middle of the 19th century and is well ensconced and largely unquestioned in our greater society.<br />There is an element of the author putting the cart before the horse in this book. In the U.S., the capitalistic class controls our culture and our social, economic, and political institutions. It would seem that average citizens, at a minimum, would have to achieve some independence within our workplaces, gain control of the flow of information in our society, now dominated by a few huge media conglomerates, and gain control of the political process well before structural changes can be made to education. But as it is now, businesses are only too happy to see over-credentialed, fearful graduates scrambling to demonstrate their worthiness to fill scarce positions.<br />The author seems to be fixated on small community life as the ideal in which to grow up, work, and become educated. What is curious about that view is that America has been a very transient society since our founding. The longest standing communities in America, those of small-town New England, often were bastions of orthodoxy and suppressive of any kind of difference. Education in such settings would undoubtedly be narrow and community-specific and hardly a broadening experience.<br />The United States was formed as a political community, where citizen participation is absolutely essential for our overall health. We are not supposed to be a traditional society that leaves its governance to a hierarchical authority structure. But unfortunately ours is a superficial democracy. Capitalistic and materialist values overwhelm citizen control and what one could call humanitarian concerns. At least, in traditional communities some economic support is provided for all community members - not so in capitalism. In some sense, the security of traditional communities will have to be replicated in a capitalistic society in order for its members to function fully as democratic citizens without the fear of being placed on a scrap heap for failing to fully incorporate the required manner of thinking, or for any reason.<br />The author is to be admired, as an award-winning teacher, for sending up an alarm concerning our manner of education. But the issues are complex. And there is much to question. He is surely correct to point out that the fundamentals of reading, writing, and arithmetic can be readily taught and absorbed in a relatively short period of time. Much of the study of literature and many subjects is wasted on kids; they simply to do not have the life experiences to benefit. If knowledge of the classics is a genuine part of the culture, then people will read them and discuss them as they mature. Of course, such is not the case in Americanculture. The author does not discuss the apprenticeship programs found in European countries. They seem like excellent solutions to the ill-advised warehousing of students done in America. After learning the basics, students work in local communities among trades-people to learn useful skills.<br />It is probably not wrong to say that we are a &quot;dumbed-down&quot;  and controlled society. But of course this is nothing new. And yes schools are a locus for some of that dumbing-down. But the problem goes way beyond schools. Our schools reflect the distribution of power in our society. We could change all of that. Theoretically, we have the means to do so. Unfortunately, the trend is definitely towards more of the same.n culture.

US	52280224	R208744GUHQ0IY	039332169X	997615053	The Twilight of American Culture	Books	3	69	74	N	Y	We need political action, not "monks" (3.5 stars)	According to the author, American culture, or American society, is in \\"shambles.\\" It is a society that has been dumbed down and hollowed out as multinational corporations have virtually penetrated all of society's domains. What does such a society look like? In lieu of Enlightenment reasonableness, American society is kept in a superficial state of busyness by such mechanisms as the constant introduction of technological gadgetry (Internet, DVDs, etc), entertainment spectacles (Super Bowl, Olympics, etc), and sensationalism (Princess Di, OJ, Monica Lewinsky, etc), and infotainment, the dispensing of mountains of disconnected trivia or \\"information\\" that is not geared to inform. Kitsch, that is, \\"something phony, clumsy, witless, untalented, vacant, or boring [which is regarded as] genuine, graceful, bright, or fascinating\\" pervades the culture. There is a patina of vitality to the culture but it hides a spiritual dying.<br />A sub-theme of the book is that all civilizations, regardless of how grand, will face a decline, as did Rome's. One can look to such factors as social and economic inequality, declining returns on investment in solving social problems, dropping levels of social intelligence and understanding, and spiritual death as indicators of a civilization in decline. Being that the author holds that American culture is in the midst of such a decline, a purpose of the book is to serve as a guide to those who self-select themselves as \\"monks\\" who are willing to preserve non-commercial American culture and reject the global \\"McWorld\\" culture of \\"slogans, spin, and hype.\\" The precedent for this monasticism is the transcription and preservation of the Greek and Roman cultures undertaken by some orders of monks from 500 AD to 1100 AD after Rome's fall, though the author admits that those monks had little understanding or appreciation for what they were saving.<br />Perhaps most indicative of American cultural decline is the state of education in America. Educational institutions have in a wholesale manner adopted a business culture; they are truly in the business of selling products and entertainment to students as consumers. The author finds little difference between the selling of diplomas for entry into good jobs by universities and the selling of indulgences for entry into heaven by the Church in the Middle Ages. None of these institutions are really interested in transforming the buyer. The author notes that only a small segment of the adult population reads so much as one book a year. The books that are sold consist largely of \\"short, sloganistic books that promise to improve lives overnight.\\"<br />Much of the author's characterization of the corporate hegemony over American culture is quite accurate. But there is an element of narrowness to his thinking that could stand some review. In particular, there is a certain amount of harshness in his separation of the thinking class from the drones. Quoting Robert Browning from memory and being conversant with the works of Shakespeare, Flaubert, Virginia Woolf, and Voltaire would be a high hurdle for most to jump. And only a miniscule number of people could possibly produce the witty essays of a Lewis Lapham, editor of Harper's, rich in their referrals to all manner of literary and historical items. That probably indicates some good fortune early in life. Also, we can all construct our litmus tests for passage into the select.  A broader view is needed. At one point the author suggests that what is needed is a \\"healthy skepticism, individual creativity, and free choice.\\"  Furthermore, despite his criticism of universities, the author, at heart, clings to the notion of universities as being the ideal locale for learning. Frankly, many would question whether the young even have the worldly knowledge to fully benefit from a liberal education. There is no real reason for that dependency. Thinking, reading, and studying should be lifelong enterprises conducted anywhere that hopefully would have relevance in the general culture.<br />The author's ideas concerning the pursuit of a \\"monastic option\\" are most puzzling. The author really presents no immediate purpose for his modern monks. In an era of overwhelming data, there is no need for the data preserving exploits like those of the monks in the Dark Ages. Apparently, when the global consumer culture eventually collapses of its internal contradictions, the monks will be ready to restore a pre-consumer culture primarily by example. But waiting for the system to collapse, which is bound to occur due to the unsustainability of the world's population on diminishing resources and a degraded environment, on the off chance that some underground monks, who unsurprisingly resemble liberal arts professors, will bring everyone back to their senses, seems to be a very risky proposition. In addition, the author eschews grass roots political action as a means of correcting the current corporate excess. Of course, that route has immense difficulties, but there is some chance that change could occur before the extinction of life, as we know it. Democratic action is in fact a huge part of our cultural past. Why not urge the thinking class to draw upon the American traditions of Jefferson, Paine, Lincoln, FDR, the Knights of Labor, the IWW, the Wagner Act, etc to reassert the right of citizens to participate in the governance of their affairs and institutions. There are probably more citizens disenchanted with American culture than the author realizes.<br />The book is strongest in its depiction of American culture and what it has become under corporate dominance. But the arguments for inevitable civilization decline, reliance on underground \\"monks,\\" and the eschewing of collective political activity are far less compelling.  It is difficult to contemplate a way out of the current cultural situation that does not involve a renewed sense of political participation along with cultural transformation.fully would have relevance in the general culture. <br />The author's ideas concerning the pursuit of a \\"monastic option\\" are most puzzling.

But waiting for the system to collapse, which is bound to occur due to the unsustainability of the world's population on diminishing resources and a degraded environment, on the off chance that some underground monks, who unsurprisingly resemble liberal arts professors, will bring everyone back to their senses, seems to be a very risky proposition. In addition, the author eschews grass roots political action as a means of correcting the current corporate excess. Of course, that route has immense difficulties, but there is some chance that change could occur before the extinction of life, as we know it. Democratic action is in fact a huge part of our cultural past. Why not urge the thinking class to draw upon the American traditions of Jefferson, Paine, Lincoln, FDR, the Knights of Labor, the IWW, the Wagner Act, etc to reassert the right of citizens to participate in the governance of their affairs and institutions. There are probably more citizens disenchanted with American culture than the author realizes.<br />The book is strongest in its depiction of American culture and what it has become under corporate dominance. But the arguments for inevitable civilization decline, reliance on underground \\"monks,\\" and the eschewing of collective political activity are far less compelling.  It is difficult to contemplate a way out of the current cultural situation that does not involve a renewed sense of political participation along with cultural transformation.	2003-06-20

Elizabeth's body was supposedly found days later, the victim of a serial killer. But after all of that time, strange things begin happening. Two bodies are found at the same lake and Dr. Beck receives some mysterious E-mails. Dr. Beck, not having quite the resourcefulness of the redoubtable Myron, fumbles his way through these developments and even draws suspicion to himself as a suspect.<br />Dr. Beck gets a lot of support from an old college friend and now a lesbian super-model and a crusty, tough female lawyer as the mystery unfolds. He gains some exceedingly timely assistance from the network of a street drug-dealer whose son is a patient at the clinic where Dr. Beck works as a pediatrician. There is a certain amount of inexplicable computer expertise exhibited by not only the bad guys tracking Dr. Beck's every move but also by the mysterious E-Mail sender.<br />Plausibility may be stretched at times in this story and several fairly important developments are largely left unexplained. For example, a fugitive who has hidden in the area of the private lake for thirty years is convenient for the story but the reader learns little about him. The role of the father of the murdered wife is key, but good explanations for his behavior given the story outcome are somewhat lacking.<br />Despite any shortcomings the book will keep the reader's interest. There is a compelling main story line, not to be revealed here. It will be interesting to see how Coben does in his other non-Bolitar books.	2003-06-19

But there have been no reports of kidnappings and even more bizarrely, the reporter is fired for plagiarism. He had apparently borrowed the entire episode from an obscure book that was published many years before. This is the strange scenario in which Myron Bolitar, erstwhile sports agent and sleuth, finds himself enmeshed in this the seventh and last of the Bolitar series. Furthermore, he starts to find that there is more fact than fiction to this situation.<br />Bolitar's usual supporting cast is back, namely Win the blue-blood financial consultant and borderline psychopath and Esperanza now a full partner in MB SportsReps. But one character from his past, Emily Downing, ex-wife of Myron's fiercest basketball rival, takes the wind right of Myron's sails by not only revealing that her son was in fact fathered by Myron but also needs a life-saving bone marrow transplant. Myron vows his help but meets with immediate frustration: the name of a potential donor surreptitiously obtained from a national registry turns out to be not only bogus but leads to a member of an immensely wealthy family who also cannot be located.<br />From a mysterious phone contact out of the blue, Myron has to contend with a seeming connection between a fired sports reporter with a bizarre kidnapping story and a missing donor. As in all of Coben's Bolitar books, the plot is fast moving. There is the usual no nonsense dialogue with Win, and as always Bolitar's current female dealings never quite get on track. And of course, Myron and Win have a running battle with the FBI. As some reviewers have noted, the plot gets a little involved but in this opinion not wildly so.<br />This is the last book of the Bolitar series and it has been an entertaining series with interesting characters, snappy dialogue, and intriguing plots. However, it seems that Myron may have come to some kind of crossroad in his life. It has been several years since a Bolitar book has appeared.

Further rejuvenation would have to wait as Win and Myron raced back to New York; the arraignment of Myron's friend and new partner in MB SportsReps, Esperanza, an exotic Latino ex-pro wrestler and now a lawyer, on charges of murder was imminent. The victim was Clu Haid, a newly acquired New York Yankee's pitcher, who was turning around a career in the doldrums, and a client of MB SportsReps.<br />But Esperanza would not talk to Myron and lots of evidence pointed her way. And Myron had gotten a bizarre computer disk in the mail that showed an image of a teen-age girl's face that slowly disintegrated before his eyes and then the disk was wiped clean. As is often the case in the Bolitar series, Myron finds himself entangled in the seedy world of the alternative bar scene and organized crime. In addition, Myron gets a strong feeling that he may be more a part of this entire situation than he can realize.<br />Some have complained that the Bolitar series has gotten stale. But despite perhaps a bit of a slow start, this book is typical Coben in its fast pace and unexpected turns of events. There is a certain amount of repetitious background information given in each book as they are meant to be standalone, but it is not excessive. Reading the books in order does add to the enjoyment of the Bolitar series, though. Coben adds dimensions to his characters with each book. In this book, Big Cyndi, a mammoth, spiked lady, shows a previously unrevealed side. And Myron's unsettled personal situation floats along the surface of this book.<br />Personally, I found this book to be an entertaining and quick read; it wasn't a disappointment. In fact, I plan to start on number seven in the series very soon.disappointment. In fact, I plan to start on number seven in the series very soon.	2003-06-13

While having read only three of the other six to this point, it is not possible to say with certainty that this one is the best of all seven. But \\"One False Move\\" has more in-depth personal interactions than the others that I have read, drawing the reader a little closer to Myron than is sometimes the case. For those unfamiliar with Bolitar, he runs MB SportsRep. But his circuitous journey to this point, after his budding basketball career was abruptly ended due to a serious on-court injury, gives Myron a dimension far beyond the typical sports agent.<br />The book is, as usual with Coben, fast-paced with Myron and Win, his quirky, lethal, and blue-blood partner, encountering all manner of sleaze-balls and people with something to hide. Brenda Slaughter, the girl that the new WPBA basketball league is featuring, should be on top of the world. But her father has gone missing after she filed assault charges against him, not to mention the fact that her long-lost mother of twenty years has been on her mind all of that time. Enter Myron; the league needs its investment protected. But the assignment gets more complicated and riskier by the day.<br />Some reviewers find the Coben books humorous. And they are. But the dialogue is more edgy than funny. Of course, the new office worker Cyndi, the spikey ex-pro female wrestler, is captivating and hilarious.<br />There are some good twists in this book. I missed the one at the end - well actually I missed all of them. See if you can get it (them). Meanwhile I'm starting another Myron Bolitar book.	2003-06-08

Like all great athletes, he could never accept his fate; there was always that what-could-have-been lurking around in his mind. Then seemingly out of the blue, the owner of the New Jersey Dragons, a top NBA team, wants Myron to join the team, to suit up. Myron cannot resist, the demons have got to be put to rest; and the owner was counting on that. But there is an ulterior motive; Myron's main task is to quietly and quickly find the team's current superstar, Greg Downing, who has disappeared, while maintaining the deception of an aging jock's comeback.<br />In this third book of the Bolitar series, Coben probably does his best work in exploring a subculture, in this case, life in the NBA. Myron finds along side the opulent lifestyles, including trophy wives, and the immense talent, the doubts and the senses of fragility, which have a lot more to do with the substance of the book than is first suspected. Myron has to pick his way through any number of characters peripheral to the team who had some connection to the missing superstar.<br />Myron's investigation starts simply enough; he and his fair-haired financial consultant and bad boy, Win, \\"let\\" themselves into the star's home. It's the phone message from a \\"Carla\\" wanting to meet in the back booth of a diner and blood in the playroom that sets Myron off on an involved race against time to find Greg before the playoffs begin. The case ratchets up several notches when someone is found bludgeoned to death. Rumors of gambling and large debts to the crime world surface, as do bizarre connections to the political underground. Throw in the complications of any number of liaisons within the team, involving wives and hangers-on, and Myron has a confusing and intricate case on his hands.<br />The usual Bolitar cast of characters is present. Esperanza, former female pro-wrestler and now Myron's office manager, has a larger role than previously, while Win is less prominent. Cyndi, a large, spiked lady and also from the wrestling circuit, begins work at SB Sports. And Myron's antagonistic relationship with \\"Rolly,\\" the NYPD detective is renewed.<br />Like all Coben books, this one moves quickly; it easily holds one's attention. There could be an issue of plausibility in this installment. Twists and turns are what Coben books are all about, but this one takes a turn that may seem less than satisfying to some. Nonetheless, it is another good Coben book and does nothing to lessen the appetite for more.Esperanza, former female pro-wrestler and now Myron's office manager, has a larger role than previously, while Win is less prominent.

US	52280224	R3UX4E4HSEZXW5	085345888X	389921142	Longer Hours, Fewer Jobs: Employment and Unemployment in the United States (Cornerstone Books)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Succinct and unflinching view of capitalism	Though published in 1994 and being reviewed in 2003, this book is not irrelevant to the present. Ostensibly, the book is concerned with hours worked and employment, but it is far more a primer on the realities of capitalism and its control of the social relations of production. The timing of the book missed the economic surge of the late 1990s and the bust in the early 2000s, but the boom-bust cycle of capitalism is described and predicted by the author.<br />During WWII and in its aftermath for 25 years, American corporations somewhat accommodated the American working class, especially those segments that had substantial union representation. But the fragility of that accord was clearly demonstrated as the global hegemony and profits of American businesses began to erode in the early 1970s. American businesses reasserted their ability to dominate the political and economic landscape by taking measures both directly and through the government to discipline the working class.<br />The author makes abundantly clear that capitalism is by definition an economic system that is exploitative of the working class. The power of capitalists is hidden through the rhetoric of free enterprise, which holds that neutral, or \\"invisible,\\" forces work to the advantage of all. The fact is that by the early 1980s and continuing through the early 1990s, the entire employment situation had changed considerably through the exercise of that power. Factories were closed, jobs moved to the South, unionization rates were slashed in half, wages declined, especially for the high school-educated, and contingent work became much more widespread, that is, part-time, temporary, and contractual. At the same time, marginal tax rates for the rich were greatly reduced, inequality in income and wealth increased, and the investing class received a huge bailout from losses incurred in the S&L scandal.<br />In addition, unemployment levels soared throughout the 1980s, officially averaging over 7 percent across the decade. As the author points out, the unemployed are an important component of capitalism as they are an immediate source of workers, but more importantly they force the employed to moderate wage requests. However, it is not in the best interests of capitalism to have the official unemployment rate be too high. Conveniently, the Labor Dept has lax standards in defining an employed person, but stringent standards in declaring someone unemployed. The net result is an official unemployment rate that is always several percentage points below actual un- or under-employment.<br />Though mainstream economists debate and constantly adjust the level of unemployment that is considered to be indicative of \\"full\\" employment, the author invokes President Roosevelt's State of the Union address of 1944, where he called for the right of all Americans to be employed who wanted to be, even if government is the employer of last resort. It is clear that public employment and/or a minimal guaranteed income are doable, but the employing class rabidly opposes any measure that would minimize the life-and-death dependency of the working class on private sector employment. The author also points out the devastating social effects of unemployment: increased crime, health and mental problems, and suicides.<br />The working class in America has the \\"potential\\" political power to change the entire economic landscape. But that has not happened. Divisions within the working class based on skill, position, race, ethnicity, and gender have obscured the fact that capitalism is primarily based on the social relations of work. It cannot be ignored that capitalism has managed to persuade huge portions of the working class that consumerism is a form of empowerment. Nonetheless, worker organizations, whether they are unions or otherwise, will have to develop workers' class-consciousness for them to have any chance of radically changing the current exploitative relationship that exists in producing goods and services. The author calls for increased unionization, but it is unclear as to whether he regards co-opted, bureaucratic unions as adequate vehicles to represent workers' interest. It is clear that workers' efforts will have to proceed along political lines as well as within workplaces. In addition, he calls for non-capitalistic modes of production. But it would seem that production in the interests of the general population is mostly a matter of control, not formal structure or name. The social democracies of Europe have been successful in taming capitalism, though that is eroding at the time of this review.<br />The book succinctly makes some key and irrefutable points about capitalism and capitalistic society. An interesting angle to this book will be its connection to the author's newest book, \\"Naming the System.\\" From the vantage point of 2003, will the author extend or alter the points made here?cing goods and services.

Then it turns out that she contacted the newest rising men's star, a youth who has clawed his way up from the ghetto, shortly before her death, and, furthermore, she had some involvement with the son of a powerful senator, who had been stabbed to death six years prior.<br />It all makes for a page turning read as Myron Bolitar with his usual cast of characters - Win, the lethal Ivy leaguer, his exotic, ex-pro wrestler, female office manager, and his contacts in law enforcement and elsewhere - moves through the world of tennis coaching, exclusive country clubs, pro tennis, and the lurking presence of the crime world trying to sort through contradictions and fragments to find the murderer of the comeback tennis lady. Some of his interactions are just amusing. A lunch with his detective friend Jake at a local diner is classic.<br />While the book does stand on its own, there is just a little bit of the sense of its being cut from a cookie cutter mold with Deal Breaker being the first cookie.

The authors focus on the Creatives: who they are, and their current and hoped-for potential impacts on the broader culture. Of particular interest to the authors is the impact of Creatives on the issue of ecological sustainability.<br />The authors regard half of adults in America (100 million) as Moderns. They generally accept the constantly changing, materialistic culture operated and promoted by big business. Much of modern culture seems to be value-free as it revolves around science, technology, growth, speed, and efficiency. The marketplace has largely taken over the lives of moderns: it unabashedly breaks community ties and, in essence, defines people through their consumption and employment. Moderns range from advantaged business executives to the lower middle class adversely affected by globalizing business strategies.<br />Traditionals, on the other hand, have been largely bypassed by modernism. The 48 million traditionals tend to be older and rural-based with low incomes and limited education and are a group in decline. Their culture is based on time-worn, shared community values and is often orally transmitted to future generations. Traditionals are appealed to by affluent elements of both business and social conservatives, although many traditionals are not pro-business or anti-environment.<br />The principal contention of the authors is that since the 1960s, 50 million Americans have shifted their \\"worldview, values, and way of life\\" sufficiently to form a distinct subculture: the Cultural Creatives. They are defined by both disenchantment with the materialism and fragmentation of modernism and an interest in personal growth, authenticity, and experience. A \\"core\\" element of 24 million adults dominated by women and consisting of a variety of artists, professionals, alternative health-care providers, and feminists are oriented toward personal growth and spirituality. Creatives, more broadly, have only an average interest in spirituality and person-centered values and are more focused on the environment and broader social issues.<br />The authors suggest that the Creatives arose from the civil rights and anti-war movement of the 60s and such movements as feminism and environmentalism. Those movements succeeded partly because Americans were forced to confront the fact that American \\"principles of general equality, personal freedom, justice, civil rights, and representative democracy\\" were being unfairly applied. The authors contend that those movements are having an impact far beyond visible leaders and supporters by feeding the longings and hopes of the greater population. More recent Creatives reject large institutions, both social and political, and have turned to New Ageism, holistic approaches, and developing and understanding one's self.<br />A primary agenda of the authors, beyond identification of social groups, is to press for the need of redirecting the economy and the broader culture in directions that will sustain the environment. The recommendations of several environmental experts include such measures as increasing efficiency, decreasing waste, recycling both natural and man-made materials, and stopping the destruction of Nature. One of the more interesting ideas is the recycling of durable products, where durable products are leased, instead of being owned, with businesses being required to take back and recycle their products. Of course, current reality is for businesses to pass the consequences of environmental destruction onto the public. Interestingly, businesses have arisen to supply the alternative needs of Cultural Creatives in such areas as organic foods, various self-help or experiential endeavors, etc. Of course, some resent the intrusion of business principles in a movement that rejects greed and profit. Resentment or not, these businesses have had an imperceptible impact on the general direction of the business community.<br />The authors are optimistic that the advent of Cultural Creatives bodes well for \\"an evolutionary surge to a new level\\" of cultural development and economic transformation where ecological sustainability has become a reality. However, the authors acknowledge that the growth of the Creative subculture is barely recognized, even among themselves. The various media underreport their activities and their social influence. For one, as stated, many Creatives are simply unseen. Secondly, the successes of earlier movements in integrating schools, registering voters, limiting nuclear arms, and setting environmental standards have made those agendas old news. And thirdly, as the authors indicate, advertiser-driven bias is a factor in news coverage. It's hard to conceive of a group flying below the radar having much public influence.<br />In addition, the authors applaud the eschewing of politics and pressure groups by Creatives. They point out that involvement in the political process often involves compromises or the watering down of agendas, which is anathema to Creatives. But the authors do concede that many activists believe that \\"political protest is what really counts in changing society.\\" The authors also contend that Creatives \\"are no more liberal or conservative than most Americans.\\" Yet it is acknowledged that the Creatives \\"reject the intolerance and narrowness of social conservatives and the Religious Rights.\\" It would seem that any group that would attempt to limit the prerogatives of big business would have to do so from the left. Of course, a central view of the authors is that the Creatives will infiltrate the hearts and minds of Americans and thereby indirectly achieve their agenda: \\"concerns for the planet, for ecology, and for spirituality will become as normal and natural as motherhood and apple pie.\\"<br />There seems to be a lot to question about this book. There is really no hard-core evidence presented that convinces the reader that there are 50 million Cultural Creatives. And even if so, their inward turn, their individual pursuits, and their apolitical stance make society-wide transformations, led by Creatives, seem unlikely. The U.S. culture and politics have made a rightward turn over the last decade. Again, where are the Creatives and what is their political influence? Despite their optimism, in the end, the authors see the U.S. as \\"muddling through\\" the excesses of modernism. It may even be that instead of shifting towards the Creatives, Moderns need to develop sharper and more critical insight into their material and business dominated world.ent or not, these businesses have had an imperceptible impact on the general direction of the business community. <br />The authors are optimistic that the advent of Cultural Creatives bodes well for \\"an evolutionary surge to a new level\\" of cultural development and economic transformation where ecological sustainability has become a reality.

His supporting cast primarily consists of his office manager, a Latino female ex-pro wrestler, and Win, an upper-crust blue-blood whose blond, wholesome looks hides a lethal mean streak.<br />The book starts simply enough: Myron is negotiating a first contract with a pro football team for a prized college quarterback. But a call to the quarterback supposedly from an old girlfriend who disappeared under mysterious circumstances a couple of years earlier starts a rapid-fire series of events that leads into the crime world, pornography, and academia.<br />The book's strength is the rapid pace of events that keeps the reader just enough off balance to maintain interest. One could not say that the book is from the school of realism. The characters are quickly drawn with exaggerated features, be they beauty, acumen, meanness, etc. Broader culture insights are minimally drawn. But that is not what this book is about.<br />The book is a good start in a series of Myron Bolitar mysteries. For entertaining, quick reads I will look to the next books in the series.	2003-05-30
US	52280224	R19SCNC0B7PYDS	1579546277	779815236	Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights	Books	4	9	12	N	Y	Corporations as Supra Human	The founders of the United States were most concerned about state and religious tyranny when they added the Bill of Rights to the Constitution. The power and machinations of companies that had been chartered by the crown were thought to be a matter of the past and not of sufficient concern to be dealt with in the new Constitution. From today's vantage point, greater naivet&eacute; could not have been demonstrated.<br />Corporations were chartered by state legislatures throughout the nineteenth century, but the corporations were put on a relatively short leash, being subject to controls including charter revocation. But as the author indicates, corporations became very powerful entities with the coming of the Civil War, in particular in the legal arena. The phalanx of attorneys that corporations could muster constantly pushed the legal envelope for corporations. The author attaches great importance to an (as it has turned out) erroneous reporting of the Santa Clara County Supreme Court decision in 1886 that supposedly held that corporations fell under the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees due process for all persons. After that decision, corporations came to be viewed as legal persons with all of the rights of natural persons.<br />Not only do citizens' rights apply to corporations, but corporations have the advantages of existing in perpetuity and of having limited liability. Corporations have, in essence, gained at least equal social standing with real people, but they in fact do not have human values. Corporations are institutions concerned almost exclusively with profitability and not with the well being of the greater society, as would actual people. One ramification of that is that, from a monetary standpoint, it makes sense for corporations to shift the costs of their operations onto the greater society, if possible. For example, degrading the environment is often not paid for by corporations, despite social effects. From a human standpoint, that is irresponsible, unsociable behavior.<br />It is the combination of full citizenship standing, immense wealth and resources, and a rational disregard for the greater social good that has produced, what the author calls, unequal consequences when corporations and people operate in the same arena. In general, the consequences have been that corporations have distorted and molded the social, economic, and political aspects of our society to their benefit. Huge corporations control much of public speech including the constant bombardment of advertising through their consolidated ownership of the media. They heavily influence tax and trade legislation by being a part of and controlling the political process. They control the global location and relative rewards of employment as wealth has continually been redistributed upwards over the last thirty years. They flaunt accepted environmental and labor laws and standards. Basically, their penetration into all aspects of our lives has been both immense and subtle.<br />There is a certain amount of disingenuousness in this book. The author is reluctant to place blame in this corporate dominating scenario. He would contend that corporations are simply doing what they do best aided by their unmerited legal status as full rights-bearing persons. Simply put, his solution is to remove that legal designation. However, there are many who would not view corporate power in such a benign manner. They would regard the actions of transnational corporations roaming the globe and pressuring even the largest nations in the world to bend to their needs as out-and-out class warfare. It is warfare that has been devastating in its effects on entire societies. He has the notion that local governments will one-by-one deny corporations various rights. That is a most optimistic view, if not delusional. Corporations and the capitalistic class are relentless in preserving and extending their prerogatives. Their teams of lawyers eat local attorneys for snacks.<br />This is one of several recent books on corporate domination written by someone with a business background. Others are by David Korten and Noreena Hertz, to name two.  They all add a little bit to the picture, including this book. But none of them have written what I would call a working class manifesto.ys for snacks.<br />This is one of several recent books on corporate domination written by someone with a business background.

US	52280224	RM058C77EQURF	0743234782	595092652	The Silent Takeover: Global Capitalism and the Death of Democracy	Books	3	14	14	N	Y	Critique Light, but useful	Whether done silently or not, the author makes the case for the fact that huge transnational corporations (TNCs) have taken on the societal role that formerly fell to governments and that governments largely accede to and support the agenda and maneuverings of those corporations. As a result, perhaps as many as one half of voting-age citizens in democracies do not find their political processes viable, worth participating in. The author examines alternatives to democratic participation, to pressuring corporations.<br />Beginning with the rise of Thatcher and Reagan, neo-liberalism has become the dominant economic and political philosophy worldwide with deregulation and privatization being core elements of that thinking. It is a very sparse view of the obligations of leading institutions to look out for the general good of society. However, for the book supposedly being a critique of laissez-faire capitalism, the author seems to have somewhat mixed feelings concerning the desirability of free-running capitalism. Her biggest concern seems to be the maldistribution of the wealth gains of the 1990s. But she also seems to be dazzled by the huge increases in wealth experienced by many and the overall benefits of free trade.<br />What is missing from the analysis is any real understanding of the true powerlessness of the working class to withstand this business assault. With the mass media and politicians firmly supporting the business agenda, workers have nowhere to turn as they are downsized, benefits are cut, jobs are shipped overseas, and workers' rights on the job are toothless or nonexistent. As a substitute for actual worker power on the job, the author would suggest shareholder activism: forcing ethical behavior and investment through pressuring boards of directors and fund managers. Of course, any significant shareholding is already skewed towards the rich whose concerns are not those of the working class.<br />The author makes much of the ability of consumer activism to curtail corporate excesses, instead of using the political process. She cites the examples of Kathy Lee Gifford and Nike, where consumers supposedly forced companies to not use sweatshop labor. Of course, that is the sort of thing that is unverifiable as contractors move about globally, not to mention such protests cannot possibly be more than a drop in the proverbial bucket. While noting the several protests surrounding meetings of world trade bodies, again, the net effect of those protests has amounted to little. Much of these actions perpetuate an illusion that the system is modifiable by citizens, despite the absence of political participation.<br />Of course, corporations are forever concerned with image, that is, their brands. In the interest of name promotion and co-opting protest movements, the author cites several examples of corporations providing such social services as education and health care in various countries where their factories are located. The author does not note that under IMF structural adjustments, governments have been forced to cut social services to the bone. So corporations can step into that vacuum when they wish, but when cheaper labor can be found elsewhere, those facilities are closed just as quickly as the factories. The same sort of thing can be said for the codes of conduct adopted by most TNCs: when those vaguely worded declarations affect the bottom line, they can be dispensed with in a heartbeat. A particularly pernicious development in the U.S. is the penetration of primary and secondary schools by large corporations under the guise of supplying needed technology. Of course, corporate logos and advertising are part of the package.<br />This review is not to say that the author is pleased with this state of affairs. She does not regard ad hoc protests as a good substitute for democratic participation. But there seems to be little appreciation or emphasis on the class nature of the domination of corporations. Although large parts of the citizenry are turned off by politics, no assessment is made as to the depth of their disaffection or understanding. Are citizens alarmed with consumerism as the dominant mode of life? Is there really much in the way of an untapped potential to transform the economic and political system? Is there a noticeable path for citizens to recapture the political process and minimize reliance on largely ineffectual, random protests that are easily shunted aside by TNCs? Those answers are crucial if neoliberalism is to be countered.arge parts of the citizenry are turned off by politics, no assessment is made as to the depth of their disaffection or understanding.

The fact that transnational corporations and their agendas have come to dominate cultural, political, and economic life on a global scale can hardly be disputed. These powerful corporations have used national governments and government-created international bodies to create a legislative and institutional regime that accedes to and actively promotes and implements a \\"free-market\\" ideology. This book is largely concerned with detailing the tremendous costs to the political, economic, and social fabric of the entire global community as corporations have become ever more capable under this ideological regime in extracting wealth and generating huge profits on a worldwide basis. The author sees poverty, social and political disintegration, and environmental degradation as the main consequences of this global corporate ascendance.<br />The ability of corporations to penetrate the political and cultural sectors of our society is hardly a late twentieth century phenomenon. Despite the founders' efforts to contain corporations by explicit and revocable state charters, emerging industrialists in the post-Civil War era became powerful enough to sway legislators and the judiciary to act in their behalf. Not only did corporations generally gain rights to perpetuity, but the Supreme Court declared corporations to be legal persons entitled to the same rights as ordinary citizens, in addition to limited liability. By the late 1920s capitalism had largely emerged triumphant over worker and community interests. Consumerism was instilled as the only legitimate avenue for realizing individualized \\"freedom.\\"<br />According to the author, a form of democratic pluralism existed among the civil, governmental, and market sectors of society in the post-WWII era, but any such sectorial accommodation was mostly an aberration that came about only because of the necessity to solve the twin crises of the Great Depression (caused by corporate-led economic excess) and WWII. Any social accord that may have existed was shredded as corporations, backed by the Reagan administration, renewed their assault on the working class and relentlessly pursued self-interested global strategies. Over the last two decades, middle-class jobs have been lost, median pay has stagnated, and austerity has been imposed on the less fortunate as a profound upward redistribution of wealth and income has occurred.<br />Globally, the structural adjustment measures forced upon developing nations by the World Bank and the IMF to qualify for loans, ripped the fabric of those societies and have actually increased indebtedness to First World bankers. Trade agreements and administrative bodies, such as the NAFTA and the WTO, are designed to eliminate local restrictions on investments by international firms and barriers to the free movement of goods between nations. The freedom for capital to move freely among nations has also fueled rampant financial speculation unrelated to productive investment. Unconscionably, American taxpayers have been forced to bailout those engaged in extracting wealth from the developing world.<br />Free market ideology is used to justify the gutting of the social and legal structures of nations. But it is a disingenuous view. Free market activities posited by Adam Smith involve local, individual economic actors, none of whom have the power to control the marketplace.  Unregulated market activities by huge economic entities can result in market coercion. For example, monopolistic firms can externalize costs, that is, they are powerful enough to force societies to pay for the social and environmental side-effects of their activities. For example, labor and environmental regulations are often ignored with impunity with society picking up the pieces.<br />The impact of corporations acting as legal persons cannot be overemphasized. Corporations overwhelm actual citizen political participation and free speech by the extent and intensity of their political lobbying and media controlling efforts. Corporations and the rich, in a form of legalized bribery, basically fund political campaigns. They also heavily sway public opinion through public relations front organizations, conservative think-tanks, and the control of the major media. The dependency of the media on advertising dollars virtually guarantees presentation of views that are compatible with corporate interests, not to mention the fact that the huge media empires are themselves transnational corporations with no interest in harming broader corporate interests.<br />As the author indicates, corporations have largely \\"colonized\\" the common culture.  Television is the main media outlet for the inculcation of business-friendly values, which emphasizes the avid pursuit of consumption. Even political activity has become mostly the marketing of pleasing candidates. The message is incessantly and subtly delivered that a free market system is self running and stabilizing and needs little or no political interference. Of course, the reality is far different. Corporations have infiltrated government at all levels with the sole purpose of ensuring that governments take an active role in supporting the corporate agenda, or pro-business regulation. In addition, governments are left to deal with the unprofitable aspects of society or side-effects of corporate actions. The net effect is a democracy hardly worthy of the name.<br />The author's principal approach to this regime of corporate hegemony is to call for a rollback to self-sustaining local communities. Such recommended measures as land reform (breaking up corporate farms) and urban agriculture seem almost quaint. The author confuses his message of a return to pre-consumption-dominated life by calling for high tech solutions, such as video-phones, to link local communities. Where does he think high tech products come from other than corporate development labs? A hard-hitting analysis seems to be getting waylaid by some fuzzy spirituality.<br />But the most practical approach is contained in the book. Free market propaganda has to be countered and a regime of regulating big business through governmental controls must be instituted. Is there any hope for this? The Seattle protest and other citizen demonstrations show that the democracy-killing initiatives of the WTO have not gone unnoticed. In addition, it has been claimed that 25 percent of the population belongs to a cultural grouping called \\"Cultural Creatives,\\" who can be expected to oppose insensitive corporate agendas. And the author takes no note of minority interests that are generally opposed to the conservative business agenda.

US	52280224	R1XP8U9V7QQBOK	1841120189	209461878	The Seven Deadly Sins of Business	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	Self-deceptive thinking knows no bounds	It is the author's contention that many businesses are not &quot;focally&quot; aware of the actual rules and mindsets by which they operate. The author has identified seven general areas where businesses &quot;sin&quot; by falling sway to illusory actions and thinking. They operate in a &quot;doom loop of unchallenged beliefs, faulty predictions, incorrect rules, inappropriate actions, and disappointing results.&quot; Obviously, there is the potential for severe repercussions for a business and its associated stakeholders for not being firmly grounded in reality.<br />The author breaks the &quot;sins&quot; into three groupings. The first, the three &quot;Sins of Strategy,&quot; is mostly concerned with the disconnection between formal plans and actual company operations and product development and strategies versus marketplace realities. It is here that fine sounding words, such as &quot;quality, empowerment, productivity, low-cost producer, and customer-driven,&quot; devoid of concrete content relative to a specific enterprise, are loosely tossed about. Ongoing conversations about strategies, one way to prevent these sins, are sidetracked or distorted by unexamined and unchallenged preconceptions or by the idea-suppressing dominance of top management. The author illustrates the connections that businesses should be making between pricing and costs versus customer benefits and expectations with some simple and interesting models and graphs.<br />The pseudo empowerment of employees and the substitution of corporate &quot;sizzle&quot; for meeting employee wants and needs are at the heart of the second group of sins, the &quot;Sins of Organization.&quot; The ubiquitous corporate claim that &quot;people are our most important asset,&quot; is no more than empty rhetoric without considerable investment - both time and money - in the workforce and the subsequent buy-in to the corporation's goals by each employee. It is the sin of &quot;banking on turbo-charged employees&quot; to confer the shell of empowerment on employees with insufficient inner-core skills to make company-enhancing decisions. Perceptive managers should understand the cumulative effect on a business of the hundreds of decisions made every day by inadequately trained employees, especially those in the service sector.  The author suggests that employees be trained in the use of an &quot;OODA&quot; strategy for decision-making consisting of the steps of &quot;observation, orientation, decision, and action.&quot; The alternative approach of simply not permitting employee discretion is seldom viable.<br />The sin of &quot;focusing on workplace sizzle&quot; is a very shortsighted approach to employment by businesses. In that view, the offer of a &quot;financial package, some fancy words, a set of marching orders, and penalties for failure to comply&quot; is entirely sufficient for a workforce. That view is often reinforced through carefully crafted internal company surveys that invariably show employees as being happy with this employment relationship. Employees who do not accept the sizzle approach will simply leave or will be dismissed - according to the remainder of this policy. But this is where the myopia of management arises. Such employees usually do not leave. Dissatisfied employees are often not detectable and are not inclined to risk acting in a precipitous manner. The prudent company will realize that for a &quot;willingness factor&quot; to be unleashed, a set of fairly constructed WIF-MEs (what's in it for me) will have to be provided to employees, which includes, among others, adequate and fair pay, good working conditions, training, empowerment, and respect. The commission of this sin can result in companies &quot;charging forward at full throttle, only to realize later how few troops are following in their wake.&quot;<br />The third category of sins, &quot;the sins of information,&quot; reinforces the previous sins because they interfere with the information flows that could counter illusory thinking.<br />In the sin of &quot;taking pride in being a learning organization,&quot; those with cherished ideas and secure positions cling to the notion that they and their organizations are open to wide-ranging inputs, but, in actuality, are unwilling to endure the discomfort and ramifications of such openness. Unwanted ideas are deflected in various manners. Closely related is the sin of &quot;investing in sophisticated forward intelligence systems.&quot; Despite investment in such intelligence gathering techniques as open-door policies, management by walking around, suggestion boxes, and brown-bag lunches with top management, little intelligence is gleaned. Not surprisingly, the costs, ranging from the penny-ante to some far more severe, to those providing information are not reduced. Management often adopts the pretense of an equal partnership in gathering information, that is, that they downplay the ability to inflict severe consequences to those delivering information. In other cases, the roadblocks to information flow are an obsessive and convenient adherence to lengthy processes that will ensure the staleness and unusability of the information. This category of sins is especially pernicious to organizations in its insidious effects.<br />There is no doubt that many businesses operate in the modes that the author has detailed. The degree of intent in the commission of these sins can be speculated upon. The sins of strategy fall somewhat into the category of marketing mistakes - something no business would purposely do. The sins of organization, especially creating workplace sizzle, and the sins of information directly impact the power relationships in a business. It is not going too far out on a limb to suggest that these sins are committed to maintain power despite any long-term detrimental effects. In fact, the issue of power and its impact on all of the sins floats on the surface of this book. The author could have addressed the question as to whether the typical structure of US businesses necessarily results in these &quot;sins.&quot; Along that line, would democratically organized and operated businesses have the same tendencies to engage in illusory thinking?<br />The author urges appropriate &quot;take-shake-or-break&quot; action for management: take or accept the implicit rules of a business; shake up the rules with minor patches or major revisions; or break up the rules entirely and begin anew. But the value of this book is in its descriptions of the operating holes and thinking traps into which business can fall. It is one of the more prescient management books that I have read.

And few companies are addressing the issue in any systematic manner. The concept of a business model includes \\"the who, what, when, where, why, and how much a company uses to provide its goods and services and receive value for its efforts.\\" The authors are basically suggesting that if businesses are not improving their performance relative to their competitors, that is changing their business model, in terms of \\"sales, profits, and cash flow,\\" they are probably facing a decline in their prospects.<br />It is claimed that the right business model innovation will be beneficial to stakeholders across the board: \\"customers, end users, employees, partners, suppliers, distributors, lenders, shareholders, and the broader community.\\" But the focus of the book is on obtaining, enlarging, and protecting competitive advantages, that is, to expanding both market boundaries and share, and, of course, on profitability. The authors demonstrate the workings of several approaches to achieving these ends by including any number of brief glimpses of various companies. Among those approaches are \\"adding value for customers and end users\\" without raising prices; devising astute pricing schemes; and eliminating costs that impact customers by adopting such measures as outsourcing, reallocating resources, changing practices, and using more appropriate materials.<br />A somewhat suspect example is of a major communications company who, through FCC abdication of its responsibilities, has been permitted to achieve a monopoly of radio and television stations in several metropolitan areas of the country and then offers customers value-added advertising deals that they could little afford to not take (not the authors' words). That is certainly one form of \\"locking out\\" competitors regardless of any ethical issues.<br />The idea that all stakeholders within or connected to a business deserve fair, if not equal, treatment has gained currency in the business press in recent years. But that notion is often limited to one appealing to some form of material self-interest, which leaves lying below the surface any examination of any fundamental or potential conflicts among the various stakeholders. In a somewhat revealing example, one CEO regards his customers and consumers as \\"citizens\\" of his company with quasi-rights to input. But employees are like \\"paid volunteers\\" because of their alleged devotion to the company's direction. It is an idea that distorts what employment could be. Employees, in actuality, are members of a genuine workplace community with a need for formal rights of input and, in fact, do not have the transient and casual attachment to an organization characteristic of volunteers. The almost cynical psychological manipulation of employees also seems to fall within the concept of fair reward. For example, it seems that airline employees, after a market expansion program by management, should see their reward in knowing that they are helping more people make their way to family reunions, birthdays, etc. Or publishing company workers should be satisfied in knowing that are advancing the spread of knowledge and progress with increased book sales. One has to wonder if all stakeholders in those two examples were rewarded only with warm thoughts.<br />The authors stress the necessity of \\"developing and implementing a superior management process to continually improve an organization's business model.\\" Curiously, the authors devote virtually no space to describing any such process. The greater emphasis is on describing a variety of actual business strategies that could be selected such as, adding value, pricing, cutting costs, etc, to effect competitive advantages. The reader will be left to puzzle over the who, when, and how of the structure of a typical, ongoing process of defining the next business innovation.<br />The primary point of the bookthat businesses should reassess their model, orientation, manner of working, etc can hardly be disputed. There are some brief overviews of some possible strategies to employ with a heavy emphasis on brief descriptions of attempts to implement those strategies. Some of the points are obscured by the endless presentation of examples and in some cases are just not well presented. The book is much too long for the points delivered. After the first of the book describes business model innovation, the last of the book purports to expand the topic. In actuality, the earlier points are redundantly made in another iteration of example companies.<br />The book only minimally delivers. Surely, most any business of any sophistication would be well aware of this material. Furthermore, it is hard to see how this is groundbreaking material as claimed. There is generally a poor development of the concept of stakeholder in relation to business innovation and more broadly. This book is probably best regarded as a basic book on marketing.ook that businesses should reassess their model, orientation, manner of working, etc can hardly be disputed.

The author freely acknowledges that modern capitalism operates according to the unrelenting market demands of efficiency and competitiveness, which maximizes the self-interests of an upper layer of market players but is detrimental to the financial and psychological well-being of the less well-placed who have either remained under corporate umbrellas or who have been discarded as redundant. Yet, on the other hand, he suggests that anyone with any intelligence and a bit of get-up-and-go can make money. And for those who dont succeed, it must be because they have failed to develop an eye for a customer, the market, and a useful skill.  This is the understanding of an individual who early in life received both an elite education and a lucrative job posting for which he was admittedly mostly unqualified who has now decided in later years to both mildly point out the flaws of capitalistic society and chide those who havent single-handedly overcome those economic forces.<br />The author attempts to fuse an emphasis on personal sovereignty, or what he sometimes calls proper selfishness, and the need for community especially within business enterprises. Recognizing that it is increasingly likely that he or she will be left to fend for themselves in the harsh environment of free markets, the individual should not seek employment, per se, but should develop employability. Of course, backpedaling, the author recognizes that the educational system as well as other institutions does little to develop and sustain a society of entrepreneurs. The one-shot chance at an education of forgettable facts is largely useless to those who desire/must operate service businesses. But this harsh reality is not all bad; the author insists that there is a widespread hunger for personal growth that will be a part of developing employability. Work that has a greater purpose will increasingly be sought. Does walking the dogs or trimming the grass of elites qualify?<br />This line of thinking also has ramifications within corporations. These newly inner-directed employees will reject being regarded as human resources or managed as some kind of business cost.  They will settle for nothing less than being viewed as citizens of their companies with rights of residence, justice, free speech, a share of the wealth , and a say in the governance of their [companies].  The author correctly acknowledges that the democratic reorganization of companies seems like a trade union manifesto, which does not comport well with his expressed anti-union convictions. Other than through the insistence of these newly redirected employees, the author is unclear as to how the major redistribution of power that will be required to establish companies of citizens will occur. Of course, the compelling question is why the author is concerned about businesses as communities. Properly selfish, self-employed, citizens no longer need to work for corporations, right?<br />Despite the fact that the author generally regards laissez-faire economics as troublesome for the greater society, he seems unwilling to advocate for political processes to exert much control over its excesses. In fact, he suggests that major issues are best decided outside the political process beyond the level of the nation-state by pressures from global markets or by international economic (WTO) and military alliances. Citizens/voters should confine themselves to local issues of roads and schools and police and hospitals. This minimalist view of politics and government is hardly adequate to address the effects of the bottom line thinking of modern capitalism for which the author expresses concern. The revamping of educational systems to include life-long learning with replacement income during schooling and the restructuring of corporations will require greater, not lesser, political intervention.<br />Asa critique of capitalistic society, this book is marginal at best. The authors focus on the drive for money and the workings of market forces doesnt begin to explain the structure of capitalistic societies. Absent are virtually any descriptions of the power structures in society and, most importantly, the domination of contemporary culture and the control of information by media empires. It is clear that the author has little appreciation for the profound role of citizen empowerment whether that is through the political process or such bodies as unions that will be necessary to counter the forces of modern capitalism. The idea that half of society becoming entrepreneurs trying to sell services to each other or to a layer of elites without significantly countering present economic forces will represent a general advancement for society is dubious at best. If anything, it seems a certain path for a First-World country to become a Second- or Third-World country.As a critique of capitalistic society, this book is marginal at best.

The author goes to considerable effort to discredit the notion that there are \\"objective\\" views of history, preferring to emphasize the ideological filtering that inevitably occurs. In keeping with that line of thought, many of the essays take issue with any number of positions that misunderstand the nature of the Athenian democratic experiment.<br />The point of many critics is that regardless of the formal structure of a state, a narrow elite invariably governs or controls affairs, which is commonly know as the \\"Iron Law of Oligarchy.\\" However, the author goes to great pains to demonstrate that economic inequality in the private realm was not allowed to overpower the Assembly of citizens, the native-born males of the Athens city-state. In addition, the protection of the dignity of all citizens was of utmost importance to all with the crime of hubris directed towards citizens by elites viewed as especially egregious. Most of the executive and judicial bodies were determined by rotation and by lottery, diminishing the possibility of an entrenched bureaucracy. Of course, educated elites with good speaking ability could be highly influential within assemblies, but they had to operate within the discursive context of the demos, the body of citizens.<br />A further misunderstanding is that the Athenian democracy was constitutional, that it was based on the rule of law and the separation of powers, in essence, a division of sovereignty with the legal system as the trump card.  But the Athenian democracy was not based on a founding document or on an overriding concept such as \\"natural rights.\\" Athenian citizens did not gain their political standing primarily through political institutions. The Athenian democracy had a socio-political context. Decisions made by the Assembly and judicial bodies were based on broad social standards as understood by the general citizenry and not on \\"established doctrines.\\" The legalese that pervades today's legal system and acts as a barrier to average citizens' participation was not a part of Athenian judicial or legislative proceedings. Athenians relied upon their collective wisdom and individual common sense to make sound judgments. The author regards this as a \\"pragmatic\\" approach to governance.<br />The notion of democracy has taken on all manner of meaning in today's world. For some, it is voting every few years with no political input otherwise. It is even suggested that the right to shop freely is democracy at work. Businesses have taken to suggesting that they operate on democratic principles. None of these highly limited notions of democracy come close to realizing the level of citizenship and empowerment of Athenian citizens of 2500 years ago. That is not the theme of this book, but the stark contrast can hardly go unnoticed.<br />This is a fairly scholarly work. The author is not reluctant to sprinkle about Greek terminology, though usually with some definition at first usage. There is a sense of an ongoing dialogue with other academics with alternative views, which has resulted in some keen insights into some aspects of the Athens city-state. But because of the essay format, this is not a work that systematically describes all of the political facets of the Athenian city-state. As a reader interested in democracy, I found the book to be very interesting.ext.

The author depicts a close-knit, rural society dominated by white landowners who basically controlled their communities' affairs including the dispensing of justice as they saw fit. Keeping the blacks of the area under a watchful eye and in a subordinate economic position was a huge part of that control. Any deviation from their prescribed roles and permitted behaviors, generally resulted in some form of physical violence being perpetrated upon blacks. Of course, law enforcement personnel, if not assisting in this extra-legal violence, looked the other way.<br />The assassination of these four individuals screamed across the nation's headlines in the summer of 1946 to the surprise of the local residents. This dispensing of justice, while more egregious than was usually the case, was from the same timeworn mold. The local thought was, Why the clamor? The FBI, the NAACP, and any number of reporters descended on Walton County, Georgia that summer. But all of those parties met with silence, fear, dissembling, conflicting stories, and a decided lack of evidence. Five months of investigation, including the convening of a federal grand jury, yielded only some potential suspects, but the evidence was slight and inconclusive.<br />The author seemed to have a vague notion that she would be able to sift through the evidence and solve the case, aided by further digging. That thought was fueled by the fact that an alleged first-hand witness to the murders had come forward with his story in the early 1990s. It becomes evident in the course of the book that the new revelation was largely a fabrication, though the motivation remains unclear.<br />The author's project began in 1997, fifty-one years after the crime. Virtually all of the suspects and witnesses had died by that time. Most of the recapitulation of the days leading to the killings was derived from the extensive interviews conducted by the FBI in 1946. Other sources were newspaper accounts and files from the NAACP. In the beginning, the author attempts to piece together the steps and actions of the principals in the days leading to the murders. Most of the book is devoted to bouncing around the conflicting evidence as it was gathered. Some conclusions can be drawn, but mostly the truth remains obscure.<br />Of course, anyone reading this book would realize that the crime has not been solved, so that is not a good reason to read the book. And it is a slight criticism of the book that after that much effort, the author does not in the end offer much in the way of speculation as to the perpetrators. The importance of this book is that it lays bare the notion that Southern society treated blacks, though perhaps differently, benignly. Life for blacks in the olden South was nothing short of brutal. One wonders just what it is from the past that Southerners want to defend in the various flag controversies now raging throughout Southern states. This book makes quite clear that atonement for the past should be on the minds of rural Southerners, not preservation.time.

A Company of Citizens is concerned with two themes. First, \\"workers in today's Knowledge Age,\\" mindful of their contributions and responsibilities, increasingly expect to become full citizens of their organizations with rights to self-govern and to develop practices of cooperation. Secondly, the Greek city-state of Athens in the fourth and fifth century B.C. is presented as the most significant example of a large organization/society that operated as a thoroughgoing democracy, and, as such, is suggested by the authors as the best practical model for modern firms desirous of a transformation to democracy. But the connection between the democracy of Athens which existed primarily at the level of the state and participatory democracy in modern, private enterprises is hardly straightforward. The authors contend that reality for today's employees is one of being forced to \\"check their values and sense of purpose\\" at the door to their firms, much to the detriment of the firms.<br />A large portion of the book consists of a discussion and breakdown of what the authors term the core elements of the Athenian democratic system: \\"democratic values, governance structures, and participatory practices.\\"  The basis of the widespread participation by Athenian citizens in the affairs of state was an unprecedented freedom and equality. There was not a layer of elites that trumped the various citizen assemblies, and any leaders chosen remained accountable to those assemblies. There was frequent rotation of citizens among the various bodies performing legislative, executive, and judicial functions. The art and responsibility of governing was widely distributed among Athenian citizens.<br />The authors focus on the Athenian concerns for defense and the domination of neighboring city-states as evidence of the positive workings of the Athenian democracy. But the authors make little mention of the economy of Athens, which is surprising since this book attempts to address the relevance of the Athens model to modern private enterprises. They make the claim that redistribution of private assets was not part of Athenian policies. But the redistribution of power or economic goods in the name of fairness and the wellbeing of communities is invariably part of democracies. That is a fundamental principle of modern social-democratic states, and, one guesses, of the Athens city-state.<br />For both communities and organizations, issues of \\"who can be members\\" and \\"the permanency of membership\\" are primary. An oddity by today's standards, citizenship in the Athens city-state was limited to native-born males. Unfortunately, the authors seem to have been unduly swayed by that restriction by pondering whether levels of membership will need to be established in firms employing workers with varying degrees of importance to their firms' success.  However, a caste system is a dubious proposition for a modern democratic community. As a further consideration, in most genuine communities, members are protected by the group and not cast aside in difficult times. Yet the authors see \\"downsizing\\" as a possible action by democratic communities, though perhaps distasteful. The damage to an organization's fabric is not discussed.<br />The oft-repeated, hollow slogan of modern companies, \\"the people are the company,\\" certainly had validity in Athens. There can be no state without citizens. But modern companies have legal, independent standing and are generally owned by outside shareholders, not workers. The reality is that workers are more like \\"wage slaves,\\" not citizens of their companies with long-term, essential standing, legal or otherwise. The authors briefly touch on the necessity of redefining and reprioritizing the concept of \\"stakeholder\\" in modern companies. Obviously, a company of citizens cannot be trumped by absentee owners and still be a democratic community.<br />Closely tied to the issue of ownership of a firm is the role of management. The difficulties in transforming a company being operated by a managerial elite backed by a board of directors to one governed by employee-citizens cannot be exaggerated. A company of citizens cannot simply be mandated with power being retained by some overriding authority, no matter how enlightened. The authors point out that a democracy evolves through  experimentation and mistakes by citizens. It is difficult to envision a modern CEO permitting his authority to be eliminated, let alone diminished, or allowing himself to be rotated out of the job. In addition, a huge issue is whether modern workers can really embrace and accept the responsibilities of democracy.<br />The emphasis on the Athens city-state is instructive from the standpoint of describing a \\"strong\\" democracy, despite some of its shortcomings. But one could ask whether it is even necessary to turn to ancient history to shed light on employees trying to find empowerment within their workplaces. The labor movement has struggled since the beginnings of industrialization to gain a voice for workers within enterprises. The authors do not present in the main text any examples of companies where employees are full citizens. It would have been interesting for the authors to comment on the well known example of the Saturn Corporation as to its fit as a company of citizens. Or perhaps the works council systems found in Europe could have been mentioned.<br />The authors repeatedly make the point that a company of citizens must be concerned with a \\"steep performance challenge,\\" but why the condition? One would think that those advocating for democracy would do so on the fundamental basis of citizens controlling their destiny and not on the existence of some unusual circumstance. The book is thought provoking. But far too much space is devoted to the Athens city-state and the attempt to capture its workings in a set of textbook-like generalizations. There is little in this book that leads one to believe that the U.S. will be establishing companies of citizens any time soon. Nor is the book much in the way of a blueprint of how to do so.  In some respects this book can be added to a large list of management books that talk employee empowerment, but don't quite get it.ansforming a company being operated by a managerial elite backed by a board of directors to one governed by employee-citizens cannot be exaggerated.

This book is largely an answer to those who would contend that Lincoln showed little promise of greatness before supposedly stumbling into the Presidency, where it is acknowledged even by those critics that he rose to the heights demanded by the times. The author certainly admits to the elements of circumstance in Lincoln's ascent. He was a Whig, or a moderate, in a state Illinois that had become increasingly important in national elections.<br />While it may have appeared that Lincoln was politically dormant in the early 50s, his behind-the-scenes political activity became obvious when he became a key anti-Nebraska activist in 1854. As a Whig, Lincoln lost a very close contest in the Illinois legislature for the U.S. Senate (legislatures elected senators in that era). From 1854 to 1856 it had become obvious that both the Whigs and the upstart Know-Nothings could not deal with the slavery issue, which led to their demise. By 1856 Lincoln had finished second in the running for the Vice-Presidential nomination at the first national Republican convention, and in the process had firmly established himself as a leading Republican in Illinois.<br />It was the continued Kansas crisis and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision in March of 1857 and the reactions to them that put Lincoln on the national stage. The court decision had affirmed the repeal of the Missouri Compromise in the Kansas-Nebraska Act under a principle of Congressional non-intervention in territories. But Senator Stephen Douglas contended that his doctrine of popular sovereignty continued to hold. Both Lincoln and most Republicans found the indifference or neutrality of popular sovereignty to the spread of slavery to be repugnant. Thus began a series of exchanges and seven formal debates between Douglas and Lincoln before the elections of 1858.<br />As a senator from mostly anti-slavery Illinois, Douglas had been forced, at the end of 1857, to denounce the machinations of the proslavery element in Kansas in trying to force their constitution on a mostly slave-free territory. In a shrewd and unprecedented political move, Illinois Republicans nominated Lincoln for the U. S. Senate to counter the infatuation of Eastern Republicans with the newly recreated Douglas. Lincoln fired the first shot in the senatorial campaign with his famous \\"House Divided\\" speech where he insisted that a nation divided over slavery could not stand.<br />One of the more controversial ideas that emerged from the debates was Douglas' Freeport Doctrine. In skirting Lincoln's question of whether territorial legislatures could exclude slavery, Douglas claimed that such a legislature's failure to pass laws that favorably policed slavery was tantamount to formally excluding it. The Democratic illusion that non-intervention and popular sovereignty were benignly equivalent had been exploded. According to the author \\"Southerners could see the walls closing in on them, and the defection of Douglas vividly dramatized the growing isolation of slave society.\\" Ignoring Dred Scott, the South began to insist on the enactment of positive slave codes for the explicit protection of slavery in territories.<br />Lincoln narrowly lost the senatorial contest in Illinois in 1858, but the issue of slavery had been discussed on the national stage, as it never had been before. While Lincoln had asked the hard questions about slavery, he remained a moderate in Republican circles, and, as such, perhaps the only Republican that could have been elected President in 1860. It is clear that Lincoln had no intention of attacking the institution of slavery in the South. The Southern demand for slave codes applicable to territories was simply irrational given the fact that it was generally agreed upon that no territories were even suitable for slavery. It is most clear from reading this book that had the extremists of the South permitted Lincoln to exercise the fundamental decency and strength of character that he had, that there would have been no reason to precipitate the destruction of an entire way of life.upon that no territories were even suitable for slavery.

Stephens was a prototypical, antebellum Southern Whig: scholarly, principled, and moral. Yet in many ways his life was compromised as he, along with other Southern politicians, was \\"compelled to defend the indefensible.\\"<br />Stephens despite the disadvantages of humble beginnings and a sickly, frail constitution was able, through some fortuitous and generous assistance on the part of others, to climb into the lower ranks of Southern society, first as a lawyer and then as a U. S. Congressman. There, Stephens found himself in entangled in such antebellum controversies as the Mexican Cession, the Wilmot Proviso, the Kansas-Nebraska bill, and the Lecompton controversy.<br />Stephens as a Whig was a staunch defender of the Constitution, the Union, and the rule of law. He opposed the Texas annexation and the Mexican War as infringing on those cherished beliefs. However, Stephens was constantly walking a tightrope between his Whiggish principles and the political realities of the South over the issue of slavery. He supported Kansas-Nebraska, but by that time he had been forced to jump ship to the Democracy. Later he committed the apostasy of siding with the northern Democrat Douglas in the Lecompton controversy and then supported him for president in 1860. For this reader the author's coverage of these controversies gets a little confused by his focusing on the various tortured rationalizations of the various parties, including Stephens'.<br />The author devotes much time to the state of Stephens health in this period (often sick), his mood swings (often in despair), and his need for recognition which is seen in his oratory, his obsessiveness in defending his personal honor (even resorting to challenges for duels), and his somewhat exaggerated views of his own importance. Stephens was a prolific writer of letters, especially to his younger brother Linton, throughout his life, and these are used well by the author to capture Stephens' thinking.<br />Stephens was one of the leading Southern politicians who opposed the Southern secession. During the War, from his position as Vice-President of the Confederacy, he was a constant thorn in the side of Jefferson Davis, the President. Of course, Stephens construed his opposition as principled. But his opposition to such policies as conscription and the suspension of habeas corpus in the context of Southern survival seems wrong-headed. After the War, Stephens was returned to the House of Representatives and then served as governor of Georgia for four months before his death in 1883 at the age of seventy-one.<br />At times this book becomes tedious in its detailing of the endless rationalizations and defensiveness of Stephens in his various political dealings through the years. His self-assignment of being more moral, pure, and principled than others wears thin. In addition, for such a lengthy book, it seems that only a glimpse of the broader world shows through and then through Stephens' views and machinations. The reader can become only moderately informed of the events of the day and of Southern society. The book definitely focuses on Stephens, the insatiable and recognition-starved politician, which probably narrows its appeal.was one of the leading Southern politicians who opposed the Southern secession.

And the organization of the book contributes to that problem, because the presidents are not presented chronologically. The continuity of events across presidencies gets lost in this book.<br />The presidents are discussed in five tiers, from the &quot;undisputed champions&quot; to the &quot;tomoto cans.&quot; In other words, they are ranked from the best to the worst. After the top tier, there is definitely room to quibble with the ratings. The author is rather vague as to the selection process. As a side note, for this reader what is especially noticeable in this journey through the presidents is the remarkably few really top notch presidents we have had. Most have been rather mediocre.<br />Contributing to the narrative disorganization of the book is the author's scattering of snippets of presidential facts in boxes on each page that are not necessarily connected to the main text. In addition, despite the modest amount of information that is actually presented in the book, there are several errors in facts and dates and in some cases there is an absence of dates.<br />For a quick read that will yield a few basic facts, this book will serve that purpose. Beyond that, the book's utility is doubtful.	2003-02-17
US	52280224	R2M9J9O2WIF6II	0671792806	649821276	Principle-Centered Leadership	Books	3	39	61	N	Y	Principle-Centered Leadership Falls Well Short of Claims	For the most part American businesses have traditionally ignored the fact that their workplaces are small societies where employees have many of the same social and political concerns and needs as in the broader society. Renowned management guru, Stephen Covey, offers a \\"principle-centered leadership\\" (PCL) paradigm for businesses that supposedly rests on time-tested social norms and values.<br />The maintenance of order and stability is of primary importance in any society.  The smooth operation of virtually all American businesses is achieved through the exercise of the unilateral authority and power of a management hierarchy that views employees as commodities or economic units, not social actors. In such firms, social interaction is limited to financial exchanges or to some form of coercion. In the \\"human relations paradigm,\\" authority may be somewhat more benevolent, recognizing or manipulating emotional needs, but is not weakened. In the \\"human relations paradigm,\\" the creativity and talent of employees are better utilized, though still in a utilitarian sense. In all of these paradigms, employees are only a means to the ends of the company. Their initiative is often not appreciated, if not prohibited. In other words, employees are not regarded as social and political equals in typical companies.<br />So what is wrong with this state of affairs? These managerial outlooks have generally worked for American businesses. But according to the author the intense competition of an infinitely more complex and dynamic economic landscape requires firms to empower and use all of the talents of their employees. He suggests that a new principle-centered leadership paradigm is needed that focuses on the social and political \\"principles\\" of \\"fairness, equity, justice, integrity, honesty, and trust.\\" It is supposedly a paradigm that extends full citizenship within a firm to all employees.<br />What are some of the characteristics of a firm operating under the aegis of a PCL paradigm? The empowered employee, as the base of the company, is trustworthy, which is to say that he or she is competent and possesses the character traits of integrity and maturity. Such individual trustworthiness raises trusting relationships among all members of the firm to the level as being the basis of the firm's success. Trust also facilitates highly effective communications throughout the company. The company is governed according to win-win performance agreements with negotiated accountability and consequences stipulations. With such agreements in place, explicit managerial control is replaced by self-supervision. The author maintains that companies that have adopted PCL are no longer autocratic, but have created a form of democracy.<br />But how does a PCL paradigm come to exist within an organization? And is it democratic? Well, as it turns out, the establishment of a PCL organization is very much top-down driven. It is for wise, top-level leaders to transform their organizations by \\"communicating vision, clarifying purposes,\\" and establishing an overriding, governing mission. A mission statement is used to \\"heighten\\" the sense of contribution of employees. The author devotes considerable space to suggesting behavior to increase an executive's honor and power with others or to achieve influence. The focus on top leaders is continued with a repackaging of the author's \\"Seven Habits of Effective People,\\" and an outline of observable characteristics of principle-centered leaders. It is clear that the PCL paradigm seems to be based on charismatic leadership, which usually relies on appeals to emotion and not careful deliberation or extensive participation.<br />In virtually any democracy, the rights of citizens to secure equal participation and due process is based on legislation or a constitution that concretely defines those rights and stipulates the manner to achieve those rights. The health of a democracy is never left to the good intentions of leaders. Yet that is exactly what the author suggests, regarding a twelve-word mission statement as a constitution, \\"a framework for governing.\\" The fact that a mission statement is consented to, in some sense, does not give it legitimacy as a constitution. The author makes the classic business claim that formal rules and regulations that ensure that employees can obtain equal voice and impartial adjudication of disputes are impediments to a principle-focused firm. For the author, security is an internal attitude and is not based on a bundle of rights found in a real constitution. The author's definitive statement concerning democracy within firms is that employees interested in politics (who exercises power within the firm) need to shape up (abandon their quest for formal rights) or ship out (leave or be fired without formal due process).<br />The author bases much of his concept of principle-centered leadership on his contention that principles of human interaction are \\"self-evident, objective, and external,\\" much like natural processes. That is profoundly incorrect. Equity, fairness, and justice are all contentious issues that are often subjected to vigorous debate among all parties. The all-wise leader does not have a hold on the definition of those ideals.<br />Like most books of this genre, this author makes virtually no reference to other authorities or scholars in such fields as sociology, political science, or psychology. The reader is left to wonder about the bases of the author's forays into topics of motivation, social and political theory, and organizational behavior. For example, the author acknowledges that systems and environments greatly influence us, yet his answer to the problem of establishing quality is to create principle-oriented persons who simply overcome organizational impediments to quality. That is questionable sociology.<br />PCL adopts the façade of employee empowerment, but in reality it is far more a paradigm in motivation. The goal in PCL is to subtly convince employees that the firm is being run in a benevolent, equitable manner by all-knowing, high-minded leaders towards lofty goals. Conflicts are downplayed as insignificant in comparison with the widespread, unmitigated devotion to a transcendent mission.<br />This book does not make its case for PCL. It is at best a vague concept with little grounding in social science and at worst simply another form of managerial manipulation. Undoubtedly, the patina of empowerment will persuade some.Yet that is exactly what the author suggests, regarding a twelve-word mission statement as a constitution, \\"a framework for governing.\\" The fact that a mission statement is consented to, in some sense, does not give it legitimacy as a constitution.

The author has extensively researched Lincoln's movements, first-hand accounts of his utterances, his formal speeches and writings, as well as official records kept in the discharge of his various duties and offices.<br />It is a fascinating look at the evolution of the character and personality of a man of meager origins and virtually no formal education. Lincoln was driven to make something of himself; this is best seen in his insatiable desire to educate himself. Beyond self-development, Lincoln had an inherent ability to relate to others. He combined humility with a great ability to tell stories. This ease among his fellow citizens led to his being elected to the Illinois legislature at a fairly young age and to a reasonably successful career as a lawyer.<br />Lincoln was a Whig and devotee of Henry Clay and his American system of internal improvements. But it would be completely wrong to regard Lincoln as mostly an opportunistic politician. He was principled, if anything. Manipulating a political view to get elected would have never occurred to Lincoln. Furthermore, Lincoln was a man of his word. When elected to Congress in 1846, he returned home after one term as he promised, though undoubtedly he could have been re-elected. However, the author shows that Lincoln became very astute politically with a substantial network of political friends both at the state and national levels.<br />Early in Lincoln's career, slavery was seldom an issue. But by the mid-1850s, slavery came to dominate the political and social life of the country. Lincoln, though clearly antislavery, was not an abolitionist. In his debates with Stephen Douglas in 1858 and on his way to being elected president in 1860, Lincoln articulated, often eloquently, a moderate position on slavery that resonated with a large segment of Northern voters. The extension of slavery to new territories became the foremost issue of the day as compared to eradication.<br />Lincoln was probably not technically qualified to be president; he had never held an administrative post of any importance. Nor did hundreds of high-level administrative assistants perform most of his duties, as is the case in the modern era. In addition, Lincoln faced perhaps the greatest challenge that any president in our history ever has. The secession of the South exacerbated political divides in the country. Not only did Lincoln have to deal with radical and moderate Republicans and War and Peace Democrats, but also his own cabinet, populated with some of his political rivals, exhibited the same sort of splits. Militarily, the U.S. was totally unprepared to put down a rebellion, as Lincoln called it, of the size that the Confederacy represented. He was often driven to the edge of his patience in dealing with a series of incompetent generals that cost the Northern armies defeat after defeat in the early years of the War.<br />The author captures the immense pressures on Lincoln during his presidency. His ungainliness was fodder for the various political factions that publicly labeled Lincoln as an \\"imbecile\\" or a \\"baboon.\\" Though the presidency took a tremendous toll on Lincoln, he retained his generally good humor, even seeing countless numbers of nameless citizens straight from the streets in his office. He functioned at a high level of awareness, navigating the political minefields of the day, in making difficult decisions. The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 was just such a decision. It was a typically moderate Lincoln response to the antislavery and unionist extremists. When Lincoln was shot at the beginning of his second term, he had prevailed and brought the country through a terrible experience through the sheer strength and flexibility of his intellect and personality. One doubts whether there existed another individual in the country at that time, who could have dealt with all of the issues that Lincoln did with the same degree of success.<br />Though the author is favorably deposed towards Lincoln, he does not push Lincoln on the reader - he does not have to. He does a great job of letting the reader closely watch Lincoln in action for about forty years. It is an incredible story.heer strength and flexibility of his intellect and personality.

But the author's views are tilted toward those of the antebellum South. He goes to great length in describing the Southern plantation system with its incorporation of slave labor and compares it somewhat favorably with the industrialization and the \\"so-called\\" free labor of the North. In addition, the exaggerated Southern claims of social superiority seem to strike a chord with the author.<br />A great deal of the book is consumed with describing the reactions and views of leading spokesmen and of various publications in the North and the South concerning major antebellum political developments. The question of the Mexican Cession and the Wilmot Proviso in 1846 moved the question of slavery squarely into the political system resulting in the formation of the Free Soil Party and talk of secession in the South. The Compromise of 1850 quieted some voices, but only until the next expansion of slavery.<br />Interestingly, of all of the political crises of the mid-1850s where slavery was front and center, that is, the Kansas-Nebraska bill, the bleeding Kansas crisis, and the Dred Scott decision, the author claims that the Southern response was relatively moderate compared to the extremists of the North. Yet that moderation seemed to have evaporated with the John Brown raid at Harpers Ferry. And the Southern reaction to Lincoln's election the next year was beyond shrill and ultimately self-destructive.<br /><br />I think it is fairly obvious that this author regards the Civil War as occurring as a result of emotionalism and opportunism run amok. And despite the fact that the South was unwilling to honor the untainted election of a President and failed to comprehend that all of the conservative candidates together far outpolled the Republican, I believe that the author holds that Northern forces largely provoked the Southern secession and then were unwilling to accept that fact by offering some kind of compromise.<br />This author fails to grasp, or at least state, that slavery and its ramifications were the great moral issues of the day. Of course, tremendous emotionalism was evoked by the issues. And those issues could not be simply managed or downplayed in the Second American Party system. Slavery was conceptually wrong for America and produced an unsustainable divide between two sections of the country. Emotionalism may have obscured that fact then and now, but it is superficial as an explanation for the Civil War.ely provoked the Southern secession and then were unwilling to accept that fact by offering some kind of compromise. <br />This author fails to grasp, or at least state, that slavery and its ramifications were the great moral issues of the day.

It would be difficult to find an historian more qualified to offer a succinct analysis with his two highly acclaimed books on the revolutionary period: The Creation of the American Republic 1776-1787 and The Radicalism of the American Revolution. It becomes readily evident that the American Revolution cannot be understood as simply battles won and oppression thrown aside.<br /><br />The author makes abundantly clear that enormous cultural, social, and economic changes were occurring in the colonies dating from the French and Indian War. There was a tremendous amount of westward migration in this period. Americans were becoming economically more prosperous by producing raw goods and finished products for the European and Caribbean markets. This adventuresomeness and prosperity strained lines of social deference and traditional authority. Even though colonialists regarded themselves as Englishmen, they led lives of independence. Especially on the western front, settlers often had to band together to perform basic governmental functions such as keeping the peace.<br /><br />The French and Indian War was part of a British effort to regain control over its empire, but it proved to be very costly with continuing costs projected. Subsequent British attempts to tax Americans for those costs and to quarter soldiers on American soil via a series of ill-conceived acts of Parliament in the 1760s and 70s precipitated all manner of protest from the colonialists. The notion of \\"virtual\\" representation in Parliament as being sufficient for agreeing to taxation was rejected strongly throughout the colonies. The protests and the violence eventually led to the war effort beginning over a year before the Declaration of Independence in July, 1776.<br /><br />While the British had the advantages of a trained military, that was offset by the remoteness and vastness of the American colonies and Washington's willingness to wage a war of attrition. The actual entity that waged war for the colonies was the Continental Congress; however, it had no power to tax the individual colonies. Had it not been for the financial support of the French, this lack of power could have undermined the revolutionary effort.<br /><br />After the war, the states resumed their roles as the primary governmental entities, but formulated under new constitutions with weak executives and strong legislatures. Unfortunately, the result was democratic-induced chaos, with laws and policies subject to constant change based on the relative strength of interest groups, especially debtors who wanted either debt forgiveness or other considerations. Furthermore, the colonies did not present a coherent front to the European powers, placing the colonies at a considerable disadvantage. Colonial elites, merchants, creditors and the like realized that this political situation was untenable and called for a constitutional convention in 1787. There, a relatively strong central government was constructed with the powers to wage war, conduct foreign affairs, establish a currency, control commerce, set tariffs, etc. Countering claims of the Anti-Federalists that the new constitution made a too powerful national government, the Framers vested sovereignty in the national populace, not the states: democracy and centralization in one fell swoop.<br /><br />The founding of the United States, that is the adoption of the Constitution, represented in some ways a restoration of the control of elites and an enhancement of the ideas of republicanism and the virtuous citizen. But social, economic, political, and religious forces were well underway that swept aside the control of elites. The common man thought of himself as being the equal of anyone, regardless of learning or background, which may well be the true revolution of the period.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the revolutionary period is the most profound and important period in our history. Our essential nature was cast at that time. This book is a nice overview of that time with some good insights, but some of the jumping around among the various events of the period with little or no explanation could be a little disconcerting.

The author finds that the general Whig philosophy and culture transcended the Whig Party. He explores the breadth of that thinking by profiling a dozen of the leading Whigs of the day from the worlds of politics, religion, business, and the legal system.<br />The Whigs could be considered an oddity in the Age of Jackson, which extolled the virtues and equality of the common man. The Whigs were a throwback to colonial times and to a country-party tradition where society was considered to be hierarchical with elites rightfully governing and controlling the society. To the Whigs, society was a balanced organism with its constituent parts accepting their places, while the Democrats were not unwilling to point out opposing interests among, say, producers versus non-producers. Not surprisingly, a majority of the well to do and other prominent citizens were Whigs in the mid-nineteenth century.<br />The author points out that the Whigs had little regard for party politics. For them, the political realm should not be a contest among those with differing conceptions of society. It was for politicians to reinforce and improve the social order. While the Jacksonian approach to social and economic affairs was generally one of laissez-faire emphasizing personal liberty and territorial expansion, the Whigs stressed self-control and government-orchestrated qualitative improvements in the country. Henry Clay's American System, the main platform of the Whig Party, called for federal government subsidization of internal improvements, tariffs to protect northern industry and planters producing for domestic markets, and a national banking system to control currency and supply easy credit. In addition, the Whigs were proponents of public education, benevolent societies, asylums, etc.<br />The author suggests that the broader appeal of Whiggery was mostly moral. Whigs felt a moral obligation to redeem or reform themselves and others including the greater society. This moral dimension of Whiggery was very much driven by the evangelical movement of the day. However, there was a tension between social-conservative Whigs and those whose focus on morality made them more inclined to back social reform. It is not the author's intent to fully explore antebellum history, but it is clear that slavery was the issue that drove a wedge between northern and southern Whigs and led to the party's demise by 1856. The reform-minded, northern wing of the Whig Party could not countenance the extension of slavery that the Democratically-controlled Congress backed with the support of conservative southern Whigs.<br />The author emphasizes John Q. Adams and Henry Clay as those Whigs most exemplifying the core values and programs of Whiggery. But the vast majority of northern Whigs found themselves in the Republican Party by 1860. Abraham Lincoln, a prominent Whig dating from the 1830s, best represents the Whig transition to Republicanism. He retained virtually all of his earlier Whig predispositions, but he emphasized the equality of men as first articulated in the Declaration of Independence. Though highly secular in outlook, Lincoln practically sanctified the principles of the Declaration which appealed to the morality-focused reformers of the era.  In addition, gone was the paternalism of the Whigs. Lincoln extolled the virtues of free labor and emphasized the possibilities of social mobility through hard work.<br />The author notes that the cultural predominance of small-town America, the paternalistic factory owner, and the ethic of hard work - all prominent in the Whig culture and ideology - were mostly swallowed by the urbanization and industrialization of the late nineteenth century. Theclassical learning and the persuasive oratorical skills of the Whigs largely disappeared. The Whig Party, though having played a significant role in antebellum politics, only existed just over twenty years. Although Whiggery seems quaint by today's standards, it is not possible to understand the forces leading to the Civil War without taking into account the impact of Whig thinking. I say put this book on your shelf next to those by Foner, Potter, Holt, Donald - among others.e classical learning and the persuasive oratorical skills of the Whigs largely disappeared.

He attempts to piece together the actual writing of the address and to sort through various claims that particular drafts of the address were the final version. The author thoroughly debunks the notion that the address was a last-minute preparation.<br />The Gettysburg Cemetery was part of the nineteenth century's renewed interest in Greek society including the Greek interest in rural cemeteries. The two hour funeral oration by eminent Greek scholar Edward Everett at Gettysburg was typical for the times.<br />Clearly the most important aspect of the Gettysburg address was its turning to the ideas of the Declaration of Independence as the essential principles of the United States. The author shows that it was the &quot;unfinished work&quot; of establishing &quot;a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot; that Lincoln focused on. In his address, Lincoln made certain that the particulars of the Civil War would not intrude on his theme of a rebirth for a nation founded in 1776.<br />Lincoln was a noted scholar of language. The author dissects a number of Lincoln's earlier speeches to show his careful phrasing and choice of words. For the author, the Gettysburg address is the very epitome of an &quot;economical, taut, interconnected&quot; speech. He notes the repetition of words, the phrasing and sentence structure, and Lincoln's ability to cut out the extraneous. Though Everett was the principal speaker at Gettysburg, the simple brilliance of Lincoln's dedication remarks are what are remembered nearly one and a half centuries later.<br />The book is quite good in providing the context for the Gettysburg Address. There are quite a few Greek references but they are not so numerous as to present an obstacle for understanding. Though not the purpose of the author, it would have been interesting to see more substantiation of the transformative impact of the Gettysburg address.the Gettysburg Address.

US	52280224	RYAGTMYQG4IFV	039395370X	526594621	The Political Crisis of the 1850s	Books	4	55	61	N	Y	Overemphasis on political containment, but otherwise good	Part of the author's title is indisputable: the Northern-Southern divide over slavery and all of its attendant subtleties and ramifications was a crisis only waiting to happen in the 1850s. But the author places greater importance on what he sees as the political crisis of that era. Regardless, this book is a fine effort in capturing the richness of the party politics in the two decades leading to the Civil War.<br />It is the author's essential point that a robust democratic polity requires political parties that compete on a somewhat equal basis, inspire widespread party loyalty and, in essence, control the more fractious issues or interpretations of the times. That is exactly the role that the author suggests that the Second Party system consisting of the Whigs and Democrats played from Andrew Jackson's presidency to the early 1850s. The expansion of slavery into new territories and states was the most contentious issue of the day. The Northern and Southern wings of both the Democrats and the Whigs adopted particular positions on such controversies as the Wilmot Proviso and the Compromise of 1850 that kept the public looking to the political realm for solutions. The author notes that themes of republican virtue, that is, defense of freedom and independence and opposition to tyranny in its various guises, were the basis of the parties' positions.<br />But that political status quo fell apart as both the slavery issue and nativism could not be contained within the Second Party system. While the author views this development as the beginning of the political crisis of the 1850s, others may see the rise of new political parties as the essence of political responsiveness. The Know Nothing party had a meteoric rise in the mid-1850s but just as quickly the Republicans rose in the late 1850s and elected Abraham Lincoln to the presidency in 1860. The author contends that political elites should be able to manage controversial issues of the day. But the fact is that the adherents of anti-slavery, nativism, and free soil of the 1850s overwhelmed the political alignments formed in the 1830s. The author comes close to suggesting that the Republicans were irresponsible opportunists by forming a party on sectional lines with sectional interests.<br />The essential question that the author asks is why did slavery become an issue in the 1850s. After all, it had existed for the first sixty years of the nation. But his explanation of Second Party system breakdown seems inadequate. In the first place the Whig Party broke up in the South as a result of the Compromise of 1850. Secondly, a series of slavery-related developments in the 1850s exacerbated the situation. The Kansas-Nebraska Act, the entire state constitution fiasco in Kansas, and the Dread Scott decision all convinced Northerners that an oligarchic Slave Power had gained the upper hand in extending slavery. Those reactions drove political realignment along sectional lines.<br />However, a salient point of the author's, and in accordance with his political crisis thesis, is that the lack of political competition in the lower southern states permitted the extremism that led to an extra-political solution, or secession. He points out that the upper south retained vigorous opposition parties to the Democrats and confidence in the political system as an avenue for redress. In the author's view, it is not surprising that South Carolina was the first state to secede because a vigorous two party system had never existed there.<br />The author admits that his book is an &quot;extended dialog&quot; with the earlier work of Eric Foner, author of &quot;Free Soil, Free Labor, ...&quot;. Foner emphasizes the essential social and philosophical differences between the South and the North that came to the fore and inevitably led to the Civil War. This author is not entirely dismissive of those sentiments, but chooses to emphasize the possibilities of political containment of those differences and theramifications of political breakdown. In addition, this book does a far better job of describing the various crises of the era in chronological fashion. Both books are well worth reading.<br />Footnote: this book does not in any way address the constitutional right to secede as one earlier review suggests.ramifications of political breakdown.

While ostensibly concerned with the ideology of the Republican Party leading up to the Civil War, the author clearly shows that the Republicans also both reflected and advanced the belief system that came to permeate much of the North.<br />A key component of Northern thinking emphasized a free labor and producer ethic, which extolled the virtues of free, independent, and propertied working men. Dependency was eschewed as evidence of personal shortcoming. But the institution of slavery violated that ethic in every way. Not only were slaves not free, but also Southern aristocratic society degraded free labor. To be a free laborer in the South was to be a member of a lower class. These diametrically opposed views of labor were the basis of an ongoing controversy dating from the Missouri Compromise over the issue of permitting slavery in newly obtained territories or newly admitted states. The Northern and Republican position was one of \\"free soil,\\" for free laborers.<br />Though not emphasizing the chronological history of the Republican Party, the author traces the assimilation into the party of members or adherents of the Abolitionists, the Liberty Party, the Free Soil Party, anti-slavery Democrats and Whigs, the Know-Nothings, and the so-called radical Republicans. A good sampling of the pronouncements of the leading Northern political figures of the era as well as the positions of key newspaper publishers is quite illuminating. It is a mild criticism of the book that the author, in following the historical trail, at times provides insufficient background on historical events that he refers to such as the Wilmot Proviso, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Lecompton controversy, etc.<br />Certainly much of the rise of the Republican Party was due to a concern of Northern Whigs and Democrats that the political process in Washington was being dominated by a southern Slave Power. That Slave Power was seen as a force intent on expanding the geographical reach of slavery. Every attempt at expansion of slave territory drove more and more people to the ranks of the parties that became the Republican Party. The author is keen to point out that while anti-slavery was a moral crusade on the part of some Republicans, for most the prevention of the Slave Power in expanding its reach and the preservation and expansion of Northern society superceded any moral imperative to emancipate slaves.<br />It is not the author's intent to directly list the causes of the Civil War, yet it would be difficult to deny the relevance of this book in answering those questions. But the author does address some claims of causation. While not denying that protective tariffs were controversial issues, he downplays their overall significance. For one, many leading Republicans were free traders, not protectionists. Republicanism was not simply warmed over Whiggery intent on protecting industry. In fact, many Republicans had a distrust of emerging corporations. In addition, he gives little credence to suggestions that the Civil War represents either a failure of political compromise or political incompetence.<br />The author amply demonstrates that the election of President Lincoln in 1860 constituted a culminating point for both the North and the South. Clearly, the Republicans had emerged as a voice for a Northern society that was based on entrepreneuralism, free labor, progress, and expansion. For the South, the election of Republicans was seen as a dire threat to a way of life wholly different than that of the North. No longer the foremost power in Washington, Southerners had grave misgivings concerning the designs of Republicans on dismantling their society. And neither the Democrats who had stared down John Calhoun in the Nullification Crisis or the Republicans with a Whig background of Henry Clay's Americanism were about to simply let the South secede.<br />According to the author there was \\"the conviction that North and South represented two social systems whose values, interests, and future prospects were in sharp, perhaps mortal, conflict with one another.\\" And for those who would downplay the essential role of slavery in the impending conflict, the author quotes another historian as indicating that \\"By 1860, slavery had become the symbol and carrier of all sectional differences and conflicts.\\"<br />In an introduction twenty-five years after the original, the author acknowledges that the ideology of free labor was already fraying by 1860. In the first place, by that point more than half of all men were wage earners and not independent workers. Secondly, the Republican fiction that both capital and labor had similar interests was belied by the greater power of capital to make the employment relationship hardly free. But those realities rose to the front after the Civil War as industrialism really expanded.<br />For those who would have wanted a bigger and more comprehensive book, there is merit in that. The book is somewhat narrowly focused. That is not to deny that the capturing of Republican ideology is not a significant contribution. But Southern reactions as the Republican Party was growing would have been interesting. But this book should be on the list of anyone wanting to understand the Civil War era.heir society.

Deviations include extra-marital affairs and serial monogamy, that is, divorce and remarriage. Based on this reality, the author actually advocates for responsible non-monogamy, or polyamory, which involves a wide range of sexual relationships involving at least three individuals in the same period of time.<br /><br />The author assures the reader that polyamory is not the equivalent of \\"swinging,\\" but the differences seem to be negligible. She suggests \\"coming out\\" and joining polyamory groups, the sole purpose of which is to gain intimate partners. However, generally, loving relationships should not be dependent on being formed in groups where sex is obviously foremost. That's not how twosomes are formed, why should threesomes?<br /><br />To the author, polyamory is an honest approach to life. Negative emotions like jealously have to be overcome. And there is some truth to that. But she downplays the realities of life in maintaining even one relationship. For those who work fulltime with countless family responsibilities including the raising of children, the demands of establishing and maintaining a second relationship without severely impacting the first would be daunting to say the least. Furthermore, it is asking a lot of the other partner to accept extra-marital relationships regardless of any attempts at honesty. The difficulties go way beyond jealousy. It is no wonder that in the interests of self- and marital-preservation that most affairs are kept discreet.<br /><br />It is difficult to see where the concept of polyamory has a whole lot of validity for the general population. A general life-style of polyamory would seem to appeal to those with strong sexual proclivities and who are extraordinarily open-minded, with fewer real-world, time-consuming commitments. Needless to say, this book is not going to be the basis of a surge of uninhibited, multi-partnered individuals. Most people are just not that obsessed with sex or in situations where that is possible.t people are just not that obsessed with sex or in situations where that is possible.	2002-11-06

Confidence in their social and political understandings was a factor in leading men to construct democracies. Invariably such constructs are more complex than originally foreseen. The author points out that democracies invariably contain some inherent tensions.<br />For some the construction of a democracy is a \\"technocratic\\" project to design a set of institutions and rules/laws, adherence to which is necessary for an orderly society. The emphasis on such a framework was usually motivated by the view that rights and civil society exist prior to government and need to be protected by a system of checks and balances. The \\"good\\" society protects a multiplicity of interests from governmental encroachment.<br />Yet others are interested in reconstituting society based more on a \\"moral or religious vision.\\" They desire the government to become much more a part of society to enforce a \\"totalistic\\" vision, contrary to a pluralistic view. The constraints of the institutions and representative bodies of the \\"technocrats\\" may be seen as a hindrance and unnecessary to achieving a good society.<br />In addition, some emphasize widespread citizen participation in all facets of society, eschewing being confined to simply voting. Such participatory democrats are more concerned with the inequalities of social power and see the state as the means to ensure equal participation in society.<br />The author points out that the drawing of the boundaries of what can legitimately be controlled politically has been a constant source of tension in modern democracies, much as the tradeoff between liberty and equality. It may be counterintuitive for those with political and social power, but the author insists that democracies must be able to accommodate the \\"symbols and themes of protest\\" to remain viable. Failure to do so can lead to a breakup or demise of a democracy.<br />This book is a difficult read. It is rather theoretical containing lengthy and complex sentences with little relief in practical digressions. For many the obscurity of the book may be greater than any paradoxes in democracy. For the brave or academically inclined, there may be enough in this small book to justify the effort of digging through it.an lead to a breakup or demise of a democracy.<br />This book is a difficult read.

Books	4	6	9	N	Y	Constitutional perspective	The author in a very low-key manner invites the reader to examine along with him the basic structure of the Constitution as it has impacted democracy in America. He is certainly aware that for some any questioning of the Constitution is nothing short of a sacrilege. Others are smugly certain that the subject is irrelevant because in their view the U.S. is actually a republic, not a democracy, which of course contradicts the fact that &quot;We the People&quot; established the United States.<br />While the author invests little time in formally defining democracy, it would seem that the ability for all adult citizens broadly conceived to equally participate in the political process at some basic level is essential for democracy. Whether due to the lack of a model of democracy to follow, the need for compromise among various interests, or a mistrust of ordinary citizens, the framers created some significant non-democratic structures and understandings within the Constitution. Obviously, the failure to outlaw slavery looms largest; only a minority of citizens were given voting rights in 1788; and elections of the president and senators were not directly based on popular votes. The author laments the fact that historically it has been most difficult to gain passage of Constitutional amendments that  address these kinds of issues, being subject to blockage by the disproportionately powerful seventeen smallest states in the Senate.<br />It is a misfounded conceit on the part of many Americans that the Constitution shines worldwide as the one political document that should be and is copied. The author goes to great pains to dissect that view. Among the oldest twenty-two democracies in the world, few have adopted the U.S. system of federalism, bicameral legislatures, an independent presidency, and a judiciary that can supercede national legislative actions. The author takes particular note of the fact that most other democracies employ a system of proportional representation whereby legislatures are populated by political parties based on a percentage of total votes. It would seem that the potential for representation of multiple interests within party coalitions is far greater than in a winner-take-all system where it is quite conceivable that minority interests would have no actual representation.<br />The author makes abundantly clear that regardless of constitutional structures, the prospects for democracy within a polity rests on a supportive and engaged culture. The rise of Jeffersonian democracy in the early 1800s was through the actions of the general citizenry. But the inequality of resources essential for equal political participation in today's society concerns the author. The domination of political information by vast media empires and the financing of elections by the rich does not bode well for democratic participation.<br />The Constitution is perhaps flawed - far from ideal - but it is the distortion of the political process by the powerful that is most worrisome. Of course, that power imbalance is, in turn, based on an inconsistent representation structure disinclined to produce remedial legislation.whereby legislatures are populated by political parties based on a percentage of total votes.

As might be suspected, the nonpartisanship of the Foundation and the differing perspectives of the task force members resulted in rather limited, even inconsequential, findings as to what direction the labor movement should take to reverse their slide.<br />This report established the unremarkable finding that unions at sufficient density raise members pay relative to the non-unionized segment, reduce the possibility of extreme pay differentials, increase the rate of health insurance and pension coverage, and tend to increase political participation. Of course, the task force uniformly agreed that unions need to rebound to continue to receive these benefits. One of several  side recommendations calls for unions to strategically organize through targeting organizable sectors, to consolidate unions, to promote unions as assets in high-performance workplaces, to ally with their global counterparts, and to raise labor's voice on behalf of all working people. The task force fails to mention that the labor movement has considerably stepped up these efforts over the last few years with quite modest results.<br />Other members focused on labor laws and their interpretation by courts and the National Labor Relations Board as a major hurdle for unions to overcome to organize new members. The basic labor law of the land permits employers to dominate the process by which workers supposedly are free to choose who will represent them. Under the current legal regime, employers can use both coercive and illegal tactics to prevent the establishment of a union with little concern for punitive measures being taken against them.<br />But there is no chance that the legal situation will change for unions and working people unless a wholesale transformation occurs in public thinking; there simply will be no political mandate. A task force member, Nelson Lichtenstein, declares that &quot;trade unions will need to engineer a political and cultural breakthrough that sways the hearts and minds of millions and millions of people who today see the unions as irrelevant, or even hostile, to their interests.&quot; A &quot;classwide insurgency&quot; will be required.<br />Lichtenstein also presents a background article on the labor movement since the 1930s. It is clear that through the vehicle of labor unions a sizeable portion of the working class gained substantial  economic and political citizenship. But equally clear is the fact that the labor movement facilitated those gains at considerable costs. Labor unions were expected to police their memberships in accordance with the provisions of collective bargaining agreements and to eliminate class-based militancy from within their ranks. In an era of an alleged labor-management accord, the labor movement lost the social and political power necessary to respond to the various forces that became seriously arrayed against them by the mid-1970s. The slide has been continuous since that time. A more complete picture of the slide of unions is available in Lichtenstein's recent book: &quot;State of the Union.&quot;<br />This task force as a whole was unwilling to squarely admit that class warfare has occurred in the U.S. over the last thirty years and that the working class lost and is losing. Organizing a few pockets of workers here and there, coordinating with some foreign labor bodies, and running slick political ads do not constitute a labor turnaround. The working class must adopt stances of militancy, insurgency, and participatory democracy to even think about turning around their situation. But beyond isolated cases of such resolve, there is virtually no evidence that a significant revival is even remotely imminent.beyond isolated cases of such resolve, there is virtually no evidence that a significant revival is even remotely imminent.	2002-10-05

The election debacle in the Fall of 1994 was the final blow that forced an acknowledgement that their leadership and manner of operation were hopelessly ineffectual. The new &quot;New Voice&quot; leadership of the AFL-CIO, elected in 1995, hit the ground running with ambitious aims for a labor turnaround. In a decided change from past practice, John Sweeney, the new president of the AFL-CIO, called for open debate and a critique of the labor movement from both within and without the labor movement. This volume contains the input of 27 individuals who participated in a labor symposium in anticipation of the transition. If not officials in labor unions, almost all of the contributors work within the labor movement in some capacity.<br />These contributors all see the traditional union approach of firm-centered collective bargaining conducted by union officials and staffers as a guaranteed prescription for further union decline. But what do they think the labor movement should be doing or become? Their emphasis is on organizing both for workplaces and within communities, on the inclusion and expansion of opportunities for ethnic and gender minorities both in terms of membership and leadership positions in unions, on the impact of globalization and its main strategic initiative neoliberalism on working people throughout the world, on the need for renewed and independent political action, and on counterpoising worker democracy and solidarity against what amounts to the class warfare of capitalism.<br />There is a great deal of idealism and optimism but unfortunately not a lot of realism and pragmatism that permeates this collection. Of course, that is somewhat understandable in that the New Voice leadership has given the labor movement renewed hope of a turnaround.<br /><br />Perhaps the vaguest notion put forward in these essays is the notion that unions, or the labor movement, need to become some sort of society-wide institution concerned with issues of the working class in general regardless of union membership. This concept is termed social movement or community unionism. One tactic proposed is for the labor movement, itself a rather vague concept, to form coalitions with social and political groups. Except in a few inner-city areas there is hardly any overlap between specific workforces and geographic communities. Despite the fact that some union-community coalitions have been successful, there is no discussion of the feasibility or the mechanics of unions becoming broad social institutions in most communities.<br /><br />There is general recognition from most of the authors that political power is essential to advance the position of working people. Disassociation from the Democratic Party and independent political action is urged. But what is lacking is any real assessment of the political orientation of the working class. One author comments on the lack of coherent political thinking among working people. It seems that the notions of social movement unionism and political power are intertwined in some manner but at this point this seems to be more of a partially formulated ideal than a possibility.<br /><br />Advocacy of greater inclusion of immigrants and ethnic and gender minorities can hardly be disagreed with. But the huge increase in semi-professional and technical workers, who are largely unrepresented, is ignored by these authors. What little overlap there is between workplaces and communities most probably exists among immigrants and ethnic groups. Perhaps the labor movement, as a practical matter, sees the potential for recruitment of members as far greater in these urban areas.<br />Given the background of the contributors, it is understandable that there is no commentary on the entire structure of workplace representation. Much union representation is based on fairly sizeable groups of workers with common functions, a situation that does not pertain in hundreds of thousands of workplaces. The European system of legislated workplace-based works councils that are in turn of a part of supra-works councils makes a lot of sense. The consultation and codetermination aspects of works councils go a long way toward the workplace democracy that some of the authors advocate. Throw in tri-partite discussions at the highest levels of the works councils and the potential exists for a representation system that exceeds the sparse, rather ad hoc, and limited system of union representation in the U.S.<br />There is no doubt that these authors are well aware that the labor movement is at best only minimally serving the working class in the U.S. They point out many of the problems and make considerable effort to describe where the labor movement needs to be. But the optimism engendered by the New Voice leadership seems to have clouded and limited the perspectives on what is attainable. Perhaps those authors would have a different assessment from today's vantage point.

US	52280224	RPIIN1AYAFIYH	0765608510	660043784	The Future of Private Sector Unionism in the United States (Issues in Work and Human Resources)	Books	3	4	4	N	Y	Unflinching analyses, yet limited explanations	Predicting the demise of labor unions, as this volume most assuredly does, has proven injurious to reputations of experts in the past. The editors and contributors to this volume hope to avoid the fate suffered by the economist George Barnett who made such a prediction in 1932, just months before the dramatic resurgence of labor unions. It should be noted that sixteen of the twenty-three contributors to this volume are academicians in the fields of economics and management, who unsurprisingly view labor unions in strictly economic terms.<br />With considerable overlap, the selections in this book attempt to gain a perspective on the future of private sector unionism by examining the myriad reasons for the drop in private sector union density from 36 percent to 9 percent in the last half century.  Among the reasons cited are structural shifts in the economy involving industries, occupations, and worker demographics, the globalization and decentralization of corporations, the substitution effects of human resource management and of legislation that both protects and provides a basic floor for workers, the rise of the social ethos of individualism and consumerism, and a negative public perception of union leaders and the internal workings of unions. That there is a statistical connection between these developments and the slide of labor unions can be little doubted.<br />However, a main theme that runs through most of the chapters is that employees and employers are subject to and must and do act within a framework of neutral, natural economic forces. Any notion that powerful class dynamics have tilted the playing field on which workers and unions must operate is scarcely acknowledged. There is no recognition of the ability of powerful economic entities, that is, corporations, to exert disproportionate control of the political process from elections to the formulation of workplace legislation or trade policies. The blocking of legislation to greatly increase penalties for managerial discrimination against pro-union workers or permitting the importation of goods from foreign subsidiaries that hardly adhere to minimal international standards for labor or the environment are not examples of an &quot;invisible&quot; hand at work.<br />The rejection of one author's contention that up to 40 percent of union decline can be explained by managerial opposition, as failing to understand economic necessity, hardly seems compelling in the light of the class dynamics that shape the workplace landscape. In addition, the role of vast multi-media empires to shape public opinion is totally ignored. Unions are invariably cast in an unfavorable light by major media outlets when workplace issues are even considered. Can it be disputed that basic economic understandings of most working people are highly colored by the continual bombardment of the advantages of &quot;free&quot; markets and individual investing in an ever-rising stock market by a business-centered media? Astonishingly enough, one author, in keeping with the theme of the economic free-agency, contends that the new system of &quot;individual [self] representation&quot; is superior to acting in concert with fellow employees. Beyond the fact that &quot;individual representation&quot; is simply incoherent, the author did not find it necessary to admit that this view directly contradicts the preamble to the National Labor Relations Act.<br />The contention in one essay that the loss of employment in the union sector coupled with gains in the non-union sector largely explains union decline is far too simplistic. Losses in the union sector did not just somehow happen. In fact, the union sector has relentlessly relocated employment to the non-union South and West and globally taking advantage of weak labor laws coupled with little enforcement and of the rhetoric and policies of &quot;free&quot; trade.<br />Whether one agrees that the various economic phenomena described by the authors &quot;explain&quot; the slide of labor unions, the shrinkage of union density and membership is beyond dispute. Furthermore, it would be difficult to find fault with the view of most of the authors that expects private sector union density to be no more than five to six percent by the 2010's. Do the authors need to be concerned with being placed with George Barnett?<br />Despite the contention of one author that the 2000's are similar to the 1930's, there is at least one huge difference. In the half-century before the Great Depression, workers continually battled the excesses of capitalism. In the 1930's, workers drew upon the legacy of the Knights of Labor, the Populists, the IWW, the Socialists, and others to gain a foothold within America's corporations. But in the 2000's, in an era of huge economic inequalities, of gratuitous downsizing and re-engineering, and of shipping jobs overseas, among other assaults, workers do not have a similar legacy or a coherent understanding of the forces at work against them. That is seen in the support of political candidates little inclined to counter the forces arrayed against working people. There is little in popular thinking to suggest even the remotest chance of a resurgence in the standing of labor unions.xplain&quot; the slide of labor unions, the shrinkage of union density and membership is beyond dispute.

The backdrop for &quot;State of the Union&quot; is the &quot;labor question&quot; that the author finds Progressive Era reformers confronting. They regarded the disproportionate power that corporate capitalism wielded relative to citizens and workers as unjustifiable in a democratic society. Changes in workplaces were most troublesome. Skilled workers were bypassed by work-simplifying machinery, an autocratic foreman system enforced Taylorism, or speed-up, and wages hovered at subsistence levels. But American workers, drawing upon a republican legacy, seized upon the WWI rallying cry of making the world safe for democracy to insist that industrial democracy be established within workplaces. Even President Woodrow Wilson recognized &quot;the right of those who work, in whatever rank, to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affects their welfare.&quot; Interestingly, the author does not take note of the fact that Wilson's call for workers' participation did not mention unions. But it is the relationship of unions to this &quot;labor question&quot; and to the notion of industrial democracy that most concerns Lichtenstein.<br />The lack of a legal and institutional basis for industrial democracy virtually ensured that industrial democracy would fizzle in the post-WWI era. But the major slip-up of American capitalism in the 20th century, that is, the Great Depression, opened the door for a tremendous, pent-up surge of American worker activism. In the Wagner Act, the most significant piece of New Deal legislation, workers were given the right and even encouraged to self-organize or select a representative to bargain with employers. In unionized workplaces, vibrant shop-floor steward systems ensured that workers' concerns received an expeditious hearing. Many labor activists from the Progressive Era were in the forefront of this politicized offensive to push for legalized industrial democracy. In addition, some of the Progressive social-democratic platform such as unemployment insurance, social security, and fair labor standards were part of the New Deal package.<br />The backlash against this resurgence of worker empowerment began immediately. Conservative justices, hostile corporate managements, racist Southern oligarchs, and anti-statist AFL unions - all opposed state intervention in the private domain of workplaces. But with the onset of WWII, the labor movement was drawn even more tightly into the state web as a participant in peak-level bargaining with the War Labor Board and industry leaders for the purpose of stabilizing industrial relations. For example, to curtail the spontaneous and disruptive strikes that were a part of the self-help tradition on the shop floor,  multi-level grievance arbitration systems became standard sections in most bargaining agreements. But that tripartite bargaining did not extend beyond WWII. Some of the agreed to provisions proved to be more debilitating than helpful to trade unions and workers in later years.<br />With the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, conservatives were finally able to accomplish the dilution of the Wagner Act. Unions suffered major setbacks in that legislation. Communists and radicals were purged from union rolls, &quot;right to work&quot; laws were enacted in some states; employers could now denounce unions in organizing drives; and secondary boycotts were mostly prohibited. The author refers to the exclusion of supervisors and the subsequent exclusion of tens of millions of professional and technical workers in today's workforce as the &quot;ghettoization&quot; of the union movement.<br />As the author indicates, Taft-Hartley guaranteed that collective bargaining would be both limited and firm-based. A variety of barriers and penalties now existed to derail broader, classwide mobilizations. Negotiated contracts did not venture outside &quot;mandatory&quot; subjects of wages, hours, and working conditions. The prerogative of management to make virtually all corporate decisions regardless of any impact on workforces was a privileged topic. Industrial democracy received scant consideration as the courts generally held that a grievance clause in a contract overrode the statutory right of workers to strike.<br />The author takes particular care to debunk the widely held notion that the post-Taft-Hartley industrial relations era through the 1970s was a time of labor-management accord. A companion idea was that collective bargaining represented &quot;industrial pluralism&quot; in action. But classes with opposed interests and distinct ideologies could no longer exist; society now was defined to consist of competing interest groups who engaged in &quot;non-ideological conflict.&quot; It was a theory that eschewed the idea that &quot;alert citizen-workers&quot; were the basic political actors of society. Industrial pluralism required that &quot;competing elites bargain, compromise, and govern.&quot; Labor unions were only fulfilling their legitimate role when led by unassailable officers of long tenure. In addition, capitalism was now a benign force; it had been transformed into a rational planner for industrial society.<br />Global economic forces beginning in the 1970s undermined this supposed labor-management accord. Increased global competition, OPEC, inflation, and reduced corporate profits triggered new assaults by  businessmen, conservatives, and various pundits on unions, casting them as &quot;self-aggrandizing interest groups.&quot; Meanwhile a new rights consciousness, fueled by the civil rights movement, coupled with a loss of credibility and trust for unions persuaded workers to look to state regulatory legislation for workplace protections. But it was a pursuit for protection of individual rights based on gender, race, age, etc and not collective rights to industrial democracy. It was a focus that left unchanged the basic power structures in workplaces. Worker solidarity and workplace democracy no longer resonated with workers.<br />The author clearly regards the collective bargaining regime of American industrial relations, as it has evolved, to be a &quot;product of defeat, not victory.&quot; Obviously material gains were made by many through collective bargaining, but the trade union movement has mostly failed in facilitating the democratic voice for all of the American working class.<br />What does the author suggest? It is a simple list: militancy, internal union democracy, and politics. There really is no assessment of the feasibility of the labor movement solving the labor question and establishing industrial democracy. Unlike the 1930s, there is no pent-up demand for workplace democracy. Consumerism seems to be the operant ideology of the American working class. This is an important book that leaves little doubt as to the state of unions.

It is the ability of transnational corporations (TNCs) to avoid labor unions by diversifying globally, especially in terms of production, and the changing ethnic composition of work forces in such locations as Miami and Los Angeles to which labor unions must adjust for their very survival according to these authors.<br />With the passage of NAFTA the pace of jobs being shifted to Mexico has accelerated. Transnationals, mostly in the automotive, textile/clothing, and electronic/electrical industries, have now established nearly 4000 factories in the maquiladora zone in Mexico with wages at about one tenth those in the U.S. Increasingly, labor unions in the U.S. have realized that global focus and actions are essential in dealing with global firms. The essays suggest and detail all sorts of cross-border alliances and contacts at both federation and union levels, as well as worker-to-worker interfacing, designed to pressure and support organizing efforts. Many readers would be familiar with the unfavorable publicity campaigns that some U.S. retailers have been subjected to as a result of cross-border collaboration. Another strategy described is the cross-border pressure that local unions of one transnational employer can apply in assisting one another.<br />It is fairly clear from the essays that organizing successes as a result of cross-border initiatives are few and fleeting. Though the problem is not totally ignored by the authors, widespread solidarity among workers with different languages and cultures and separated geographically is more of a pipedream than a real possibility. None of the essays even attempts to quantify overall levels of cross-border labor alliances and their impact. The authors do note that appeals to the labor laws of Mexico and the bureaucratic nightmare that describes the labor side agreements of NAFTA are of limited utility. It seems pretty evident that the taming of the forces of globalization will require far more than cross-border alliances between labor, or labor-like, organizations.<br />Two essays demonstrate that the family and community orientations of urban-based immigrants, if properly drawn upon, can be powerful forces in organizing unions, especially in lower-end service work. The essays show that flexible and progressive leadership that is sustained is key to immigrant organizing. But such an adjustment for craft-based unions, or any union that focuses mostly on contract administration, seems to be quite difficult despite any obvious decrease in members or loss of market power. The history of exclusion and privilege for a select group of workers is hard to overcome.<br />A recurrent theme in the essays is the necessity for the labor movement to become &quot;social movement unionism (SMU).&quot; It is a most nebulous concept, but one notion of SMU seems to require labor unions to become a part of community activities and concerns. One author claims that neo-liberal restructuring (NLR), which maquiladora zones are a part of, leads to SMU in contrast to business unionism. SMU advocates seem to be unwilling to squarely confront the fact of the scattering of specific workforces across vast metropolitan areas, a fact hardly conducive to SMU.<br />Along the same line of thought, but perhaps more interesting, is the notion that unionism should draw upon the themes of citizenship, which in a democracy implies participation. The author does not seem to know where to go with his concept, however, with a proposal that central labor federations provide coordination. Citizenship opens the door for much more. For example, those on the left in the labor movement eschew worker participation in managing corporations. But, it could be contended that any concept of participation in a democracy that does not provide for worker input into decisions that affect his economic destiny is pretty weak stuff. Surprisingly, the author does not touch upon the German legal mandate for works council and supervisory board participation.<br />This is not a big idea book. Cross-border initiatives are on the fringe as far as union participation or any significant yields for the labor movement. Organizing immigrants when and where possible is a no-brainer.

How is it that conservatives, disapproving of big government, can support rolling up large deficits or extending \\"welfare\\" to corporations. Where is the logic? According to the author, the explanation lies in morality. What best explains the politics of conservatives and liberals is their fundamentally different moral worldviews. Those views are grounded in models of family morality.<br />The \\"Strict Father\\" model of family morality that conservatives subscribe to is based on the hierarchical authority of the father who sets and enforces rules of behavior. Children are expected to learn self-discipline, self-reliance, and respect for legitimate authority. Obedience is emphasized; questioning of authority is little tolerated. Governmental social programs are seen by conservatives as rewarding a lack of self-discipline, of failing to becoming self-reliant. However, spending for the preservation of the moral order, for protection of the \\"nation as family,\\" whether it is for defense or for building more prisons, is morally required.<br />Liberals, on the other hand, subscribe to a \\"Nurturant Parent\\" model. Children become responsible, self-disciplined, and self-reliant through being cared for, respected, and, in turn, caring for others. Open communications is emphasized; even the questioning of authority by children is seen as positive. Desired behavior is not obtained through punishment. Empathy and a regard for fair treatment are priorities in this model. Social programs are seen by liberals as helping both individuals and the greater society. The maintenance of fairness is a priority for government.<br />Particularly instructive is the role that competition plays in these models. For conservatives, competition is essential to determine who is moral, that is, who is sufficiently self-disciplined to be successful. Understandably the prototypical conservatives are businessmen who have succeeded in the competitive marketplace. They are at the head of a hierarchical moral order, of a \\"meritocracy of the self-disciplined.\\" Interestingly, governmental largesse for economic elites is viewed as deserved, unlike assistance for the poor.<br />But liberals view fierce competition as bringing out aggressive behavior that is hardly consistent with a desirable nurturant personality. Liberals would also contend that there are class and social forces that are essentially inescapable by those on the lowest rungs of society. The ubiquity of the conservative \\"Ladder of Opportunity\\" is largely a convenient myth.<br />The author explains the liberal and conservative position on any number of contemporary issues, from taxation and gun control to the environment and abortion. Invariably, conservatives take a Strict Father moral position and liberals use the morality of the Nurturant Parent.<br />The book lacks any real historical or geographical perspective on these two models. Although the Strict Father model may seem close to traditional morality, the author does not identify at what point in our history these models clearly emerged, or why. Or have there been changes in these moral models over time, either in basic tenets or in who subscribes to them? Furthermore, what are their connections with such 19th century political philosophies as republicanism or producerism, or for that matter, democracy? Are these models unique to the United States? Why is social democracy so prevalent in Western Europe? Is there little Strict Father morality there? In slightly hedging his message, the author does note that individuals can use different moral systems in different spheres of life, in addition to acting pragmatically within a moral model.<br />The author complains that the \\"issue\\" orientation of news organizations, as well as claims to \\"objectivity,\\" can be misleading because of unconscious moral system slant. But beyond that point, the author has nothing to say about the influence of the vast oligopolistic media empire. He does note the rise of conservative think tanks and their ability to influence public debate. Have these developments impacted adherence to the Strict Father moral model?<br />It should be said that the author is not neutral concerning the soundness of these two moral models. He cites considerable evidence that Strict Father childrearing has unintended consequences. Moral strength is often not the outcome and violent behavior seems to be reproduced. In addition, Strict Father morality countenances little in the way of subtle interpretations of morality, which the author points out is not particularly consistent with the way we actually think.<br />The book is rather lengthy with considerable redundancy in describing these two moral models. The author should have provided historical and philosophical context. His models do seem to comport with political behavior despite the fact that much of that influence may act unconsciously. I think the book would be interesting for those trying to understand political behavior.that point, the author has nothing to say about the influence of the vast oligopolistic media empire.

As a result, the book serves as a useful complement to the literature available from the National Park Service on the Natchez Trace. However, the most important document that a Trace traveler needs is a Natchez Trace Parkway Map and Guide from the Park Service.<br />The author briefly describes the historical significance of many of the landmarks along the Trace. Of great interest to bicylists is the lay of the land (hills) which is well described. Most importantly, one can find the location of food and water and lodging just off of the Trace, that is, not managed by the Park service. The Trace itself has insufficient restroom and water stops for the bicyclist. A minor point is that the author does not indicate the hours of operation of the markets that he notes. The author notes the great amount of wildlife on the Trace; but keep a sharp eye for the snakes sunning themselves on the Trace in warm weather.<br />Most all of the practical advice in the book is related either to logistics or to various routes. Where and how to ship one's bike is useful. About 40 percent of the book is taken up with auxiliary routes that either start or cross the Trace and are not a part of traveling the Trace from end to end. Multi-day tours through Vicksburg and around the Tennessee River are two of those. Most of these may appeal to local residents.<br />Throughout the book the author mentions various rules and regulations of the Trace. Although there is a brief section, it would have been useful to see a section with a complete listing: for example, rules for speed limits, parking, picnicing, camping, hiking, etc.<br />What one will not find in this book is much in the way of practical and general information about bicycling or touring on a bike - what gearing to use, how to pack gear on a bike, how to ride with a fully loaded bike, what is the best way to deal with bicycle problems while on the Trace, etc. One point of interest is that the author provides an 1-800 number that can be called in the case of problems; interestingly the park service does a poor job of signage concerning this number.<br />The bottom line is that the book would help anyone comtemplating a tour of the Trace to get a better feel for what he or she can expect on the Trace.he Trace, etc. One point of interest is that the author provides an 1-800 number that can be called in the case of problems; interestingly the park service does a poor job of signage concerning this number.<br />The bottom line is that the book would help anyone comtemplating a tour of the Trace to get a better feel for what he or she can expect on the Trace.	2002-06-06
US	52280224	R2T5SGSBVFNN51	1583670033	276775170	Taking Care of Business: Samuel Gompers, George Meany, Lane Kirkland, and the Tragedy of American Labor	Books	3	10	11	N	Y	Skewering personalities slights serious issues	&quot;Taking Care of Business&quot; is a scathing attack on the shortsighted, bureaucratic, business union approach of the leadership of the AFL and AFL-CIO over the last one hundred years. None of the presidents of these labor federations from Gompers through Meany and Kirkland escape the author's thoroughgoing criticism.<br />Of course, those leaders can only reflect the nature of the overall trade union movement. Trade unions in the US have historically been both exclusionary and, since WWII, controlling in their relationship to the working class. Most trade unions, until only very recently, have focused on protecting the relatively privileged position of white, skilled craftsmen within the economy while either outright excluding or only rhetorically supporting the largest portion of the working class due to differences in race, ethnicity, gender, or skill level. The rise of industrial unions in the WWII era, despite being a small step in the direction of inclusion, ushered in a labor relations regime where labor unions' role became one of enforcing constraining collective bargaining agreements as much as the representation of workers.<br />By the early 1950s union officials, as typified by Meany and Kirkland, came to see themselves as the counterpart to business leaders in a labor-management accord. They adopted the same lifestyles and moved in the same social circles. Labor officials, in their newfound role, had no problem with making the world safe for business interests. So-called radical unions and unionists with their demands for worker activism at the point of production were purged from the AFL and unions. The AFL and AFL-CIO under the regimes of Meany and Kirkland collaborated with the US intelligence community through a series of front committees and councils to defeat popular movements in favor of pro-US, right-wing thugs in foreign lands, especially Latin America. Even though the PATCO fiasco of 1981 clearly showed the shredding of the post-WWII domestic social compact, the focus of the AFL-CIO remained on expending tremendous amounts of federation resources on dubious foreign operations.<br />Clearly, Meany and Kirkland did little to advance the interests of US workers, but the author does not really address the weakly federated structure of organized labor in the US. Given the independence of the AFL's constituent unions and the history of organized labor through WWII, were Meany and Kirkland types not almost predictable? Perhaps they do deserve the author's scorn as symbols of the ineffectualness of organized labor, but the problems run much deeper.<br />The author more than hints that the Gompers-Meany-Kirkland threesome squashed the desires of the US working class to establish some sort of workers democratic regime - his admiration for the syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) being a tip-off. But that view may be mostly wishful. He cites the Knights of Labor as indicative of working class interest in social unionism, but it is clear that only a small portion of the membership of that organization supported the KOL position of transforming the US into a cooperative society. In fact the KOL impaled itself on traditional, yet failed, strike actions. The author does not attempt to quantify, or place in a broader perspective, the impact of the 1890-1920 movements of populism, the IWW, and socialism on the wider society. Though Gompers, a socialist in his early working days, was clearly unsympathetic towards these movements, the attribution that he was a major factor in their demise seems very questionable. His power to influence events pales in comparison to power of various organs of the state, especially the judiciary, and corporations to adversely affect the working class.<br />Though the author continually raises the issue of worker democracy as a rebuke to the policies of labor leadership, there is scant reflection on what worker democracy may entail. It would have been unthinkable that the author's much admired IWW would have tolerated third-party bureaucratic organizations like unions negotiating contracts for workers. The IWW wanted direct worker control at the point of production for all workers. But then the practical questions of social and economic coordination arise quickly with such radical decentralization. Nonetheless, the author does not attempt to resolve in any practical way the conflict between actual democracy and the current form of organized labor in the US. Nor is there any real assessment of the desire of the American working class to participate in some form of IWW-like democracy.<br />The author does not limit himself to the personalities that have led the AFL-CIO. He is determined to identify countless former communists and socialists of labor organizations who renounced their radical pasts and joined neo-conservative political bodies or collaborated with the intelligence community. The fact that the author is a socialist undoubtedly is germane to his mission of identifying those who have abandoned the cause.<br />A book that is so intent on skewering personalities usually suffers as a result and this one is no exception. The author hints at but does not pursue some worthy topics. What is worker democracy? Are trade unions compatible with such democracy? Aren't centralization and bureaucracy necessary in any complex society? Now those are topics worthy for a book on the labor movement and the working class.uthor's much admired IWW would have tolerated third-party bureaucratic organizations like unions negotiating contracts for workers.

US	52280224	R299G8V87H19GV	0743225511	32489776	First Among Equals: How to Manage a Group of Professionals	Books	4	28	37	N	N	Just where in the real world are these groups?	&quot;First Among Equals&quot; is concerned with the dynamics of relatively small groups of professionals and the role that group leaders have in ensuring group success. The authors make it clear that a group leader that can inspire and orchestrate a group is essential for a group to exceed the results of a collection of individuals pursuing private agendas. But the book is narrow and somewhat disingenuous in its considerations. It scarcely looks beyond the group level for the impacts and constraints that the larger organization has on small groups.<br />The authors do not minimize the difficulties in achieving group cohesion, acknowledging that professionals are adverse to being managed. Eschewing formal managerial authority, the authors emphasize the buy-in necessary by group members to legitimize a group and the authority of the group leader.<br />Most of the book is devoted to the various practical steps of building and sustaining effective groups. It is essential that group members appreciate the validity and the advantages of the group. Ground rules must be established, by consensus, that define the shared obligations and values and operating procedures of the group. The leader must have a clear mandate from both group members as well as higher management to lead the group, to &quot;stimulate creativity, develop common purpose and forge teamwork, solve problems and break down barriers, act as a sounding board, enforce standards, and be a conscience&quot; for the group.<br />Trust is a huge component of effective groups. The group leader must establish close ties with group members. &quot;Trust is often destroyed by thoughtless behaviors&quot; that violate the core values and standards of behavior of the group. Adding to the complexity of the group leader's role is dealing with group members, all of whom exhibit varying degrees of low or high assertiveness and responsiveness which results in personality orientations of &quot;analytical, driven, amiable, and expressive.&quot;<br />Consistent with the authors' business interests, the book has the look of a seminar presentation with multiple bullet pages/slides being standard.  A chapter with 23 bullets on good listening habits following a chapter on establishing rapport with group members is tedious and unnecessary.<br />Despite the authors' claims that the book pertains to any professional grouping, the talk about billable and non-billable hours and client relations skews the book towards independent professionals such as lawyers, CPAs, financial service providers, and the like. In fact, the formation of a group is largely treated as an option to be accepted or rejected by such professionals, which probably conforms with their reality.<br />However, most so-called professionals, or intellectual workers of all types, cannot usually decide to work independently and are subject to departmental management not of their choosing. It is these lower-tiered professionals that are even more dependent on group dynamics. The authors downplay formal management, yet most professionals must look to formal managers to find the existence of the sort of group leadership that the authors describe.<br />The matters of trust and consistency and continuity would have to be concerns of small group members in larger organizations. Will the shared values of a group be acknowledged and honored by the organization at all levels. The authors make clear that group chemistry is all important. Arbitrary tinkering with groups or undermining their shared understandings could easily destroy a group. One could even argue that the democratic way of doing things in groups is at odds with most corporate structures.<br />The description of basic group dynamics is useful, if not fairly predictable. But of at least equal interest would have been a realistic assessment by the authors of such groups being allowed to exist and to establish a shared culture within a typical American corporation. Of course, the expectation would be to go beyond any corporate rhetoric that espouses an interest in independent groups and then dispenses with them at will. And the book does have some such espousals with no independent means of verification.expectation would be to go beyond any corporate rhetoric that espouses an interest in independent groups and then dispenses with them at will.

US	52280224	REBA9VXJ39UME	0805048987	309725095	Media Unlimited: How the Torrent of Images and Sounds Overwhelms Our Lives	Books	3	26	32	N	Y	Less than persuasive media depiction	If, and the author suggests a strong likelihood, the role of the media falls below our radar, &quot;Media Unlimited&quot; challenges the reader to face and accept the centrality of media in our lives. The author's concept of the media is quite broad. Any means or mechanisms that present written words, sounds, images, or video, and possibly permitting responses of some type, for the purpose of having some sort of a communications effect constitute the media. While the immense expansion of the media in our culture is certainly to be noted, it is the visceral reaction of consumers of the media to the &quot;torrent of images, sounds, and stories&quot; unrelentingly cascading upon them that, according to the author, guarantees the media will be a central part of our lives. It is the blas&eacute; individual, the typical person produced by &quot;calculating&quot; modernity, who &quot;paradoxically&quot; develops an acute need for &quot;stimulus and sensation&quot; which the media meets with its &quot;montage&quot; of speeded-up and streamlined content.<br />Despite the contention that the onrush of media content meets basic psychological needs, the author also acknowledges that this &quot;nonstop&quot; flow requires a variety of coping stratagems, or &quot;navigational styles.&quot; The Fan, the Content Critic, the Paranoid, the Exhibitionist, the Ironist, the Jammer, the Seccessionist, and the Abolitionist are approaches identified by author that are used to deal with the onslaught of the media. But only the Fan is fully accepting of the &quot;immediacy&quot; of the media. No breakdown of the distribution of these various types across the general population is provided. Oddly enough, it appears that most media users must adopt defensive measures to deal with a media that satisfies fundamental needs.<br />The author is concerned that the main truth about the media, as a whole, has been &quot;disguised.&quot; But characterizing the media with a broad brush does not seem to take into account substantial differences. Distinctions can certainly be made between various media or media content that are geared to providing primarily either entertainment, advertising, interpersonal communication, or information and even education. Surely those engaged in telephone conversations, watching PBS programs, or shopping on the Internet would have different expectations about experiencing a &quot;jolt of feeling,&quot; not to mention the differing capacity of the various media to even provide a jolt.<br /><br />The aggressive consolidation of the media industry into only a few media empires has been a concern of many media analysts ( for one, see &quot;Rich Media, Poor Democracy,&quot; by Robert McChesney ) for some time now. They see an ability and desire on the part of these huge enterprises to control content in a manner that is not favorable to the interests of public. But this author downplays the one-sided nature of the production of media content: &quot;our desires are [not] the unwelcome products of vast corporations.&quot; Of course, the author suggests that the manipulation of emotions is a legitimate and needed function of the media. His rightful claim that media oligopolies do adapt somewhat to consumer demand is not a serious encroachment on the contention that the media oligopolies make every effort to control content.<br />Those familiar with the work of Stuart Ewen, &quot;Captains of Consciousness,&quot; would be well aware of the tremendous push undertaken by retailing giants in the 1920s to create a consumer society. Both the desire to attain a middle-class materialistic standard and the fear of not measuring up to one's neighbors were to be subtly inculcated via media advertising. Advertisers' demands then and now are for the media to deliver targeted consumers. For their part, the media adopt policies of &quot;safe&quot; programming, whereby media content is rid of controversy or  significant questioning of the status quo. The programming found on commercial television, the most influential and watched medium at the end of the 20th century, can be described as simplistic, juvenile, smart-alecky, happy-talk, contentious, episodic, fragmented, self-righteous, and personalized. The emphasis on quickly shifting images and shortened dialogue goes hand-in-hand with the trivialization of programming content and easily fits within a description of torrential media.<br />The author admits that the nature of the media &quot;reduces democracy to a sideshow,&quot; where political proceedings appear as no more than a rush of images and of sound-bites. In addition, studies have shown that television viewing is highly correlated with reduced political participation of all forms. But demobilization is hardly the largest impact that the media have on the political process. A democratic society depends on free and full information flows. But the media, and in particular television, present a highly sanitized picture of American life; the kind of programming described earlier makes no room for controversial topics such as the various effects that capitalism has on the greater society, the penetration of the political process by corporations, workplace issues and representation, the healthcare system - in other words, issues that impact real people every day in their lives. Beyond the skew due to omission are deliberate, though subtle, distortion effects such as employing mostly conservative political commentators or mischaracterizing the arguments of advocacy groups such as labor unions or environmentalists.<br />The author at one point is hopeful that there will be &quot;fights over who gets to harness media power, over censorship, over improving content and broadening access.&quot; But his argument is not that; he maintains throughout the book that the media has evolved to meet real social needs for sensation and stimulus, not information. The kind of information that democratic citizens need to make wise choices will not be obtained where media oligopolies knowingly trivialize and distort the content of their products. The history and nature of the media can support the argument that the media are presently constructed to meet the needs of capitalism to sell products and maintain the status quo and only incidentally to meet any deep-seated psychological needs.<br />It seems that the author has taken some characteristics of the media and drawn some rather irrelevant, if not dubious, conclusions while de-emphasizing the true impact and nature of the media, so says a card-carrying Abolitionist.ming found on commercial television, the most influential and watched medium at the end of the 20th century, can be described as simplistic, juvenile, smart-alecky, happy-talk, contentious, episodic, fragmented, self-righteous, and personalized.

The upper class, whether the pre-Revolutionary landed aristocracy or the more recent industrial or post-industrial capitalistic class, through its power, privilege, and wealth, has largely dominated and controlled the working class irrespective of wage or slave labor. The democratic promise of the nation's founding has taken a beating in this arrangement.<br />The authors attempt the impossible: the description of working class life in general over the last five hundred years with snapshots of countless names and events to provide the sustenance. The tone for the laboring class was set early on in our nation's history. The brutal and deadly nature of both indentured and permanent servitude is vividly brought home by the authors' careful description of their conditions and often futile resistance. Yet the fissures within the working class itself are evident throughout the book. Immigration and slavery and resulting ethnic conflicts and racism are shown through any number of positions taken and violent incidents to have been devastating to working class solidarity. In addition to ethnicity and race, the authors do not shrink from gender and sexual orientation issues. And the trampling of Native Americans fortifies the authors' arguments for the abuse of power.<br />To counter power and to assert their own voice, workers have formed countless organizations such as political parties (Socialist, Greenback), advocacy and reform groups (Ten Hour Leagues, producer and consumer cooperatives), community groups (Black Panthers, fraternal orders), as well as labor unions. The authors provide enough detail for the reader to see a U.S. labor movement at odds with itself in terms of basic philosophies. It has adopted any number of approaches: the political of the Knights of Labor, the syndicalist of the IWW, the bargaining of the AFL, the CIO's social unionism, and the post-WWII social-accord, not to mention narrow, craft-based unions versus industrial. Of course the issues of native-born versus ethnic or racial differences have been played out in the labor movement.<br />The authors accurately point out that there have been few periods where the democratic promise for the American working class has made sustained headway. Interestingly enough they comment little on WWI as being a period where workers called for making the world safe for democracy. The U.S. government was forced to back the right of workers to elect representation committees within workplaces. The two periods in our history where workers and their unions gained the most power, that is WWI and WWII, were followed by periods of either suppression or containment. And in both cases red-baiting was a primary instrument of their foes with some conservative unions leading the charge against their more radical brethren. Clearly these were huge turning points not overly emphasized by the authors.<br />While the book is consistent in showing that working class life has been a constant struggle, there is a lack of an attempt to understand the basis of continued setbacks. The issue of American \\"exceptionalism,\\" the failure to achieve a stronger, permanent political position, is relevant in any history of the American working class. The Western European working class managed to tame the worst excesses of capitalism. The role of the mass media and the educational system might well be factors to consider. In addition, the attempt to be inclusive of most relevant players and events in the working class story results in what seems like a mountain of details, which can cloud the bigger story.

The rhetoric of &quot;win-win&quot; and of &quot;choice&quot; in school-business partnerships and in privatized schools is empty, misleading sloganeering.<br />Every school-business partnership described in the book shows that the primary interest is in promoting products and corporate images whether in the form of product giveaways, the plastering of corporate logos on school property, or the penetration of the school day by private television networks advertising products appealing to students. In some cases, there is clear intent in creating interest on the part of students in entry-level clerical or service jobs such as those found in grocery stores or in the fast-food business. One grocery chain hires teachers for summer work expressly to persuade them to help in recruitment efforts among student populations.<br />The motive for privatization, or corporate-managed or -owned schools, is purely one of profit. Privatization is promoted as enhancing &quot;choice.&quot; But providing choices for, say, special students or those interested in extra-curricular activities is costly. Privatized schools invariably reduce curriculum choices and require teachers to closely follow course blueprints with the primary goal being one of inculcating facts useful for scoring high on standardized tests. High test-scores bolster the product, that is, the school, that the corporation is selling. Broader and more nebulous educational goals are shoved aside because they are viewed as a drain on the bottom line. An additional consequence of private school choice is the inevitable segmentation of student bodies along racial and class lines as the ability to pay excludes some from having actual &quot;choice.&quot;<br />In addition to specific corporate involvement in schools, the author is concerned with the predominance of business thinking in the broader culture and its impact on our school systems. It has become a standard view among political and business elites that the essential purpose of schools is to train future employees. According to them, the primary focus of schools should be on teaching &quot;skills&quot; to students that are directly useful in work places. In this line of thinking schools are not the locus for wide-ranging intellectual endeavor. Teachers as intellectuals are not needed. Instead, they are seen as essentially education clerks, as employees, that follow management's direction in producing a product. Students are said to get an education, a product, closing the circle on the commodification of education. In another vein of corporate determination, the textbook industry sanitizes book content to ensure greater book sales which is contrary to the spirit of open inquiry.<br />In the face such reductionistic and regimented thinking, the author pushes throughout the book for the spread of &quot;critical transitivity&quot; in our schools whereby a critical and flexible approach by both teachers and students is taken in acquiring broad knowledge. He is concerned with what finds as the oligopolistic nature of the United States. He sees schools as being centers for the education of democratic practice and where critiques of our culture, capitalism, and social injustice are mounted.<br />While the author seems to be on solid ground to decry the move to quantify schools by simplified, standardized testing and the de-professionalization of teaching, it is worrisome to see what amounts to a social agenda being proposed as a replacement. Children and teenagers are not equipped to engage in social critique; they simply do not have enough worldly experience to have informed, independent opinions. One would hope that the author is not suggesting that the influencing of young minds with the social agenda of teachers has more merit than business-imposed thinking. It is for adult citizensto make democracy a reality in the political process, in workplaces, and in the broader culture including schools. Meanwhile, there is much for students to learn beyond workplace &quot;skills&quot; long before they become agents for social change.<br />The book seems to be grabbing for too much. It details actual corporate involvement in schools; it is concerned with the dominance of business thought; and it wants schools themselves to be the agents to change all of that. And those topics get intermixed. Also, at times the book can get a little overloaded with academic jargon as the author sprinkles in talk about techno-rationality, non-propositional versus propositional knowledge, consumer materialism, and intransitivity versus critical transitivity, etc. But for the most part the author's points are on the money. Our school systems have gotten derailed by some very dubious thinking.

But until the last third of the 20th century, most of the immigration consisted of Europeans. New immigrants were eventually absorbed or assimilated into mainstream culture. But the author points out that the nature of immigration has changed. In recent decades much of the immigration has been from the third world and in the case of Canada from Asia. The sheer volume of immigration as well as the non-whiteness and ethnicity of the newcomers has created a situation where urban areas are literally being taken over, displacing the native-born.<br />Multiculturalism has shoved aside assimilation as a basic philosophy  of immigration. But what is the impact on the social fabric of a nation that accepts wide cultural diversity. The author points out that any stable nation depends on the common culture, common language, and shared experiences of its people. The Canadians have expressd displeasure with their changing status. Undoubtedly, in coming decades the situation will be exacerbated and the potential for social unrest will increase.<br />The author contends that political and economic elites have basically been driving immigration policy since the middle 1960s. In the Cold War era, immigration was a propaganda tool to create a favorable impression of the West in the third world. But of greater significance has been the impact on the working class and their job prospects with a labor force swelled by immigration. Despite high unemployment immigration flows have been kept high. Since immigrants now largely fall into the category of a racial minority, complaints from the working class are cast as discriminatory - conveniently covering up the class warfare being waged by the elites.<br />The fact is that most third world individuals would not be clamoring to come to the West if the economic and political situations in their countries could sustain decent lives. And the first world could help. It could help by not exploiting their cheap labor, adding to their monumental debts, and not draining off their best and the brightest to work in the first world. That is the ultimate solution. But that is not the agenda of multinational corporations.<br />The book is not an academic treatise, but it is well argued with some perhaps unnecessary overlap in places. The author is surely correct to expose the class-nature of immigration and its potential to undermine a nation's social fabric.help by not exploiting their cheap labor, adding to their monumental debts, and not draining off their best and the brightest to work in the first world.

She never seems to be totally satisfied or grounded in the present, which results in her putting physical or mental distance between herself and her current reality. She seems to be well situated as a community veterinarian and as a wife to Daniel, a minister. Yet her main comfort seems to be in dealing with her animals; her reserve impacts her relationship with her daughters and her husband.<br />The main event of the book revolves around a vague premonition of Jo's which is realized in a chance meeting with Eli, one of several residents of a rooming house with whom she hooked up while escaping an unsatisfactory first marriage some thirty years earlier. An inexplicable murder of Dana, a resident and larger than life woman, triggered Jo to move on with her life at that time. But the meeting with Eli brings the covered over past rushing into the present. The remainder of the book explores both Jo's actions and thoughts as she meets Eli with vague intent and the ramifications to her family.<br />One could quibble with the plausibility of some of the actions taken by Jo, Eli, or even Daniel the supposedly level-headed minister. Yet life is not lived according to a blueprint. Mistakes are made; thinking can get confused. \\"While I Was Gone\\" is a believable window into one path that life could take.	2002-03-04

However, this situation is at odds with an era that holds democracy to be sacred. Large corporations that draw upon the ideas of an era of aristocratic privilege are contrasted with corporations organized democratically. A secondary and less successful interest of the book is to show paths that have or could be taken to bring about such a change.<br />The author outlines those characteristics of modern corporations that can be considered aristocratic. The aristocratic corporation adopts the legal pretense of being a non-public, private entity. Based on private property rights, a distant and ever-changing group of stockholders have the liberty and voting rights to choose the CEO, while the core constituent body of the corporation and the actual wealth producers, the employees, have no legal voice. Financial gains for the stockholders by virtue of their &quot;ownership&quot; position, irrespective of any real corporate functionality, are to be maximized while costs, which employees represent, are minimized. It is this &quot;wealth privilege&quot; that is truly reminiscent of the status of the olden feudal lord.<br />By contrast democratically organized corporations would be developed and viewed much differently. First, it would be acknowledged that corporations are semi-public entities with obligations for the public good and subject to control by both the community and employees. A body of distant, amorphous &quot;owners&quot; would not be able to disenfranchise a stable, human community of workers, that is, the employees. The aims of the corporation would reflect the primacy of employees. Payouts to stockholders would be viewed as costs to be contained with the rewards of productivity improvements accruing to employees.<br />Historically, however, the author notes that in the early republic corporations were chartered by state governments for fixed terms to accomplish specific functions and were subject to some government oversight with the possibility of charter revocation. But a series of court decisions established the &quot;bizarre&quot; notion that corporations are private entities with full rights as persons. In that construct, employees are subsumed within the corporation with only a subservient role to perform.<br /><br />Turning to more recent attempts at ameliorating the primacy of shareholders, the author notes that some states have enacted legislation that obligates corporations to act in the best interests of other stakeholders including employees, customers, and the community. But much of that legislation is relatively weak and untested. In addition, voluntary corporate initiatives such as codes of conduct or enlightened management seem to be mostly reactionary with little staying power.<br />At this point in our economic and political history, any change in the structure of corporations would be a most difficult task.<br />Free market economic theory, the current rage in the U.S., holds that more or less equal entities freely interact in the economy. The fiction of corporate personhood dovetails with the theory perfectly. Corporations are just people; the non-democratic power dynamics and the privileges of corporations are neatly hidden away. But without public understanding of the aristocratic vestiges of corporations, the privileges of wealth, there will be no public clamor for change. Even the Enron debacle is likely to be viewed as simply personal criminality rather than an example of more general flawed corporate structure. The author does not delve into the public's perceptions of corporations or for that matter the media's role in manipulating those perceptions. But that may be a subject for others. &quot;The Divine Right of Capital&quot; certainly delineates the aristocratic nature of corporations in a democratic age.in a democratic age.	2002-02-28

In addition, his concerns about the impact of huge, unassimilated immigration flows on our culture are legitimate. But despite the subtitle of the book, these are not Buchanan's main points.<br />The author is most concerned with the de-Christianizing of the culture as he sees it. From that flows all that is wrong with our culture: low birth rates, \\"butchering babies,\\" that is abortion, toleration for homosexuality, gender equality, etc. In addition, he finds a tyranny of \\"cultural Marxism\\" that indicts our past and enforces a widespread political correctness. But those views are too simple. Americans have never been especially fond of various authorities, even church authorities, that attempt to dictate to us.<br />Though touched upon, the author gives insufficient weight to the effects of industialization, the rise of materialism and consumerism, and the infiltration and dominance of American culture by huge corporations. It is huge media conglomerations that control and present a purified, non-controversial view of American life. The ideology of free-market conservatism has gained ascendancy in American life. Profits and greed are the driving forces. For example, a traditional pillar of American life, the dignity of work, is shoved aside in the search for cheap labor which includes a tolerance for the huge immigration flows that Buchanan decries.<br />Buchanan understands that the entire neo-liberal project has no concern for the integrity of a society, a nation. But the solution is not some vague return to religion with a rather dubious ability to address issues. Political empowerment is the only way that the American people can regain control from institutions that serve only their own agendas.<br />I do not think that Buchanan is racist, per se, as some have said. He has legitimate concerns. But he should be advocating for democracy throughout society including within workplaces and for public debate about the direction for our society. From that could easily flow solutions to the problems that the author has raised.s.

Is it a book about longevity or is it a textbook on adult development? A main purpose of the author is to convey the findings of a multi-decade study of three distinct groups totaling about 800 individuals as they aged: a male Harvard student cohort born in 1920; a male inner city cohort born about 1930; and a gifted female cohort born in California about 1910. However the emphasis is on the Harvard cohort, a group that most assuredly stands apart from typical American lives. All of the interviewees were at least 70 years of age by 2000 but the specific commonality of longevity seems to get lost in the author's focus on more general social and emotional developmental concerns. However, the author establishes little connection between longevity and such development.<br />Perhaps the biggest problem with the book is that only a very limited, and at times inadequate, overview is presented regarding various social and emotional developmental topics. The author bases the entire book on Erik Erikson's ideas about adult developmental stages, which in his interpretation consists of the sequential tasks of identity, intimacy, career consolidation, generativity, keeper of the meaning, and integrity. There is no discussion about the legitimacy of those ideas or whether there are alternative ideas. The principal means of elaborating on those views is by presenting mini-profiles of about 50 individuals throughout the book who supposedly have or have not attained a particular level of development. It is burdensome for the reader to be presented with so many case studies to weigh.<br />It is here that the author's subjectivity becomes most apparent as he is very inclined to label those surrounded by somewhat extensive social networks be they ones of family, patients, customers, or friends as having aged well. He takes no notice of single adults or childless couples; two situations that would undoubtedly have an impact on traditional socialization. In one case he lauds as brilliant a man who has focused on the tasks of intimacy and career for the first twenty years of his adult life and then turns to generativity, or nurturing the young. One wonders if his children would appreciate the twenty years of de-emphasis on them. Frankly, it makes the development laid out by the author seem questionable.<br />In addition, the author demonstrates little appreciation for the atypical life chances and economic standing of the Harvard cohort. He finds it quite commendable that one-half of the Harvard cohort remained in their full-time work at age 65, failing completely to understand that the career control of doctors, lawyers, professors, and business owners and executives of the Harvard cohort far exceeds the options available to most people. He basically sidesteps the entire topic of adequate retirement income, even regarding it at one point as relatively unimportant compared to learning to play.<br />The author also classifies childhoods as ranging from &quot;the Loveless&quot; to &quot;the Cherished.&quot; But to what effect? It is found that the negatives of childhood generally do not translate into life beyond age 50 and certainly not to longevity. In deference to general adult development textbook mode, the author makes a brief jargon-laced foray into both maladaptive and adaptive defense mechanisms that is bound to leave most lay readers just baffled.<br />The author frequently refers to &quot;healthy&quot; aging, but, again, what is it? We do learn that ancestral longevity, cholesterol levels, stress, parental characteristics, childhood temperament, and ease in social relationships do not predict healthy aging. What does predict healthy aging? Among the Harvard cohort, no alcohol abuse, no heavy smoking, and not being overweight were the greatest predictors of healthy aging followed by some exercise, a stable marriage, and then maturedefenses. Among the Inner City cohort, a stable marriage was found to be the best predictor of successful aging followed by the same top three of the Harvard cohort and then by 12-plus years of education and by mature defenses. A major disconnect in the book is a discrepancy where the text claims that mature defenses ranks as the second best predictor contrary to the data displayed in charts.<br />So what is learned from this book? Some adults develop more or perhaps differently than others. Some adults have lives that are more social  than others. Some adults are happier than others. None of that is unique to aging. It could well have a lot to do with life's circumstances that are largely outside an individual's control. We do learn that the author is somewhat judgmental concerning the quality of various individuals' lives in old age. Adults without bad consumption habits stand a far better chance of living longer than those who abuse their bodies. It probably did not take a Harvard study and a book to know most of this. Maybe the lesson is to go to Harvard and live long.defenses.

RCA, like many industrial concerns in the so-called Rust Belt, has always been concerned with operating in locales with favorable labor relations. It was the community characteristics of having a large pool of unemployed workers with limited wage expectations and no history of industrial activism that impelled RCA to move the production of its consumer products, mostly radios and televisions, from Camden in the 1940s to Bloomington, IN, and ultimately to Juarez, Mexico beginning in the 1970s. But the mass production regimes that were established had the unintended effect of significantly altering the social environments into which they moved.<br />Certainly anti-unionism triggered some of the plant closings that began in the 1970s in the Rust Belt, but RCA actually tolerated the compliant unionism that they recognized in Bloomington and then in Juarez. It was the very nature of the production process instituted by RCA that triggered the worker discontent that they so ardently sought to avoid. The speedup and deskilling under scientific management, the petty authoritarianism, the ignoring of work rules and job classifications, and gender inequities - all sparked resentment and resistance; but did result in some alleviation of the complaints.  But a key point is that the ability of a corporation to invest or disinvest literally globally simply transcends the ability of a locally rooted workforce to counter corporate practices, a point amply demonstrated by RCA.<br />The author is wont to discuss the broader issue of worker solidarity especially across borders, as in the Mexican border. But it is acknowledged that interpersonal relationships on which worker solidarity is built, not to mention local customs or even language, do not translate well internationally. While the author is most assuredly on track to criticize simplistic protectionism to counter run-away factories, there is no commentary on the feasibility of political solutions that are grounded in working class solidarity. The political knowledge and activity of the various workforces encountered is not discussed. The fragmented pockets of resistance that may be found in local communities regarding corporate policies is simply no match for the ideological consistency and political influence of the capitalist class. Without a broad-based worker politics strong legislation to require corporations to absorb the costs to communities of shutdowns and downsizings and to require enforced labor and environmental standards to be reflected in the cost of imported products will not be attained.<br /><br />The book is most significant in demonstrating that the cross-border moves to Mexico by RCA were little different from their earlier trans-regional moves. In addition, it was pointed out that NAFTA was only a continuation of Mexico's Border Industrialization Plan of the 1960s where a border zone was constructed that permitted the free import of goods for use in products for immediate export - a plan that RCA exploited. The limitation of place-based worker power is well noted. Yet it is the political sophistication of the workforces explored that would have been of most interest to this reader. It will take political power to counter capital mobility.interpersonal relationships on which worker solidarity is built, not to mention local customs or even language, do not translate well internationally.

However, according to the author, unions tend to gravitate to functioning between two of the vertices. He draws his examples from European trade unionism. Thus British trade unionism is depicted as operating between the dictates of markets and class considerations; German trade unionism exemplifies the tradeoffs between markets and society; Italian trade unionism represents a compromise between class and social considerations.<br />To act both as a market bargaining agent and as a class actor has contradictions. It is widely held that most workers desire a union to be a body that focuses on and stabilizes their particular employment and wages - not those of an entire class. And resulting bargaining agreements tacitly assume that unions will exert control over workforces. It is a position that essentially leaves unchallenged the rights of capital to control workplaces and the economy, but it has proven to be quite vulnerable, as economic pressures have increased in the last of the 20th century. Early 20th century Italian factory councils or the more recent British shop steward system gained some degree of worker control on a location-specific basis though largely outside the purview of bureaucratic unions. But no trade union body has ever consolidated working class interests sufficiently to be able to cause a transformation of capitalism in favor of working class interests.<br />Political power or standing permeates the entire discussion. Repeatedly it is the ability of working class interests to be a part of the political process that is key to their relative standing in both the larger society and in workplaces. The social integration or corporatism that is found throughout continental Europe includes trade union central bodies in peak-level macroeconomic discussions as well as other working class considerations, such as the establishment of works councils in workplaces. Trade unions are, in essence, social partners in this climate. They are also class actors in their ability to aggregate working class political power. A purely collective bargaining approach seems to be indicative of minimal political power and, in this era, of minimal effectiveness.<br />There is no doubt that the book is thought provoking. Do the poles of market, class, and society provide an adequate framework for understanding trade unionism? For this reviewer, class and society would be subsumed under political power with that power countering and influencing economic power. The discussions of the three particular trade union movements are quite tedious and sometimes provide confusion as well as clarity as to how those movements fit in the author's general framework. The more theoretical parts of the book are also a little difficult to follow with the qualifiers and exceptions sometimes diluting the central argument. But I think the book should be read by anyone wanting to take a new look at understanding trade union orientation.d throughout continental Europe includes trade union central bodies in peak-level macroeconomic discussions as well as other working class considerations, such as the establishment of works councils in workplaces.

But the book can be seen as more about obsessiveness than it is about Jewish culture, per se. Moreover, time and again comfortable cultural conventions are laid open to expose their essential fradulence including but hardly limited to religious tenets.<br />Alex's mother is obsessed with maintaining a perfect Jewish househould not only for herself but for the world to see and that includes Alex. Of course perpetual anxiety and oftentimes hysteria pervade the Portnoy household as any shortcomings must be eradicated. But, if anything, possible inferiorities are internalized only to seep out later. The Alex that emerges leads what amounts to a double life. On the one hand he is a &quot;do-gooder&quot; ( a perfect person) publicly acknowledged for his service to mankind, but on the other hand a compulsive Alex is fixated on sex as the only aspect of his life that is significant to him. Ultimately the conflicts are too much for Alex, hence an analyst.<br />There is a lot to digest in this book. It is humorous, outrageous, and would be offensive to the tender-hearted, but it is far more a study on personal and social dysfunction. The question is has Roth captured a reality in a manner that informs or captivates. The answer here is an unqualified, yes.	2001-12-28

He hit upon a walk across America as means to gain perspective.<br />The foremost fact of his journey was its sheer difficulty: having to endure hunger, cold, loneliness, sickness, etc. There is no way anyone could anticipate that and Peter did not. But his purpose had a lot more to do with the people that he hoped to encounter. But his contacts with people actually were quite limited and were almost exclusively with rural people (except towards the end). It would be hard to make any general claims concerning the general character of the American people based on Jenkins' journey. He had some good experiences with people and some not so good, even frightening. Most people were civil to him if that is the claim.<br />Some of his experiences were quite compelling. He had great rapport with a reclusive mountain man in Virginia that he stumbled upon and visited for three days. By far the most noteworthy experience of the journey was the four months that he spent living with a black family in cramped quarters in Murphy, NC while becoming a part of the entire community including backbreaking work at a sawmill. But just prior to arriving in Murphy the white law enforcement officials of Robbinsville, NC threatened to hang him if he did not leave town - there goes any general goodness theory.<br />Other highlights of the journey were meeting and being pleasantly surprised by George Wallace, the governor of Alabama, and meeting his future wife in New Orleans. Less compelling aspects of the journey were the showing up of his family members at various points of the journey which detracts from his self-discovery assignment and a turn towards religious overtones as the book progressed.<br />For purposes of rating the book, it hard to separate the book from the journey. Any rating of the book is bound to influenced by whether the reviewer found the journey to be compelling. The book is written simply - no pontification.

This book consists mostly of snippets of that on-line ticker and gives a very fragmented feel to the reader. After a while it grows tiresome to read of Mr. Noname making a break or covering a break. There is just a whole lot more to the Tour than an endless recitation of obscure names as they jockey for position throughout a six hour stage. A far more interesting angle would be to explain how so-called domestiques do so well in so many of the stages. What are differences between them and the favorites?<br />I would have expected an insiders book on the Tour de France to supply the reader with far more technical information as well as explanations of the rigors, demands and behaviors affecting the participants. What are typical meals? How can so many calories be consumed without causing complications? How is hydration maintained? How can a rider survive over 2,000 miles on a bike in three weeks? What special measures are taken. How does a rider not feel good on a ride yet continue at a level that would amaze even a good amateur cyclist? What does it mean to &quot;have good legs&quot;? What are the riding styles - in saddle or out? What gearing is used? What manufacturers equipment is used? There was a brief section on time-trial bikes in the book. How can a cyclist scream down mountain stages at 60-70 mph? Most good cyclists would not survive even one such descent.<br />Few books are written on professional bicycling racing, but the Tour de France does pique general interest. Here is a chance to explain the real world of cycling: its difficulties, complications, and requirements. Put the race coverage in the context of a broader view. Did the winners somehow cope with all of that better or is there another explanation? This book seems to have been written exclusively for the small world of elite cyclists who know all about professional cycling if not the actual participants. If that is the objective, label the next book &quot;For elite cyclists only.&quot;w all about professional cycling if not the actual participants.

There is no doubt that the book is part of an overall effort to capitalize on Lance's amazing Tour de France win in 1999 and after, but the sometimes angry, sometimes cocky Lance may be a little difficult to understand or tolerate by some.<br />Lance acknowledges a great deal of good fortune in surviving cancer but does so rather disingenuously. The fact of the matter is that over 99% of the population would have never had the instant access that Lance had to specialists all over the country who as it turned made all the difference in his recovery. In addition, Lance was quite fortunate in that a bike store owner in Texas took Lance under his arm when he was very young and developed his cycling ability virtually from the ground up. It is vintage Lance Armstrong when he has falling out with his patron just as he is starting to gain some national recognition of his cycling talent. On several ocassions Lance benefited from the right guy entering his life at the right time to provide the right kind of help with his cycling. It did not have to happen that way.<br />Some may find the book inspirational and it is to a degree. Others may see just how thin is the thread that separates success and even life itself from failure and even death.	2001-12-22

The author of this book punctures that notion and counters with the reality that capitalistic society is very much defined by distinct classes: an elite and small capitalistic class, a large working class, and a middle class of professionals, entrepreneurs, and managers that reside between the other two. His key point is that it is not income that defines the classes: it is the exercise of power. An elite capitalistic class dominates and controls our society culturally, politically, and most basically in workplaces and corporations. It is that exercise of power that sets capitalists apart. The working class is essentially powerless by comparison with the author's middle class exercising varying degrees of power depending on actual position held.<br />The author identifies several approaches that obscure the existence of classes. One is that we gain our identity primarily as consumers. As consumers we are told we are &quot;sovereign,&quot; that is, empowered. Of course, the systematic manipulation by advertisers is an agenda of disempowerment of consumers adding to the domination already occurring in workplaces. Another myth is that people freely change positions (upward mobility) within a vast middle class. In other words, class does not largely determine life's chances and successes even though there is substantial evidence to the contrary. To further deny the reality of classes in American, talk of class is discredited by elites as foreign to America, or at least as an ideology of the past. While this book is not about media domination of American culture, the author does attribute to the media a role in obscuring talk about class from mainstream American culture. That point should have received greater emphasis.<br />The author contends that the recovery of the lexicon of class is essential for the working class to understand and to deal with the forces at work in society. It is the power of capitalists to control the economy that has seen working class wages decline and stagnant over the last twenty-five years while income and wealth has been redistributed upwards. It is not the mythical &quot;invisible hand.&quot; The folding of capitalists into the &quot;rich&quot; obscures the exercise of power. Entertainers are often rich but seldom wield any power. In addition, in a sociology devoid of the exercise of power, the poor are construed as lacking moral fiber and not as less fortunate members of the working class. The poor are a convenient target for the anger of working class communities or families who have suffered various dislocations or dysfunctions. Power wielding economic elites remain hidden and free of blame.<br />The larger purpose of this book is to not only educate the working class about power dynamics but to inspire a revitalization of working class political activity. Any realistic assessment of the working class' ability to form independent organizations to counter the think tanks, political parties, trade associations, university support, and the corporate media, all directed by the capitalistic class, is simply lacking. The absence of class-talk is not a recent phenomenon. Even traditional working class organizations like labor unions have been content with sacrificing worker power for material benefits. It is most difficult to fathom the working class overcoming the efforts of educational institutions, the media, and other elitist directed bodies in their quest to obscure the dynamics of American society. Nonetheless this book is another wakeup call for the working class. Hopefully it will make its way into the hands of those for whom it was written.the working class to understand and to deal with the forces at work in society.

According to this author the benefits of a perfect job seem to be unlimited: a longer, better, and more vital life; an elevated self-esteem and sense of humor; a life that counts; etc. Of course most of us by that standard are leading substantially diminished lives. But all is not lost because it is only your lack of courage or cynicism that prevents you from reaching the rarified air of the perfect career. The author's key question is, &quot;Are You Up For It?&quot; Can you give yourself up totally in your perfect job quest to coaching either via this book or a professional, which dovetails nicely with the author's career counseling business.<br />The path that the perfect job seeker must follow is daunting to say the least. Three primary lists of &quot;wants, requirements and commitments, and questions&quot; are to be maintained in a large notebook and filled via a rather vaguely specified manner with any number of self-assessments in such areas as your innate capabilities, personality, traits, decision-making technique, etc as well as assessments about the external world.<br />The biggest problem with the entire approach is that the author attributes far more expertise to people in assessing themselves and in knowing and controlling their environments than they have or even could have. Personalities, traits, and other personal characteristic often do not fall clearly on one side of the fence. In using the Myers-Briggs Indicator one may be both intuitive and sensory oriented or use both perception and judgment. Or it is quite conceivable that one is comfortable using both spatial and non-spatial or concrete and abstract tendencies. The distinctions between tribal vs. maestro and introversion vs. extroversion seem better drawn, but mapping personality assessments into jobs is far more complex than the author indicates.<br />A huge shortcoming of the book is the clear implication by the author that employees or potential employees can assess and control workplaces sufficiently to find perpetual job happiness. Workplaces in the U.S. have never worked that way. Your true happiness is not of much concern to employers. Few, if any, workplaces have formal structures in place with legal-like rights that permit employees to modify both the broader work environment as well the specific nature of their jobs. As it is now, most, if not all, of the adaptation must be made by the employee which runs counter to the main argument that the employee should not be doing what he or she is not wired for. Most jobs upon entry probably cannot be a perfect fit unless one is just lucky. The key is the flexibility to change the job and the environment to suit the person and still be an asset to the company.<br />The book has areas that could be applied more broadly than just in finding the perfect job. The author's model that depicts human behavior as going through cognitive filters and being subsequently modified via feedback from the comparison of actual versus intended consequences of the original behavior is interesting. The idea of executing a cycle of accomplishment of creation, action, and completion by creating goals and implementing projects has a very practical ring to it. The author also has an interesting chapter on the life-games that people play including the notion of one or more &quot;master&quot; games.<br />In lieu of suggesting that the lack of job happiness is due to poor personal assessment capabilities or strategies the author could have described the situation in European countries where high school age kids are permitted to sample apprentice programs and select one if so inclined. In addition some European countries have regional employment centers that perform some of the functions of assessing skills, paying for new or additional training, and placing workers. There is the recognition that requiring the unemployed to fend for their own has its limitations.<br />The author acknowledges &quot;Given sufficient intelligence, the average human can do just about anything with reasonable competence.&quot; But what he did not say is that given adequate institutional support from an educational system, employment centers, and from a formal system of employee empowerment, most people would probably be able to find or create pleasing work. Dangling the &quot;perfect job&quot; concept in front of people without realistic tools or power to get there is not particularly helpful.itional training, and placing workers.

Most of the conditions of the 19th century sweatshops are present in these corporations: speedup and exorbitant workloads, excessive and not fully compensated work hours, interpenetration of non-work lives by the corporation especially via new electronic technologies, rule by intimidation and arbitrary decisions, and powerlessness - all of which produce a great deal of stress, anxiety, and other health problems.<br />I find it to be a major failing of the book that the author did not explore the ignorance of U.S. labor history exhibited by the various knowledge workers that she interviewed. Though the author did acknowledge that the ascendancy of the labor movement in the few decades after WWII positively impacted white collar working conditions, it was hardly noted the period was an aberration in the long history of generally hostile labor-management relations.<br />The blissfully ignorant organization man of the fifties has had the rug pulled out from under him by the rise of Wall St, investment bankers, globalization - the entire neo-liberal project. The short term rise of stock prices aided considerably by squeezing and eliminating workers has become the focus of corporate managements. The paternalistic organizations of the fifties were only too happy to increase salaries, benefits, and pensions when they ruled the post WWII world. Now the lament of reduced financial rewards is certification that today's knowledge workers have no idea of just how little standing they have in large corporations. Company spokespersons channel any discussions of negative repercussions to workers from management decisions as necessitated by competitive pressures.<br />The author's suggestions for improvement of the situation are quite hollow. The first suggestion for individuals to stand up to the corporate giant is surely a course of self-sacrifice. She accepts that white-collar workers don't like unions without addressing the issue of employee power. Legislated European-style works councils are not mentioned. The political behavior of knowledge workers is not mentioned at all. Is there a connection to supporting the Repubs and workplace conditions? The author feels the pain of workers subjected to sweatshop conditions, but for a veteran of business affairs that is clearly insufficient.

And there is some interesting detail concerning ARMs, lender rate sheets, zero-point loans, etc.<br />But I think the book lacks organization and consistency. Like a lot of &quot;insider&quot; books it needed to have been read by a lot of &quot;outsiders&quot; for coherency before publishing. The author is not consistent in using the terminology that he defines at the start. He often is not clear about when he is talking about the firm originating your loan or the ultimate buyer of the loan. He creates as much confusion as clarity in his sloppy use of the terms: rebates, points, loan discount points, or loan origination points. Furthermore, for a detail-oriented book I was surprised that section numbers of a standard settlement form, 800, 900, 1000, etc, were not referred to when discussing closing costs.<br />I would have like to have seen more realistic discussion about the ability of a consumer to force a loan originator to reveal or discuss the profit margin on a loan as the author suggests one do. As far as I know American businesses are not in the habit and in fact resist revealing markups to consumers.<br />For some readers this book may be just what they are looking for, but I suspect that for most the detail is just not presented in a way that makes it particularly understandable or usable.	2001-10-15

One is urged to shed the various nefarious social systems which have operated on one since birth causing untold Stress, to find one's True Self, and to return to those very systems, mostly family and work, a new recharged and in-charge person. According to the authors, most simply need to go through a self-assessment process and thought experiments to reveal Personal Visions for the future.<br />Nowhere in the book do the authors discuss the power dynamics of the broader economy, society, and the polity and the impacts on persons. Managers are depicted not as powerful players in organizations who demand adherence to rules but as employee allies who want you to achieve your self-defined goals. Perhaps the authors could have reflected on the reason that labor unions formed. Or perhaps they could have pondered as to why social-democratic political parties exist in most democratic societies. The answer is most certainly not that corporations are interested in your True Self. Try the fact that workers and citizens need help against powerful players.<br />The authors operate a company that sells Whole Person Technology out of which comes a Personal Vision. Their customers are mostly large corporations which only adds suspicion about whom is to benefit. In fact, most of their individual customers seem to find happiness where they were previously unhappy. How convenient. For the readers of this book a battery of tests is available on CD for the tidy sum. The book has an unmistakable feel of being a promo for their self-help products.<br />In addition, the book is clearly intended for professionals, executives, managers, knowledge workers, etc. The book is loaded with snippets of case studies of such workers. Of course, they all found their Personal Vision.  Apparently blue-collar workers don't have near the need to find a True Self.<br />Is the book completely bogus. No. It is Briggs-Myers on the cheap. Yes, distinctions between introversion and extroversion, specialization and generalization, logical and spontaneous, etc are minimally presented. If someone was hopelessly in the wrong job, perhaps  that would be seen by reading this book ignoring the question of how he or she got there in the first place. But the book greatly oversimplifies the ability of individuals to make major transformations in their lives. I suspect that for most the costs and risks, resources and information available, and the power to affect change make real changes nearly impossible.

The first part of the book is largely instructive. He defines the market system as &quot;a system of society wide coordination of human activities not by central command but by mutual interactions in the form of transactions.&quot; Coordination is for both &quot;social peacekeeping&quot; and cooperation. Markets are an arena for mutual adjustment and not simply or even mostly for competition as some would contend. He contrasts the flexibility of markets with the rules and authority of a command system. The state under girds the market system by providing for liberties, property and contract rights, policing, infrastructure, a monetary system, etc. The author furnishes the analogy: if the market system is a dance, the state supplies the dance floor. He is especially wont to point out the interpenetration of the market system with society and the polity. The market system is not some purely economic formulation like, say, the law of supply and demand.<br />A key claim by purists is that the market system establishes efficiency prices, or the correct price based on the free interactions of all buyers and sellers. The author squashes that notion. There are any number of inefficiencies and compulsions that undermine claims of efficiency. Among them are so-called spillover effects or externalities, transaction termination, manipulation of buyers, inequality of resources, inequality of market position, arbitrary pricing by monopolies or governmental interference - to name a few. In addition, the author identifies &quot;prior determinations&quot; as distorting efficiency prices. Custom, laws especially those of inheritance, and historical accident distribute assets and skills that distort and taint current market transactions.<br />The author spends some time examining the quid pro quo basis of the market system. The general rule for entering the market system is that any request for benefits or goods is invalid without an equivalent market offer. Traditional societies have generally acknowledged at least some claim to society's output by virtue of membership. But market systems turn inhumane quid pro quo into a moral virtue. The author points out that the concept of community allows for &quot;love thy neighbor,&quot; but in market societies one has no neighbors. Critics contend that the market system affects personalities rewarding small-mindedness, cunning, and deceit over wisdom. Yet the author is more inclined to view market behavior as an example of role ethics and not to be deplored.<br />Perhaps the major concern of the author concerning the market system is the disproportionate power granted to elites in a market system and the subsequent impact on freedom and democracy.<br />Clearly entrepreneurs and corporations and to some extent governmental elites are the movers and shakers of market systems. Market and political elites constantly bombard the public in one-way communication with their messages for purposes of controlling and manipulating the public's market and political behavior making a mockery of the much proclaimed &quot;consumer sovereignty.&quot;  Elite control and hierarchical arrangements are made to seem natural in an ostensibly democratic society.<br />Governments offer any number of inducements to corporations:  tariff protections, loans, cash and land grants, purchase of goods, patents, tax concessions, information and research services, subsidized advertising, etc. School systems are geared to corporate needs. But those concessions to market elites are clearly a case of the exercise of political inequality.<br />In addition, it is problematic for democracy when rights usually conferred on real, living citizens are granted to institutions such as the fiction that corporations are legal persons. He contends that institutions should be constrained to pursue assigned purposes and no others. For corporations that would include rights to buy and sell and manage a workforce. As it is, corporations play the role of oversized, unfairly empowered citizens. Utilizing public funds, that is, sales receipts, and organizational resources, corporations engage in overt political and philanthropic activities at a level that overwhelms normal citizen participation and influence.<br />If the market system distorts democracy, why is it that no democratic state has turned away from the market system? According to the author the assault on the public's mind by market and political elites has produced &quot;a remarkably high degree of conformity of thought endorsing or accepting the market system.&quot;<br />Free-market ideologues tout the freedom of the market system. But in the face of &quot;distracting and obfuscating&quot; communications from elites, is it possible to exercise free choice. Some have suggested that such manipulation actually degrades mental acuteness, and though sympathetic the author finds that to be an overstatement. The unfreedom of workplaces also brings into question the claim of the market system as being freedom enhancing. In the author's words: &quot;People at the end of the 21st century may look back with astonishment on our era's discrepancy between democratic principle and autocratic practice in the corporation.&quot;<br />In the end, the author though noting the considerable problems of the market system remains confident that the market system can best deliver the benefits to society as first defined. He points out that every market society can choose varying degrees of control over spillovers, monopoly, corporate powers including political powers, managerial authority in enterprises, investment, and distribution of income and wealth. Purchase, subsidy, tax, and related devices can be used by the state to make the market system livable.<br />Undoubtedly, free-market types will not find much to enjoy in this book. Others may contend that the author was unwilling to drive the final nail into a system that he clearly finds to be problematic.

Or the author instructs to drive the old pin all the way out in doing chain maintenance on an HG chain. Usually it is much easier to reconnect the chain with part of the old pin still in. It is stated that a Shimano tool does not damage the plates of a Shimano chain but others do. Well, Park tools are by the most purchased tool by home enthusiasts. Does a CT3 chaintool tool cause damage? The reader or future home repair person is left to wonder. In fact there is almost total absence of exact tool identification in the entire book. That is the kind of thing that a beginner needs to know.<br />In adjusting derailleurs presetting the barrel adjusters is not done. Setting the front derailleur limit screws before tightening the cable is not done. It is this kind of inconsistency in most every chapter that plagues this book. But the beginner would have no way on knowing this. So that is why I must qualify the chances of a person following this book having success in his or her repair.<br />A more complete book is the Barnett's Manual. But of course it is about four times as expensive and it too is not without its problems. It attempts to cover all types of bikes but its attention to detail and specifications and procedures can often overwhelm rather than really help the reader. The bottom line is that if you know next to nothing about bikes, you can learn a lot from this book. But there is still lots more to learn. Seek out other sources.

The Manual actually consists of four volumes with vol 4 consisting of material extracted from the previous three for easy access. The repairs and adjustments are conducted via written step-by-step procedures. Many of the adjustments utilize self-adhesive markings that are put on the bike for the purpose of exactly increasing or decreasing the tightness of bearing adjustments. Proper torquing is always specified. The Manual attempts to be comprehensive covering both road and mountain bikes and all sorts of groupos. Some of these are covered better than others. The manuals also deal with frame preparation using facing and threading tools. In some ways the manuals are a little dated. For example the wheel building and truing sections use traditioanl rims and spokes, not to mention traditional hubs. But modern wheels are using vastly reduced spoke counts, exotic spoke materials and shapes, and cartridge type hubs. The translation from the old to the new is hardly discussed, if at all. Cartridge hubs in particular are given insufficient weight. On the other hand the adjustment of newer STI derailleur systems is superb, not to mention threadless headsets, V-brakes, etc. The author probably would contend that his manuals facilitate learning the principles of bicycle repair and maintenance and that dealing with new technologies would follow the same guide lines. And there is of course some truth in that. However, a purchaser of these manuals could be disappointed if he or she expects every bicycle part to be covered in detail, becasue they are not.	2001-08-27

First, the author debunks the notion that consumerism was a natural technological development or clearly represents progress.<br />The author makes evident that the captions of industry sought to exert control over the entire social milieu beginning in the 1920s. Their foremost project was to define American life as consumerism. Consumption was marketed as far more than acquiring the essentials of life; it was a means to transform one's life: to achieve social esteem, to escape otherwise mediocre, humdrum lives. It was very much an individualistic approach to life in contrast to the traditional focus on small communities or extended families.<br />Industrialism was not easily swallowed by workers of the 19th and early 20th century. Traditional social bonds became irrelevant in factory production. Also under scientific management work was systematically deskilled and redefined by management. The strike wave of 1919 and the &quot;Red Scare&quot; of the early 20's convinced economic elites to set upon a course of pacification of discontented citizens in addition to measures of suppression.<br />The advertising in the 20's tried to convince that the mass production of consumable items was of tremendous benefit to society. The &quot;freedom&quot; of workers as consumers to transform their lives more than offset the actual loss of control over work processes. Every effort was made to see that mass-culture goods penetrated and hence defined all areas of life. Non-acceptance of that corporate-defined world was not viewed kindly. Virtually all non-market activity was cast as secondary, if not illegitimate. Buying superceded voting as the means to social remedy. Even families became purchasing units.<br />By the 1950s the transformation of the US to a consumerist culture was virtually complete. The penetration of corporate-owned television into all households ensured that alternatives to consumerism would not surface which was a continuation of the trend of centralization of all media outlets. The free-market and free trade ideologues of the 1990s are merely following in those same footsteps.<br />Though written 25 years ago, this book remains relevant today. More recent authors such as Kuttner, Schiller, Lindblom, or Frank can only add to what Ewen has already said.to consumerism would not surface which was a continuation of the trend of centralization of all media outlets.

The celebrities selected for skewering are hardly surprising. The calamitous lives of Michael and Elvis; the grotesqueness of disfiguring plastic surgery as a means to stay or get on top (see Cher); the unrestrained lewdness of aging Hollywood actors and moguls; and the sleazy, smarmy Las Vegas entertainer, a la Wayne Newton, easily serve to make the point.<br />The broader culture is hardly spared. The hugely deforming and crippling aspects of small girls pursuing fame through sports, namely gymnastics and ice skating, pushed by celebrity hungry parents and coaches is a chilling reminder of the costs of reaching for fame. In addition, the connection between unimaginative entertainment and the promotion of noncontroversial celebrity is examined. Not spared is the unquestioning obsession with celebrities that the broader culture exhibits.<br />Though unfamiliar with her writings, the book seems to be snippets of previous work - probably columns - and does lack the continuity of a more conventional book. Her phraseology is often catchy and original as well as outrageous but at times can be awkward and difficult requiring rereads to grasp the intent.<br />The book is rated fairly highly due to its outrageousness and irreverence towards a phenomenon that needs skewering. A decision to read this book would hinge on one's interest in the dissection of the shenanigans and sicknesses exhibited by mostly show-biz personalities and the broader culture intent on celebrity.	2001-07-26

Of equal concern to the author is the puncturing of that self-serving business agenda.<br />The author ranges widely among a variety of pundits, gurus, columnists, academics, and businessmen in the areas of finance, various media including the Internet, management theory, cultural studies, advertising, and corporations to capture the ascendancy of business-market thinking in the public arena during the 90s. He finds a remarkable convergence in their thought, which he subsumes under the rubric of &quot;market populism,&quot; which emphatically holds that markets and even workplaces are no longer the provinces of the powerful and well-placed but now operate according to the dictates and in the interests of the common man.<br />Those theorists shrewdly redefine familiar political terms; the primary location for democratic activity is now said to reside in the workings of the marketplace. The consumer replaces the citizen. The average man makes his will known not through voting for a legislative agenda but via consumerism and investing in the stock market on-line. In fact it is only antidemocratic elitism that attempts to regulate or counter market forces. Populism and the labor movement no longer serve the interests of the working class in this new era of market populism. Wholesale firings euphemistically tagged as downsizing are opportunities for workers to assert their power with future employers. The huge upward redistribution of wealth via the stock market in the 90s is overwhelmed with a focus on dot-com millionaires, nice-guy billionaires, or &quot;Fool,&quot; everyman investors.<br />As others have noted the book can be a bit tedious with the author revisiting many of the free-market theorists chapter after chapter. Also, in focusing on what these gurus have to say, it is unclear as to the extent of the penetration of market populism ideas into the masses. The author does mention the diminished status of journalists, of course because they are elitists, and newspapers but the ability and efforts of the media to control information in accordance with market populism dictates is not particularly well explored.<br />The Right always likes to claim that it is the Left that is ideologically driven. It is claimed that the marketplace is ideologically neutral - the very essence of freedom. But this book skewers that notion. Now the market is a propaganda tool. Markets empower all equally; power dynamics simply disappear.r as to the extent of the penetration of market populism ideas into the masses.

However, it is pretty obvious in this multi-month experiment that the author was never subjected to the gut-wrenching fear of being without money for life's essentials: she could and did bail out or fall back on resources from her affluent life when she felt the squeeze.<br />But the book is only partly about the wage squeeze that the lower echelon of our work force must endure. It is the conditions of employment that the author describes and experienced that drives the book.<br />As the author moves from waitressing, to cleaning houses, and to being a Wal-Mart associate it becomes obvious that the industrial relations of low-wage jobs exact a very burdensome toll. In low-wage work the distinction between management and employee is emphasized: the employee is not to be trusted and is required to follow exacting rules of work enforced by close supervision or the threat of surveillance. The personality screening and drug testing that occur when being hired stress to the new employee the inequality of the employment relationship. It is a lesson to be absorbed and not forgotten.<br />The author was forced to fight the fatigue, frustration, and even boredom of the low-wage jobs as constructed by the employers. Even a few moments of dignity and self-respect that originate from a job well done cannot offset the controlled and demanding nature of low-wage work.<br />The author is obviously an advocate for unempowered low-wage workers. But in what may be the most disturbing point of the book, the author admits to finding little in the way of understanding among her low-wage co-workers of their conditions of employment or of class relations in general - many even were mostly concerned with satisfying unreasonable managerial expectations. Such is one of the effects of many low-wage work regimes.<br />In a era when welfare has been reformed right out of the consciousness of most Americans, this book attempts to place the very real poverty of millions of hard-working Americans back on the radar screen.eformed right out of the consciousness of most Americans, this book attempts to place the very real poverty of millions of hard-working Americans back on the radar screen.	2001-06-13

Phelps Lectureship on Early American History)	Books	4	19	20	N	Y	The triumph of democracy in 1800 explained	Appleby's book demonstrates that the ascendancy of the Jeffersonian Republicans in 1800 was in itself perhaps as revolutionary as the War for Independence. The classical republican ideas of rule by virtuous elites, adherence to tradition, deference to superiors, etc all subscribed to by the Federalists were attacked as being contradictory with the aims of the Revolution.<br />Appleby argues very persuasively that the rise of market relations was also very destabilizing to hierarchical social and economic relations. Throughout the 18th century the idea that an economic system in which individuals acted in their own self-interest would yield a result most beneficial to the greater public gained widespread hearings. In the Republican view such a system required property-owning men free from such restraints as tariffs, excise taxes, and any other market interferences which was contrary to the mercantilist ideas of the Federalists.<br />The French Revolution was a catalyst in the formation of Republican political societies in the 1790s where Federalist policies were roundly attacked. Even the successful prosecution of several Republican newspaper editors under the Federalist-backed Sedition Act of 1798 could not stem the attacks on Federalist ideas of privilege and elite control. The author contends that the rise of the Republicans was nothing less than the triumph of an idea of the essential equality of all men.<br />The commercial enterprise in which most colonials were engaged was the production of foodstuffs for the European market. Other enterprises arose to support this increased production by farmers. This very short book ends with the election of 1800 before the rise of industrialism and such distinctions as employer versus employee. A concluding chapter would have been most welcome that addressed the Republican response to a more complex economic world. I did enjoy the book but I do believe that not examinig its ideas in the context of the 19th century is a shortcoming.tcoming.	2001-05-10

The book rests on the statements and views of party elites, though mostly presidential candidates, during presidential campaigns as being definitive of those parties' ideologies.<br />The periods identified for the Whigs and Republicans are the National Epoch (1828-1924) and the Neo-Liberal Epoch (1928-1992). For the Democrats the periods are the Jeffersonian Epoch (1828-1892), the Populist Epoch (1896-1948), and the Universalist Epoch (1952-1992). It may be surprising to learn that Bryan and not FDR started an epoch or that Hoover was the first neo-liberalist and not Goldwater or Reagan.<br />The author explores the nuances of the views of the parties on such matters as liberty, democracy, equality, virtue, the market, labor, etc. For example, both parties could make the claim of being pro labor. But for 19th century Republicans labor was not much different than modern-day entrepreneurship. The rise of organized labor, or unionism, was an unwelcome development. Democrats generally viewed labor as work done by the common man and did not include economic elites.<br />The author clearly shows that some aspects of party ideologies underwent near reversal across political epochs. By far the most interesting reversal of views is the attitude of the parties concerning the state and by extension the national government. The Whigs and Republicans of the 19th century were far more state-oriented than are the Reaganites. Republicans supported state intervention in the economy in building public works, maintaining high tariffs, and in generally advancing the cause of Americanism. The 19th century Democrats on the other hand were highly suspicious of state power. The Jacksonian assault on the National Bank is the foremost example of acting on that suspicion. Yet beginning with the Populist Epoch, Democrats sought to use the state to counter the increasing power of industrial entities.<br />The nineteenth century Republicans favored the growth of large economic entities, however the rhetoric of latter day Republicans seems to favor the rights of small businessmen and is opposed to anti-competitive formations and state regulation of the economy. Here the author could question the legitimacy of party ideologies. The claims of the pro-business party to be representing small businessmen in an era of massive corporate consolidations would seem to be of dubious validity. However, clearly the two parties have completely reversed their views of the state.<br />The book is well organized; it definitely clarifies the political speech of the two major American political parties by providing well-drawn frameworks on which to hang that speech.ning with the Populist Epoch, Democrats sought to use the state to counter the increasing power of industrial entities. <br />The nineteenth century Republicans favored the growth of large economic entities, however the rhetoric of latter day Republicans seems to favor the rights of small businessmen and is opposed to anti-competitive formations and state regulation of the economy.

The various innovative structures of Saturn such as teams, modules, business units, and councils are first described, but the book is far more concerned with the interactions among the Saturn management and the local UAW union and with GM and the international UAW. While the authors liberally point out the successes of the Saturn system, they are equally concerned with demonstrating the shortcomings principally in the areas of communications and decision-making among the various parties that have impacted the performance of Saturn. Despite Saturn's cars consistently scoring high on consumer quality ratings, internally Saturn has had difficulties with problem solving, productivity, organizational learning, and even quality.<br />The more discerning reader will have many questions while reading this book, especially in light of the fact that the authors are highly experienced labor relations academics. After the PATCO wholesale firings in 1980, US corporations declared war on unions. Yet why did GM agree to share management of a business with the UAW in the early 80s? The authors' explanation of a downturn in sales is insufficient. In actuality it was sheer panic, or desperation, on the part of GM coupled with the UAW being the strongest union in the US that prompted GM to go against its every instinct. That is not a trivial point.<br />The core production unit at Saturn is the work team consisting of 6 to 15 members with one of those individuals being elected as team leader. Teams have the responsibility of dealing with many aspects of production: work planning and scheduling, material and inventory control, budget constraints, repairs, training, quality, hiring, vacation scheduling, absenteeism, etc. Team members do receive several hundred hours of training in these areas, but it strains belief to find that this amount of expertise can be more or less equally imparted among disparate teams. With so much dependency on teams, a few teams that do not perform well despite their best efforts could easily interfere with overall results. Since teams essentially take on the role of HR management, they have to deal competently with such issues as discrimnation in hiring or discipline. What happens to union solidarity when team leaders are forced to discipline co-workers?<br />Certainly assembly is an essential part of the quality of an automobile but engineering would have to be more important. But the authors do not address the fact that engineering is not co-located with production and is not part of the UAW. How does the local union or teams determine that the highly technical aspects of the car design are correct? Again, expertise issues do not simply disappear with participation.<br />The authors do discuss organizational problems. They contend that the lack of communications or follow-up is the key to most problems. But not enough information is provided concerning the actual workings of teams to be sure that deeper structural problems do not exist.<br />The authors point out that the international UAW is concerned that the local Saturn union takes on characteristics much like the company unions that were essentially banned by the Wagner Act of 1935. But the authors could have indicated that unions are not necessarily even needed for substantial employee participation. For example, the legislatively mandated works councils of northern Europe provide for co-determination by employees in workplaces with resort to labor courts in the event of employer conflicts. It is not unions per se that is the key for employee input. There have to be channels for communications regardless of the system and there must be due process for workers that exercise voice. In addition, participation can occur with or without production teams.<br />It is surprising that the authors did not mention the efforts by some in the US Congress to pass legislation permitting employers to establish work teams on their own terms with no due process for employees. The authors are concerned with learning from Saturn. The authors are undoubtedly fully aware that the closest that most employers will come to a Saturn system is to install some sort of pseudo employee participation scheme.<br />I do find much to criticize about this book.

A major focus is on the religious and republican strands of thought that have been historically interwoven into our basically liberal culture and thereby makes our liberalism &quot;virtuous.&quot;<br />Duty and responsibility to the larger community have always been a part of Christian and moral thought. Adam Smith, often invoked by present-day free-marketeers, was a Scottish moral philosopher who saw the market as a means to broader social goods. Christianity has often emphasized the essential equality and brotherhood of men and the requirement of participating in the life of the community.<br />Republicanism is usually associated with public-spirited, independent, virtuous citizens who view centralized power as corrupting. The Jeffersonian small, land-owning farmer epitomizes the republican virtuous citizen which accounts for the early American fear of the rise of manufacturing because the factory system created a class of dependent laborers.<br />In other words, the author maintains that our political philosophy has always been a juggling act balancing the liberal basics of freedom versus duty to the community and of self-interests or wealth accumulation versus equality.<br />According to the author, pragmatism, a philosophy often associated with John Dewey, is the approach to take in making political or social decisions. It is a philosophy that eschews absolutes and depends largely on actual social experiences to arrive at solutions and accommodates our various strands of political thought. It is a democratic philosophy because it is collective experience as articulated by citizens as opposed to prescriptions by experts that is sought.<br />The author acknowledges that the &quot;virtues&quot; of liberalism have largely faded from public speech. Citizens have become mostly independent, rights-bearing entities without community obligations. Consumerism is the operant ideology. The author's calls for communities of democratic deliberation would seem to have no place in present-day culture. In addition, the recognition that communications is fundamental to a democracy generates only fleeting comments concerning the power of ever-consolidating media giants to limit and manipulate public speech and ideas.<br />The essays written at different times do have some overlap. Furthermore, there is some drift and shifts in the subjects and arguments across the essays. However, overall the essays are interesting. The views of numerous historical actors and authors as they relate to virtuous liberalism are presented: Madison, Jefferson, Tocqueville, William James, Weber, Dewey, Lippman, FDR, Rorty, Habermas, Sandel, and Rawls among others.s&quot; of liberalism have largely faded from public speech.

Professional, world class cyclists have their own training systems and don't need this book. It's difficult to see how 9-to-5ers who race on weekends have the time to follow a training program as complicated as this one.<br />The author starts by describing the basic cycling abilities of speed, endurance, and strength and goes on to describe the advanced abilities of muscular endurance, speed-endurance, and power. His training program consists of &quot;periods&quot; that emphasize the specific training of those abilities in varying proportions.<br />Those periods are Base I,II,III, Build I,II, Peak, and Compete. Throw in the factors of frequency, duration, intensity for all of the training periods, as well as lactate and cardiovascular monitoring and you have got yourself one complicated program. There is a lot of overlap in the training: to say that this manner of riding is this kind of training can seem somewhat arbitrary.<br />As a long-time runner and cyclist, I can attest to the fact that numerous training books exist for runners that are far easier to follow than is this one. There are a few basic workouts that can make one a successful runner. It is the opinion of this reviewer that the author would better serve those likely to buy this book or a next one if he would make the effort to simplify and reduce his descriptions of basic physiological systems and the corresponding training needed. And the author does readily admit that some cyclists are successful without going through such a complicated schedule. There must be some middle ground here.	2001-04-14

Social formations are strictly voluntary and, as such, do not define or incur obligations unless voluntarily accepted. The only social stricture is to do no direct, physical harm to others. A somewhat understated corollary of the book is that pristine, free-market capitalism and classical liberalism go hand-in-hand. Both posit freely-choosing individuals.<br />The author considers the counter arguments of so-called egalitarian liberals, communitarians, and conservatives. Those arguments contend that classical liberalism ignores or misunderstands social realities.<br />The inequality concerns of modern liberals are rejected by the author. No where in the book does the author admit to the freedom diminishing and well-being threatening consequences of the ability of the powerful to unduly influence the structure and workings of laws, governmental makeup, workplaces, etc. By definition, freedom, and not coercion, is being exercised. Curiously, the generational transfer of inequality is not addressed. Surely that violates classical liberalism's claim that success is due to personal choices, not those of one's parents.<br />The communitarian and conservative concerns with stable communities are also dismissed. Of course, that is hardly surprising because social embeddedness is merely a choice of individuals and not a fundamental characteristic to respect and preserve. Harm can only occur to individuals, not communities. Interestingly and revealingly, according to the author the instrumental and dispersed community of stockholders in a corporation should have their investments protected moreso than those who have put down roots (invested) in a geographical community.<br />The book suffers from a failure to consider actual, real-world societies that have dealt with the ramifications of capitalism and by extension classical liberalism - for example, Germany, Scandinavia, Holland, etc come to mind. In those societies it is recognized that capitalism randomly creates winners and losers. Those societies have chosen to not let mere chance and generated inequalities destroy lives. For example, a plant closing is very costly to a business in Europe: stockholder rights do not trump those of workers.<br />As one reads this book, the arguments even as described by the author of those who see the shallowness and disingenuity of classical liberalism are very persuasive.

But that's not who the book is for.<br />I'll recomment &quot;Developer's Workshop to COM &amp; ATL&quot; by Troelsen for anyone wanting to learn COM/ATL. That book ranges from basics to full-blown coverage. It is the best out there.	2001-01-21

In other words, there is an untapped social solidarity waiting for the right situation to transform society into one that cares for all citizens.<br />The problem is that the author presents little evidence for any such belief other than his desire for this to become a reality. No evidence is presented to indicate that substantial numbers of people even understand the dysfunctionality of their lives and of society and what actions to take both personally and within the larger society.<br />The author does demonstrate the rise of cynical pandering to social discomforts by the political right usually by scapegoating the disadvantaged as well as the government. He should have explored the propagandistic effects of the mass media and the educational system.<br />The author seems to be saying that if we are not really the self-centered, selfish people that we clearly demonstrate on a daily basis, we could have a good society where basic needs for physical and mental well-being could be meant. But that is a big if that the author cannot explain away. His calls for society-enhancing initiatives just have a hollow ring.	2001-01-08

I did run across a few mistakes; I had some trouble with a couple of the examples. But this book is far and away the best tutorial on COM and ATL that is out there. It is more than a simplistic introduction. The author starts with simple concepts, usually in straight C++, and progresses in a very logical sequence to an intermediate level using ATL. Many subtleties are covered but in context of the overall presentation. There is none of this inexplicable, out of context pandering to  fellow COM gurus that seems to motivate so many software authors.<br />This book is easily superior to &quot;Beginning ATL 3 COM,&quot; &quot;COM+ From the Ground Up,&quot; and &quot;Creating Lightweight Components.&quot; The other ATL book that is good is &quot;Active Template Library,&quot; but this book is better and more recent. For example, it does a far better job of explaining ATL internals. Amazingly, the explanations of ATL are in many ways superior to a book on the market that purports to be solely an ATL internals book. Of course, the difference is that one author can write, the other cannot.<br />In any event I do not hesitate in declaring this book at this time to be the one book that is best at explaining and conducting a thoroughgoing learning session in COM and ATL. I applaud the author for rising above the mediocrity that so typifies programming books.	2000-12-27
US	52280224	RCWRTEEITEANU	1861001207	725756571	Beginning ATL 3 Com Programming	Books	3	6	6	N	Y	Inconsistent enough to cause most readers to struggle	Maybe I can see three and one-half stars. For some, the book may be useful. A practical goal of the book is to develop a full ActiveX control using ATL and various tweaks. For most, getting to that point with this book would prove to be an arduous task unless they already know the subject and do not even need a book, let alone this one.<br />This book cannot be considered good for beginners, that is, those reasonably competent in C++ with maybe some COM rudiments. The book does not stay on a consistent path of explanation. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is full of &quot;by-the-ways&quot; that have nothing to do with the topic at hand and usually refer to a concept that has not been introduced, if ever. It is frustrating.<br />Also, the authors cannot make up their minds about how much ATL code and internals should be presented or what their general level of explanation will be. Time after time the reader is left with code snippets that cannot be well understood because of the poor base established by the authors. The various topics of error handling, automation, aggregation, and connection points are just not covered particularly well. The authors especially botch the topic of connection points with an overly complicated example utilizing several ATL classes that are marginally  explained. Also, virtually all COM books, and this one is no exception, do a lousy job of explaining the various types of marshalling, type libraries, proxies, stubs, and the nuances of their interactions and when they apply or should be explicitly used.<br />The fact is that COM itself is complicated - ATL would not exist if that wasn't the case. And ATL, the tool that's supposed to simplify the task, itself is complicated. Coherent, consistent, logical, well-written books are needed by most to understand this topic. Unfortunately, the computer gurus and nerds seemed to have weighed in on these topics ( of course they created COM &amp; ATL ) much to the suffering of most of us who have to wade through their tortured books. There are some exceptions. Armstrong's &quot;Active Template Library&quot; was a pleasure to read. Troelsen's &quot;Developer's Workshop&quot; looks promising at first glance. Early on &quot;Inside COM&quot; and the Eddons' &quot;Inside DCOM&quot; were quite good.<br />I fault the publishers as much as the authors, assuming they are not one and the same.

Books	3	13	14	N	Y	Not much insight into democratic disaffection	Many tables are presented that demonstrate that confidence in public institutions, especially in the executive and legislative branches of government, has declined in varying amounts in the trilateral countries, the US, Japan, and Europe, over the last 25 years. The conclusions seem to be that this trend is based on the public's perception that the performance of these institutions has deteriorated. But little insight is offered behind the numbers. The following are minimally addressed if at all.<br />In the first place, little mention is made of exactly what performance is lacking. Presumably the authors are after something greater than disaffection over episodes of scandal or corruption. There are some vague references to globalization but no evidence is presented that the public is disaffected over that matter.<br />Little is made of the impact of the extreme right-wing rhetoric that denounces government as an impediment to the free-market. Does that not pander to and reinforce the historical wariness that one author mentions of Americans towards government?<br />If government is of the people, by the people, and for the people, why does government not correspond to what is wanted by the majority? One author does raise the issue of the general competency of the citizenry to understand governmental workings and to choose a sensible course of action.<br />The authors do not address the massive consolidation over the last two decades of the entertainment and news media and the ramifications for a democracy. Any number of books demonstrate that delivering audience levels for advertisers supercedes wide-ranging or controversial political information. Personalities and day-by-day polling numbers are safe ways of covering politics. Is the minimalist &quot;information&quot; that the public gets adequate for an active, informed role in government? One author, interestingly enough, contends that the effects of the media are benign.<br />One author acknowledges that the business community is generally hostile towards government. What is not discussed is the infiltration and control of government by business. The massive funding of candidates' political campaigns by business PACs is not mentioned. Despite their hostility, businesses have the leverage to ensure that governments make decisions on such matters as deregulation or free trade that benefit the business community far more than the general public. But would government or business shoulder the blame for any adverse consequences for those policies on the public? Does the corporate media accurately report on the inner workings of government?<br />The book is unsatisfactory because it does not really attempt to discover what is behind the public's growing disaffection with government. The points listed above would undoubtedly be relevant in trying to grasp the public's views concerning government, but they are essentially ignored by the authors in this book. I would like to see this book reviewed by others to see if I have missed the basis of the public's disaffection with democracy as presented by the authors.siness community is generally hostile towards government.

It's not really necessary to be obscure about the author. Also, this book is a COM/ATL book. COM+ comes up only at the very end of the book.<br />This is definitely a how-to book. It only assumes that one knows the rudiments of C++ and then it takes you through the Visual Studio ATL Wizard in creating simple COM servers. However, there are some irritating lapses in detailing all the steps.<br />There are a lot of detailed code samples that demonstrate topics like error support, dual interfaces, aggregation, etc. But there is a limit as to how far code samples can take someone in learning something as complicated as COM and ATL. The chapter on connection points presents mountains of code that relys on some concepts or techniques that had not been well developed, if at all.<br />The author does not discuss the class structure of ATL. It's a big leap to go from generic, simple class factories to CComObjectCached. Object maps and COM maps would remain a puzzle. For those who want simple and believe that programming is adapting code samples to your needs, this might be the book for you. Or it could be a place to start.  I give the book four stars because it probably successfully meets a certain need.	2000-11-10

But the IDL that most programmers would need can be picked up from COM books or the MSDN. The author has some nice diagrams for marshalling and discusses various IDL nuances for pointers among other topics. He leads a rather obscure argument for not using QueryInterface(). This book would probably mean more for those that are highly skilled in COM.<br />This book is definitely not the place to start to learn COM. Try &quot;Beginning ATL 3&quot; or the more readable &quot;Active Template Library&quot; by Armstrong, or others. Keep in mind that IDL files are not even necessary to produce COM servers unless of course type libraries are needed. A use for this book would be to tinker with the IDL that is produced by wizards [ATL] or to understand it. But again chances are that one could or would learn most of the IDL that they need elsewhere.	2000-11-10

Jefferson and Madison and then the backers of Andrew Jackson established political parties to ensure that &quot;We, the People&quot; had a voice in political affairs. The focus was primarily on local affairs.<br />However the Progressive movement felt that local party fiefdoms presented roadblocks to addressing the complexities of an industrial society. They called for direct democracy methods such as the referendum to bypass narrow party interests. Their outlook was decidedly national in scope or neo-Hamiltonian.<br />The New Deal saw the ascendancy of the executive branch as the primary branch of government for proposing solutions and for administering a complex and liberal national state. Parties were subordinate to this purpose [see the Roosevelt purge of conservatives]. Johnson's Good Society continued with the New Deal program adding more administratively determined entitlement programs. But the author points out that adaptations were made to this strengthened presidency. Public interest groups comprised of experts represented the various publics' interests. The legal system gained importance in adjudicating those causes. And Congress with a vast proliferation of subcommittees and staff has taken on a secondary watchdog role. But the hugely expansive Presidency still controls public policy.<br />The parties of today are fundraising and marketing bodies. Candidates are recruited to serve the parties' national and administrative purposes. Then the candidates are advertised via the mass media bypassing any remnants of local parties. The average citizen's participation is entirely passive: watch television and cast a ballot.<br />  The author does not advocate for the return of strong locally oriented political parties. Other than achieving higher rates of citizen participation, there is no indication that 19th century style politics could contend with a complex state. It would have been of interest to see speculation about the impact of campaign finance reform on this state of affairs. A mild criticism of the book is that the author seems to lament the passing of local parties without calling for their return or specifying a suitable alternative. But for those interested in democracy, parties, and an effective, modern government, this book will be thought provoking.been of interest to see speculation about the impact of campaign finance reform on this state of affairs.

The delivery of targeted viewers and users to advertisers is the goal of the media giants, not the creation of an informed citizenry. In fact, the author demonstrates that considerable censorship is exercized to prevent views that question the corporate order as well as their own restricted information flows from reaching the public.<br />The author emphasizes that the corporate media system will have to be addressed before democracy stands a chance. But a real quandry exists. Usually an active citizenry requires good information to become energized - the kind that is needed from the very media in need of drastic reform. It is a most unpromising picture.	2000-11-02

But the author does present a very good introduction to COM and ATL COM. He does it in a very orderly and easy to read manner. There is plenty here for the ATL novice. To show that the author presents more than help-file pablum, he digs into the class structure of ATL.<br />I have never given a computer book five stars, but I do this time because the book simply has the right presentation and tone for an introduction. There are no statements that if the reader is not a C++ template guru, he/she has no business reading my book.<br />Having rated the book highly, I will however state that more than one book will be necessary to learn the subject.

She considers rural radicalism as a distinct phenomenon because of the nature of rural life itself. Rural residents, especially the common folk, often endure difficult and even harsh lives. Urbanization, modernization, consumerism, and the rise of huge business interests and bureaucratic government have impacted or have been felt to unduly impact rural residents. Rural people have generally turned inward toward their local communities for support in the face of difficulties. But at different periods in our history these small communities have erupted, often extra-legally, to contend with these various hated forces.<br />The author distinguishes between producer radicalism and vigilantism. The former category is much concerned with economic issues from unfair land laws and practices, distant and unresponsive legislatures, burdensome taxation, judicial favoring of creditors, and monopolistic businesses, especially railroads. The Populists of the late 1800s are the prime example of producer radicals. Vigilantism shares some of these same concerns, but is slanted towards external forces or people who are seen to be a threat to a closed way of life. In some cases, as in pre-revolutionary North Carolina, vigilantes have operated against criminal elements in the absence of effective law enforcement but have been far more likely to identify and inflict harm on scapegoats along racial, ethnic, religious, and political lines. The KKK is perhaps the foremost example of a vigilante group.<br />The author trys to convince that producer radicalism and vigilantism are two sides of the same coin. This reviewer does not find that the case is made. The Populists had legitimate complaints and found responsible ways of expressing them. They did not hate the federal government, even advocating for the nationalization of some industries. Some of their platform was adopted during the Progressive Era. Vigilantes in lieu of operating from any careful analysis of their situation seem to cling to wild conspiracy theories usually involving the federal government and then proceed to select vulnerable victims to assuage their frustrations. These are not the virtuous citizens of producer radicalism.<br />The book is a very good survey of the various rural radical groups through our nation's history. While I do not agree with a central tenet of the book, maybe others would. In any event the book is quite worthwhile.or the nationalization of some industries.

For the author the working class for its own wellbeing must be unified against the predations and exploitations of employers. The book focuses on the historical existence and effectiveness of worker solidarity as primarily exercised through unions.<br />The need for working class solidarity arose as formerly independent craftsmen were forced into a factory system producing for an expansive capitalistic market and in the process lost control of their economic lives. Worker organizations such as the Knights of Labor, the Wobblies, and craft-based unions attempted to address this transformation and the accompanying brutal working conditions. Le Blanc clearly outlines their struggles:  the extreme cyclic nature of late 19th century capitalism undercut worker militancy; racial, ethnic, religious, gender and skill differences undermined solidarity; employers mounted intense and often violent opposition with state support.<br />A main theme of the book is the effect on worker solidarity when union bureaucrats seek accommodation with business or rely on the state for survival. Gompers, first president of the AFL, eschewed worker militance in cooperating with the National Civic Federation and then the Wilson administration during WWI. Later, New Deal labor legislation as elaborated and implemented by the War Labor Board of WWII essentially prohibited workers from any exercise of power on shop-floors. Union leaders demonstrated a willingness to purge dissidents, pandering to red-scare mania, and to enforce contracts that traded economic gains for union members in exchange for unchallenged management control of workplaces - an unspoken social compact that has been shredded in the era of globalization.<br />The author points to some recent developments within and outside the labor movement as a result of the recognition of the poverty of post-WWII labor leadership. But a weakness of the book, since it purports to discuss the working class, is any real feel for the general citizenry's views on the need for worker activism. What have been the effects of consumerism and of the stunted and stilted information provided by media giants on the American public? Overall the book is a reasonably good introduction as to how the working class has fared over the last 150 years.

How did they start? What was/is the social, economic, and political/legal context of unions? But the book is a window into the practicality and realities of unionism since 1877.<br />The author shows that other than for a brief thirty-year period the labor movement has mostly struggled for relevancy, even survival. It is not clear as to the degree of optimism that the author has regarding the completion of the struggle. As a practical matter, a reading of this book leaves little room for optimism.<br />In the absence of great detail, the author focuses on historical &quot;turning points&quot; as markers to indicate the standing and prospects of the labor movement. Among those selected for discussion were the Strike of 1877, the Lawrence Textile Strike of 1912, WWI, the Steel Strike of 1919, the Great Depression, the Wagner Act of 1935, WWII, the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, the PATCO Strike of 1981, and the change in the leadership of the AFL-CIO in the mid-90s. In addition the conflicts and contradictions within the labor movement are well assessed. Basically, the book is a very sobering account of the labor movement.<br />The author acknowledges the next to impossible task of writing a short history of the labor movement because of its complex past, but he has done a very credible and worthy job.	2000-09-21

In lieu of genuine politics the  American public is treated to the corporate media's orchestrated political  charade that sidesteps serious social issues. The media, as the public  relations tool for corporate America, devalues politics and panders to an  historical anti-statism by its incessant focus on scandal, corruption, and  bureaucratic ineffectualness. While big government is critiqued, the impact  of big, trans-national corporations on society never makes it to the table  for discussion.<br />I contend that the author overstates the ideological  commitment to democracy in the past among the general citizenry. He  acknowledges that the liberal-capitalistic order has always operated on the  principles of free markets and individualism and minimal governmental  interference in the economy. The challenge of the Knights of Labor, the  Populists, and the Socialists was the last time that the working class in  America acted politically against the economic order. The fact that  urban-based political machines in the mid-twentieth century were able to  orchestrate get-out-the vote efforts among urban ethnics and union members  over bread and butter issues is not evidence of great political insight.  Many of those voters and their children are now suburbanites and quite  content with their privatized lifestyles of television viewing and  mega-mall shopping, a situation that the corporate order is only too happy  to exploit.<br />The author devotes considerable space to examining various  localized organizations or orientations such as environmentalism,  new-ageism, therapeutic fads, rural militias, and postmodern  intellectualism for their relevance to political activism. He concludes  that the withdrawal from the general public sphere, an enclave mentality,  or the reliance on the transforming power of new consciousness give  hegemonic elites even more space in which to operate.<br />Though I rate the  book at five stars, it is at times tedious and repetitious but it does add  to the debate concerning the viability of politics in the US. The author,  while focusing on the depoliticization of the culture, finds some hope in  the inherent contradictions of capitalist-liberalism. The political charade  that is foisted on the American public does contain the pretense of  participation that could grow in ways that would be distressing to  hegemonic elites.to political activism.

The main point is that it  is the class power of workers as reflected in pro-worker institutions that  insulates unions from market forces such as the business cycle and permits  unions to grow or maintain their standing.<br />This is not a book that makes  an effort to find the historical basis of worker class power: why it exists  in some places but not others. Furthermore, the reader cannot discern from  this study the relative importance of class power as reflected in left  political parties versus that reflected in centralized union structures and  roles. Which way do the arrows of dependency point? Which comes  first?<br />The author does show that those nations that have a strong mix of  pro-worker institutions have been best prepared to withstand the forces of  political conservatism, large unemployment levels, and globalization that  emerged in the 1980s and continue to the present day.<br />The book is  somewhat difficult and tedious to read. Its origin was for a PhD  dissertation. It was assumed that the audience would have a background in  advanced statistics, but there is room for the general reader. Furthermore,  the book largely falls in the category of proving the obvious. At least by  the 1930s it was obvious to all working classes that state and  state-enabled  or -permitted institutions ultimately based on workers'  political power would be essential for their economic well being.  Nonetheless, the book is interesting in its demonstrations of the  importance of institutional power.	2000-05-24

He maintains that most workers &quot;demand&quot; an &quot;individual representation system.&quot; But these claims can been seen as contradicting worker experiences.<br />US workers were finally able to overcome the array of political and economic forces stacked against them with the passage of the Wagner Act in 1935.  Unions thereby interjected themselves into the governance of workplaces and forced the substitution of work rules and formal grievance procedures in place of capricious and unilateral employee relations, and in the process gained a measure of industrial justice for employees.<br />Now, according to Troy, workers don't need those protections. Curiously, the validity and effectiveness of Troy's individual labor relations system is based on the benign and/or self-correcting nature of markets which is a standard argument of laissez-faire capitalists. However, correctly functioning markets require participants who are relatively equal, certainly not subject to coercion like needing a regular paycheck, and can readily obtain adequate information about market workings and opportunities. That requirement is hardly met in US labor markets.<br />In addition, the rationality and newly found goodwill of managers are supposed to assure workers of fair dealings. Yet the huge consulting industry that guides management efforts in avoiding unionization at nearly all costs goes unmentioned by Troy. Due process in this new world of workplace harmony is the old paternalistic &quot;open door&quot; policy. Here the wise manager aids the employee in solving his personal &quot;problems.&quot; This procedure is decidedly not an example of sharing workplace governance.  Neutral arbitration is rejected as an unnecessary interference regardless of any enhanced justice possibilities.<br />Troy seems assured that a firm's investment in employees precludes unfair treatment. He neglects to indicate how wide is the stratum of employees whose value is so great as to be extended that protection. One suspects the coverage would be very narrow.<br />It should be noted, as the author does not, that the preamble to the Wagner Act states that individual employees are at a decided disadvantage in dealing with employers and in fact do not have actual freedom of contract. In addition a primary argument for the Wagner Act was its redistributive effects in maintaining strong economic demand. To Troy any such redistribution is unsound, whereas a distribution that rewards CEOs at rates hundreds of times greater than for workers is unquestioned as natural.<br />Troy's contention that workers overwhelming demand individual representation is not consistent with other contemporary literature. A recently published book, &quot;What Workers Want,&quot; indicates that a majority of workers want actual representation in dealing with management.  While they do not like the adversarialism of union-management dealings, they do not trust management to willingly surrender power in the workplace.<br />Professor Troy's book accurately notes that all is not well with unions.  Beyond the severe decline, many unions exhibit one or more characteristics that are disturbing to workers such as distant and impenetrable bureaucracy, corruption, excessive dues and fees, ineffectiveness, etc.  But, however imperfectly, unions have facilitated the voice of workers.<br />Professor Troy seems to accept the argument that competitiveness in markets supercedes other economic considerations such as workplace fair dealing. But there is nothing sacrosanct about the way markets favor the powerful. The NAFTA and the WTO are mechanisms that alter market balance in favor of investors and corporations. Unions are institutions that attempt to balance power relationships in workplaces as well as various markets.<br />It is a nineteenth century idea that laissez-faire capitalism is an optimum arrangement. America found out the hard way in the Great Depression just how dubious that idea is. Professor Troy does not make the case for substituting a rather nebulously conceived individual representation system for the collective representation of worker interests. His arguments simply fail to understand the empowerment that unions can bring to workers.  Perhaps this book can be read as a reminder as to the fragility of worker rights.eteenth century idea that laissez-faire capitalism is an optimum arrangement.

Several charts and tables detail the following: the stock market boom and  the huge increases in net worth  of those who own the majority of stocks, that is, the rich; the loss of  wages for production workers over the last twenty years;  the rise of debt,  bankruptcies, and college costs; the loss of defined benefit plans; and  reduced savings.<br />This is not a book that attempts to explain these  trends. No mention is made of the reversal of the post-WWII social compact,  the rise of political conservatism, neoliberalism, free trade,  globalization, etc. Without that kind of context there is little basis for  evaluating some short proposals for wealth-gap reduction such as KidSave  Accnts, ESOPs, Individual Development Accnts, USA Accnts, or various types  of wealth taxation.<br />Unless one is just oblivious to wealth gap trends  there would be no reason to buy this book.	2000-04-25

He details the centralization and the conglomeration of the  various media, such as film, broadcasting, cable, books, and internet  providers into about six transnational media firms led by Time Warner,  Disney, ViaCom, and Murdoch's News Corporation. All of these giants have  moved to hyper-commercialism where through constant self-promotion and  innocuous entertainment, especially sports programming, they deliver  predictable, if not affluent, customers to advertisers. Little room is left  for the non-commercial and public affairs programming that stimulates broad  political participation.<br />He details the failure of reformers in the  early 1930s to establish non-profit and public broadcasting terminating in  the Communications Act of 1934. He shows that public broadcasting today has  been forced to rely on advertising revenues and adopt programming that is  largely indistinguishable from for-profit purveyors.<br />The rise of these  media empires is a part of the neo-liberal, free-market, and globalization  pattern of the 1980s and 90s. As part of the anti-regulation mantra, these  firms cynically claim First Amendment rights to be uncensored  (unregulated), which are meant to promote the widest dissemination of ideas  through the press, to have a free hand in limiting and controlling the  information content produced by their employees.<br />The book can get tedious  in the extended detailing of media holdings or in following the various  travails of the reformers in the early broadcasting days. In addition, the  description of how the Internet is likely to fit in the media mix is poorly  drawn, if not highly confusing, with ill-defined terminology. Beyond  describing the reduction in differing views available to the public, this  is not a book that attempts to ascertain the propagandistic effects of the  oligopolistic media message.<br />McChesney's purpose is to convince those on  the left to put media reform at the top of their lists. The media empires  because of their strategic placement to affect public opinion are the front  line troops for the corporate order. However, the position of the media to  filter the flow of information concerning media reform and other leftist  projects is not lost on the author. The book is unconvincing that media  reform is anywhere on the horizon. Nonetheless, the power and the agenda of  the media corporate giants can not be in doubt after reading this book.f the  oligopolistic media message.<br />McChesney's purpose is to convince those on  the left to put media reform at the top of their lists.

But he and his book suffer from an excess  that is no less unappealing.<br /><br />At first, he is mainly concerned in pointing  out that it is politically correct, even in the wider society, to ignore  reverse racial discrimination regardless of its severity. But it is  leftists of whom he was once a card carrying member that he is after. He  denounces their infatuation with the Black Panthers despite their  criminality. He claims that it is in vogue among leading black  intellectuals and leftists to contend that white people are racists simply  by participating in social institutions. He cites one case where a black,  female professor writes about a \\"killing rage\\" over a snafu  concerning an airline seat. But it is unclear as to the extent of the  blindness and reverse hate that he finds. In so far as it exists, Horowitz' book rightly shines light on this excess.<br /><br />But Horowitz wants to go further. He lumps together all leftists as Marxists intent on achieving  equality of condition. No where in the book are there gradations of leftists, such as social democrats or communitarians. He has no tolerance for critiques of capitalism; they all fall into the category of theories of oppression. To analyze the vast inequality that has opened up over the last twenty  years with the commensurate deflation of wages for the working class is regarded as an example of Marxist extremism. Increased dealings with the Chinese are seen only as a policy initiative to personally benefit the President; but the globalizing push by corporate America, especially into China, remains  unmentioned. Horowitz frequently stands by the stated ideals of America: freedom, democracy, etc. But developments such as establishment of media  empires or the severe decline of the labor movement are not juxtaposed with those ideals.<br /><br />In reading Hating Whitey, one never gets a sense of a balanced book. He seems so interested in identifying all of his former leftist cronies and skewering them that he fails to see the legitimate political views and concerns of working- and middle-class citizens who may be on the left but are not on the faculties of liberal arts colleges intent on furthering an anti-US radical agenda. Also, it never becomes clear as to the reason for his complete break with the left; lots of middle ground exists between where Horowitz was and now is.eading Hating Whitey, one never gets a sense of a balanced book.

Professionals, managers, and executives acquire an empowering literacy that  emphasizes evaluation, analysis, and synthesis in contrast to the  functional literacy that is taught in working-class schools which leads to  routine, non-creative work and diminished social role. It is Finn's mission  to empower working-class kids through changes in the educational system  that will create, what he calls, literacy with an attitude.<br />Finn arranges  schools along a line including working-class, middle-class,  affluent-professional, and executive elite schools.<br />Working-class schools  are strictly teacher-directed emphasizing order and discipline. The subject  matter is largely fragmented facts with  little relevance to working-class  lives. An uneasy standoff exists between derogatory teachers and reluctant  students.<br />Middle-class students also have minimal input to the  educational process but see the value in the information in textbooks and  teachers' efforts. Anxiety-producing testing is emphasized but is accepted  as essential for success in white-collar jobs. Competency is the goal, not  creativity.<br />It is only in affluent-professional and executive-elite  schools where empowering literacy is found. Students are able to  participate in planning their own education. Creativity and problem solving  take precedence over getting the facts right. The executive-elite schools  stress academic excellence and the exercise of control. The  affluent-professional schools are more wide-ranging and even willing to  critique the social status-quo.<br />Finn finds that working-class culture  itself has an impact in school settings. The dominant form of communication  is implicit which relies on unspoken, shared opinions and beliefs. However,  success in schools is dependent on the ability to fully use language. Also,  working-class parents tend to emphasize obedience in younger children, not  exploration. But constrained personalities can be at some disadvantage in  settings where personal initiative is key for success, as in good  schools.<br />So working class culture itself must be overcome to gain equal  footing with articulate elites. But the Finn mission of extricating  working-class kids from dead-end schools is fraught with other  contradictions and difficulties.<br />It is difficult to understand Finn's  claim that \\"the savage inequalities in schools are not the result of a  conspicuous conspiracy to oppress the working class.\\" It is Finn that  describes the  suppression of the fledgling corresponding societies in 1790  England who had a mission to empower the English working class via the  extension of literacy. He further shows that a main factor in establishing  public education was to control the working class. Why wouldn't the same  sort of policies deployed by many levels of  government and supported by  business interests against the American labor movement throughout most of  its history be reflected in the public education of the working class?<br />Finn proposes that \\"transforming\\" intellectuals who see schools as sites  of social struggle for the working class will initiate change. He does not  clearly address where sufficient numbers of these agents for change can be  found. Nor does he explain why their actions would be tolerated by school  officials and the larger society. It is somewhat disturbing to see proposed  the use of children to achieve a social agenda.<br />It is unclear as to  whether Finn fully appreciates the individualizing that occurs in the elite  schools. It is individual creativity and excellence that is developed. But  in Finn's new working-class schools, students become \\"collective\\" actors  for social change. Is student  solidarity equivalent to maximizing  education? Where would the new schools fit among his school models?<br />A  glaring piece that is missing from the book is the location and numbers of  the various types of schools that he describes. One can only  speculate  that the middle-class school model predominates in the US. That data is  necessary to get a handle on the feasibility and relevance  of his  proposal.<br />Finn's book ultimately does not come to grips with the  contradictions within the working class itself as well as the demands of  capitalism.  Despite an  emphasis on social class in the book, Finn does  very little to acknowledge that working class education occurs within and  is shaped by capitalistic class relations. And what he proposes would have  ramifications for those relations. Capitalism does not require extensive  education for most of its workers. Somehow the reader gets the feeling that  close to an invisible hand is going to guide working- class students to  empowerment nirvana despite the real obstacles noted.piece that is missing from the book is the location and numbers of  the various types of schools that he describes.

More of the myth is that workers do not find it necessary to participate in politics and they view capitalism kindly.<br />His means of making his case is to follow the various ups and downs of the shiploaders of Philadelphia and the culinary workers of New York City from 1913 into the 1930s. He clearly shows that when workers are strategically located and can control the relevant labor market that they can extract concessions from employers as long as those advantages remain. In both cases the fortunes of workers rose and fell many times.<br />A weakness of the book is that it does not explore the ramifications to workers' lives to operate in a direct action mode. What sort of hardships were endured and what were the effects on workers' thinking about capitalistic relations? The claim that in their actions lies class consciousness is not convincing. Obviously some solidarity is needed to effect a strike, but it seems fairly evident that the actions of the workers represented mostly a realistic assessment of their situation and of the best means to achieve economic gains. The actions of the workers could in no sense be termed revolutionary; they are presented in the context of a contest of economic wills within US capitalism.<br />There is no doubt that class consciousness would have to exist in a capitalistic society for the working class to make permanent headway. In many social democracies, workers have expressed themselves through political parties. That has not occurred in the US. The author does not mention that adverse judicial rulings of that era could be a reason that the political route was not taken by US workers. The IWW viewed direct action as a way of transforming capitalistic relations, but the author demonstrates that workers had little interest in IWW ideology.<br />Other than a few passing comments, the reader is hard-pressed to determine any applicability to the present era.  Industrial relations have been completely transformed in the US with the passage of the NLRA and the rulings of the NLRB and the courts since the era under discussion. Furthermore, working class culture has embraced consumerism as the operant ideology. One wonders whether the author would like to mount an argument for worker class consciousness at this point in history. One suspects that such an argument would be even less convincing than one from the early 1900s.

Clearly a class state exists that enforces the subordination of the working class to  capitalist owners as well as other inequalities. Also, the extant rhetoric  of equal opportunity merely reinforces the inequality of starting  points.<br />The author discusses a hypothetical meritorious equality that is  based on the common humanity of all and a recognition of the equality of  most contributions to society that then should result in near equality of  reward. A democratic state would have to be a major player in maintaining  this equality by, for example, being the employer of last resort for any  who desired to work.<br />The author is unconvincing in attempting to describe  the New Deal order with the rise of industrial unions as the forerunner to  his strong equal opportunity society. That era of accommodation proved to  be short-lived. Now capital has reasserted itself and the rhetoric of the  free market is ascendent. Consideration of equality and social justice is  not part of the politics of resentment and greed.<br />The book is somewhat  dissatisfying because its difficult to get a handle on the propspects for  equality and what it would entail using present day reality as a starting  point. Are we talking remade men here? The author seems to lurch back and  forth across the line of feasibility or even the current existence of  equality. As a mostly theoretical book on equality no effort is made to  compare an equality society with, say, an existing social democratic  society. Its just hard to get a good feel for the substance and  significance of this book.	1999-10-06

Gitlin finds that the &quot;common dream&quot; of what it means to be an American deteriorated with the unraveling of the New Left of the 1960s and the ascendance of identity politics.  But as a founder of the SDS he makes  way too much of the New Left and the impact of their breakup on common  dreams.<br />The formative bases of America: anti-monarchial and minimalist  government and rough equality among land-owning, farming citizens have not  been relevant since the Civil War. The advance of industrialism and the  rise of huge, powerful private concerns ripped asunder that idyllic world.  The Knights of Labor, the Populists, and the Socialists tried to mount  challenges to these changes and really represent the only challenges to  that new order. The union drives of the 30s and 40s were interested in  getting a piece of the pie, not fundamental change.<br />The middle class and  rich kids of the 60s that led the protests against the excesses of American  foreign policy in Vietnam did serve as a useful corrective to the arrogance  of the United States. But in no way did the 60s protest change the common  dream. As Gitlin himself points out consumerism replaced citizenship as the  American dream easily by the 1920s.<br />Gitlin is right to say that identity  politics detracts from a common purpose. But the significance of those  movements pale in comparison to the dominance of the corporate order in  remaking and controlling the direction of the world and national orders.  There is no Left or whomever that is being drowned out or replaced by  identity voices.<br />This reviewer found Gitlin's book difficult to  understand at times. He clearly wants a commons reestablished but one is  left with a rather murky view of what that is or should be and how it will  happen given no Left, identity politics, and global economic forces.	1999-09-26

But only activism, or social involvement, is consistent with our democracy  and can result in psychological or spiritual growth.  The nature or the  scope of the cause to be pursued is basically secondary next to the  soul-enhancing nature of activism.<br />Loeb tells the story of about  twenty-five citizens who reacted against some sort of economic or political  situation that was thrust upon them by enlisting the aid of other citizens  to combat the situation. Loeb is concerned with showing that imperfect  knowledge and starting small can effect change. He stresses that activists  must be patient, that success may be slow, that support is needed, and that  burnout can easily occur.<br />Loeb trys to link his activists with social  movements from the past. But the kinds of systemic change that concerned  the Knights of Labor, the Populists, the Wobblies, and the Socialists  around the turn of the century are not what the activists that Loeb  profiles are all about. In fact, Loeb eschews the detailed critiques of  society that those historical groups produced. While Loeb contends that  structural changes are needed for our society, he downplays the need to  develop the kind of expertise needed to engage in that level of  change.<br />Loeb speaks of the isolating tendencies of television, but says  nothing about its potential as a propaganda tool to get across a particular  message or to limit the free exchange of ideas. His talk of the village  square seems strange in an era of corporate-controlled media and the  pseudo village squares of suburban mega-malls. Loeb talks about \\"our\\"  choices that cause economic harm which neatly obscures the central role of  the huge private concerns that dictate economic policy in this country.  Loeb's failure to address large and controlling forces in our  society  gives the impression that piecemeal acts by randomly placed activists have  a greater impact than they really do.<br />Soul of a Citizen has the feel of a  self-help book. If one is feeling down about some aspect of society, most  any form of activism will help  alleviate that personal distress. But for  those who accept ideas about a \\"web of domination\\" in society, piecemeal  actions may not be so  satisfying. Of course, Loeb is quick to label those  folks as cynics. That is why Soul of a Citizen only marginally contributes  to the dialog of significant change.ion that piecemeal acts by randomly placed activists have  a greater impact than they really do.<br />Soul of a Citizen has the feel of a  self-help book.

This book reveals clearly how thin was the veneer of the  labor-management accord after WWII. Phelps Dodge saw an opportunity to bust  their unions and aided by labor law, labor law officials, and law  enforcement departments did so. This book is strongest in its depiction of  personalities but is weakest in putting this entire episode in a larger  perspective. Rosemblum casts doubt on the unions understandings and  strategies in this strike of 1983. But what is missing is any broad attempt  to frame this labor conflict in context of the political understandings and  power of the American working class in general. Why are the anti-labor  biases of labor law officials, judges, and law enforcement officials  tolerated in this country? Do most working poeple support these biases? Do  they not know that they exist or consider them to be irrelevant? Do they  support union-busting? If not, are they powerless to elect pro-worker  Congressmen and change labor laws? Union actions and community  understandings take place in these unanswered contexts. The book is highly  readable but one is left primarily with sympathy for the mostly Chicano  workers who had their lives uprooted and not with a broader understanding  of labor relations other than the obvious capability of a company with an  extreme anti-union animus to carry out its will.	1999-07-10

But the authors in this book would  find that the top-down and staff directed nature of those efforts only  minimally overlap with rank-and-file democracy. They feel that actual  rank-and-file empowerment within union processes is the only way for the  labor movement to regain its former stature. But many questions do arise.  None of the authors clearly differentiate between worker democracy within  local unions and democracy over workplace affairs. The NLRA restriction to  bargaining over wages and conditions has proven to be disastrous to working  people. But labor activists and these authors seem to accept this limited  role for unions. But that is hiring-hall unionism where jobs may last only  a few weeks and larger company strategies are mostly irrelevant. Most  working people are firm-located and need to have input to company plans  regarding investment, marketing, products, plant closings and locations,  etc. If that is company unionism, so be it. Also, the authors point to a  nebulous concept of social unionism as a desired path for unions. The fact  of the matter is that in the past larger community support for unions was  because working people at one time lived in highly localized ethnic, urban  communities or small company oriented towns. Many of those communites no  longer exist. The authors have confused unions with a political party that  is devoted to the social interests of the entire working class. National  unions in the U.S. are really very narrowly focused businesses: they  collect dues, actively try to increase membership, and provide bargaining  and contract administrative services. And are very concerned with survival  for their own sake. Since the authors have made rank-and-file democracy  their central concern, it is a shortcoming of the book that no comparative  analysis of the industrial relations system of a northern European country  where workers have legislated co-determination rights was included . The  bottom line for this book is that it is well worth reading. It is not a  rubber stamp of Sweeney policy. But this book leaves plenty of room for  considering what the structure and policies of unions should be for the  coming century that will enhance and protect the economic lives of working  people.rative  analysis of the industrial relations system of a northern European country  where workers have legislated co-determination rights was included .

The heart of the book is in three chapters: 10-12  that describe the basics of VB classes, interfaces, polymorphism,  delegation, collections, etc with good examples. The first part of the book  is an overview of an application design process. The last part of the book  provides only very brief discussions of many topics such as ActiveX  Controls, DHTML, IIS, etc. But the book is not consistent in its level and  completeness. This book is not for experienced VB programmers - but the  assumption of knowledge concerning components and data/DB design makes the  design section of questionable utility for inexperienced VB programmers.  Who is this section for? But the intro to VB objects is right-on for the  relative newcomer. Kurata leaves her topic of VB ActiveX components far too  quickly. Her coverage of ActiveX EXE components leaves a lot to be desired  with the explanations and ramificaations of the various project settings  being no better than the fragmentary tidbits of online help. Examples have  ceased at this point. The frustrating, obscure, and important subject of  threading and apartments that lurks beneath VB EXE components is covered no  better, if as well, as numerous other authors who claim to do so. I think a  better book is in Kurata based on the promise of the heart of the book.  Undoubtedly the superficial nature of the last of the book was a cave-in to  the buzz-word, marketing types. Until someone can produce a coherent,  complete, and readable book on ActiveX components for VB programmers [and  there is not one on the market], the programming community will have to  rely on unsatisfactory MS or MS-aided articles that give us  &quot;clever&quot; or &quot;ingenious&quot; ways of achieving programming  tasks beyond the ordinary. At this point VB is one of the most  &quot;trial-and-error&quot; tools available. Hopefully that is not because  of its internal incoherence. If not, we do not need &quot;tricks&quot;  articles.or&quot; tools available. Hopefully that is not because  of its internal incoherence.

It would be amazing to this reviewer how anyone could walk away after reading this book and believe that they have gained anything but the most cursory and  scattered explanation of what underlies VB ActiveX DLLs and EXEs (ActiveX  Controls not covered). Only the most superficial details, if any at all,  are presented concerning virtual base classes, class factories, proxies, or  stubs.

Perhaps one can take solace  in having picked up some computer buzz words. This book does not  discriminate against VB programmers in providing mystical explanations.  Even for a person steeped in C++/Win32 the explanations are simply  inadequate. For example take the notion of apartments. The author starts  mildly enough with good old Win32 processes and threads and then jumps into  an admittedly  artificial COM construct called an apartment. If there is a  coherent tie-in to processes and threads it is undetectable to this  reviewer. Does it mean something to say that a thread &quot;enters&quot; an  apartment? Is a thread a little man? Not one line of sample code is  presented. Not one underlying Win32 API call that COM may use is detailed.  This is definitely explanation light. But it can be said that the book is  not without merit. It is just not what it purports to be. The actual use of  Implements, TypeOf, &amp; CreateObject keywords is shown and discussed. The  book is also somewhat informative on N-tier business solutions using MTS.  The author states that his background in C++ and COM is of very recent  vintage. Further, he learned at the right hand of a well-known COM guru. A  suggestion for the next book. Take the draft on the road and find out what  real-world programmers can really learn from the book. What gurus think of  a book is mostly useless.ook is mostly useless.	1999-03-01

This book is a collection of essays by labor union leaders and their academic supporters that attempt to find and describe methods by which unions can reverse their downward trend of some forty years. The articles  range from hopeful exhortations to descriptions of actual union programs. A  widespread theme is the need for a transformation of unions from a  servicing mode to an organizing mode. In addition, labor-community or  cross-border labor-labor alliances are considered to be essential  strategies for unions. But these initiatives do invite questions.  For  one, in some of these essays the concept of community is more wishful than  realistic. As one of the essayists points out, there has been a devastating  scattering of the American working class into the vast suburbs that  surround US cities. No longer are there cohesive worker communities that  are ready to agitate for their neighbors whose place of work is on the next  block. But more practically, some of the authors conceive of communities as  those workers who are employed in the same industry with a commonality of  interests, such as the telecommunications industry. Other authors are  willing to limit worker commuities to minority, inner-city neighborhoods.  According to all of the authors the key to the renewal of organized labor  is through rank-and-file activism or mobilization in an organizing model of  unionism. But these articles show that the organizing model demands even  greater numbers of union staffers and rather nebulous reliance on  rank-and-filers. Several authors are concerned with the shallowness of  mobilization and union contract campaigns.  One fact is clear from  the articles: labor unions are in a survival mode; they need millions of  additional dues-paying members. To that end the articles show that the  rhetoric of community and mobilization can help in recruitment. But no  article attempts to assess the degree to which these union initiatives have  influenced the thinking of the nine in ten private-sector workers who are  not in unions.  The subject of labor's drastic decline is only  minimally touched upon in these articles. Large questions, such as whether  the labor relations system in the US that organized labor is intent on  preserving is viable for the 21st century, are not asked. But for those who  have no voice in their places of work and are not likely to regardless of  labor's efforts, such questions are highly relevant.  These essays are  worth reading for anyone interested in seeing where unions and their  supporters believe they are, where they want to go, and what steps they  propose to take or are taking to get there. **Note:** Disregard any earlier  review from this reviewer.g of the nine in ten private-sector workers who are  not in unions.

The motivation is the reversal of the sagging fortunes of labor unions.<br /><br />Many of the  articles focus on the need for grassroots activity by existing union  members and community supporters. Several union campaigns utilizing members  are examined in detail. Union support organizations such as the Garment  Women Justice Center are described. Serveral articles examine subtleties of  the motivations of non-unionists to vote for a union.<br /><br />An interesting  observation is that white collar and technical workers are turned off by  the potential for conflict when joining a union, which is interesting in  light of the fact that unions have always relied on confrontation as their  tool of last resort.<br /><br />The main point of the editors is that union  tactics and actions make a large difference in organizing success. The  second point is that unions must remake themselves into organizing bodies  and avail themselves of the wisdom contained in these articles.<br /><br />But for  non-union insiders reading this book, many chinks appear when looking at  the articles in totality. For example, one article shows that belonging to  two community organiztions lowers the desire to join a union, yet many  articles tout labor-community coalitions. In one case where community  connections were leveraged to the fullest to win a union contract, it is  admitted that may have been a one-time occurrence.<br /><br />A large and  confusing point that leaps out from these articles is, just what is a union. Is it a centralized business that collects fees from subsidiaries,  demands adherence to policies from the CEO, and provides services? Or is a  union a legally recognized association of workers at a locale that  affiliates with a national body but retains sovereignty?<br /><br />Statements that  workers \\"are\\" the union hide more than they reveal. If workers  are the union, can they insist that national unions remain committed to a  servicing model? If workers are the union, how can some national unions  literally require local unions to focus on recruitment? Claiming that  workers are the union can be a demotivator for joining a union. After all,  it is workers who have unsuccessfully dealt with employers on their own  that want to join unions; now they want support, not abandonment.<br /><br />The  editors and authors may complain that this book is not about \\"what is  a union,\\" but is only about subtle strategy. If so, they need to put a  \\"Nonunionists need not read\\" label on the cover. Actually the  book is worth reading by all interested in the situation of labor not only  on its educational merits but also for the questions that it can engender  for non-insiders. Who knows, maybe their next book can be \\"What is a  Union.\\"n, can they insist that national unions remain committed to a  servicing model?

US	52280224	R3SBXF0LGOOMKR	0853459290	238801472	Why Unions Matter	Books	4	26	46	N	N	For some, unions matter; for most, unions are an irrelevancy	Yates does present a good basic review of the trials and tribulations and the benefits of unions over the last century or so. But there is much disingenuity in this book. He points out that much of the basis of early  unions was an urban-based solidarity of workers who lived, worshipped, and  worked in close proximity in the early decades of the 20th century. He  calls for a renewed, if not similar, solidarity among mainstream workers  today; but the demographics of US workers and the structure of industries  are far different. The closest example today of old time solidarity may be  the relationship of black churches and neighborhoods and municipal workers.  Other than workers from union families and left-liberal college professors,  most US workers in many segments of the economy don't have a clue about  unions and what they know is negative. His calls for worker activism in the  political process and within workplaces have to be reconciled with the  reality of political apathy and workplace authority. That is the ground  that must be tilled for solidarity. For the one in ten workers that are in  unions, the NLRA and NLRB and well as union officialdom probably contain  and constrain as much as empower workers. For example, changing national  union affiliation is not viewed with equanimity. Yates is too accepting of  US-style unionism; for example German-style works councils could have been  contrasted with US unions in terms of giving workers agency. Also, it seems  that Yates derives far too much satisfaction from the fact that the AFL-CIO  will now talk to left-liberal academics. He needs to appreciate better that  the activists of bygone eras were generated from within the working class  which reflected an inherent understanding of their class condition. How  many Americans today even have a notion of class? As stated, Yates' book  does a good job of showing the state of AFL-CIO unionism. But the book  would not be satisfying for those who have critically examined that  terrain.	1999-01-24

Books	4	1	2	N	Y	Buchanan's tariff panacea is insufficient	There is no doubt that working class Americans have suffered over the last twenty-five years at the hands of US trade policy and the behavior of transnational corps (TNCs). But Buchanan's claim that the 1865-1913 high  tariff era was some golden era for workers is at best disingenuous. He  seems to believe that high tariffs automatically make for a better life for  all. But the distribution of economic benefits is not so simple. It was the  high union densities in the three decades after the Wagner Act of 1935 that  brought industrial workers into mainstream America. But Buchanan never  mentions worker rights to form unions or works councils, bargain with  employers, or receive adequate compensation when a TNC moves overseas to  capture windfall profits. He also focuses primarily on government trade  policy as the problem for working poeple, largely sparing the worker  slicing actions of TNCs. And he only minimally addresses the fact that TNCs  have immense control over governmental economic policy. But despite these  shortcomings, Buchanan rightly excoriates free trade which is nothing more  than double-talk for worker exploitation. His program of tariffs if  combined with calls for citizen and worker empowerment to influence their  economic destiny could move Buchanan into the category of genuine populist.  But he is not there yet.	1999-01-19

The Wagner Act neatly bottled up,  with union acquiescence, worker unrest and power to influence US industry.  As Aronowitz shows, the limitations of that accord were revealed early on  in the failed Southern organizing drives and the passage of the  Taft-Hartley Act. But that was then. Now one has to wonder if the notion of  a &quot;labor movement&quot; has any real meaning. Is there a recognizable  philosophy of labor or worker empowerment in the general public's  consciousness. I don't think so. Yes unions have hung on in some industries  and teachers, whose situation in terms of public and contract-based  employment is unlike that found in the private sector, have hidden the  overall decline of unions. Also unions in this age of extremely small voter  turnouts that can mobilize a dedicated minority can influence some  elections much as can the Christian right. But those have been mostly  defensive victories: elect the least conservative of two. One of  Aronowitz's key suggestions is the organizing of the huge numbers of  professional-technical and white collar workers. But that seems to be  mostly hope. Many (probably most) of those folks accept all of the negative  stereotypes of unions. Aronowitz briefly mentions European-style works  councils, but US unions aren't about to allow that. There just is not much  in this book, as well as in scores of others written since John Sweeney  took over the helm of the AFL-CIO, that is a realistic assessment of the  possibility of going from point A (corporate dominance of the economy and  politics) to point B (genuine worker influence within enterprises and the  overall economy and political process).	1999-01-13

Obviously much research has  gone into detailing names of key players and the sequence of events. But  this book is supposed to be about industrial democracy. While it is  stressed that the term &quot;industrial democracy&quot; came to the fore  during this period, there is limited coverage of why this is so and the  nature of any industrial democracy that may have been established. No where  in the book is there a detailed look at how industrial democracy worked in  an actual place of work. Many obvious questions are left unanswered. How  widespread was any such industrial democracy? How did the typical worker or  the media react to the concept? How did shop committees and trade unions  interact? Also, it is unclear as to what the author's claims are regarding  industrial democracy's lasting effects. He clearly shows that employers  dominated the ERP's of post-WWI. The New Deal intervention in labor affairs  was clearly not one of instituting democracy. McCartin does indicate that  labor relations of the current period seem to have come almost full circle  to some form of 19th century thinking. Basically, McCartin's book seems to  indicate that &quot;industrial democracy,&quot; whatever that was, was not  much more than a blip on the screen of labor history. His book needed to  focus far more on just what industrial democracy is and its difficulties  and transience in real working peoples lives as well as an institution. The  role of the AFL in stifling industrial democracy is given insufficient  weight.	1999-01-04

Obviously, Don Box is a COM and C++ master, which is where the problem  lies. Admittedly, he does cover many aspects of COM quite extensively. The  first chapter is the best background material on COM that I have read. But  thereafter, Box changes his approach. He then seems to lapse into  gratuitous, uncontollable programming razzle-dazzle when covering COM  topics. His multi-page macros are just plain confusing and distracting.  [Who is his intended audience: COM neophytes or his COM cronies?] His  explanations concerning his use of the subtleties of C++ are entirely too  feeble. While COM is at heart a subtle C++ application, surely programming  virtuosity can be de-emphasized when explaining COM basics. His examples  have questionable utility. However, again, his book does fill in some of  the gaps of COM that other books gloss over. But I'm still waiting for that  five-star book on COM.	1998-09-30
