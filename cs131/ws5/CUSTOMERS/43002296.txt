Its great spark was over the question of Georgia and the Great Russian nationalist approach Stalin and his henchmen took against the heroic communists and people of Georgia. This is quite important as in this discussion Lenin developed a policy similar to affirmative action in the accompanying works by Lenin on that national question. The other front was over the encroaching bureaucracy who aimed at smothering the revolution, and against the idea that this was simply an administrative task involving better organization rather than the social struggle Lenin saw this as, to bring 'workers from the bench' as he said into the struggle. Finally, this became a struggle to remove Stalin from command of the party to block his crude bureaucratic threats against Lenin himself. These documents were suppressed in the Soviet Union during the Stalin decades, but published by Trotsky and other supporters of real Leninism in the 1920s and 1930s. The introduction and glossary and notes make the issues understandable. With the former Soviet Union and China still ruled by the old Stalinist clique of bureaucrats, now mixed with naked profiteers and gangsters (not that the bureaucrats were anything other than profiteers and gangsters themselves back to the days Lenin and Trotsky battled them), the origins of their struggle, and the direction needed to preserve the goals of working people are clear. Stalinism didn't grow out of a life and death struggle against Leninism. It was not for nothing that Stalin murdered almost every member of the Lenin's central committee. It was not for nothing that the big business governments of the US, Britain, and France favored Stalin's victory in this struggle. They wanted to kill the great October revolution that Lenin and Trotsky presided over. We should read this to understand the struggles of another revolution, still following Lenin's example to try to lead workers and oppressed nations to freedom, the Cuban Revolution. The discussions here and in Lenin and Trotsky's work (see the struggle of the Left Opposition series of Trotsky's writings) are almost identical to the discussion that Che Guevara raised against Stalinist models in Cuba, and that Fidel and other Cuban leaders have raised to fight bureaucracy and procapitalist forces in Cuba over the past 20 years. This struggle lives.<br /><br />Also recommended: Che Guevara Speaks, History of the Russian Revolution, Changing Face of US Politics, Revolution Betrayed<br /><br />|lin murdered almost every member of the Lenin's central committee.

This book is a rich, sometimes moving, sometimes enraging trip to a land that more and more millions of people in the US inhabit. The world where you work minimum wage or little better jobs, with no benefits, often no vacations, no union representation, and often no respect for your personal dignity. Scores of millions of people work these jobs. And everywhere else from Universities to coal mines, management is trying to push workers with more rights, pay and benefits back into the conditions of these workers.<br /><br />Ehrenreich's gift here is that she focuses as much on how this effects the hearts and spirits of the workers she meets and lives among, as she does the economics, or the physical difficulties.  She is very honest about what was rough and what was too rough for her to take.<br /><br />  It is an inditement of the culture of this country, that this excellent book is one of the only ways you can learn about this life.  No one should miss this. Moreover, instead using condemning these workers as immigrants who should not be here, unintelligent, or shiftless folks, we should read this book to see how the same difficulties and more were the lot of this Ph. D and powerful intellectual in great physical shape for her age.<br /><br />It is not some kind of ignorance that makes the lives of these workers so miserable, but corporate policies designed to continue their exploitation as well as the complicty of the big business controled government.<br /><br />Ehrenreich's visit to minimum wage world has its limitations, but those limitations emphasize how much more difficult this world is to live in, than the bleak picture she paints in this wonderful book.<br /><br />  Ehrenreich isn't permanently anchored to the jobs she works unlike scores of millions of workers in this this country.  She can always get back to her life. She take lengthy breaks to return to her life as a well-paid lecturer, writer, and general social democratic whiz. She  relys on her regular personal network of friends and family and a distant boy-friend for emotional support. She worked too short in jobs and quit several times when things got to be too much for her.<br /><br />The real world she explores is permanent for tens of millions of workers in this country. The same trends are taking place in the industrialized countries of Western Europe and Japan, in some places quicker than here, and some places slower.<br /><br />  Most people outside of the working class are ignorant of this world and its divisions.  Someone here thinks the UPS workers are in this world. But, No one in the low wage, or even high paid working class, would confuse UPS workers with low wage unorganized workers that Ehrenreich talks about. UPS workers are protected by one of the best Teamster contracts other than MasterFreight--a contract earned by a hard-fought and successful strike several years ago. UPS workers probably start at around 15 or 16 bucks an hour with full medical and dental benefits and regular vacations and sick time.<br /><br /> I have a good friend who was in an awful auto accident who was flat out told by his doctors that had he not been protected by the full medical benefits that the Teamsters had won for him, that they could not have brought him back to being able to walk and function on his own. That's the essential thing. None of these workers in the places Ehrenreich works are unionized, one of the key factors that Ehrenreich rightly points to in creating these problems.<br /><br />Ehrenreich illustrates what the job market is for many if not most workers without skills, particularly if you are older, particularly if you are not hooked up with family, friends, or if your friends or family are in the same or worse condition you are.  She also shows the basic crisis that exists in regard to housing which yields not only homelessness, but the floating working homeless who live in cars or run down motels.<br /><br />Her point isn't how to avoid this. Ehrenreich has already done this by gaining a Ph. D. in biology and becoming one of the country's top writers on social issues.  Her goal is to show how a larger and larger percentage of workers live and are exploited and oppressed.<br /><br />She's not talking about anything exceptional but what is becoming the rule in employment. After all, one of her worst examples is when she worked for Walmart,THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE UNITED STATES IF NOT THE WORLD.  She also wrote in a time of economic boom and labor shortage. In fact, she sought out areas where there was a job shortage and where living conditions were supposed to be more affordable than elsewhere.<br /><br />She's not talking about making 6 bucks an hour in 1978, but in the late 90s. I can remember working in a now-defunct department store where other employees envied the fact that I made $4.50 an hour. Like Ehrenreich, I couldn't imagine what the single mothers working throughout the store did to make ends meet, though they were doing the kind of work Ehrenreich did at Walmart. Every Thursday when the hours for employees were posted around the time clock, I would see some of these women begging and even crying to the supervisor for more time for more hours, because nobody in the store except the automechanics made 40 hours a week.<br /><br />  Ehrenreich's book also gives a face to how many occupations once done by professionals or even owners of their own business are now industrialized, done by national, and international corporations who study how to reduce the work force to its most atomised, hard worked, and least paid.  Gone is the neighborhood store owned by someone from the neighborhood, and who but the very well off does their shopping any more in stores that can afford to have professional sales people who make a decent living who have time to learn something about the products they sell to wait on you.  Gone for the most part are the mom and pop restaurants and diners operated by a family.<br /><br />  They are replaced by operations where everything an employee does is timed, controlled, and disciplined with one thought in mind, maximizing profits and minimizing the rights and dignity and independence of the work force.<br /><br />  Yet, this is no natural process of modernization like the car replacing the horse and buggy. It is part of a bipartisan social war, the same social war that has resulted in the greatest concentration of wealth in the hands of the big business owners in the history of this country, the same bipartisan social war that has reduced the minimal social benefits that once existed.  In a series of industries like the airlines, Western coal, and meat packing, a constant campaign has been waged to change the status of workers, their pay, their benefits, and to oust unions.<br /><br /> If workers think that their vaunted skills are what keeps their wages high, they should look at the airlines. Despite the highly-skilled techinically demanding nature of airline jobs,  management is constant drive to push back unionization, pay, and benefits in the airlines. The airlines have even tried to end end the professional status of pilots. As it is today they are shunting more and more flights onto non-union affiliates where pilots receive lower wages.<br /><br /> Even in college teaching, which I do part-time, the same process has taken place in the past 20 years.  At most universities and colleges, you are very lucky if an undergraduate student gets taught by an actual tenured professor who has job security, benefits, and a professional salary. They are more likely to be taught by graduate assistants who get paid not much more than the people Ehrenreich describes and who have to have extra jobs to live or by adjunct professors (which I do).  An Adjunct is just a fancy word for a temp with no job security, no benefits, and no hope of ever getting a permanent teaching job. What professors did twenty years ago to become heads of their departments, oreven deans at their universities, are now being attempted by newly minted Ph. Ds and MFAs in the often vain hope of getting a starter job. Indeed, most full-time professors I know  at the college I teach at take on extra classes at our college or others to make ends meet.<br /><br />  The real question involved is unionization and political action. Working people have to fight back against the social and economic war against us.  Whether a job pays well has nothing to do with the amount of skill involved. Ehrenreich shows that most low paid jobs she worked require significant skills.<br /><br /> Good paying jobs with benefits are a result of unionization. Truck drivers before the great Teamster organization drives of the 1930s, Autoworkers before the UAW organized the big three in the 1930s and 1940s, and railroad workers before the great organizing drives led by Eugene V Debs at the end of the 19th Century used to be considered low-paid jobs done by dumb workers who didn't deserve benefits or consideration. People who worked in stores or restaurants like Ehrenreich did in her book were then considered of higher status and pay.<br /><br />Things are different now, only because of unionization.  For those liberals who think that this is all due to some satanic evil embodied in Bush, I remind you that Ehrenreich's experience took place during the Clinton \\"boom.\\"<br /><br />  Of course, the Teamsters, the autoworkers, and the rail workers weren't unionized by the kind of business unionism most unions practice today. They didn't organize themselves by depending on the Democratic and Republican politicians or by trying to \\"get along\\" with management.<br /><br />They were organized by mobilizing the masses of working people in and out of these industries for political, economic, and sometimes physical battle with the corporations and the police and government that stood behind them. They were organized by reaching out to the unemployed, to immigrants, to minorities, to farmers, to young people outside of these industries and showing that the fight for the union advanced their cause.<br /><br />  This is what we need today.nd disciplined with one thought in mind, maximizing profits and minimizing the rights and dignity and independence of the work force.

Of course, attempting to balance the study, Dower also points to how racist attitudes toward other Asian peoples were propogated to justifty Japanese imperialism's brutal exploitation of the areas it conquered.  All of this emphasizes how racism is really a fundamental aspect of the modern imperialist order, not some aberration left from another time.<br /><br />  What is sensational here is the documenting not only of the racist explanation of the war by the United States and Britain, but his detailing of atrocities carried out against the Japanese by the US and its allies in the Pacific.  Indeed, the general explanation of the Pacific war, not as a war for democracy, but as a war to maintain the supremacy of the \\"White race\\" was such a strong part of popular, political, and even academic discourse that experts on Asia like novelist Pearl Buck and Chinese/American author Lin Yuitang, believed the US was headed for a confrontation with all non-white peoples in Asia and Africa, not just Japan.<br /><br />  Worse, Dower documents the many atrocities carried out against Japanese civilians and prisoners during the war. While much is made of Japanese soldiers fighting to the death, Dower explains one reason for this is that US and British troops rarely took Japanese prisoners during most of the war.  He notes not only where Japanese troops slaughtered without quarter, but a public--as in on the cover of Life magazine as what a soldier boy sends his girl friend home--trade in Japanese sculls and golden teeth from Japanese soldiers--sometimes taken out before the soldiers were dead--blossomed in the early years of the war.  Dower quotes one US general who said he wished such atrocities were not carried out, as it stiffened resistance by Japanese soldiers and civilians.<br /><br />  Dower also points to the racist justification that the Japanese used to justify their exploitation of their Asian conquests. It is interesting how he shows their debt to European racist ideology. This seems to be the way nations justify the domination of weaker, less-developed nations, a requirement of the imperialist order, whatever the race of the dominant powers.<br /><br />  Dower's section on the United States provides a quick, but very useful, explanation of the development of racist attitudes in the West in general and the United States in particular.  He notes what many forget, the key role that Thomas Jefferson played in launching the pseudo-science of racism, that Blacks and other inferior \\"races\\" were less human, lower species than the white Europeans.<br /><br />  This is quick summary of a very serious book that delves deeply into iconography and the structures of racism in imperialist society in general.such atrocities were not carried out, as it stiffened resistance by Japanese soldiers and civilians. <br />   <br />    Dower also points to the racist justification that the Japanese used to justify their exploitation of their Asian conquests.

Alas, the writer is apparently an adherent of the Maoist brand of Stalinism and gives much more weight to the role of the Chinese Communist Party than they deserve.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, this book gives a good picture from the inside of the growth of conflict in East Asia between Japan and Britain and the United States, as well as a picture of the shifts inside Japan that led to first the expansion of their penetration in China to full scale war, and then how Japan's needs in that war and Western economic and diplomatic hostility to Japan led to Pearl Harbor.  It gives a brief but useful description of the collapse of Japanese society as Japan was defeated.<br /><br />  This book might be a big difficult for someone not familiar with the ins and outs of Japanese life as it was written in Japanese for Japanese readers.  However, it will has a strength for giving which points were important from the Japanese point of view, particularly to those within Japan who are critical of Japan's course during and since WWII.	2005-09-15

I looked forward to this book and rushed through things to get to it. I then read it and read it, when I should have done other things. I finished it in a day where I did very little else.  This testifies how Paris After the Liberation is a great and interesting read.<br /><br />  Yet, I think this book is unfocused.  Beevor and Cooper really needed to decide whether they were writing a book about the City of Paris in the Liberation and life and events in it, or a history of France from 1944 until 1968. The focus shifts in too many places from goings on and life in the city to the national political alignment in France, international events affecting France, and relations between other countries dealing with France, political events in France outside the city, etc.<br /><br />  Likewise Beevor and Cooper's view of the city of Paris tends to be unbalanced.  They focus on the city of tourism and myth rather than the city most Pariseans live in.  They give us only a few pages of description of the misery, poverty, disease, starvation, and neglect in the outer working class suburbs. They provie a paragraph about the prison-like experience of workers at Billancourt where Renault is. They have not one word about the working class and poverty-stricken faubourgs inside the city.  Instead, Beevor and Cooper concentrate on the life of major intellectuals, upper class socialities, and above all the English-speaking diplomatic circles and returning exiles<br /><br />  If you want to know the details of the life of British Ambassador Duff Cooper, his various extra-maritial affairs, taste in decoration, friendship, advice to French politicians, advice to the British government, this is the book for you.  If you want to know what it was like to live in Paris from 1944 until 1952 as an average working class or lower middle class citizen who is not a writer or a painter and who does not socialize at embassies, world class restaurants, or hotels, you need another book.  This is about the Paris of public myth,the Paris of politicans and millionares, and not about the Paris that the great bulk of its people lived in and continue to live in.<br /><br />  I think this book would be very hard to understand for someone who does not understand French, is not familiar with the city of Paris, and is not familiar with the array of political, cultural, socialite, and artistic figures that Beevor and Cooper present without explanation.<br /><br />  I speak French, have spent time in Paris not as tourist, and have studied and written about French History and politics for decades.  Yet, I found this book both exhilarating and hard to keep up with as names and places whirled past me and had to stop and remember the city's geography. I don't know what someone who can't read French would make of the many statements in French produced with no translation?<br /><br />  One of the interesting aspects of this book is Beevor's use of documents unearthed since the fall of Soviet Union about the French Communist party.  In doing so, he provides a good  picture of the utter contempt Stalin and his bureacrats had for the working people of France and the world, and Stalin's continued determination to use the PCF not as a tool for social change in France, but as a puppet to secure diplomatic advantages with the imperialist leaders of Europe and the United States.<br /><br />  Beevor and Cooper explain that the PCF began to lose its support in 1944 when it became clear to French workers that the party was not going to lead French workers and farmers to power. Once connections with Moscow were restored and exiled leader Maurice Thorez returned, the PCF organized itself to increase production, \\"stop strikes,\\" as Thorez was wont to stay, and allowed the peaceful return of French capitalism.<br /><br />To be sure the PCF remained a major political party, but as Beevor indirectly explained, this was due to middle class intellectuals flocking tothe party as workers left. Later in the late 1940s when the PCF aimed at spoiling actions whose purpose was to disrupt the Marshall plan and stiffen France's opposition to the West's plan to build a strong West Germany as a military bulwark against the USSR, the PCF brought about disaster.<br /><br />What I found the most interesting was Beevor and Cooper's pictures of the lives and intellectual development of Jean Paul Sartre and Simon De Beauvoir, Camus and other Paris intellectuals during these years. Though I think Beevor and Cooper tend to have a bias against De Beauvoir, I would loved to hear more about them and less about the sexual affairs of various English socialities and diplomats.<br /><br />The final chapters takes the reader through the 1950s and 1960s very quickly.  The focus on the city of Paris is really lost, so we don't know anything about the big changes in life and lifestyle, the explosion of new art, film, literature, and politics that happened. As  the book goes on and loses focus, inaccuracies unworthy of Beevor and Cooper start to appear. Rather than describing life in Paris, Beevor and Cooper seem to end this book by trying to settle political scores with a generation of the French who were barely born in 1944-1950.<br /><br />I would have loved a book focused on real life in Paris during these years with the necessary background in French and global politics, a picture of the real city and not just the tourist city.  On the other hand, a political history of France from 1944 to 1950  by Beevor and Cooper would have been a wonderful work. Perhaps, a book on the social world of the upper classes, the intellectual elite, and foreign dignataries and diplomats might also be interesting.

Nor does it focus solely on military activities in the way a book oriented to what I consider hideous \\"war buffs\\" would. So for those with an almost pornographic desire to learn the minutiae of military operations, weapons, etc, this book will be a disappointment.<br /><br />  Bigger questions were involved in the war, and this is Overby's concern as in his masterpiece that I high recommend _Why the Allies Won__<br /><br />  This is a book that examines the question of war and especially the Army in the Stalinized Soviet Society and discusss how the Soviet Union functioned during the war, as well as what the Soviet Union did, but its real riches are why things happened as they did, even if you are like myself and do not share his analysis of Soviet Society.<br /><br />  Overby takes advantage of the release of many Soviet  paper, memoirs and statistics since the fall of the Soviet Union to answer a number of the pending big questions of the Soviet-German war.  For example, he verifies from secret documents of both the Poles and the Soviet leadership that it was not any decision by Stalin to see the Polish nationalist revolution Warsaw crushed in 1944, but the exhaustion of the Soviet Offense that had been only designed to advance through BeloRussia but had been able to enter Poland, and the desire of the leaders of the Polish rebels NOT to cooperate with the Red Army.  Likewise, he records statements by both Stalin Zhukov that allied economic and military aid was decisive in the USSR's ability to survive against Hitler.<br /><br />  By mapping military power in the Soviet Union starting with the seizure of governmental power by Stalin and his clique in the 1924, Overby provides a summary history and discussion of basic questions not only of Soviet History, but Soviet Society.  He continues that discussion after the war with a discussion of the results of the war on the peoples of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's role in World power. Inas much as he focuses on Stalin's role in all of this, he continues that discussion until Stalin's death in 1952.<br /><br />Overy rejects both the evil-empire demonification of the Stalin regime popular in some writing about the War, and also rejects the gloriciation of or ignoring of the STalinist tyranny. Armed with recent revelations, Overy surveys what a disaster the Stalin regime was starting with its force collectivation and superindustrialism and how the same dictatorial regime that carried out the purges continued during the Soviet-German War.<br /><br />  While Overby seems to be quite knowledeable about revelations about the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany during the war, there are a few things that he seems to be unaware of in regard to the pre-War Stalin regime.  He seems to have no understanding how and why the purge trials began beyond paranoia on the part of Stalin.<br /><br />  We now know that Leon Trotsky's analysis of the purge trials when they happen was exactly right. In fact, Stalin began his purges when he learned that even within the bureaucratic elite in the Communist party tops, his rule was despised.  At the famous Congress of Victors, Sergi Kirov, not Stalin was elected as General Secretary. This insured Kirov's assasination and a war of persecution against any section of Soviet society that could gather in opposition, starting with the Communist Party itself.<br /><br />  Overby is good at assessing the disasterous role Stalin's attempts to run the Soviet war effort were in the first two or three years of the war.  Since he isn't pilloring Stalin, but trying to find the truth, he is honest enough to point out that by late 1943, Stalin had learned the error of his ways and began listening to his commanders and allowing them to make more and more decisions.<br /><br />  Overby also tells us that the victory of the Soviet Union was not inevitable and that the idea that the USSR won only because of overwhelming numbers of Soviet Solders were availble is also a myth.  I won't tell you his answers to these questions, because I believe you should read his book and learn the answers.<br /><br />  Even though I disagree with much of his analysis,  this book is essential because of the questions he tries to deal with. Overby is also modest enough to say that the amount of information that has been released since the opening of the Soviet archives is so vast, the amount of material still kept secret by the successors to Stalin still drawn from the bureaucracy  still hides is still so great in concentrated questions, and the historical questions so large, that real answers will not be avilable for years.

It is a magnificent read. I've read it so many times in the years I have owned it that the cover has been worn off.  Yet, it offers a different approach than the standard writing on the subject, provides revelations, and most of all poses questions that few others pose, even when Overy's answers are wrong.<br /><br />  This book does not gather the minutiae of military campaigns, weapons, procedures in in pornographic details and collections.  Nor does it  repeat themyths about World War II, that have driveled out of the USSR, United States and Britain since the war.<br /><br />  What Overby is concerned with is the big social, economic, and political questions that were at the center of the war and not military campaigns, bombing tactics, or what this or that division or air wing did. Why, not what, is the goal of his book. As such, rather than reciting the litany of the war's happenings, he comes upon facts and analyses which are important, new and fundamental.<br /><br />  I really found his depiction of the differences between German armaments production and procurement and that of the USSR and the USA to be quite interesting and illucidating. The German desire to produce the best possible weapons of the highest technical quality led them to eschew mass production for higher quality craftsperson production, to eschew large corporations for smaller speciality firms, and to allow supervision of production and design and ordering of weapons systems by fairly low level military organizations, halting production for constant battlefield modifications.<br /><br />  This might sound like a program for better weaponry and victory.  And indeed, Overy points out that during World War II the Germans created the standard weapons used by both NATO and the Soviet Block for decades after the war.  Yet, this led to a shortage of quality arms in the German armed forces and problems induced by the wide variety of different arms and support equipment that might be used by one military unit.<br /><br />  This is not his chief analsyses--I will allow you to enjoy discovering them for yourself, but an example I give you without giving away the pleasure of reading this book.<br /><br />  Overy's scope is so wide and so fundamental, that he can be excused, if not forgiven, for this or that error of detail that may have surfaced.  Unfortunately, lousy editorial, copy editing, fact checking, and proof reading support has become more and more the norm in non fiction.  That seems more a reflection of dwindling budgets for serious non-fiction, than Overby's ability or integrity.rent arms and support equipment that might be used by one military unit.

Even before the great revelations came out with Glasnost and the Fall of the USSR, this book seemed old fashioned, unscientific and a bit dim.  There were many descriptions of differences between Soviet troops and society and German troops and society that struck me as downright racist.<br /><br />There is a general accounting of the military activities and the course of the war, but not much analysis and a totally cold war approach.<br /><br />  Seaton's view that the Soviet Union won simply because of large manpower resources has been rejected by the scholarship of the last 20 years based on more Russian and German sources.  The Soviet Union won because of the successful economic mobilization that by 1943 and 1944 made the Soviet Army more modernized, with more motorized equipment, more powerful weapons, superior airpower, and many more and better tanks than the Germans. An apt decscription of the differences at the end of the war would be that of many Eastern Europeans who described the coming of the Russians and the retreat of the Germans:\\"The German commander left on his horse.

They were pioneers in the collection and publication (for their own profit copyrighting folks songs that their informants taught them in their own names)of folk music.  They also had a lot to do with the promotion of urban intellectuals who claimed to play folk music like Pete Seeger  and players of various levels of contact with folk tradition who became involved with them like Leadbelly and Woodie Guthrie.<br /><br />  They were not angels.  They were deeply flawed.  They tended to find what they wanted to find, and produce what they were looking for. Folklorists I know who have met people the Lomaxes interviewed have reported that the Lomaxes were rude and forceful and sometimes insulting to people they interviewed.  For example, they often claimed that as representatives of the government in Washington [They worked for the folklore program of the Library of Congress] people were legally bound to open their doors to them.<br /><br />  The legends and the attitudes produced in this book are comfortable and entertaining, particularly to people who know little but the common sterotypes about Black people, the blues, and the times depicted.  However, this book has a lot of untruth in it.  The real situation in the time and places depicted can only be understood if we have access to another text, one by Black sociologists and folklorists from Mississippi and Tennessee whose work Lomax hijacked, suppressed, and lost.<br /><br />  The truth and the untruth of this book--still valuable despite Lomax's confusions, fictions, and weaknesses--can only be understood by reading __Lost Delta Found: Rediscovering The Fisk University-Library Of Congress Coahoma County Study, 1941-1942__ by John W. Work, Lewis Wade Jones, Samuel C., Jr. Adams. The editors, blues scholars Robert Gordon and Bruce Nemerov, found the original papers of the two trips to Mississippi that Lomax bases this book on (although fictively he combines them into one trip in the __Land Where the Blues Began__).  It is interesting that these papers were \\"lost\\" for decades, though they were found by Gordon and Nemerov in the Library of Congress which supposedly lost them and among Lomax's papers after his death.<br /><br />  Gordon and Nemerov point out in their introduction the degree to which Lomax simply took credit for work that Work--the most outstanding African American folklorist of the 20th Century who was also a leading composer and expert of Black religious music and a director of Fisk's Jubilee singers--and the graduate assistants Jones and Adams provided did.  They also point out that it was Lomax's pressure and the opportunity to use the portable recording machines Lomax had that led them to set up what was supposed to be a joint study, but was hijacked by Lomax and taken away from the directions the Black scholars wanted.<br /><br />  This book of Lomax's supposed story was published at a time that he claimed the African American scholar's work was lost. Moreover, as my reader review of Lost Delta Found reports, the difference in emphasis from what African American researchers who looked at the communities from the inside is significant.<br /><br />No doubt, readers whose connection with the blues is superficial will find Lomax's book simply a welcoming bit of the same old stuff.  Yet, such readers are in part disabled because their knowledge of the blues is based on the type of fiction, stereotypes, and unrepresentative selection Lomax shows in this book, and is now recognized to have been Alan Lomax's practice throughout his entire career.<br /><br />  Aside from these issues, this book is problematical especially from the point of view of an African American who studies and plays the blues not from outside, but inside the Black nationality.<br /><br />  Lomax keeps trying to to write about how he wants to know what it feels like to bea Black person or compares petty indignities he faced and attempts to say \\"ahhah, now I know what it is like to be Black.\\" This is something he could never in the slightest degree be able to do.<br /><br />  Of course the logical conclusion is for Lomax to realize that this work should be done by Black folklorists who know how it feels to be a Black person in the South, not by Alan Lomax.  Yet, he essentially worked to divert the focus of the project from the topics that African American scholars who knew what it was like to feel black.  This book essentially hides the work of Black scholars involved in what was supposed to be a joint project.<br /><br />  Their conclusions were quite different.  They had already spent much time in the Delta working on a previous study of Youth in the Delta.  The Fisk scholars also had a deep knowledge of the Mississippi Delta since Fisk College supervised and assisted African American school teachers throughout the Delta. Where Lomax sees the blues and the delta issuing from old ways, the Fisk scholars reported on how the Delta had attracted a new, younger, more dynamic population that the rest of the Black Belt South.  Where Lomax sees compliance and fear in the face of segregation, the Fisk scholars found a growing militance among the youth.<br /><br />  Lomax's story is an artificially put together fiction manufactured out of his memories, notes, and perhaps wishful thinking 50 years after the fact. It centers on Alan Lomax and not on the people of Mississippi. He combines incidents that took place on a longer trip in 1941 with incidents that occured on a shorter one in 1942.  People known to John Work and his team for years are recreated as people that Lomax discovers just walking down the street in Memphis or Clarksdale.<br /><br />  The other thing I get from Lomax is how alien this book reads to me as a Black person.  Lomax's approach is that he is always explaining Black culture and Black people to white people, so that reading this book from within the culture, I feel a bit excluded.<br /><br /> While he tries to show the connections between the Delta culture and Africanism, his view of Africa is too general to deal with a large continent. Africa has a lot of countries and different cultures. Africanism can't simply be generalized. To be useful different cultures can be identified or at least discussed.  One could say that Lomax's approach might be excused in the 1940s when he made these trips, but this book was written in the 1990s. For example, in _Deep Blues by Bob Palmer_, Palmer speculates that an important factor differentiating musical traditions in the Mississippi Delta from the the Southeast is that much of the Delta's Black population descended from Bantus and not West Africans, something Lomax is unaware of.<br /><br />  Lomax also discounts the point of view of his colleagues from Fisk by claiming educated African Americans don't appreciate the importance of the folk culture that he, Alan Lomax, understands. Of course, this did not prevent Lomax from more or less forcing Work to surrender much of his own recordings to the Library of Congress with little attribution.<br /><br />  Lomax really does not inform the reader that John Work--whom he terms a \\"composer\\"--had  done extensive research as part of this study and for years before this trip with some of the individuals. As an outsider, Lomax constantly got in the way of collection and did not understand nuances and his team understood. Nemerov and Gordon note that in the interview with Muddy Waters that has been published on the CD of their trip to Stovall Planation, Lomax's cuts off Work who has begun a sensitive and knowing conversation about Muddy's music with comments shut things down.<br /><br />  In fact, Lomax used the open door with white Mississipians that the Library of Congress provided and their posession of a precious portable recording machine to force Work to donate transcripts and recordings from his ownwork to the Library of Congress.  Nor does he mention the special graduate seminar on the material from the research that Work and Charles S. Johnson organized at Fisk between the 1941 and 1942 journeys, a seminar that brought Black and white folklorists and sociologists from all over the country and promised to launch a new day of African American research into Black folklore, had that and so many things not been disrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War.<br /><br />  In fact, Lomax doesn't give an image of himself as a serious, detached scholar, trying to build up data for general scholarly discussion and knowledge.  He sounds like the kind of paternalist southern white boy who \\"knows Black folks,\\"  wishes he could be \\"Black on Saturday night\\" and who is always looking for moonshine and where Black folks are juking. Of course, this may appeal to many white pseudo blues fans who are basically in the same category.<br /><br />Work, Jones, and Adams are more concerned with  impact on folklore  that the real social and economic and cultural changes going on in the Delta had.<br /><br />  To be sure there is a lot of valuable and wonderful information in here. A lot of it is taken from interviews and other work done by the Fisk team and blended in to place it in the fictional sequence Lomax creates in his book to place himself at the center of things.  There are some good folkways described, and good contexts for a number of the songs that have previously appeared in other Lomax productions without much backgrounds.<br /><br />After four decades reading Lomax, I was surprised at some very good prose, although he gets too purple to be accurate. He also tends to quickly leap to comparisons of Black Mississipians and the their culture to the most stereotypical and paternalist images of Africans, images few Africans would find acceptable.<br /><br />  If you are interested in Blues, African American folklore, etc, this is a book to be read, but not without reading the Nemerov and Gordon edition of the Fisk studies.  Serious blues studies like Kubrik's _Africa and the Blues_ or any of the work of David Evans are also good.<br /><br />  It is unfortunate that the discourse about Blues falls so strongly in the hands of people who are not Black and see writing about blues largely a discourse between white people where black people are not subjects of their own stories, but objects for interpretation or enjoyment by white people who are assumed the only audience.<br /><br />  This too shall pass.excluded.

In the 1984 of Orwell, there is not much home, only rumors of an opposition, an opposition which may only exist as an excuse to persecute and victimize.  In the 1984 the technology is use to overwhelm his hero who seeks freedom.<br /><br />  Orwell was a member of a trend that lost hope in the cause of socialist revolution, and believed that the Soviet Union and the Nazi government of Germany were the same thing.  It was the wave of the future, bureaucratic collectivism, James Burnham the former Trotskyist named it as he fled to the anticommunist ranks of the National Review.  It couldn't be stopped, Nazism, the corporate society, and Stalinism would all grow into what Orwell depicts in 1984.<br /><br />  But now, 20 years after 1984, the bureaucratic regimes in Eastern Europe and China and the former Soviet Union have been pushed aside, and great avenues for free political life, the exchange of ideas, and struggles by workers for union rights, by oppressed nationalities for freedom from discrimination, even without the kind of revolutionary leadership that emerged in Hungary in 1956 or in Cuba in 1959.<br /><br />  Technology has proven a weapon for working people and others fighting for their rights, not something by which tyrants can rule through. For Soviet dissidents the first big explosion in the discussion and circulation of ideas came with the advent of the photocopying machine that spread texts and reports against the bureaucracy across the country.  Today web sites for unions fighting the coal bosses in Utah, fighting to organize textile workers in Miami, or fighting to defend coal miners in China, reach out around the globe.<br /><br />  As the world seems to be heading into an economic criss marked by aggresive wars by Washington and resistance by working people we can expect not the bleak sunnless future that Orwell painted, but a festival of freedom for working people fighting the bureaucracies in Eastern Europe, the USSR, and China and the billionaires in North America, Japan, and Europe.<br /><br />  However, what will live forever in this book, what lives more strongly in every other thing Orwell wrote is his ability to picture a real man, not a hero, not a perfect man, living a real life, hoping, fearing, wanting, messing up in little things, searching for bigger things. Read 1984 and regardless of its political pessimism, its author had a clear hold on what is like to be an ordinary man or woman trying to hold onto life even when it all seems too big to conquer.inted, but a festival of freedom for working people fighting the bureaucracies in Eastern Europe, the USSR, and China and the billionaires in North America, Japan, and Europe.

This book helps us understand rather than the beneficient and hallowed benefactors of African Americans he liked to picture himself, Alan Lomax perpetuated the same racism and paternalism that has been a halmark of white scholarship of African Americans since this country began.<br /><br />  The trips to Mississippi in the 1940s that Lomax made were supposed to be part of a joint project between between Lomax's team at the Library of Congress and a team of Black scholars at Fisk University led by the great John W. Work III, one of the greatest African American folklorists, the musical director of the Fisk Jubilee singers, and one of the major Black intellectuals of his period.  The lure of Lomax to the Fisk scholars was that he was supposed to lend resources from the Library of Congress, especially portable recording equipment, and would advance the publication of the joint study. In particular, the connection with the Library of Congress would make things easier with white authorities in Memphis and in the Mississippi Delta. Lomax seemed to be after the cooperation of Fisk professors and graduate students who knew their way around the Black south, especially Mississippi.<br /><br />  What turned out is that Lomax demanded that Work give part of the archive of folk recordings he had achieved to the Library of Congress.  While Work, and two graduate assistance wrote cogent studies, that included many transcriptions of songs, hymns, sermons, and other Black folk culture, all that came out were recordings done by the Library of Congress. Nearly 50 years later, Alan Lomax came out with a book on this trip called _The Land Where the Blues Began_ which won many prizes and set the stage for another reissue of the recordings made on this expedition.<br /><br />  Yet, the studies by Work, Adams, and Jones were alledgedly \\"lost\\" by the Library of Congress and Lomax, although researchers found this information in Lomax's papers several years ago.  While Lomax uses photographs taken by Work, data and interviews compiled by Adams and Jones, there is no attributation to these Black scholars.  Indeed, Lomax makes many mistakes and even confuses the two trips he actually made with one.<br /><br />  The studies by the Black scholars here that are finally seeing the light of day are important.  Rather than focusing solely on remnants of the past and perpetuating the image of the Delta as a dynamic center of change, a mixing pot of Black culture, and place the traditional culture in the context of real change in the real Black community.  If Lomax focuses on older Black folk singers and seems to prefer, as Nemerov and Gordon point out in their introduction, the inarticulate, who necessitate interpretation by Lomax, Work, Adams and Jones interview a very articulate cross section of Black people from the Delta ranging from high school students to great grand mothers to give a picture of Black folklore and live in the world.<br /><br />  As Adams and Jones were sociologists working on the equivalent of Master's Theses under the supervision of Charles S, Johnson, their papers about life in the Delta and its connection to folklore are important for anyone interested in Black history and culture in general, and life in the Delta in particular.  There is none of the romanticism that non-African American blues writers like to invest Mississippi and the Delta with in their writing. There is no garbage about meeting the devil at the crossroads, but there is a lot about the growing race consciousness and growing refusal to take the oppression whites were dishing out that would explode into a civil rights movement.<br /><br />Since I wrote this review, I have found the scholarship here, particularly about the changing sociology of the Delta to be extremely useful in discussing several questions that people have asked me, or thinking about other questions involving the history of the blues, banjos, old time music and the civil rights music. When I say helpful, I mean it has provided clear and documented answers to questions academics working these fields have raised with me.<br /><br />This is a useful serious work written with great concision and clarity.  It stands in stark contrast to the sloppy purple prosed, self centered, stereotype seeking and producing \\"white boy who knows Black folks\\" approach Alan Lomax took in his book  _The Land Where the Blues Began_ which purports to cover the same material.ng about other questions involving the history of the blues, banjos, old time music and the civil rights music.

She's not an alienated, too sophisticated, befuddled, philosophically complex writer who writes to communicate angst and befuddlement at the world. Marge Piercy's writings are about human values and how those values came through to move people forward starting in the struggles of women, of Blacks, of young people against the war in the 1960s.<br /><br />  This is a book that I read every year or so since I first got it about 20 years ago.  It is a book that I particularly find myself rereading when I feel overrun or perplexed or hit by disaster. I think I find such strength in this book because this is the story of someone who fought for their own identity out of the working class life of growing up in the 1950s, out of fighting for a women's place in the middle of sexism and male domination of academic life in the early 1960s.  I think this is a book about the realization of the self by shedding what dead traditions that stood in our way in those times.<br /><br />  While she is a delicate, precise sculptor with words in poetry, Piercy is never one to make the words in her prose get in the way of putting down a clear story.<br /><br />  I hope you will find this book adds to your life the way it has added to mine.

US	43002296	R3W2WY79LQOMFK	1584771119	667946381	An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States	Books	5	55	66	N	N	The real story, told by a brave man, an essential book for all,	Beard was a courageous man, not afraid to say the truth, not afraid to look into reality of American life and see the abuse of power, the denial of justice, and the real social interests at stake. This book establishes the real context of the constitution, displacing the usual hero worship of the \\"founders\\" as demigods and showing them as real men who served their class interests.  Beard situates the constitutional convention in the great social struggles that went on in the period after the achievement of independence. Without such an understanding the struggle over the adoption of the constitution, and the role of the Bill of Rights are simply not understandable.<br /><br />  Post independence America was a place of economic crisis for the farmers, workers, and small tradesmen who had been the bulwark of the revolutionary struggle. Montarization of economic exchange in villages and towns where a large amount of the exchange had been based on barter, a massive inflation, and a growth of the power of the banks and other money lenders spread like a plague, particularly in the Northern States, especially New England.  Farmers were losing their land; tradesmen were losing their shops; goods not made on the farms and villages became too expensive for many working people and farmers.<br /><br />  The power of the state governments, squarely in the hands of the merchants and planters, stood behind the seizure of the lands of farmers who could no longer pay the banks and merchants.  Farmers and small tradesmen rose against this. Desperate farmers and their supporters shut down courts that met to authorize confiscation of farms. With no Bill of Rights, in Massachusetts set up kangaroo courts made up of merchants and bankers that made no attempt to be fair to the farmers. Newspapers and speakers who criticized the state government and the banks and big merchants were charged with treason.<br /><br />  Full-scale civil war broke out in Massachusetts, with the plebian rebels coming close--it is said only prevented by the delay of one detachment by a snowstorm--to seizing the national arsenal in Springfield.  It was these threats to property that threatened the power of the wealthy and the order that had been established after the revolution.  This is why the constitutional convention gathered, not some abstract interest in more ethereal and philosophical forms of government.<br /><br />Whatever is said about divine motivations, the constitutional convention which gathered the wealthy and powerful, would have had to have been a bunch of insane dreamers, not to have had the interests of their wealth and power first in their minds in this situation. This Beard shows with abundant documentation.<br /><br />  Beard documents that this was by and large a gathering of the wealthy men of the country who had profited from the revolution and who had profited by the economic disaster farmers and tradesmen faced by buying up certificates for land in compensation for services to the revolution, many farmers and tradesmen had to sell in order to keep their own land. Beard indicates that the concern for a secure state that could safeguard these interests was the dominant question for constitutional convention.  He also notes that the few delegates who were sympathetic to the popular struggle opposed the constitution.  Others among the leaders of the American Revolution who opposed this trend stayed away.<br /><br />  Beard's book has been pilloried because it challenges the public myth about the constitution and the government that is needed to maintain the continued rule of the wealthy and powerful<br /><br />  The constitutional convention did not write a democratic constitution. There is no provision for national elections.  There are only provisions for the state legislatures to select electors that would meet to select the president in what the constitutional convention thought would be another gathering of the wealthy and powerful.<br /><br />TheBill of Rights was not part of the constitution they wrote or proposed. This was not an oversight, but because the authors of the constitution did not support these rights or democracy as it is understood today. As I mentioned above, in Massachusetts rather than a \\"jury of their peers,\\" farmer rebels were tried by juries packed with merchants and bankers; rebels in Western farming communities like Springfield and Pittsfield were tried by juries from Boston. In states like Connecticut and Massachusetts, the Congregationalist church was an established church and membership in it was required to vote. Writers and speakers could be charged with treason for attacking the state governments.<br /><br />  Most people in the United States opposed the constitution that came out of the Philadelphia convention. Many cited as \\"founders\\" opposed it. The bill of rights was proposed as a compromise addition to safeguard the rights of the popular majority. Without it, the constitution would not have passed.<br /><br />  Even so, many provisions of the Bill of Rights were not actively enforced, some until the 20th Century.  The establishment of religion continued in Connecticut and Massachusetts as states until 1820s and 1830s, and establishment of the Congregational churches by town government continued in many areas of New England until the late 19th and in a few places the early 20th century!!!  Massachusetts's courts still charged and convicted newspapers for blasphemy in the 1840s.<br /><br />  Popular voting without property, religious, or other qualifications was not me insured in this constitution.  This came only with the amendments others that followed the Civil War, which Beard famously termed The Second American Revolution.<br /><br />  Beard tells the real story here.  For that, he was pilloried.  Similarly, during and after WWII he documented, using congressional hearing testimony for the most part, how Roosevelt took the US into the Second World War.  Again he was pilloried with new attacks generated against this book, even though this was written decades before.<br /><br />  We are lucky for a man like Beard who wasn't afraid to tell the truth, even when the truth clashed with myths that are propagated in the interests of the billionaires who run this society.thy and powerful.   <br /> <br />The Bill of Rights was not part of the constitution they wrote or proposed.

US	43002296	R716KA4OFK85K	1585671622	765323882	The Bomber War: The Allied Air Offensive Against Nazi Germany	Books	2	11	20	N	Y	Unobjective praise for British bomber command, good vignettes	Neillanos is open that he wrote this book to defend the British leaders of the bomber campaign, above all Arthur Harris, the chief wartime commander of the RAF Bomber Command.  His subject is \\"Bomber Command\\" in the Second World War. He includes a fairly extensive discussion of what the US Eight Air Force did insofar as it is necessary to explain what  Bomber  Command did, and to clear up several myths about differences between the RAF and the USAAF.<br /><br />  This book has almost nothing to say about the experience of the majority of the people involved in The Bomber War, the tens of millions of Germans, French, Dutch, British, and Japanese people who suffered under Allied, Nazi, Italian, and Japanese bombing during the Second World War.  This book  discusses them only in regard to the wrangling of military chiefs or the lives of the flight crews.  For that story I highly recommend _Dresden: Tuesday, February 13, 1945 by Frederick Taylor_, _The Night Tokyo Burned by Hoito Edoin_ and  _To Destroy a City: Strategic Bombing and Its Human Consequences in World War II_ by Hermann Knell.  Each one of them can be reached by clicking on the links to my other reviews above this comment.<br /><br />  What Neillanos is good at and what he really seems interested in is explaining the real lives of Allied flight crew.  The book is laced with many descriptions of bombing missions, life on the bases, the training regimen, and other features of the lives of aircrew of both the RAF and the USAAF, all in the words of British, American, and German aircrew. You find out more of what the missions were really like for the men flyign the planes.<br /><br />  This book also provides a clear account of the various bombing campaigns, aircraft, technical equipment, and tactics used by the US, British, and German air forces in Western Europe.<br /><br />  Neillanos is good at detailing the technical and organizational development of Bomber command and its tactics.  However, Neillanos is self-contradictory and unobjective because in broader discussion he clings to a defense of Arthur Harris's determination to continue following the \\"Bomber Dream\\" first put forward by Italian air power theorist Douhet.<br /><br />  The idea was that bombing cites, killing people, and demoralizing the enemy in war time would produce so much political dissatisfaction with a war, that it would force the enemy government to cease war or be overthrown.  Bombing alone without support from land or naval actions could win a war.  Harris and his colleagues believed that by terror bombing the cities of Germany, they could force an end to the war. They even believed that land invasion or bombings aimed at strategic military targets or purely economic targets like oil or transport were diversions from this.<br /><br />  Despite claims made especially by the USAAF and crack \\"precision\\" units of the RAF, WWII bombers were incapable of serious precision bombing of anything without overwhelming losses. It was a constant struggle to lead the bombers to the right cities, let alone to hit precision targets without special efforts.  The RAF Bomber command learned this after the first two years of WWII.  They then changed their strategy to aim at massive destruction aimed at setting entire cities alight in firestorms.  Their models were the Nazi blitz, particularly the small firestorm raid against Coventry, England in 1940. While exception and horror has been raised by the bombings of Hamburg in 1943 and Dresden in 1945, these were not exceptional. They were simply successes at what Bomber Command hoped to do every time it hit a major German city with a heavy raid. You will not learn this in Neillanos's book but Taylor and Knell's books tell that grisly story.<br /><br />  Harris was so extreme that even Neillanos has to admit that by the fall of 1944 he had been proven wrong and needed to relent.  Yet, Neillanos simply ignores evidence that was developed in the strategic bombing survey carried out by the US government at the close of the war and several years after, that the political impact of the bombing was to harden Germans against the allies, and to embitter some who opposed Hitler and the war against an Allied victory.  Neillanos simply ignores the fact that these bombings were relatively ineffective in damaging military and economic targets, even though they killed hundreds of thousands of Germans and other Europeans and nearly tens of thousands of Allied aircrew.<br /><br />  Neillanos is right to show that despite public relations attempts to distance themselves from British terror-bombing, particularly after world uproar after the February 1945 bombing of Dresden, the United States Eighth Air Force came to the same conclusions and carried out raids with the same results. He is particularly vociferous in pointing out that the US air force bombers cooperated with the RAF in the bombing of Dresden, and bombed Dresden for several days after the British night bombing of February 13, 1945.  Showing the USAAF was no better than the RAF, he explains how P-51 fighters that escorted US Bombers would swoop down and attack fleeing civilians and firefighters at Dresden and elsewhere.<br /><br />  At the end of the book Neillanos embarks on an embarrassing attempt to defend Harris's terror bombing tactics morally and militarily.  His arguments are all over the place and completely inconsistent. The author has already explained that Harris considered bombings with military targets or with transport or oil targets to be diversions from simply slaughtering Germans and destroying their homes (\\"dehousing\\" being the term Bomber Command used).  Yet in his defense of Harris Neillanos tries to take credit for raids with economic or purely military targets that Harris was forced to carry out by his superiors. Likewise, while Neillanos uses the amount of German resources involved in shooting down the bombers, fighting the fires, and clearing cities to justify the terror bombing, he says nothing about what the resources that went into the terror Bombing campaign could have been used for. Approximately 10 thousand British and American strategic bombers were shot down.  The majority of crews were killed, captured, or wounded, leaving more than 100K aircrew casualties.  These figures do not include aircrew from the tactical air forces that worked directly with the Allied armies and navies bombing targets on the battlefronts.<br /><br />  Yet, the real point is the indifference of the imperialist British and American governments to the lives of the working people of Germany, or for that matter, to the lives of the aircrew.  In this regard they were no different than the German imperialists who prosecuted the war at such a heavy price to their own population and carried out massive atrocities including terror bombings of their own.<br /><br />  The real question is the replacement of the capitalist system that engenders insane rivalries for control over the world between plutocratic governments of \\"democratic\\" or fascist nature.the close of the war and several years after, that the political impact of the bombing was to harden Germans against the allies, and to embitter some who opposed Hitler and the war against an Allied victory.

It was not Beard's last book, but one that subjected him to a veritable witch hunt and his removal from his position in historical societies and organization.  A progressive of the old LaFollette type, Beard simply sought to tell the truth about how Roosevelt plunged the USA into World War II before any declaration of war or attacks on the USA by Germany, Italy, or Japan.<br /><br />  Most of the material here comes from hearings in the US congress, some during World War II, and other shortly afterward.<br />It is unfortunate that Beard did not have access to the materials that have been available in the last 10 or 20 years as war time records has become declassified.  His concentration is on Pearl Harbor and the naval war against Italy and Germany (most who write about submarine warfare in the Atlantic neglect the fact that there was a substantial force of Italian submarines as well as German submrines), that Roosevelt launched in 1940.  Yet, this is but the tip of the iceberg in Roosevelt's illegal war against Germany and Italy and Japan in 1940 and in 1941.<br /><br />  Roosevelt ran the 1940 election under the slogan \\"I hate war\\" and on his many pledges not to send Americans to fight in the Second World War. As soon as Roosevelt won the 1940 election he secretly began to send American sailors, marines, and soldiers into the war.<br /><br />  In November 1940, Roosevelt sent the US navy into the Atlantic to attack and sink German and Italian submarines in complete cooperation with the British.  This was despite the fact that the German and Italian submariners were ordered to stay out of the Western Atalantic and to avoid American ports and ships so they would not provoke US public opinion.  What the Axis submariners could have done if they targeted American shipping was shown in 1941 and 1942 after Pearl Harbor.  Hundreds of ships were sunk within sight of the East Coast. Britain was seriously threatened with strangulation.<br /><br />  The evidence that Beard prints in this book chiefly from Congressional hearings explains major incidents like the sinking of the Reuben James and the Kearny that were used to claim Germany was sinking American ships without provocation.  Congressional hearings reported on in this book show both incidents were provoked by aggressive US Navy attacks on German submarines either separate from or in direct cooperation with the British and Canadian navies.<br /><br />  Roosevelt had the US in a world-wide naval war with Germany and Italy by 1941. American Navy pilots worked directly with the British.  In fact it was an US Navy pilot, not a British pilot who flew the plane that torpedoed the Bismark and left it unable to steer. The destroyer for bases deal not only supplied the British with destroyers, but sent US troops to the bases that protected British colonies in the Americas and Africa so British troops there could be sent to the war in the Arab East.<br /><br />The US Navy began to build a major base in Northern Ireland. By 1941 US Navy ships would attack, sink, or seize any German vessel they encountered on the high seas, not just in the Atlantic, but in the Pacific and Indian Ocean as well.  The US fleet and \\"neutral\\" American shipping were used to convoy Australian, New Zealand, and British colonial troops from the Pacific to the US and Canada to be shipped to the British war in North Africa.<br /><br />  American Marines  relieved the British troops who had essentially invaded and occupied Iceland, an action not really favored by the Icelandic government which had tried to stay neutral.  Those same Marines were originally to have invaded Vichy-controlled Martinique and Guadeloupe, but the Vichy governor of the islands agreed to allow US Navy officers to control passage of naval vessels to those islands, keeping French warships in port on these islands until the end of the War.<br /><br />  In Asia, Roosevelt launched the Flying Tigers.  Rather than being a mercenary program paid for by the Chaing Kai Shek government as the public was told until the relevant documents were released in the 1980s, the Flying Tigers were totally financed by the United States Army Air Force. All of the Tigers were serving Navy or Army pilots who were ordered to leave the Navy and the Army to accept positions with the Tigers. Generally, Army and Navy officers are not usually allowed to simply quit and take other positions before the end of their service, let alone in a period of coming war. Plans for the Tigers included building a huge American-staffed and paid for air force that would possess long range bombers to attack Japan. They barely had begun functioning in China before WWII began.<br /><br />  In late 1940 joint commissions of the US military and naval general staffs and their British counterparts were set up in both Washington and London to plan a US-British war against both Germany and Japan. Similar arrangements were worked out with Britain, Canada, and the Dutch colonial government of whatr is now knows as Indonesia for naval and military action against Japan.<br /><br />  Those who do not know the information Beard provides and the rest that has come out since his times, wonder why Germany declared war on the USA.  They picture the German declaration of war as an erroneous and gratuitous act of solidarity with Japan.  They miss the real question. The real question is why did Germany wait so long to declare war on the USA when the USA had been carrying on what American and international law clearly defined as illegal warfare against Germany since the fall of 1940.<br /><br />  Beard's courage on this issue was symptomatic of his rigor and independence, his relentless desire to find the truth. Just as we are ignorant of the real origins of US involvement in WWII without this pioneering work, we are ignorant of who the founders of the US government were, and what they were afraid of unless we read his Economic Interpretation of the Constitution.  Beard was not just a learned man, a dilegent scholar, and pretty good writer, he was a brave man who demanded to tell the truth no matter how unpopular it was.

Convention of 1940 and How It Freed FDR to Save the Western World	Books	3	7	10	N	N	Roosevelt and the War	The real story of Wilkie's nomination and campaign has to do with the unity of the big business forces that control America including the Republican and Democratic parties, over the question of going to war with Germany and Japan. Wilkie's agreement with that perspective moved him from being a member of the Democratic party to being the Republican candidate for president, insuring that on that crucial issue no disturbance would be made.<br /><br />  Whatever you think about it, Roosevelt ran the election under the slogan \\"I hate war\\" and on his many pledges not to send Americans to fight in the Second World War.  However, in reality, Roosevelt was covering for a series of actions that could only be described as warfare against Germany, Italy, and Japan. As soon as Roosevelt won the 1940 election these actions escalated.<br /><br />  In November 1940, Roosevelt sent the US navy into the Atlantic to attack and sink German and Italian submarines in complete cooperation with the British. This was despite the fact that the German and Italian submariners tended to stay away from American ports and American ships to avoid provoking American public opinion.

I know who Luis Russell was, and what his band signified, what it sounded like, and have seen it playing as Louis Armstrong's back up.  However, if you haven't you might not know what this book talks about.<br /><br />  Barker writes about his own personal experiences and some of the atmospheres that Jazz functioned in during his life.  He says very little about the actual music he plays. He only mentions at some point in the 1960s that he stopped banjo playing in 1930 when his banjo was stolen and apparently played guitar exclusively.<br /><br />  He gives more a picture of the atmosphere, rough and tumble, sometimes cheating ways musicians were treated by bar owners, band leaders, and each others.  He also explains a lot about a number of personalities that he meets.  I was quite interested in the little pieces of pictures that he gives of Jelly Roll Morton who didnt eactly receive the best treatment from other jazz writers and jazz musicians.<br /><br />  Like so many books by men who became famous and successful, Barker's book is most interesting in the beginning of the book that discusses his life before he becomes a known Jazz musician.  He picture of growing up in the rough and tumble of New Orleans at the turn of the century is preciseless. If the boyhood memories were all this book had and Danny Barker had given up music to become a garbage man or a school teacher, this would still be a wonderful book.<br /><br />  He gives a real good picture of both the rough and tumble and society places musicians struggled to play in New Orleans. He gives a good picture of how the funerals and funeral bands really worked. He talks about the families of musicians and in an honest way about the frictions between Creole and Black musicians.<br /><br />  What wins in this book is the voice of Danny Barker. It is real, visceral, honest, doesn't pull punches, and is not shy to say what he thinks even when he's obviously factually wrong.<br /><br />  This is a book for someone who loves and knows Jazz.

He was a person whose image was a symbol for both people who idolized him as a plaster saint and for people who pilloried him as a communist, a decadent fraud, and an enemy of Black people. Everyone around Robeson seemed to have an ax to grind about him, or over him, or define their lives and livelihood based on their association or opposition to him.<br /><br />  To top that off, Robeson was a reserved person who tried to keep his emotions and opinions to himself. He was not a writer or a diarist. He led a public life that hid his real personal life and sometimes did nothing to disavow false public perceptions of him that benefited his wife, his political comrades, his artistic career, and his financial needs.<br /><br />  With all that, Duberman has a tough task to carry out.  He does it well here with an enormous amount of documentation, particularly on issues that protectors of this or that image of Robeson would like not to appear in public.  At the same time Duberman is honest enough to indicate the gaps in his knowledge, things that will never be known because Robeson's mind was often very much his own.<br /><br />  For those expecting a plaster saint who rises out of the toil of the slaving black masses and seeks only to advance the struggle, this book is a disappointment.  The real Robeson came out of the middle class, was an outstanding student and an all American athlete at Rutgers (then a private university), who went on to Columbia law school.  His milieu was arts, actors, writers, socialities. He prefered to live in England, not the USA, and did so from his first opportunity until WWII brought him home. As soon as the witch-hunt travel ban on him was broken, he spent the rest of his life living in England, the USSR, and the GDR returning to the US only after his mental and physical health was broken.<br /><br />  While Robeson remained legally married to the same woman all his life (although they both contemplated divorce several times),  his marriage featured semi-open infidelity chiefly on  Robeson's side.  In fact, particularly in the years he lived in the US, he frequently did not even reside in the same house or flat as his wife, but with his lovers, or in several cases with a lover and her husband.  They were only firmly reunited in the same place when disability forced Robeson to seek his wife's support and protection and that briefly for she died shortly after their return to the US in the early 1960s. The loves that lasted and he longed for, the women he was close with, and the people he really lived with, were usually white women he met<br />on the stage or as a singer, not his African American wife, who used her position as Robeson's wife as a means to become a public figure and to launch her various attempts at careers.<br /><br />  It is of course unfortunate that Robeson came up in a generation where the Stalinized Commuist parties and the USSR were misidentified as embodying a struggle against oppression, discrimination, and racism.  Yet, the picture that Duberman paints if of a man whose genuine attraction was to fighting against racism and oppression everywhere.  Robeson's fire came out of the stories he learned of his own family from slavery, and his identification with the suffering of victims of fascism in Spain, Germany, and Italy.  The US government explained its persecution of Robeson in part due to his advocacy of independence for the colonies in Africa and Asia.<br /><br />  Indeed, Duberman shows that both in WWII and afterwards, the Commuist Party which he looked to for leadership, but never belonged to, tried to get Robeson to muffle his criticism of American racism and imperialism.  At times, they too added to the pressure on Robeson to give up talking about politics to advance himself as an artist.  This is not surprising to anyone familiar with the CP's real history as reformists who sought to subordinate the struggle to the needs of a makeup between US imperialism and the Kremlin bureaucracy.<br /><br />  Even his refusal to support fighting witch hunt persecution of enemies of the CP like the SWP or his continued condemnation of the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, a real workers rebellion as close to the 1917 revolution led by Lenin and Trotsky as anything until Castro Cuban revolution, are not as important as the resolution with which Robeson devoted himself to attacking the racism, the war drive, and the imperialism of the US government and its big business institutions.<br /><br />  Robeson always had the choice to live a very comfortable life as an actor and a singer, by simply doing what everyone around him, including leaders of the CP wanted, just stick to music and the theater.  Yet, his devotion to the struggle showed he realized what was important and what was not. And with all his warts and pecadillios, all the legacy of his mislearning from Stalinism, he is an outstanding and inspiring example of what life and greatness is really about.<br /><br />  This book is fair, not partisan, and exquisitely documented.  It tells so many truths that I have not addressed here, says things about Robeson I have heard people who knew Robeson say for decades, but am finally glad to see in print.<br /><br />  This book paints not only a picture of Paul Robeson, but of the degree of evil, racism, and crime that holds up American capitalism.  What emerges, even though Paul Robeson's desires to keep his feelings within himself, is the story of a heroic man whose strength was not his voice, not his acting skills, but his devotion to principle, even if sometimes those principles were wrong.<br /><br />Read this book!eup between US imperialism and the Kremlin bureaucracy.<br /><br />  Even his refusal to support fighting witch hunt persecution of enemies of the CP like the SWP or his continued condemnation of the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, a real workers rebellion as close to the 1917 revolution led by Lenin and Trotsky as anything until Castro Cuban revolution, are not as important as the resolution with which Robeson devoted himself to attacking the racism, the war drive, and the imperialism of the US government and its big business institutions.<br /><br />  Robeson always had the choice to live a very comfortable life as an actor and a singer, by simply doing what everyone around him, including leaders of the CP wanted, just stick to music and the theater.

She gives a straight picture of her life growing up in a working class and lower middle class areas of Detroit in the forties and early 1950s which is my favorite part of the book. There is the toughness and rawness of working class life, the ambiguousness of sexuality, and some of the stark hard knocks realities of the utter cruelty of children, and the far distance parents are.<br /><br />  The second favorite part of the book is her discussion of her hard struggling days attempting to be, refusing to be, being knarled at being a proper young middle class wife in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as her fight to become a writer and not a literature academic.<br /><br />  Marge does very well in those areas.  Once she gets to around 1966 (where I came into this movie) she just goes too darned fast.  Instead of taking time to narrate things, she starts giving her opinions about things.  I am familiar with the places and people and things she speaks about in New York in the late 1960s, but I wonder if someone one who wasn't there would be able to follow what she talks about.<br /><br />  This book says almost nothing about Piercy as a writer except how she fought to write in her life in college, how writing saved her and gave her back her world in her hard days after her first marriage ended, and the general fight to have time to write and not have to do other stuff to earn a living after she became \\"established.\\"<br /><br />  Yet, she never talks about different writers who inspired her, how she actually works, how she stands on disputes over techniques, how she sees her poetry and her fiction, or how she answers the questions that many of us have about the two Marges, the ham fisted strong willed plot boiling fiction writer who does the job and goes on without much verbal flare or subltety and the delicate, sensitive, lyrical poet she has always been, although even in the poem's The Marge's mastery of plain talk from the heart runs through.<br /><br />  I haven't said anything about cats.  The cats in this book are not a gimmick. If you read the book--I won't spoil it--you will understand that from childhood, cats have been a special part of her life and identity.  It is really necessary to know her for her to explain the relationships she has had with each of the cats that has inhabited her life. Just as necessary as for her to explain each of her parents and her husbands.<br /><br />  I confess to be an unbiased fan of Marge Piercy as both a writer and a person whom I admire.  For me, this book gives more sense to different autobiographical threads in her work and clarifies confusions I had about her age (I thought she was about 10 years younger than she is from the times I have seen her, from all the good things I know she has done for people I know, always behind the scenes never trying to get the credit she is due).<br /><br />  Yet, I am not sure how interesting this would be for someone who is not a Piercy fan.<br /><br />  I would recommend that the reader who likes the pre-success part of Marge's story read her two more autobiographical novels Braided Lives and Small Changes. These were among her first books and seem to be neglected these days.  There is a lot of meaning in both of those books.  In fact, I used to read Braided Lives annually, or when I was in a tight fix personally--stolen cars, lost girl friends, fear of losing my job.ough even in the poem's The Marge's mastery of plain talk from the heart runs through.

Its great spark was over the question of Georgia and the Great Russian nationalist approach Stalin and his henchmen took against the heroic communists and people of Georgia.  This is quite important as in this discussion Lenin developed a policy similar to affirmative action in the accompanying works by Lenin on that national question.<br /><br />The other front was over the encroaching bureaucracy who aimed at smothering the revolution, and against the idea that this was simply an administrative task involving better organization rather than the social struggle Lenin saw this as, to bring \\"workers from the bench\\" as he said into the struggle.  Finally, this became a struggle to remove Stalin from command of the party to block his crude bureaucratic threats against Lenin himself.<br /><br />  These documents were suppressed in the Soviet Union during the Stalin decades, but published by Trotsky and other supporters of real Leninism in the 1920s and 1930s.  The introduction and glossary and notes make the issues understandable.<br /><br />  With the former Soviet Union and China still ruled by the old Stalinist clique of bureaucrats, now mixed with naked profiteers and gangsters (not that the bureaucrats were anything other than profiteers and gangsters themselves back to the days Lenin and Trotsky battled them), the origins of their struggle, and the direction needed to preserve the goals of working people are clear.<br /><br />  Stalinism didn't grow out of a life and death struggle against Leninism.  It was not for nothing that Stalin murdered almost every member of the Lenin's central committee. It was not for nothing that the big business governments of the US, Britain, and France favored Stalin's victory in this struggle.  They wanted to kill the great October revolution that Lenin and Trotsky presided over.<br /><br />  We should read this to understand the struggles of another revolution, still following Lenin's example to try to lead workers and oppressed nations to freedom, the Cuban Revolution. The discussions here and in Lenin and Trotsky's work (see the struggle of the Left Opposition series of Trotsky's writings) are almost identical to the discussion that Che Guevara raised against Stalinist models in Cuba, and that Fidel and other Cuban leaders have raised to fight bureaucracy and procapitalist forces in Cuba over the past 20 years.<br /><br />  This struggle lives.f a life and death struggle against Leninism.

As a person I admire her more.  She has done a lot for writers, particularly women and minority writers. This book helped because the sales from the book and different rights for movies and TV mini series that were never made helped Marge obtain financial independence for her modest life, so she can devote more of it to writing, her spiritual and social vision, and less of it to teaching classes and doing poetry reading for cash.<br /><br />  This book isn't going to please a hard-core World War II history buff like myself. Nor will it please those like myself who believe the US, Britain and France were equally evil as Germany, Japan, and Italy.  Moreover, Marge Piercy was forced to omit a planned segment on the war against the Soviet Union because she could not get funding for research on it.<br /><br />  However, if you like story telling, and you like the social, sexual, and political vision that Marge Piercy's non-sci-fi books express, you will enjoy this book.  You will be taken through the times and the war from the point of view of working folks.  You will see this world in a pro-Feminist view.<br /><br />  You will hang on and turn pages and feel the release the end of the war must have been, even as Marge is showing how the war was the beginning of things like the CIA marriage with academia.<br />This is the kind of book that you wish was longer.<br /><br />  Piercy as a novelist is not one of the great prose artists, nor is she one to produce subtle or delicately complex plots. She writes straight, hard and direct. Sometimes, you do feel a little bogged down by what I call her \\"sociology\\"--where the Marge is explaining social, political, and economic facts of life for her characters. Of course, most writers don't care about those aspects of life, particularly for the working people that Marge Piercy loves.<br /><br />  What Marge does is gives you a story, real people doing real things that you will care about and will give you a different message than 99 percent of the other offers.  If you want fine words, check out Marge's many works of poetry where she is a great artist, intimate with words, judicious in their use, but never fooling around, always with something real to say.<br /><br />Viva La Piercy!percent of the other offers.

It isn't a story as much as a world to inhabit, a way to see what slavery was like for whites, for blacks, for Cherokees, for folks who werent sure what they were for free, for slaves, for men, for women, for children.<br /><br />You don't follow any story down any straight line; you follow life as it flows not as one supercharged stream, but as a spider's web of rivelets, streams, brooks, and winding twisting rivers.  As you ease your way into the book, what you learn is the set of human relations we are all enmeshed in reaching forward to today, reaching backward to the arrival of the first slaves in America and back to the days of his white characters or their ancestors back in Europe.<br /><br />  Thomas Wolf, whose books were completely edited and shortened from six feet tall stacks by his great editor Maxwell Perkins, was said to have written 50 pages about a man who simply stood on a depot platform next to his main character, tracing the man's ancestors back to the civil war. However, Jones can take two or three sentences or two or three paragraphs or two or three pages going back in such a person's life or forward.  Yet, we see the relevance for the story, because Jones's subject  is not an individual's quest, but the4 larger set of relations wrought by slave and racism power and life that flow down through history.<br /><br />  In antislavery novels and narratives written before the civil war it was customary to begin with scenes of slavery in Kentucky where slavery was said to be the kindest and most civilized to show how even under these conditions slavery was a crime and a horrow.  Jones follows an even stronger course to delineate slavery.  His book centers on the slaves and family of Henry Townsend, who is a black slaveholder, bought from slavery by his own parents. The novel charts slavery's destructive path for Townsend and all his slaves.<br /><br />  Yet, Jones means to do more here than to tell us how bad slavery really was. He shows how its evil penetrates everything and moves morality away from abstract absolute to places where a good father tries to break his son's back, another father takes the name of murder, another father is the best parent to his bastard children, where parents own children and children parents, where the bounds of life are what is immediately in front of us, and we can simply slip down or for that matter stand up strong and be dragged into an abyss.<br /><br />  If we never ever sink into one character's skin, if we never feel one person is right and fight with them to an end, if we never feel fixed in time or even in his imaginary Manchester County, Virgina, we are in this world.  By the ending we know how we will act, though we can never be sure of what the results are.  Yet, can be we sure in life?<br /><br />  This book is more like life than a novel, and more of a romance than a tale.  It has a grace that can allow a reader to read it again and again and still come back with a narrative experience and a fresh visit to the world he both creates and recalls in the Known World.<br /><br />  The one weakness of this novel is the slightly fantastic touches to an ending I will not spoil by saying any further.

However, the day I read it became the day I finished it. I couldn't put the book down, and amid the many tasks I had that Saturday, the one priority was to read this book.  I didnt go out of the house all day, just got this book read.<br /><br />  What we have is an honest confrontation with family and family history. As someone who majored in writing memoir in Creative Writing School, I have come to find this genre usually divided between halcyon memories of a great childhood, a wonderful family, and a sacred past on one side, and the survival stories of folks who had tragic childhoods on the other hand.  This book has none of that; it seems like the real thing right down the middle.<br /><br />  At the same time, the writer's ability to tell about herself, but keep the subject squarely on her family, and the larger spiritual quest that her search for her family put her own, was really interesting to me as somone who has attempted to write memoir.<br /><br />  What I learned in this book was about how family is an open and closed book but that book is about more than who did what when, but about history, not only the history in the books that tell us how slavery, reconstruction, desegregation etc. unfolded, but the history why one cousin smiles that way and another look that way, why one cousin I have who is in and  out of jail walks and talks the same way that another cousin he has never met who is both a dean at a major university and a fanatical holiness believer.<br /><br />  If you are of my generation, 58 in 2005, you will settle in to some memories, although you will realize that you're somewhere between the author's parents and the author.<br /><br />  Besides all that, there is just some really good writing here. There are very tight metaphors that smack you into wondering why you didnt know what she is saying with them all your life.  She is able to write quite sensitive, complex, and sophisticated things while being clear as a bell.<br /><br />  Best of all for memoir, this is a very accurate and honest book. Even if you don't share the spiritual beliefs that the experience leads the author to, you will find yourself never thinking about your family, and if you are African American, never thinking about our history the same way after you read this book.ith them all your life.

Whatever you think of his thoughts on the matter, this book is exceedingly well written and brimming with information about the history of German culture and science in the 20th Century that has too long been forgotten. I found myself unable to put this book down until I completed the part that covers Hitler's scientists, often taking the book along to places where I shouldn't have been reading.  I delayed reading other books I needed to read for my teaching or for articles I am writing to finish this one.<br /><br />This is a good, informative read. While I am hardly mathematically or scientifically minded, I never found myself backpaging or reaching for a dictionary or reference material on the Net to understand the great variety of topics that he discussed.  I know I will return to sections of this book that discuss the sciences as places for instruction on how to write clearly about complicated issues.<br /><br />  The reality of much of Nazi Germany is that as a dictatorship formed as a last resort by German imperialism when it felt threatened with working class revolution in the early 1930s, Nazism came at a dreadful cost, though not one big German and World Capital (which generally welcomed Hitler in 1933-35)were not willing to pay.  One of those prices was the inability to coordinate, to centralize, to rationalize, and the overwhelming centrifugal forces of rivalries of bureaucratic factions which made it very hard for the Hitler regime to accomplish much in the realm of centralized planning and coordination not only of science but of industrial development, direction of its military, or defense of the inhabitants against the Allied terror bombings.<br /><br />  Much of Cornell's story is the scientific version of what is a familiar story in Germany during Hitler of disasters, wrong turns, and quack minded boon doggles originated by Nazi leaders.<br /><br />He also, interestingly enough, shows places where the Nazis were superior in their antismoking campaign and research into how tobacco caused cancer, while American and British governments were subsidizing tobacco and spreading smoking by giving free cigaretts to soldiers and sailors.<br /><br />  Cornwell paints a needed picture of the triumph of German science and technology from the late 19th Century up to the Hitler years. He often contrasts it to the weakness and lack of support of British science and technology.  He's also quite careful to show that with a few exceptions like the pacifist Einstein German science put itself totally at the disposal of the Kaiser in the First World War, including Haber, the great Chemist, who masterminded and personally supervised the use of gas warfare.  In passing, he is one of the few writers on German 20th century history to accurately note the privations Germans suffered under the British blockade that continued until 1919 and the awful exactions that were demanded of Germany by the treaty of Versailles.<br /><br />  When we get to the Nazi period, we find that like the rest of German bourgeois society, scientists who were not Jewish went along with the program, grudgingly in some cases, enthusiastically in others.  He even cites the tragedy of Ilse Minter, a Jewish woman physicist who thought she would be spared because she was an Austrian citizen whose collaboration with German scientists even after she left Germany made possible German discovery of nuclear fission.<br /><br />  Throughout, Cornwell presumes an overarching moral superiority of British and American science and its collaboration their governments in war.  It is this I question. I doubt the inhabitants of Hiroshima and Nagaski, or the greater numbers killed in the firestorm raid on Tokyo,or innocent people murdered in the firestorms of Wurzburg, Hamburg, and Dresden would absolve American and British scientists who perfected firestorm bombing, designed the Manchester, the B-17, the Mosquito, the B-24, the P51, and the B-29 and invented napalm for their collaboration with a murderous brutal war machine.  There is no talk of Roosevelt's racist segregated state where lynchings of African Americans were still public events with people selling hot dogs and ice cream and  speeches by politicians. Nor does he speak of the British Empire which held more than quarter of the Earth's population as colonial slaves, many of whom in the Arab East and Central Asia were policed from the air by RAF fighters and bombers.<br /><br />Yet, I don't expect Cornell to share my rather different view of the war. What he shows, in my opinion is that German scientists were no different than anyone else.  Science and pure intellect cannot transcend social and political evil in and of itself.  Scientists can be no more or less racist, antiSemitic, greedy for their own power, than any other profession.<br /><br />  Without challenging the fundamental nature of society, led and controlled by institutions owned and controlled by the wealthy, without a social force with power to control that society, scientists in the US or Poland, Germany or France, cannot ipso facto be a source of resistance or revolution.  They are too tightly tied to institutes, laborartories, universities controlled by big capital.  They are on very short leashes.<br /><br />  However, I want to emphasize that this is an extremely readible book, well documented like Cornwell's other work. There is much here about how science works as a social unit there is rarely discussed elsewhere.  In my opinion he very clearly settles the legend created after the Second World War by German scientists that they prevented a German nuclear weapon in World War II due to the opposition of Hitler.  Like so many things under the Nazi regime, a German nuclear weapon was never constructed because the resources available from a weak and overstretched German war economy that could not manage the empire it had conquered were too thin.  At the start of the war, the German government eschewed long-term programs because they had economic resources for a quick war and their wishful thinking made them think they had one.  Later, the resources they had were nothing compared to what Washington or even London had.nvented napalm for their collaboration with a murderous brutal war machine.  There is no talk of Roosevelt's racist segregated state where lynchings of African Americans were still public events with people selling hot dogs and ice cream and  speeches by politicians. Nor does he speak of the British Empire which held more than quarter of the Earth's population as colonial slaves, many of whom in the Arab East and Central Asia were policed from the air by RAF fighters and bombers. <br /> <br />Yet, I don't expect Cornell to share my rather different view of the war.

Scientists can be no more or less racist, antiSemitic, greedy for their own power, than any other profession. <br /> <br />   Without challenging the fundamental nature of society, led and controlled by institutions owned and controlled by the wealthy, without a social force with power to control that society, scientists in the US or Poland, Germany or France, cannot ipso facto be a source of resistance or revolution.  They are too tightly tied to institutes, laborartories, universities controlled by big capital.  They are on very short leashes. <br /> <br />    However, I want to emphasize that this is an extremely readible book, well documented like Cornwell's other work. There is much here about how science works as a social unit there is rarely discussed elsewhere.  In my opinion he very clearly settles the legend created after the Second World War by German scientists that they prevented a German nuclear weapon in World War II due to the opposition of Hitler.  Like so many things under the Nazi regime, a German nuclear weapon was never constructed because the resources available from a weak and overstretched German war economy that could not manage the empire it had conquered were too thin.  At the start of the war, the German government eschewed long-term programs because they had economic resources for a quick war and their wishful thinking made them think they had one.  Later, the resources they had were nothing compared to what Washington or even London had. <br />	2005-07-20

Perhaps, this is why this book has been such a target for the yes-men and women and the credulous belivers who stick by the Chucrh and want to believe in what Rome says. For Boomers like me, nostalgicly PIUS XII is still \\"the Pope,\\"  just as Eisenhower for many of us is still \\"The President.\\" But, we have a breach of the symbolism into the bloody truth here, and that truth is not the fiction the church has nourished.<br /><br />  The real starting point is not Pius XII/Pacelli's birth, but the Italian wars of independence and unity, climaxing in the conquest of Rome in 1870 by the Italian monarchy.  Up to this point, the Papacy's main concern was as a feudal, anti-democratic, reactionary ruler over people in in Italy under its sway, and a centerpiece to the international reaction that opposed the rights and struggles that issued from the Democratic Revolutions like the French and the American and the struggles for national unity and independence in Germany, Italy, and other European countries.<br /><br />  In the late 19th Century with the Italian people in control of their own country and their capital again, the Papacy's tenacles of control over the Catholic Church on an international basis grews and changed. Before this stage of the history of the Church, most Bishops were not appointed by the Pope, and many cardinals were selected by traditional election among bishops or only with the approval of the local government or nobility.<br /><br />  The 20th Century Papacy that grew and is depicted here was a bureaucracy trying to replace its rule over the Italian people with a tight rule over the millions of Catholics around the world. It is a bureaucracy in service of its own power over wealth, over doctrine, over the political destinies of the Church.  Pius XII's seeming indifference to Hitler, whatever his personal qualms were or were not, came from his service to this bureaucracy and its needs, and his status atop it.<br /><br />One must not forget that until the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, that is under the whole period discussed in this book, the official position of the Church was opposition to separation between Church and state, opposition to non-parochial schools, and a blistering anticommunism that included opposition to most real social struggles against oppression.  One must not forget the church's total identification with reaction and colonialism in the great political battles of the late 19th and 20th Century.<br /><br />  Pacelli was born into and raised in the narrow bureacuracy of sincures and adminstrators of the growing Vatican bureaucracy as it spread its tenancles to control the Church internationally more tightly, and to establish relations with all sorts of governments that would facilitate this.<br /><br /> Cornwell never claims that Pacelli was a Nazi, or an enthusiast for any of Hitler's crackpot ideas.  He as the papal nuncio to Germany, the Vatican Secretary of State, and then as Pope always saw relations with Germany and Italian fascism and other reactionaries through the eyes of maintaining relations with these criminal governments that would help build the church's power. If the Papacy as a whole, not just this Pope turned his back on the genocide of the Jews and the Gypsys, Cornwell also points out he did more than turn his back, he worked with Croatian Priests who led ethnic cleansing in their war against Yugoslavia's Orthodox and Muslims.<br /><br />What is indited here is not the Pacelli as an individual, but the Papacy as an institution.  It is no different than any of the other institutions that base themselves on the big business order of capitalism, and seek to curry favor with whatever powers that be that issue from it. The Papacy seeks to maintain its power and wealth and control, principles of justice or love or peace that it invokes are only useless drops of holy water in a world in flames.his status atop it.

In fact, until I was straightening out my library the other day, I didn't even remember I owned a copy.<br /><br />  This is well written and compelling reading to me now, after I have spent much of the last 5 or six years playing music, reading about music, talking with great intelligences like Sholmo P whom you have already read on this subject about African American traditional music.  This book stands up very well against all the other research that has gone on since it first came out.<br /><br />  I found Palmer's description of the transition from preblues to Blues to be most interesting and most useful, not only because it is an area where I have an interest, but because it is so well done, clearly explained, and is careful not to try to say too much.  In that wise, I think  if Palmer were to rewrite this section he would do well to read Cece Conway's description of the genre of Black banjo songs she describes in her book African Echoes and see how they prefigure the blues along with the jump ups Palmer talks about.<br /><br />  Palmer is best in Mississippi at the start when he is talking about Charley Patton and Son House and Bob Johnson, but when he gets past them to Muddy Waters, he has to go quicker and quicker to fit all the Mississippi descended blues artists up to his time in.  Not that there is anything bad that he says, nor anything shoddy.  It is just that we grow to love the richness of Palmer's history and feel for tradition and the music itself when he has time to stretch out, and we feel we are missing something when he has to compact everything into a few pages.<br /><br />  I would say despite its age, like Elijah Wald's book on Robert Johnson, this is a book no one interest in the Blues should live without. It is the kind of book you will read and reread and always find a little bit more as the years go on and you may read other books on the subject, hear other stories.	2005-07-12
US	43002296	R1MR3O2EZAJR6U	0312913850	506418620	The Night Tokyo Burned	Books	5	9	24	N	Y	Like in Vietnam, as in Japan, indifference to human life	About 25 years ago,  while flying back from Seattle to Oakland, I read the Boeing Company's semi-official history. When I got to the chapter where they illustrated the millions of tons of bombs dropped on the people of Japan, where they inumerate the hundreds of thousands of people who were murdered by those bombs, when they pile up the statistics of the numbers of buildings destroyed, when they add up all the square miles of Japan that was made into wasteland by their bombers, I simply broke down in tears.<br /><br />  It wasn't the air war's impact that shocked me. I had been aware of it since childhood. What hit me was the callus inhuman gloating and the treatment of murder as an industrial statistic that sickened me. I was not naive.  In fact, I was travelling around the West as the regional organizer of a revolutionary socialist movement.  The Boeing book smacked me right in the face.  The billionaires who run this country care not one wit for the lives of ordinary people, in Japan, in Vietnam, or in Seattle! If it serves their purpose to kill us off by the hundreds of thousands and millions, they will do it, and gloat over how well they can do it.<br /><br />  Hoito Edoin puts the terror-bombing campaign against Japan's people in human terms. He speaks of real people: a 12 year old separated by the firestorm from his family, a mother who has her baby sucked out of her back harness by the firestorms, a doctor who has a few assistants to deal with hundreds of thousands of injured,a man who would like to wake up in the morning and see his city as he always has, a woman who fights her hair, her clothes, a group of terrified Tokyo citizens hiding in a ditch, praying out loud to keep themselves awake and alive, and people who have to climb over, fight their way through, or up out of piles of bodies. We stare these people in the face as the US Army Air Force bombers try to incinerate them and their cities.  Yet, Edoin never over dramatizes. He never lectures. Restraint and accuracy keep his story on a human scale and prevent us from being overwhelmed by the carnage.<br /><br />  The real facts are that in the history of bombing, particularly in the Second World War, the bombers had difficulty hitting any targets in a precision way. When the US tried to do that over Germany, the majority of US aircrew were killed. By 1942, the British gave up any pretense at precision bombing.  They borrowed the tactics that made the German bombing of Coventry such a horror. They bombed to kill people and destroy cities through firebombing--creating huge fires whose convection became so strong that it was an explosive force itself.  While the US made the pretense of precision bombing in Europe,it soon joined the British terror bombing efforts at places like Dresden and Hamburg and many smaller cities that suffered under firestorm raids.<br /><br />  Curtis Le May, who many may remember as a war-criminal in Vietnam and a proponent of nuclear warfare, carried the same strategy to the air war against Japan in the raids described in this book. These raids were designed to kill people and destroy cities in Japan by burning them down. Whether any military targets happened to be involved was secondary. In fact, frustrated with Le May's indifference to crucial military targets, especially for the airwar, the US Navy brought in its aircraft carriers to carry on its own bombing campaign against Japanese military targets that Le May neglected.<br /><br />  Le May's targets were the people and their homes, hospitals, schools, religious shrines, their parks and museums, their stores and places of pleasure.  After the war, the strategic bombing survey by the US government and military, showed that given the effort and the hundreds of thousands of people murdered, these terror bombings in both Germany and Japan were relatively inefficient in the purposes of American militarism.<br /><br />  Edoin is very clear about the criminal nature of the Japanese militaryand business dictatorship and their war, and about their basic indifference to the suffering Japanese people were undergoing. He mentions the atrocities Japan had carried out in China where its bombing of undefended Chinese cities shocked the world.<br /><br />  However, the larger question is the inhumanity of the leaders of the American war machine who had no qualms at making millions of ordinary people, millions in Japan who had little or nothing to do with the war, the targets of their terrorism. Whether it was efficient or not, whether the Japanese war effort was limited or not, the terror bombings indicated tht the lives of Japanese working people, students, youth, children, seniors, meant nothing to Curtis Le May and the other leaders of the American war machine in the Pacific War just as the lives of the Vietnamese people meant nothing to the American war machine and Le May during the Vietnam war.<br /><br />  And here we return to the value of this book.  Edoin does not tell this story from the abstraction of debating military policy, not from the delight at technology and indifference to human life of the technology nut, not from the point of view of history as a discussion point for academic quibbling.  He tells the story to show what you or I, our friends or our neighbors, our coworkers or our relatives would face if we got in the way of the US War Machine.e of the Japanese military and business dictatorship and their war, and about their basic indifference to the suffering Japanese people were undergoing.

US	43002296	RUYEVT4US43TW	0306811693	314232691	To Destroy a City: Strategic Bombing and Its Human Consequences in World War II	Books	3	19	30	N	Y	A useful book, a labor of love for humanity,and hatred of evil	Hermann Knell is not a professional writer, not an academic, not a military man.  Instead, he is a concerned victim of bombing in World War II, a victim of the terror bombing that destroyed his home town, Wurzburg, Bavaria in 1945.  From his adolescence in wartime Germany to his present life in Canada, Knell has struggled to find why such bombings took place. Though he is not a professional scholar, this book is the product of research at libraries, government and military archives, and of interviews and discussion with scholars, military leaders, and experts in the Canada, the US, the UK, Germany, and several other countries.  This is a life quest.<br /><br />  The book uses the Knell's own experience in Wurzburg as its center. Why was this small city bombed, why was it hit with a firestorm that destroyed 90 percent of it,  a bombing that killed a higher percentage of its inhabitants than the terror bombings of Dresden and Hamburg?<br /><br />  The answers Knell finds are simple and chilling.  The city was there, other targets in Germany had been demolished, and the British and American bombers were pretty much unopposed by serious flak or fighters.  Simply put, the British and American bombing campaigned aimed to produce the results scored at Wurzburg, Hamburg, and Dresden almost every time they organized a major bombing of cities small, big, or whatever.  The several cities where weather, lack of opposition, and layout of the city permitted this were the firestorm cities.  Most other cities were the sites of attempted, but failed or partial firestorms. Nothing was special about firestrooms. They were what Washington and London aimed to do to all German cities. Wurzbug was bombed because it was a German city. Whatever other military or economic questions involved were secondary.<br /><br />  The firestorms were produced by dropping millions of small incendiary bombs, that would light a city on fire, often after dropping heavy explosive bombs to blow open buildings so the fires could start inside of them, but still get plenty of air to spread and grow.  If successful, the fires would grow so concentrated that their heat and the explosive force of their consumption of oxygen became more destructive than the worst explosive bombing. The British and American often mixed in delayed action bombs or had several waves of bombing timed so that fire fighters and and other rescuers would be stopped or killed if they attempt to wrestle with the firestorms.<br /><br /> The result, when successful as in Dresden and Wurzburg, was a huge explosive fire that sucked all the oxygen in huge areas of cities. People were incinerated, buildings sometimes exploded as the air was sucked out of them, people were cooked in their own skins, and even shelters that were safe from bomb blasts and heat would lose all their inhabitants to the air stealing fire.<br /><br />  These raids proved the most disastorous forms of murder in human history. In fact, the great firestorm raid on Tokyo in 1945 killed at least 100 thousand people, many more than the use of the Atomic Bomb at Hiroshama or at Nagasaki. And this was the first of many such raids against Tokyo!<br /><br />  The author attempts to deal with larger questions by going through the history of aerial bombing centering on the reasons for the Allied campaign of \\"area bombing\\" in World War II.  Area bombing is the bombings whose targets were largely the populations, the centers, and usually the working class districts of cities.  It was largely promoted by the British and practiced, but not preached by the USAAF during the in the European war, and practiced with a vengence by the USAAF against Japan,  The racist tinge of the American war against Japan made open espousal  of terror bombings up to and beyond the Atomic Bombing of that country a public and popular policy in the United States even though they felt they had to mask such bombing in Europe with the rhetoric of being \\"precision\\" bombing of specific targets.<br /><br /> One of the more interesting things Knell brings out is that British terror bombings and strafing of  defenseless Arab, Afghan, and Indian villagers help set the tone for British bombing in world War II.  Knell also shows that the US and Britain were prepared to wage gas warfare against Germany and how US military leaders came close to using biological warfare against Japan.<br /><br />Knell's major point is that the strategy of \\"strategic\\" bombing was the idea that German resistance would \\"crack\\" after a certain weight of bombing. He points out that the planners of British bombing and later American bombing rejected proposals that they go after the transportation or oil systems of Germany. They chafed at the bit whenever their bombings had to be associated with direct military operations. THEY SAW THEIR TASK AS MURDERING AND \\"DEHOUSING\\" MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, even though every form of analysis showed that such bombing whether against Britain, Japan, or Germany would not produce this effect. Arthur Harris, commander of the UK's Bomber Command actually believed all other military activity was superfluous. The war could be ended if enough Germans were killed by his bombers!<br /><br />  Knell's  states that even from the point of view of Allied or German military objectives, bombing civilians was simply not efficient, although it is obvious his concern is not military efficiency, but at stopping the destruction of cities and the murder of innocent people. He implies that aerial bombing is a violation of international law. He suggests that in a just world the commanders of the British and American air forces in WWII should have been tried as war criminals.<br /><br />  In the course of explaining the history of bombing, Knell produces a very interesting history of the years between the turn of the century and the Second World War, sparing neither the Allied or Axis governments for their roles in fomenting the war as well as the failure of various disarmanent schemes.<br /><br />  At times, Knell gets beyond his depth discussing questions of internetional relations and history that he is not familiar with. Likewise, his prose is not that of a professional writer and the publisher did not devote sufficient resources to copy-edit this book well, an increasing problem in the publishing industry.<br /><br />I would have been happier if there were more evident documentation and examples of what Knell discusses in the abstract.  While he refers to firestorms throughout his book, Knell never explains how the firestorms were created. Much of this book might be confusing to someone who had not learned this elsewhere.<br /><br />  However, the bigger question is posed about the origin of the horror of the area bombings that he justly condemns. Its useless savagery comes out of the equally savage rivalries between the big business cliques that run the imperialist countries of Western Europe, Japan, and America which flared in totwo World Wars so far and could flare up again should crisis conditions like those in the 1930s return. The military and the billionaires they serve still have complete disregard for the great majority of working people, youth, farmers, and other regular people that lead to millions of deaths in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Afganistan, Iraq, and other wars.<br /><br />  After all from area bombing, they went on to nuclear weapons whose task was not just to destroy a city, but to destroy the world.  Chiding them about the savagery of the bombing, mourning the innocent victims of the wars, and proposing international law is not enough.  The disease must be cured at its root.  Production and government for the profits of the wealthy must be replaced with production for the needs of the producers and the people of the world, and government by the workers and the farmers.the more interesting things Knell brings out is that British terror bombings and strafing of  defenseless Arab, Afghan, and Indian villagers help set the tone for British bombing in world War II.

Chords and old time banjo playing especially are not recognized as friends.  If you play old time, then you get a lot of non sense from guitar players or even people trained to play tenor or classic banjo about chords.<br /><br />  However, I find this chord book pretty useful for trying to build backup patterns, even if they are done not by strumming chords, but by playing rolls and frailing patterns where I am not actually making the whole chord but playing the notes of the chord.<br /><br />  I played guitar for about 35 years before I played banjo.  I developed a repertoire of songs based on chords. Having this chord book helped me to learn some of the chords that might seem normal in a guitar players repertoire that seem distant for old timey banjo players.  For example, I did an arrangement of my friend Raeford Starke's song \\"Roughed\\" up that has a BM7.<br /><br />I could not have figured it out without this book.<br /><br />  You will also find that a practice especially jazz players do with a chord book can be useful by trying to play arpeggios of the notes of a chord.  This can get you a lot of notes and how they go together.  It can give you a good bunch of ways to harmonice or play leads around tunes.<br /><br />  Just because you play old time banjo, does not mean that you should be ignorant of music!	2005-06-27
US	43002296	R2X12PGV3ACP1B	0374508844	852326614	The Mass Psychology of Fascism	Books	5	83	95	N	Y	One of the Great Political and Pyschological Works of the 20th Century	If you want to read an outstanding analysis of why conservative \\"family values\\" politics are essential to capitalist society and how they can be defeated by a struggle for women's rights, sexual freedom, and true liberation, read The Mass Pyschology of Fascism.<br /><br />  This work is a product of the marriage of the revolutionary political spirit that erupted in Central Europe with the Bolshevik revolution and the series of near revolutions in the countries Reich lived in until the Hitler Victory in 1933--Hungary, Austria, and Germany--with the great discovery by the Freudians that pathology was a product of patriarchial society and its sexual repression.<br /><br />  In the 1920s and 1930s Reich took Freudianism a step further by pointing out that all the non-materialist, drives, complexes, and factors Freud invented to reconcile his discovery of sexual repression and family produced insanity with conservative views about \\"family values\\" were invalid ideologically driven pseudoscience.  Reich pointed to the fact that Marxists and anthropologists from Morgan in the 19th Century to Malinowski in Reich's time had discovered a pre Patriarchal stage of development predating patriarchy and had also discovered in these socieities or remnants of them, little of the sexual repression Freud postulated was required to maintain society.<br /><br />  So Reich set out in his study of pyschology and in his intervention in the working class political movement of Central Europe to fight for sexual freedom, for women's rights, and for the ending of imperialist and capitalist society.  As his struggle brushed up against the growing adoption of bourgeois antisexual morality in the Soviet Union under Stalin and against the ultraleft and opportunist policies of the Comintern infected with Stalinism, Reich's critique turned on the Stalintern and the degenerated Soviet Union as well.  Though he built a Sexpol movement of thousands of youth, women, and workers fighting against Hitler in Germany, Reich was expelled from the German Communist party as a \\"Trotskyist\\" in 1933.<br /><br />Sadly, with the victory of Hitler followed by the Moscow Trials, Reich withdrew from active working class politics, then despaired of revolution, and became obessed to the point of his insanity in the 1950s with the idea of \\"orgone energy\\" a basic natural universal energy released among other places in good sex.  This bogus theory, observed by no other scientist, grew together with a raging paranoia.  In the end it aided the witchhunting govenrment of the US put him in jail as a medical quack, and had all of his books including this great work burned and banned in the USA.<br /><br />  In this book, a product of Reich's active struggle against Hitler, Reich traces the links between sexual repression, patriarchal society, and conservative and right wing ideology. He explains how patriarchy attempts to create the neurotic mental health that dominates modern capitalist society to use it to reign over working people.  He shows the etiology of religion as a pathological outgrowth of patriarchy, and how conservative \\"family values\\" are decisive to conservatism.<br /><br />  Reich, who built a real movement in Germany for sexual freedom and women's rights, is adamant about how fighters for human freedom and socialism cannot simply dismiss issues of women's rights and sexual freedom, but must embrace them if they are to have a chance to defeat fascists among women and youth. He explains that attempts to compete with fascists about who is the best defender of \\"family values\\" only strengthens conservatism among working men, working women, and farmers who could be won for the struggle.

In fact when I first read this book seriously in the mid-1970s when I devoured everything Reich wrote, reading those two books cast me into a near-suicidal depression.  They are sad commentary on how Reich was destroyed, and many others of his generation was destroyed by the collapse of revolutionary communism and the imposition of STalinism.<br /><br />I actually remember one night in what most have been the spring of 1974, reading this book in my apartment on East Tenth St. in Mahattan, coming to the most complete despair I have ever had in my life, and starting on a course that led to an attempt at suicide!<br /><br />  Put simply, this book is autobiographical.  Reich posits that the problem of the world is that great epoch making prophets and leaders come into the world at each major stage of history.

One may agree with many of Reich's dissections of pathological capitalist and stalinist culture.  Reich's problem is that he blames the average person for what he himself had shown in a shelf of books was the product of big-business inspired culture, politics, and religion and Stalinist imitations of them.  Reich's failure was not to realize that in history women and men have always been able to rise above such ideological and cultural crap and embrace broader visions in movements for great cultural and political change.<br /><br />Reich's paranoia and his belief in Orgone theory--including his final insanity that he was not \\"a little man\\" because his mother had birthed him after an affair with an orgone-enriched extra terrestial,--prevents him from understanding that others minds can be opened by both political movements and big historic events as his was by the First World War, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the struggles he witnessed and participated in Hungary, Austria, and Germany in the 1920s and early 1930s.<br /><br />  After the victory of Hitler, after the Moscow trials in the Soviet Union, Reich's belief in political change began to disappear, while his faith in orgone energy became more and more dominant to his pyschological and sociological outlook and became a personal crusade.

They are sad commentary on how Reich was destroyed, and many others of his generation was destroyed by the collapse of revolutionary communism and the imposition of STalinism.<br /><br />  Put simply, this book is autobiographical.

He had begun as an assistant to Frued.  Yet, Reich was familiar with the Marxist answer to Freud's view of the permanence of the Edipus Conflict that most of human history we had non patriachial structures and not the nuclear family of modern Europe.  Moreover, Reich was also influenced by the Malinowski and other anthropologists who discovered relative sexual freedom, particularly for youth, in prepatriarchal societies in the South Seas and elsewhere.<br /><br />  Armed with these ideas and the spirit of revolutionary Marxism that swept Western Europe after the Bolshevik Revolution (Reich was born in Hungary of Austrian-Jewish parents and lived in Vienna and later Berlin before fleeing to Norway and the US after Hitler came to power), Reich began a radical scientific psychological extension of Freudian pyschology to eliminate the conservative and idealist concepts Freud integrated in the system when Freud realized that his concepts of sexual repression clashed with the conservative family morality of middle class Europe that Freud believed in.<br /><br />This materialist and political aspect of Reich's work is hard to find because after his development of \\"orgone theory\\" in the late 1930s all of his works were reedited to reflect it.<br /><br />Reich was not only widely successful as a pyschoanlyst, but launched a political movement for sexual freedom, particularly for the youth that won thousands of supporters in pre-Hitler Germany.  His best work \\"The Mass Pyschology of Fascism\\" even with its current orgone editing shows how a battle of for sexual rights for the youth, equal rights for women, abortion rights for women, could have cut into the Nazi's support among the Youth.<br /><br />Reich was expelled from the Communist Party of Germany for \\"Trotskyism\\" and fled to Scandanavia when Hitler came to power, for he was surely on Hitler's death list. Across the 1930s, his belief and faith in buidling a political movement waned, and his belief that a sexual energy called orgone was emitted during good sex was born.  By the 1950s, when this book was written, Orgone energy was not restricted to sexual union, but had become a basic underlying energy of the universe with which Reich proposed to cure cancer, built plans to shoot down Soviet jets, and proposed to power spaceships.<br /><br />In the 1920s and early 1930s, Reich understood great events in the world and mass movements such as he had witnessed and participated in in Hungry, Austria, and Germany during those years and a revolutionary movement could allow people to look beyond the limitations of every-day conservative life, and see a bigger picture and create radical change.  Yet, by this time, Reich tended to believe all problems were due to orgone deprivation and more and more began to have the insane and paranoid belief that he was specially infused with orgone and a heroic view of the world because his mother had produced him through an affair with an extraterrestial!<br /><br />Facing this, there seemed no way to resolve the conflict between the great visionaries like Reich and Christ and orgone deprived masses whom this book despises.  Great visionaries are doomed to death.  Christ is murdered, and poor, delude Reich believed he was doomed to be murdered by the conspiracy of the orgone deprived led by Stalin.<br /><br />Sadly, this led him to send many of his papers and documents to the CIA and the US Air Force which made it easy for the government to frame him up as a quack doctor--though Reich only did experimental medicine and psychology in the United States.<br /><br />He was thrown into prison.

He explains how Freud then developed a series of non materialist and non scientific \\"complexes\\" and \\"drives\\" and the entirely nonsensical \\"theory of sublimation\\" to try to reconcile this contradiction.<br /><br />Reich's response to his mentor's contradictions in the 1920s was to launch a psychology that refused to accept sexual repression, conservative sex morality, and patriarchal sex roles, a pyschology that linked itself to the need to overturn capitalism and put working people in power. He became recognized as one of the world's most effective pyschoanlysts, but also built a political movement, first in Austria, then in Germany that involved thousands fighting against Fascism and for women's rights and sexual freedom especially for the youth.<br /><br />For this Reich earned the emnity of Hitler as well as the stalinist Communist party of Germany which expelled him as a Trotskyist.  Sadly, after the defeat in Germany, Reich descended from his political and pyschoanalytic theories to an increasing reliance on the spurious idea of orgone energy--a basic natural universal energy released in good sex and later, according to Reich, floating through the universe. Sadly, this led him to increased paranoia that disarmed him before the sad frame up the McCarthyite witchunt used to frame him up and send him to prison in Lewisburg Pennsylvania to die.<br /><br />  This book does bare marks of Reich's later paranoia and his orgone theory.

Instead, his ideas became filled with his spurious theory of \\"orgone\\" until it became a paranoid obession, one that made it easy work for a witch-hunting US government to frame the great man up, imprison him, and burn and ban his books.<br /><br />This was written before all that happened.  There are two kinds of materials here. First we have Reichs own simply worded modestly picture and accurate autobiography and writing about his youth and how he came into the world of pyschology.  Secondly, we have his memoirs of his work among Austrian workers, and finally we have some memoir and writing about his struggle for sexual freedom in Germany and against Hitler.<br /><br />If you have been turned off by the meglomania and paranoia of his later works, and saddened by how many of his earlier scientific and political works were reedited in the 1950s to include much mumbo jumbo about orgone or about the joint Stalin/Freud conspiracy against Reich, you will find this book a refreshing alternative, a picture of the real strength and greatness of Reich, as well as much closer to the real root of his greatness.  Rather than having an extra amount of orgone energy perhaps due to an affair between his mother and a space alien as the insane late Reich suggested, Reich's greatness came from his being able to combine two great currents. One was the revolutionary optomism and faith in science and in struggle that swept the world in the wake of the Russian revolution, the struggles in Central Europe that almost led to a Soviet Austria, Hungary, and Germany. The other was Freud's great discovery, if tarnished by the later Freud's struggle to create non-materialist drives and complexs and conflicts to reconcile his discovery with conservative capitalist \\"family values.\\" Freud's discovery was that the root of psychological despair and insanity in the world were in the deformation of character and degredation of life in patriarchy.<br /><br />The Reich of the 20s and the thirties who writes in this book believes in a future that can rip away this pathology as well as the other evils of capitalism. His work with Austrian and German workers in real struggles, as well as in clinical practice persuades him of the power of working people to change the world.<br /><br />How distant is this Wilhelm Reich to the bitter, self-serving, maniac of Listen Little Man and the Murder of Christ written in the 1950s.e other was Freud's great discovery, if tarnished by the later Freud's struggle to create non-materialist drives and complexs and conflicts to reconcile his discovery with conservative capitalist \\"family values.\\" Freud's discovery was that the root of psychological despair and insanity in the world were in the deformation of character and degredation of life in patriarchy.   <br /> <br />The Reich of the 20s and the thirties who writes in this book believes in a future that can rip away this pathology as well as the other evils of capitalism.

US	43002296	R3DKDKCR5ITS7C	0060006773	877189313	Dresden: Tuesday, February 13, 1945	Books	4	45	70	N	Y	They tried to do it every time they bombed a city!!	Taylor explains that the huge firestorm bombing of Dresden in Feburary 1945 was not a special exception to create maximum terror.<br /><br />THE TERROR BOMBING OF DRESDEN WAS WHAT THE BRITISH AND AMERICAN BOMBING  AIMED TO DO WHEN THEY HAD MASS BOMBINGS OF CITES. Almost every big raid aimed to be a Dresden or Hamburg. It was simply a hard thing to do, although as he points out, the Allies were able to launch even more devasting firestorm raids on a number of smaller cities.<br /><br /> Taylor also convincingly proves that claims that hundreds of thousands died in Dresden are false echoes of Josef Goebel's propaganda.  He also puts to rest suspicions that the bombing was some kind of threat to the USSR.  Rather, the bombing was specifically requested by Stalin and the leaders of the Soviet general staff.<br /><br />This book aims to be the most complete account in English of the Dresden bombing. Taylor acknowledges the assistance both of texts by and the direct help of a series of contemporary German historians and researchers. He makes use of extensive documentation on the city's life and history as well as of the bombing made available since the collapse of the Stalinist German Democratic Republic and of the USSR.<br /><br /> Taylor places the bombing of Dresden in the context of the overall British and Allied bombing campaigns throughout the war and gives a succinct history of bombing and theory of bombing from the invention of the airplane until the Second World War<br /><br />  Taylor also exposes the myth that Dresden was not a center of the German war machine when it was bombed. Precision optical and other detailed industries in the city had been completely converted to war work by the time of the bombing. Contrary to myth, Taylor points out that Dresden Chinas were never made in Dresden but in a city 20 or 30 kilometers away.  Dresden was the site of a major army barracks and of an air base.  It had become a major railway center for transit of troops and supplies as Hitler's control over the rest of Germany and Central Europe collapsed.<br /><br />Not only was it the site of a permanent army barracks and an air base, but<br />Dresden was in the immediate rear of the Soviet/German war. The eastern half of Dresden  was part of the battlefront and was under direct control of the German front commanders.<br /><br /> Warzburg and other German cities with much smaller military priority than Dresden were firebombed even more severely than Dresden.  The British and US bombers were out to devastate as many German cities as they could regardless of military priority in the waning months of the war.  They believed murdering civilians would lead to disaffection from the war. Indeed, Arthur Harris, commander of the British Bomber Command considered air raids on military or economic targets or, for that matter, all other military operations on land and sea, to be diversions from the task of murdering Germans from the air.<br /><br />In Dresden, like other firebombed cities in Germany and Japan, despite the massive carnage and the \\"dehousing\\" of hundreds of thousands, military targets like the railroads, the military and air bases, in the city suffered relatively little damage.  The US government's studies after the war showed that such bombing strengthened support for war and created fear of an Allied imposed peace among Germans. Indeed, Taylor narrates the story of a trade-union opponent of the Nazis who went through the bombing and how the bombing sparked hatred of the Allies.<br /><br />  Taylor explains that a significant factor in the death toll was the incompetence and corruption of Dresden's Nazi leaders who did not build the types of air raid shelters that German regulations required, shelters that reduced casualties from such raids in other German cities. He also explains how in the dying days of the war, antiaircraft and fighter protection was removed from Dresden and sent to the battle fronts.<br /><br />  Most importantlyhe explains Dresden was only exceptional in that the firebombing and mass slaughter was successful.  He shows that British and US \\"area bombing\\" was designed to create this type of impact every time massive raids were attempted. While firebombing was hard to do given problems with weather, and antiaircraft opposition, in Dresden, exceptional conditions favored the success of the raid.  Yet, the truth of the matter is that every time Britain and the US organized a major bombing of a city during the last years of the war, they aimed to create the same kind of devastating firestorm that murdered tens of thousands in Dresden.<br /><br />  During the Second World War, precision bombing was difficult at best, and often really impossible given problems of technology and weather.  Americans who attempted to bomb in broad day light difficulty in hitting their targets or doing effective damage.  Moreover, the day light bombings by the US led to the death of most US aircrew flying bombers in Europe.  That is despite the fact that unlike other troops who served in battle for the duration of the war, air crew served a set number of sorties and were allowed to return to the USA after that.  More US bomber crew were lost in Europe in World War II, than all Americans were killed in the war in Indochina in the 1960s and 1970s!  Though they bombed at night, British losses of bomber crew exceeded the number of Germans killed on the ground until the policy of area bombing and firebombing was adopted.<br /><br />  Taylor provides an example of how inaccurate bombing was even in 1945. On February 14, an American daylight raid was to follow the British bombing of Dresden on the night of February 13, 1945.  While most of the American bombers did reach Dresden, the pathfinder force that was supposed to lead the American assault flew to Prague instead.  They bombed Prague, Czechoslavkia.  Yet, they believed they had flown to Dresden and bombed it until they returned to England! British and American propaganda during and after the war about the accuracy of their bombing campaigns in Europe and Japan were simply lies. In instances like this they could not even bomb the right city or the right country!<br /><br />  Taylor explains that by 1942 the British believed that firebombing destruction of cities, disrupting the total life of the cities, and murdering thousands of civilians, was the only way that their night bombing be used.  Their model was the German firestorm bombing of Coventry in 1940. In passing Taylor explains that despite British propaganda to the contrary, Coventry had many war industries, especially in the central section of the town that burned.<br /><br />  Indeed, Taylor notes that besides the famous precedent of Hamburg, a number of smaller Germans cities faced firestorm raids more severe than Dresden's if the scale of the city is accounted for.  Several smaller cities suffered fire storm raids whose absolute death toll approached that of Dresden having despite smaller populations.<br /><br />  At Dresden good weather, lack of anti-aircraft or serious fighter opposition, the density of the city, and the materials the central city was built out of, as well as the city's administration's negligence of required air raid shelter and firefighting preparations, came together as they usually did not in such bombing raids, to produce a firestorm. The barbarity at Dresden was not special, but part of the general Allied approach to bombing the German people.<br /><br />  Taylor critiques the perpetually mushrooming figures advanced for the killed at Dresden. He proves from documentary evidence that \\"only\\" between twenty-five and forty thousand died from the bombing.  Taylor makes a convincing case that figures in the hundreds of thousands are based only on Nazi propaganda minister and director of political response to the air war Herman Goebbel's propaganda. Goebbels simply multiplied the figures he had received for casualties by ten in his propaganda as the war closed.<br /><br />  Taylor also disposes of the cynical manipulation of the bombing of Dresden by the Stalinist leaders of the USSR and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).  Like the leaders of USA and Britain, the Stalin and his henchmen had no qualms about the physical annihilation, massive destruction, and despoiling of the working people and farmers of Germany.  No horror inflicted by Washington or London on Germans, Italians, or Japanese was too great for Stalin and his cronies. Their followers in the US and around the world rejoiced at the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan! When Soviet troops arrived in Dresden and other cities in Germany they looted and raped.<br /><br />  In fact, Taylor explains that at the Yalta Conference with Roosevelt and Churchill that ended two days before the Dresden bombing, Stalin and his military leaders requested this bombing of Dresden as well as similar bombings Leipzig and other cities in the immediate rear of the Soviet/German front. This undermines later charges by Stalin and his followers in East Germany that the bombing was launched by the US and Britain as a provocation against the USSR or that the bombing was outside of military priorities.<br /><br />  On the other hand, Taylor rejects claims by witnesses of the bombing and other sources that American fighters strafed refugees from Dresden and survivors of the bombing.<br /><br />  Taylor does not overlook the utter devastation that the bombing brought to the ordinary people of Dresden.  Throughout the book, Taylor tracks the experiences of different citizens of Dresden, school boys, labor oppositionists to the Nazis, factory workers, and professionals.  When we come to the bombing itself, he describes their experiences.  After the bombing itself, he describes the disasters people faced trying to lead their ordinary lives.<br /><br />  As we have passed the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing of Dresden, and other events marking the end of World War II, what is striking is that history shows the real character of the war and of the political leaders who conducted it.  It was a war for the interests of the billionaires who controlled Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, Japan, France, and other imperialist countries. Despite the heroic defense of the conquests of the 1917 revolution, the Stalin bureaucracy consented to every inhuman step whether terror bombing or atomic bombing that the US and Britain took!<br /><br />  Taylor assumes a familiarity with Dresden's location in relation to other cities in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia that the average reader does not have. A simple map of Dresden and adjoining parts of Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia would make this clearer for most readers.ng campaigns in Europe and Japan were simply lies. In instances like this they could not even bomb the right city or the right country!        Taylor explains that by 1942 the British believed that firebombing destruction of cities, disrupting the total life of the cities, and murdering thousands of civilians, was the only way that their night bombing be used.

Indeed, Taylor notes that besides the famous precedent of Hamburg, a number of smaller Germans cities faced firestorm raids more severe than Dresden's if the scale of the city is accounted for.  Several smaller cities suffered fire storm raids whose absolute death toll approached that of Dresden having despite smaller populations.      At Dresden good weather, lack of anti-aircraft or serious fighter opposition, the density of the city, and the materials the central city was built out of, as well as the city's administration's negligence of required air raid shelter and firefighting preparations, came together as they usually did not in such bombing raids, to produce a firestorm. The barbarity at Dresden was not special, but part of the general Allied approach to bombing the German people.         Taylor critiques the perpetually mushrooming figures advanced for the killed at Dresden. He proves from documentary evidence that \\"only\\" between twenty-five and forty thousand died from the bombing.  Taylor makes a convincing case that figures in the hundreds of thousands are based only on Nazi propaganda minister and director of political response to the air war Herman Goebbel's propaganda. Goebbels simply multiplied the figures he had received for casualties by ten in his propaganda as the war closed.          Taylor also disposes of the cynical manipulation of the bombingof Dresden by the Stalinist leaders of the USSR and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).  Like the leaders of USA and Britain, the Stalin and his henchmen had no qualms about the physical annihilation, massive destruction, and despoiling of the working people and farmers of Germany.  No horror inflicted by Washington or London on Germans, Italians, or Japanese was too great for Stalin and his cronies. Their followers in the US and around the world rejoiced at the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan! When Soviet troops arrived in Dresden and other cities in Germany they looted and raped.        In fact, Taylor explains that at the Yalta Conference with Roosevelt and Churchill that ended two days before the Dresden bombing, Stalin and his military leaders requested this bombing of Dresden as well as similar bombings Leipzig and other cities in the immediate rear of the Soviet/German front. This undermines later charges by Stalin and his followers in East Germany that the bombing was launched by the US and Britain as a provocation against the USSR or that the bombing was outside of military priorities.         On the other hand, Taylor rejects claims by witnesses of the bombing and other sources that American fighters strafed refugees from Dresden and survivors of the bombing.          Taylor does not overlook the utter devastation that the bombing brought to the ordinary people of Dresden.  Throughout the book, Taylor tracks the experiences of different citizens of Dresden, school boys, labor oppositionists to the Nazis, factory workers, and professionals.  When we come to the bombing itself, he describes their experiences.  After the bombing itself, he describes the disasters people faced trying to lead their ordinary lives.          As we have passed the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing of Dresden, and other events marking the end of World War II, what is striking is that history shows the real character of the war and of the political leaders who conducted it.  It was a war for the interests of the billionaires who controlled Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, Japan, France, and other imperialist countries. Despite the heroic defense of the conquests of the 1917 revolution, the Stalin bureaucracy consented to every inhuman step whether terror bombing or atomic bombing that the US and Britain took!       Taylor assumes a familiarity with Dresden's location in relation to other cities in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia that the average reader does not have. A simple map of Dresden and adjoining parts of Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia would make this clearer for most readers.	2005-06-13

This book is an absolute treat.<br /><br />  What is very important is that she points out the historical roots of the variety of self-help movements that emerged in the 1980s out of AA and talk shows and non-scientific for profit authors writing books.  They are in right-wing politics, conservative religious attitudes, and documents like Napoleon Hill's 1920s masterpiece of get rich quick hokum \\"Think and Grow Rich.\\"<br /><br />  While they are trivializing real problems, the essential thrust of these criticisms is to remove the social content of mass pathology and emotional problems.  If I have a problem, well, that is my problem. If sixty million Americans and a similar portion of the population of other advanced nations have a problem, the pathology is not just personal, but in social conditions that produce it.<br /><br />  Yet, the self-help movement and the various attempts to extend the ideas of the 12-step religion launched by Alcoholics Anonymous, deflect pressure and attention from what there is about society that produces these pathologies as well as the need of society to provide care, assistance, and understanding for victims.<br /><br />  Wendy wrote this book about 12 or 15 years ago, but I am sure she would add what the natural successors of this crap is. An immediate one is the circuses of the Jerry Springer show variety, where people with such problems are seen as sport, as unfortunate persons whose entertainment value is prime.  Rather than understanding, we can sit, look gloat, trivalize, and pretend to be separated with people with such problems.<br /><br />  Another problem is the growing \\"spiritualization\\" of social and pyschological problems.  \\"Faith based initiatives\\" and the retreat from providing social services, support for meaningful psychological research, and the extreme difficulty in obtaining support for good pyschotherapy even for those of us with insurance are not caused by the self-help group, christian conservatives or anyone, but by big business's desires to take resources from the social wages and advantages of all of us.

The existing books tend to provide a wealth of information about bands, or specific periods of the music. They leave us with joy and perhaps personal celebration, but they don't answer questions that need to be answered to explain Western Swing.<br /><br />Boyd attempts to analyze Western Swing and designate it as part of Jazz, a definition that many people still resist out of ignorance.  Rather than treating Western Swing as a cultural phenomena, she discusses it in musical terms, and relates the methods of playing each instrument to jazz playing of contemporaries.  She also cites interviews with a number of players of each instrument about Western swing playign on their instrument and their own personal experience.  She also gives a picture of Western Swing in in fall from popularity in the late 1950s and 1960s.<br /><br />  I came upon this book in a discussion on a fiddler's list about when Western Swing began. A very wise person who recommended that all interested in that question read this book, helped us clarify that question, not because of some story Boyd tells, but because of way she teaches us how the music developed.<br /><br />  One has the feeling that more funding, more time, more support from the publisher might have brought fourth a larger book. One has the feeling the author is reaching a bit far sometimes to situate some of the music as just Jazz.<br /><br />  However, I think the problem is the paucity of books on the subject of Western Swing. Because we want more, because those of us have spoken with the old timers, or haunt the web sites, the reunions, etc, want more, we tend to put too much pressure on the few books to appear.  What is really needed is a greater study of Western swing both in regard to analysis, formal musical study, and memories.<br /><br />  This one is worth a read because it tries to present categories to judge Western swing and its development. Perhaps more struggle, more writing by experts like my friend Buddy will show this text's inadquacies.  Yet, until that happens, this is one of the best, if only, books out there.<br /><br />TTf Western Swing.

Otherwise, this is a throw away.<br /><br /> The most startling new information provided in this book are that Prescott Bush was a Senator from Maine and that Winston Churchill was prime minister of the United Kingdom during the 1939 German invasion of Poland.  Of course, Prescott Bush was a senator from Connecticut, and Churchill became prime minister in the Spring of 1940 after the Anglo-French invasion of Norway was defeated by the simultaneous German invasion.<br /><br /> France and England did not really come to the \\"rescue\\" of Norway from a German invasion. They had planned  their own invasion of Norway at the same time as the German invasion.  They were delayed by several hours due to weather and claimed to be helping Norway against Germany. Paradoxically, Chamberlain fell because of the fiasco in Norway, and Churchill who was the architect of this disaster became prime minister! Of course, this is the kind of fact you are never told about the war, that someone like Wright could never tell you.  I expected to find such things in this book.<br /><br />Mike Wright's ignorance and  the absence of any apparent fact checking by the publisher indicate that both are worthless as sources of serious information.<br /><br />  With no special knowledge or interest in World War II, Wright compiles a bunch of humorous or trivia-related vignettes about the war as he appears to do about as many subjects as he can publish books.<br /><br />  However,I feel sorry for someone like the author who believes people need to know how Swooze Kurtz--whatever she does???--got her name. I feel sorrier for someone who is bamboozled into thinking this is a book with new information about the greatest tragedy in human history.  A war in which scores of millions of people died and many countries laid waste deserves more than drivel like that!<br /><br />  With the opening of the archives of the old USSR and the GDR, all sorts of information that was not known before is available for a serious author who really wants to tell us things that we weren't told about WWII. I expected this kind of information when I purchased this book. Yet, Wright is oblivious to the fact the major segment of WWII in Europe was fought between the USSR and Germany and its allies.<br /><br />His goal is to provide quick, entertaining, light reading on a subject that is neither quick, entertaining, nor light.<br /><br />  The copy editing and fact checking in this book is simply not professional.  While a bibliography which is useful is provided, there is absolutely no regular sourcing in this book, which may, in fact, be a tribute to adequacy of his sources, compared to the inadequacy of his history.  As somone who teaches college students to discern which books to use for research papers and which to avoid, I would advise people to avoid any book brought out by this publisher for serious research or reliable knowledge.<br /><br />  This book does have its moments. He gives an interesting blow by blow picture of the draft process when it was launched in 1941.  He also provides interesting information about the deportation of Japanese Americans and Canadians, and about German prisoners of war in the US.<br /><br /> However, though he condemns Japanese brutality to Allied prisoners, Wright is completely silent the attrocities the US and UK  perpetrated against Japanese soldiers who wished to surrender.  Allied policy was usally not to take Japanese prisoners, but to massacre them.  A grisly trade in Japanese sculls and gold teeth  sent back to the USA grew up during the War. This is the kind of fact about World War II that \\"They Didn't Teach You\\" that is light years away from anything Mike Wright knows.<br /><br />  For a better look check out \\"Why the Allies Won.\\" For an even better set of information about the Pacific war that is NEVER TOLD consult War Without Mercy by John W. Dower which will tell you about Allied abuse of Japanese prisoners as well as Japanese crimes against other Asian peoples.<br /><br />  I found this book OK to read while I was sick in bed. I did not want anything demanding, although I must say that one driving factor in getting me to finish it was to see how many ignorances and errors the book contained. Like the one Harliquin romance I read under similar circumstances, I thought it was appropriate to throw the book away when I finished it.<br /><br />It is unfortunate Amazon does not permit one to have 0 stars or negative quantites of stars.W.

Many of the commonplaces and original wisdoms presented here about Black music and culture are intersting and worthwhile.  For this reason, this book belongs within the libraries of those interested in Black folk culture and music in particular.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, when he tries to create some revolutionary political character to the song and a view of \\"the lumpen\\" which we all thought was safely buried when the Black Panthers became Democratic party ward heelers and sellers of codd pieces, Brown falls flat on his face.<br /><br />  There is no way to transcend the dominant culture except through politics.  Stagolee, the lumpen as he preaches them, do not represent any new vision or revolutionary spirit of suffering African Americans, much less our struggle to liberate ourselves, but quite the opposite. They represent a group  that even more than the average working person strives to achieve and obtain the goals and values of this corrupt and exploitative society. Rather, than some threat, they are quite useful to those who wish to retain power and vice versa.<br /><br />What is also interesting is how, contrary to the life styles, Wall street morals, and Washington manners of the real lumpen like Stagolee, the song and the legend were given other clothing by Black working people, farmers, youth, prisoners, struggling for a way out of the racist hell hole of Jim Crow. Instead of a man who never found problems being \\"bad\\" and mean to African Americans, and never found much problems with the police, Stagolee is converted into the opposite. The more heroic the song and the image of Stagolee becomes, the more divorced from the reality of who he real was, and what the social scum he came  from really represents.<br /><br />  That's the real political and social lesson in what Brown explains of the reality of the Stagolee story. The actual Stagolee was a pimp and hustler who exploited the bodies of Black women. His major interest came in his political pimping for the Democratic party whose task at the time was nothing less than the overthrow of whatever gains remained from Reconstruction and the establishment of Jim Crow segregation throughout the South and beyond. His antagonism with Billy Lyons was rooted in Lyon's attachment to a rival gang of pimps and thugs who preyed on Black people under the auspices of the Republican party.<br /><br />The murder actually did reach its point after Lyon's alledged disrespect of the hat, an adoption by the lumpen of the ruling class's views that things are more important than people.<br /><br />Rather than being seen as a challenge to White society, Stagolee was defended by the top lawyer in St. Louis.  Even after he was convicted of murder, Stag served only a year or so before being released due to the influence of his friends in the Democratic party.  In fact, Brown explains that Stagolee went on to murder another African American, was again convicted of a minimal sentence, and was in prison about to be released early again thanks to the Democrats of Missouri, when he died.<br /><br />Despite, Brown's silly attempt to claim that the lumpen, or the image is some kind of revolutionary threat to dominance, the behaviors of pimps, theives, drug dealers, and other \\"lumpen\\" are if anything an extreme version of the dominant society's worst values. The basic idea is that getting money, having wealth, and using violence and ignoring the solidarity of Black people and other working folks is the road to power.  That is nothing less than the thinking that the Rockefellers, the Duponts, the Bushes, and the Kerry's use to justify their exploitation of the rest of us and their barbaric wars against the peoples of the world!<br /><br />As someone who was quite active in the civil rights and Black power movements, and knew and worked with leaders of the Black panthers in the Bay area and around the country, I never saw much of a response from this layer of the black community to the struggle on any level.  On the other hand group composed mainly of African American students and workers like the BPP did ten to be taken in by these attitudes distracted from and turned away from the struggle and diverted into unprincipled deals with the the cops and the politicians, alcoholism, disrespect for women, thuggery against working people and students, drug addiction, and drug dealing, and receive rather serious blows against their ability to struggle for liberation.<br /><br />In regard to the editorial questions raised previously, I think we are facing a crisis in publishing, even with academic publishing houses, publishing works like this by an academic. This is not the first book that I written on TODAY, where editorial misconduct and confusion is such that mistakes that take not an expert, but a normally literate person should be able to eliminate abound.

Count Basie never was the kind of person you would expect to write a tell all, or note how much reefer was being smoked like Buck Clayton did in his memoir, or spill the inside dope on John Hammond as a number of Basieites have in their books and interviews.<br /><br />  Basie has always been a cool professional, concerned with handling the business side, keeping everybody happy, and keeping the ship above the water.  He goes by the old watchword from the 50s we used to have \\"Maintain your cool at all times.\\"<br /><br />  Thus we get a memoir that has a lot of places and names in it, a lot about working in the band, but very little that is going to surprise or wow anyone who isn't into the Basie story. He stays pretty close to the vest, and presents a very easy going story.<br /><br />  One example of  how this book smoothes over conflict and controversy and makes everything seem smoother than the truth is how it treats the departure of Claude Fiddler Williams from the Basie Band in 1937. While the ignorant think Freddie Green was Basie's only guitarist, Williams was the band's first guitarist--and he was Downbeat guitarist of the year that year--and also played hot jazz fiddle solos with the band. Only the Live at the Chatterbox recording lets you hear his brilliant fiddling.<br /><br />When the band arrived in New York, John Hammond who acted like manager, director, and overlord over the band for years, decided the Fiddler's violin was too \\"country\\" and replaced him with Freddie Green who was playing in a New York Club when Basie arrived in the Apple.<br /><br /> Williams who lived until last year (2004) always said John Hammond fired him, although he says he felt grateful in the end because his career as an independent fiddle soloist would have never taken off had he stayed with Basie.  In this book, Basie says that he and Williams came to a friendly parting of the ways that let Williams become independent.  There is lots of smoothed over stuff like this.<br /><br />  To be fair, this was more or less of an interview with an aging Basie with little attempt to research things. Many things get hazy or are remember conveniently as the years pass on, as I am coming to realize myself as I enter my late 50s.<br /><br />  The book also suffers from Albert Murray's interviewing. Murray never presents his credentials in his appearances as an \\"expert\\" on Jazz.  In fact he is a retired Air Force General and has never been a musician, a musicologist, or anything professionally associated with music.  He's imposed his own rather conservative viewpoint on Jazz as the all American capitalist product, rather than an expression of Black culture, oppression, and a struggle to Africanize music. Rather, Murray priviledges a progression to take Jazz closer to the forms of European classical music. So, it is no surprise that Murray isn't going to try to ferret out controversy, difficult truthes, or unconventional behavior, particularly with a man as cool and under control as Bill Basie.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, there is a lot of information here that exists nowhere else. Sadly, no one has written a serious biography of Basie, or a serious study of his music save for the section on him in Gunter Schuller's great book on Swing. Until that takes place, this is the book.<br /><br />Like most books of this kind, the part about Basie's life before he became famous, growing up, learning his chops on piano in New York, travelling with TOBA shows, hooking up with Rushing, then with the Blue Devils, then with Moten, are the most interesting and readable parts of this book.  Similarly, the book speeds up and summarizes too quickly the closer it gets to the time the interviews took place.<br /><br /> One thing is nice is the list of who took what solo on some of the Old Testament sides.<br /><br />  Still, Basie is important enough for every true Jazz lover, or at least every true swing lover, to own this book, particularly as a cheap used edition can be obtained for little!portant enough for every true Jazz lover, or at least every true swing lover, to own this book, particularly as a cheap used edition can be obtained for little! <br /> <br />	2005-04-18

The people interviewed in this book are leading Swing musicans. They may not be well-known to the neo-swingsters, or those whose idea of swing is big band white swing groups that were essentially pop oriented parasites on Black music, nor are post swing proto rock and rollers misidentified with Swing like Louis Jordan or Louis Prima featured.<br /><br />  However, if you interested in serious swing musicians who were at the center of the jazz swing music, African American pioneers, and jazz oriented white musicians this is your book.<br /><br />  Dance is a great interviewer here and in his other world of books. He gets behind the common places to points that MUSICIANS really want to know about the player's experience.<br /><br /> An example is the interview he did with Elmer Snowden in which a dying Snowden allows him to use his secret that he used guitar strings on his banjo is precisely for those of us who recognize Snowden as a major Jazz banjoist, a major band leader, a senior stateman of Jazz, even though he may remain unknown among white yuppie swing wannabes (or has another fad captivated these know-nothings?).<br /><br />  Dance also interviews enough of the great arrangers--a group neglected by everyone except musicians and serious swing fans--that we get a pictures of their contributions.<br /><br />  This book is not narrow. There are lots of connections from the Swing world of the 30s and 40s back to earlier forms of Jazz and forward to bop, R & B, and even rock and roll here.<br /><br />  My favorite part of the book is where he takes a poll of all his interviewees. My favorite part is where the musicians are asked what they would do if they were not musician. We see a bunch of interesting alternatives that help you gauge the personality and background with their alternatives.  My favorite is the player--I will let you discover who he is--who says \\"I would rather be dead\\" than not play music!

We have the noble faithful servent in the person of Linda Brent's mother who buys herself with the aid of white who honors her position, we have attempts to escape through the sexual favors of a white man, we have people buying their way out of slavery, we have violent and non violent escapes. We also see Linda Brent's resistence and the success of her clandestine life and later her escapes to Philiadephia, then New York, then England, as a result not only of her individual bravery, character, and devotion to her people and her family and her honor, but of the existence of resources beyond the slave and Black community that can free not only the individual slave but put an end to slavery. We also have the racism that made Jacobs feel not totally free in the North.<br /><br />This is the crucial place Incidents belongs. The publications (Uncle Tom was first published as a serial in an antislavery newspaper and later published as a book) of Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1850 and 1852 unleashed at the dialog opened among contemporary African American texts about how to eliminate slavery in response to Stowe's great work. Harriet Beecher Stowe had recommended the Christic experience of evangelical Christianity in Uncle Tom, Martin Delany recommended the reculturation of Blacks by a bourgeois independent state's aristocratic and cultural leadership, William Wells Brown pointed to the ship of capitalism coming the vanquish the slave ships.<br /><br />Jacob's text enters this debate with an array of forces within the African American slave and free community, as well as within the Southern white community, as well as the Northern and even international community that can be used to defeat slavery. We have the slaves themselves debating, organizing, and resisting. We have freed Blacks North and South helping. We have whites in the South itself helping, if inadequately. We have supporters of women's rights and opponents of slavery among the women of the North. We have the international opponents of slavery in Britain and beyond.<br /><br />Jacobs highlights not only her own incredibly courageous resistance to slavery, but to the array of forces available to fight slavery.

She wasn't a paid musicologist, but she was determined to find out the story of African American music from the time we got off the slave ships until the Civil War.  She emerged with a triumph.<br /><br />  No one who has not read this book really knows anything about African American, or for that matter American culture and music, worth knowing.  Rather than the abstract dwelling on Africanism in this or that part of Black culture, she refutes the idea that the slaves were robbed of their culture she shows how the musical culture of West Africa was carried here and how it was modified and added to.<br /><br />  One of the most interesting aspects of Epstein's book for me is the record of the many different African instruments that were brought to the New World or were remade by Africans in the New World.  The common idea that African instruments were limited to drums is refuted here strongly with her references to descriptions of different instruments found in the US and the West Indies. Along the way, Epstein was one of the first to reassert the AFricanness of the banjo and document it.<br /><br />  One interesting question which with the easiness of hindsight and futher research I raise is the issue of fiddling. Epstein documents that contrary to the popular stereotype that AFricans in the America were primarily banjoists or drummers, in the US until the point in the 19th Century when banjos became generally available and popular among most black and poor folks, African American musicians were most closely indentified with the fiddle. This is true not only in the US but in the West Indies.<br /><br /> Epstein does document how quickly after being \\"imported\\" African born musicians became excellent players of the fiddle, makers of fiddles, and even teachers of fiddling.  She points out that the fiddle was so essential to the lives of planation African Americans that the question of whether the slave master should provide his slaves with a full time fiddler for slave dances was debated in circles who discussed how to manage slaves.<br /><br />  The question is really posed that such quick mastery of a very difficult instrument, and the rather rapid way it was used to play African based music could not be just a coincidence or a product of some kind of general African musical ability, but the product of retention of traditions that come from West African bowed instruments.  Blacks who were fiddlers already in AFrica on African fiddle like instruments were enslaved, and their rapid progress another feature of transmission of AFrican culture into this country.<br /><br />  Of course, I am looking back from advances pioneered by Epstein and those who followed her.<br /><br />  Read this books and celebrate that triumph and learn what must be known about Black music and American culture.time fiddler for slave dances was debated in circles who discussed how to manage slaves.

Bop may have been led by Gillespie, Parker, Monk,Powell, and Roach, but it came to fruition because it reflected ferment, not just in society, but ferment among the musicians that produced it, and change not only in the music, but in their lives. This book documents that change, not just in music but in the life styles, impressions, and experiences of the musicians, some famous, some not so famous, some who went to Bop, some who stayed with swing.<br /><br />  The whole mid 1940s Jazz scene is one that many, if not most, Jazz lovers are ignorant of beyond the recordings that Bird made. Most people who should read this book will have never heard of Claude Thornhill, or even Woodie Herman. Sadly, there are a lot of folk out there who think they are Jazz lovers who never heard of the \\"The Birth of Cool.\\"<br /><br />  Dig deep into this book because not only will you know about it and add some dates and people to your history list, but you will see what folks used to call THE BIG CHANGE documented in the real lives of real women and men.

Books	5	3	3	N	N	The most important book in American History	Uncle Tom is probably the most important single book written in the United States of America. No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.<br /><br />To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.<br /><br />This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.<br /><br />Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.<br /><br />To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.<br /><br />Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.<br /><br />Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.<br /><br />In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.<br /><br />No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.<br /><br />Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.<br /><br />Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her descriptionof slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.<br /><br />Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.<br /><br />Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom. However, Delany's hero does not submit to being sold \\"down the river.\\" He instead runs away and travels throughout the US following the same course as the travels in Uncle Tom showing how slave conditions are so much worse than Stowe showed. Finished with that business, Blake leaves the United States for Cuba where he becomes part of a group of Afro-Cubans unwilling to suffer like Christ and Uncle Tom. Like the current leaders of Cuba, they start to organize an international revolution of Slaves and the oppressed!as.

I spoke with a historican of whaling at the Mystic Seaport in Connecticut. In fact we were aboard the Morgan, the ship used in both the 1920s and 1960s films of Moby Dick.  He explained to me that for the common sailor of the day, nothing was so horrific as going on a whaling voyage.  The historian told me that no one who had been on such a voyage would ever go on one again, save the top officers and ship owners.  Yet, Melville sailed several times chasing the whales!<br /><br />  Besides the personal and existential issues that this book poses, we have to also look at this as a book about the first invasions of the global personally indiscriminate capitalist economy into the early 19th century world of Ishmael.

No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.<br /><br />To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.<br /><br />This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer. If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus. It is, in fact, the solution.<br /><br />Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.<br /><br />To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.<br /><br />Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ. That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.<br /><br />Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.<br /><br />In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.<br /><br />No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.<br /><br />Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers. In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold amillion copies between its publication and the civil war.<br /><br />Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.<br /><br />Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected. However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe. Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.<br /><br />Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom.

A 46-year-old African American political with long experience in real danger in political struggle, I wept when Uncle Tom died in this book, even though I was reading it for graduate school.<br /><br />  Using the cliff notes for this book allows you to read this properly as Stowe meant it to be, as her contemporaries meant it to be read, but to keep up with the details of all the characters and plot devices that literally range all over the United States with implications and discussions going around the globe.<br /><br />I would also urge you to consult Eric J.

He explained to me that particularly for the 19th century man, a whaling voyage was one of the most horrible experiences anyone could imagine. The historian confessed that except for the top echnlon of ship's officers or highly skilled sailors who received significant portions of the voyage's profits \\"no one with common sense who had been on a whaling voyage would ever do it again.\\"  Yet, Melville sailed several times as a common sailor on whaling voyages!<br /><br />  Besides the personal and existential issues that this book poses, we have to also look at this as a book about the first invasions of the global personally indiscriminate capitalist economy into the early 19th century world of Ishmael. The New England villages which he comes from are small collections of independent producers who know each other, following trades or farming earth their parents have passed down in. Barter on most things was just replaced in the crisis of monetization of the New England economy that followed the American revolution which led to the armed revolutions and state civil wars in New England that forced Washington and the other \\"founders\\" to establish the constitution and a strong federal government to crush the rebels who wanted to go back to the demontarized past.<br /><br />  Melville's character comes from a world where by and large everyone works for themself, their family, or perhaps someone they know.<br /><br />  Yet, Ishmael is thrown into a new world, where he is simply an employee in one of the first world industries, the whaling industry. Rather than his own master, or learning to become a master in a trade, or learning to run the family farm, he is thrown into a new world where the world market for whale oil, whale ivory, and other products command him.  Instead of the regular unfolding of crops on the season and trade activity reflecting that, Ishmael's voyage follows the whales around the globe, and its end is not regular.<br /><br />  The author's use of Ahab and his arbirtrariness and the device of the great white whale, impose these new conditions in a way that emphasizes them and makes them stand out.  Beyond the person issues, they represent the subjection of Ishmael and more and more of the world economy to blind, irrational to the average person, forces that will continue to conquer the world from Melville's time to ours, throwing us into periods of boom and bust, depression, recession, unemployment, insecurity, and world wars and rivalries.<br /><br />  Melville's fascination with whaling is also shown by the many chapters which simply relate the many traditions and experience from the ancients until his day of whalers.regular unfolding of crops on the season and trade activity reflecting that, Ishmael's voyage follows the whales around the globe, and its end is not regular. <br /> <br />      The author's use of Ahab and his arbirtrariness and the device of the great white whale, impose these new conditions in a way that emphasizes them and makes them stand out.

It is also nicely put together, clear, incisive, and provides the joy that comes from reading a book that explains things right that have been either explained wrong forever, or never explained before.<br /><br />  Literature and canon are artifical categories constructed after the fact usually under the impact of political, sexual, and social dominance, not necessarily literary achievement, whatever that is, and not at all readership. Tompkins explodes the idea of the American Literary Renaissance by pointing out that Sentimental Women Writers like Susan Warner and Harriet Beecher Stowe were selling hundreds of thousands of copies of their books, while Hawthrone never sold more than a few thousand coies of anything.  Even with Hawthrone she explains how the different attitudes of readership and thought made the Marble Faun, a work much neglected and unread, be considered as his most important work in his time.  She also does mention how history might not have been as kind to Hawthrone's place in literature had he not married his children into families that controled the Atlantic Monthly and what would become the Harvard Literature department.<br /><br />  More importantly, Tompkins unravels the mechanisms of the Sentimental novel such as Warner's The Wide Wide World and Stowe's immortal Uncle Tom. Tompkins explains how the text's purpose was the create \\"sympathy\\" seen in the physical form of tears, and how much of their approach corresponded with the notions of reality comment among its readership.<br /><br />  This work belongs on the shelf of anyone who seeks a serious knowledge of American literature and of 19th Century Culture. Moreover, the insights she provides on Uncle Tom make this book a must for people interested in the storm of literary discourse the book provoked among African American writers on one side and pro-slavery writers on the other.discourse the book provoked among African American writers on one side and pro-slavery writers on the other. <br />	2005-01-07

No one is really familiar with American culture, literature, relgion, and history if she or he has not read Uncle Tom.<br /><br />To understand this book, I would urge people to consult Eric J. Sundquist's  book New Essays on Uncle Tom's Cabin (The American Novel) and Jane Tompkin's Sensational Designs. The 19th Century world and reader that Stowe aimed at read and understood things so differently, that you will miss much without knowing how to look at this book the way Stowe wrote to them and the way they read.<br /><br />This book has a broad purpose: literary to decide what is wrong with the entire world and present an answer.  If you follow the sweep of the book you will find Stowe takes on everything from whether the issues of the 1848 revolutions can be resolved on the side of Democracy, to the question of marital relations amogn the free and the white. The issue of slavery is not the book's only focus.  It is, in fact, the solution.<br /><br />Stowe's real thesis here is that American Chattel slavery is the number one evil in the world, that this evil corrupts every institution in society North and South and corrupts far beyond the borders of the United States, and that no compromise with it or avoidance of it is possible.<br /><br />To Stowe, slavery is an abomination not just because of the cruelty, savagery, exploitation, and degradation involved, but above all, it is an abomination against God, the most unChrist-like behavior possible.<br /><br />Thus the relgious solution she offers is to become more Christlike in your opposition to slavery and to finally undergrow the Christic experience of dying for your sins and being reborn in Jesus Christ.  That's right, in Stowe's time evangelical Christianity, rather than being a fob for right-wing politics, was practiced by some of the militant and serious opponents of slavery.<br /><br /> Stowe creates figures that are Christlike who like Christ die rather than yield to sin and influence the others in their faith. The supreme figure is of course Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, as a a pejorative, comes not from this novel, but from the Tom shows that blossomed in the late 19th century which were a presentation of a mock version of this story with racist minstrel like charicatures of the African American characters.<br /><br /> In this book, Uncle Tom is a physically majestic, heroic, dignified person, whose faith and dignity are never corrupted, whose death is shown as a parallel to that of Christ in the resurrection of the souls of all around him required to eliminate Slavery. If he is passive, never disobeys his masters, and seems to have not much of a material interest of his own in life, it is because to Stowe this a reflection of his Christic nature.<br /><br /> No doubt at best Stowe sees him as a \\"noble savage\\" at Best. There is no doubt if one reads this book and even more clearly STowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin which provided documentation for this book's depiction of slavery, that it is clear that Stowe did not believe African Americans were equal to whites. Her then-current immigrationist views are expressed in the way the one intelligent independently acting Black couple presented here leave the US for Canada once they escape slavery.<br /><br />Yet, this book accomplished the purpose it had. It galvanized millions of Americans and more millions around the world to dramatically oppose slavery. Uncle Tom was one of the first true international best sellers.  In a smaller country, where literacy was lower, and when many people bought books through private libraries where families shared books and the book was often read to family gatherings rather than by one person, Uncle Tom sold two hundred thousand copies in its first year and sold a million copies between its publication and the civil war.<br /><br />Stowe was honest in her afterward and in other writings to say that her description of slavery in Uncle Tom is much prettier and more nicer than slavery was. She believed an accurate depiction of slavery--Stowe had lived in Cincinatti on the board with slaving Kentucky and traveled through the South--would be so revolting that her target audience of Northern whites would not read this book.<br /><br />Her book launched a torrent of responses from white southerners as could be expected.  However, the popularity of her book encouraged white authors, but especially Black authors to write antislavery books that responded to Stowe.  Some of the foundations of Black American literature by authors like Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Harriet Jacobs, and Martin Delany are essentially response to Uncle Tom.<br /><br />  Perhaps the most dramatic is Delany's Blake or the Huts of America whose character is a double to Uncle Tom.

They delineate a lot about the Uncle Tom and its place in the literary and political discourse that it unleashed. This book and others of its series are extremely useful for students and professors because they gather together the best articles written in the scholarly journals by key authorities on texts.

She is a very clear writer without any of the foolish over complication of the academic writer, even in academic journals. She's firm in her beliefs. She's not neutral or oblivious to racism and injustice to oppression and exploition either in the historical worlds she has excavated or in her discussion of the present.<br /><br />While Yellin is accurate and in total possession of her subject, she is precise about what we and she do not know about Harriet Jacob's life.<br /><br />  This is more than what many might have expected which is a fleshed out version of her explication of the true biological facts of Harriet Jacobs autobiography, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. This a biography of Harriet Jacobs as a Black woman facing the crises of her time, both in public political life and in personal and economic life.<br /><br />  As such, as is her practice, Jacobs takes a broad view, so what we read about Jacobs is continually inserted into the changing events of the nation, of Black people, of women. What is most compelling is Jacob's struggle to involve herself in the antislavery movement by writing her book, and then the story of Jacob's struggles to fight for support to the freed slaves and war refugees. Finally, there is a very good explanation of the split between Afrian Americans and the white section of the women's movement as figures in this womens movement turned in such a racist direction, that women like Jacobs and her daughter Maltida could no longer function within it.<br /><br />  Jacob's remarkable life after the civil war led her into contact with a number of the most notable white and African American literary and political figures including people you might never suspect like Henry James and  William Monroe Trotter, so that anyone interested in womens, literary, and African American history from the 1850s until the 1890s would profit by reading this book. Yet, despite this prominence, it was assumed by most scholars as a Black woman she had not really written her book, until Yellin and other scholars proved this in the 1970s!<br /><br />  Jacob's wrote so opens the struggle of my life. Yellin presents that life of struggle not for the seven years that Jacobs hid in her closet, but throughout the seven decades of her life.<br /><br />  Again, Jean Fagan Yellin is a good readible, accurate writer who makes this a page turner without losing any of the dignity, scientific precision, and historic importance of this task.as a Black woman she had not really written her book, until Yellin and other scholars proved this in the 1970s!

I illustrated my point by referring to the pictures alone in this book.  She turned to me and said, \\"I have to read this book.\\"<br /><br />  So do you, if you really want to have an understanding of string band music, not only in North Carolina's piedmont, but throughout the South.  He takes you from the 1890s to the 1960s, and without presenting heavy conclusions of his own, presents information that will allow you to see much, learn more, and will treasure forever.<br /><br />  This is an important book, whose relevance may be dimmed by the misplaced expectations of those who have awaited it. With Bob Carlin, master banjoist, accompaniest of John Hartford and Joe Thompson among others, and not a shabby guitarist as I can testify, most folks expected a book about the techniques of band music here. That isn't what this book is.<br /><br />  This book is really about who was and is a string band musician in Piedmont Carolina, although there is also much in this book about other parts of the state, and how this fits in to what was going on in the whole South and the nation.  This is about who became musicians, how they grew up, where they played, how it fit into lives farming, factory working, or bumming around, how it changed as we went from the 1890s until the 1960s. I've been reading about Old Time Music for 40 years, but I have never seen this done in such a concentrated way.<br /><br />  One of the joys of this book is the many pictures of musicians, bands, band wagons, bands playing at functions, and of musicians showing off their instruments. For several musicians he has shots of them starting in the 1920 or before on up to the 40s, or 50s or 1960s in which you can see the change or lack of it of selection of instruments that were accumulated.  In fact his pictures confirm two of my pet concerns: the inclusion in the old time bands of the cello, and the later involvement of the tenor banjo in the whole deal.ack of it of selection of instruments that were accumulated.

I don't just mean banjo, but any kind of music, and I am sure people writing other instruction books can learn from this too.<br /><br />Too many banjo books center on the author showing off his own virtuosity and presenting a course that really isn't helpful to a beginner.  This book IS oriented at getting a beginner going playing the banjo, learning how to do everything practically.  You will be playing tunes quickly, but more importantly you will be learning basics about the banjo that will take you further places.<br /><br />All along, Pat has very good and basic tips about banjo playing that often are not in banjo books that can save a beginner who cannot afford a teacher much trouble.<br /><br />What impresses me is that this book teaches basic concepts of music to the new player without going into things an old time banjoist doesn't need to know.  Pat's concept of a player is someone who is really getting to learn more broadly about music itself than what a particular instrument can do.  This is a good approach, but I have never seen it done as practically as in this book.<br /><br />My only quibble is Pat's obession with doing everything in the G tuning. One is taught to play in other keys by making chords and positions from the G tuning, something that I've never heard of before in an instruction book, although I confess I have done this playing in bands when my knowledge of the banjo was scant and inaccurate.<br /><br /> Old time banjo is played in a multiplicty of tunings. Indeed, the adjustment of the tuning is really key to this approach to music unlike the tenor banjo, plectrum banjo, bluegrass banjo, or guitar. Even a beginner who hopes to play old time music should learn the double c tuning, the D tuning, and the sawmill tuning.<br /><br />Despite this one drawback, this is a great instruction book. The thinking is clear and easy to understand. The book addresses practical problems a beginner will face in clear and easy and instructive language, there is a good selection of real old time songs here that are worth the price of the book.<br /><br />This is a good book to use, but once you get picking look around for information about other tuningsclear and easy to understand.

The sweep of this book is that entire period.  In this way Harper is really registering what is the last in a long dialog of texts about what social power can or did overthrow slavery, and what forces are behind this.  Harper's opening chapters about the slaves under slavery, the slaves during the civil war, their actual role in stopping the confederacy, the intelligence of the slaves, and all are not just idle depictions, but responses to those like Delany who felt the slaves were incapable of revoltion.  Harper's analysis of the strength and the struggle of the freedmen and freedwomen after slavery tends to also reply to the debate about whether they were worthy of freedom, and whether the fall of reconstruction was inevitable.<br /><br />  At times Harper's concern for these debates weakens the plot as a modern reader would see it.  Moreover, though her description of struggle through out the early parts of the book is gripping, as you gets to the close without more to offer than education and social uplift, the book also tends to seem weak to the modern reader trained to more visceral and personalized plotting.  When Harper wrote, particularly in the tradition she writes, often the overall message as she delivers it, was seen so much more important than the plot. A message such as this was what the reader bought a book for then.<br /><br />Like Blake and Incidents in the Life of  a Slave Girl this is a historic document. Unlike so of those texts, this is written with hind sight from decades latter, by one of the last of the pre-civil war Black literary/political intellectuals to survive.	2004-12-26

Unlike Douglass, Delany was even known in West Africa from which he recently returned where he had negotiated with AFrican leaders about with his economic and political plans.  Indeed, in the months while Blake was published as a serial in the Anglo-African newspaper, Delany toured the US lecturing on Africa wearing African robes!<br /><br />  Delany's book is one in a series of texts written by African American authors in response to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Despite Stowe's assistance to this project by writing small poems introducing it,one of the sub texts of Blake is to show the difference between the realities of Slavery and the picture Stowe painted in Uncle Tom. Indeed, Daleny's hero Henry Blake is placed in the exact same place time and position as Uncle Tom, but instead of heroically suffering and dying and inspiring while refusing to physically resist slavery, Henry Blake runs away from slavery to organize an international revolution against slavery.<br /><br />(To be fair, Stowe admits in Uncle Tom's Cabin her book made slavery seem nicer than it really was because she believed slavery was so awful that the white Northern readers she targeted would be too disgusted to read a book that accurately described it.  Moreover, by the time Delany wrote Blake, Stowe's views had become more militant. She had written Dred, a book whose Black hero leads a slave revolt.)<br /><br />  Blake reflects the deep pessimism of the period, ironically only a few years before the end of slavery. In fact, though he was born free and had no fear of the fugitive slave laws, Delany had left the United States and moved to Chatham, Ontario by the time he wrote Blake, so despairing he was of the future of Black men.  Delany urged Black people to leave the United States and proposed building an independent Black nation in Central America that could be a base for liberation of the slaves in all of the Americas.<br /><br />  This task is taken upon in fictional guise by Henry Blake the hero of this novel. He escapes and goes on a travel through the slave and free states of the US, in  a round based on the travels in Uncle Tom, on an itnerary that had become standard for books about slavery in this period. Blake's conclusion is that the slaves and even well-off freed blacks lack the leadership, culture, or education to lead a revolt of their own.<br /><br />  The solution to this problem is found by Blake when Blake reveals that he is actually Henricus Blaccus, a distinguished, cultured Afro-Cuban captured into American Slavery. He leaves the US for Cuba and rejoins a company of similarly well off, cultured, and artistic Afro-Cubans conspiring to overthrow slavery and Spanish rule and make Cuba into a base for African liberation. What is interesting is that Delany depicts these Afro-Cuba conspirators holding opulent cultural evenings rich with poetry and with artistic playing of the \\"African Banza.\\" Possession of our own culture, and a distinguished and even aristocratic elite, seem to Delany to be the prerequisites of a successful revolution.<br /><br />  We don't have all of the copies of the Anglo African which published this as a serial.  What we have ends when the conspirators appear to be about to launch their revolt in Havana, but we do have a fascinating look at Delany a Black leader of the 19th Century whose ideas and outlook was quite similar to that of Black militant leaders of the late 20th Century.<br /><br />  Besides its message, the descriptions of life under slavery in the US, make this book a central text to truly understand slavery and the AFrican American response.  Delany's journalism in anti-slavery publications about Cuba and the Poet Placido who he fictionally places at the head of the Afro-Cuban rebels, indicates he was misinformed about the opportunities for Afro-Cubans, the severity of slavery in Cuba, and the degree to which Placido's poetry identified with his African, as opposed to European, lineage. Yet, Delany's fictionalization of a revolutionary cultural nationalist upheaval launched in Cuba makes his plan for Pan Africanist revolt against slavery seem vivid exciting and unique.<br /><br />  It is also a testament to Delany's leadership, that once the Civil War began, he dropped his belief there was no hope for freedom in the United States.  He militantly campaigned for African Americans to join the Union Army.  In fact, Delany became a Major in the US Army, the highest ranked African American during the Civil War other than a few doctors who severed in all Black hospitals.ead of the Afro-Cuban rebels, indicates he was misinformed about the opportunities for Afro-Cubans, the severity of slavery in Cuba, and the degree to which Placido's poetry identified with his African, as opposed to European, lineage.

Yet, it can also be seen as an assessment of the forces available to eliminate slavery as a whole, part of a debate that unfolded in the years leading up to the civil war about what force could possibly overthrow slavery whose ascendancy not only over the South, but over the entire nation seemed unstoppable when this book was written.<br /><br />Its history is a testament to the growth of racism among American literary \\"experts\\" and historians.  While Harriet Jacobs was celebrated in her time as the author of this book and used this celebrity to advance her struggle to advance the lives of refugee slaves during the Civil War and of freed slaves after the Civil War, the racism that followed the imposition of Jim Crow Segregation and the US grab for colonies in Asia and Latin America in the late 19th and 20th Centuries led to the memory of her work being extinguished. By the 1950s and 1960s the scholarly world had come to believe this book was a fiction written by Lydia Maria Child.  No one familiar with  Child could think that she would do such a thing.<br /><br />We owe Jean Fagan Yellin and her collaborators the honor of resurrecting Harriet Jacob's authorship and career. In a startling masterpiece of research ,Yellin's team documented the truth of everything narrated in this book. We are also enriched by Yellin's recent biography entitled Harriet Jacobs.<br /><br /> Besides the usual, Incidents represents a catalog of different ways to escape or lessen the impact of slavery. We have the noble faithful servent in the person of Linda Brent's mother who buys herself with the aid of white who honors her position, we have attempts to escape through the sexual favors of a white man, we have people buying their way out of slavery, we have violent and non violent escapes. We also see Linda Brent's resistence and the success of her clandestine life and later her escapes to Philiadephia, then New York, then England, as a result not only of her individual bravery, character, and devotion to her people and her family and her honor, but of the existence of resources beyond the slave and Black community that can free not only the individual slave but put an end to slavery. We also have the racism that made Jacobs feel not totally free in the North.<br /><br />This is the crucial place Incidents belongs.  The publications (Uncle Tom was first published as a serial in an antislavery newspaper and later published as a book) of Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1850 and 1852 unleashed at the dialog opened among contemporary African American texts about how to eliminate slavery in response to Stowe's great work.  Harriet Beecher Stowe had recommended the Christic experience of evangelical Christianity in Uncle Tom,  Martin Delany  recommended  the reculturation of Blacks by a bourgeois independent state's aristocratic and cultural leadership,  William Wells Brown pointed to the ship of capitalism  coming the vanquish the slave ships.<br /><br />Jacob's text enters this debate with an array of forces within the African American slave and free community, as well as within the Southern white community, as well as the Northern and even international community that can be used to defeat slavery.  We have the slaves themselves debating, organizing, and resisting. We have freed Blacks North and South helping. We have whites in the  South itself helping, if inadequately. We have supporters of women's rights and opponents of slavery among the women of the North. We have the international opponents of slavery in Britain and beyond.<br /><br />  Jacobs highlights not only her own incredibly courageous resistance to slavery, but to the array of forces available to fight slavery. In the weeks and months after this book was published in 1861, those same forces did in fact overthrow slavery and crush it forever more.<br /><br />This is a stirring book written by an articulate and educated writer. Indeed contrary to what is said elsewhere, even narratives written or told by semiliterate African Americans who escaped slavery never contained dialect, but were written in clear standard English. Indeed, scholars have noted that where Jacobs tries to reproduce Black English spoken by unacculturated slaves, she had to fall back on the conventions of theatrical stereotypical imitations of Black English, rather than reproduce real Black English. She had been reared in a standard English environment, had escaped and lived and functioned among an even more stardard English environment, and by the time she wrote this book, almost 20 years after she had escaped from slavery, she was actually unfamiliar with real Black English!<br /><br /> Not only was Jacobs literate, but she was apparently very familiar with contemporary Womens or sentimental novels exemplified by Uncle Tom and Susan Warner's Wide Wide World.<br />Jacobs had spent much time in her bondage in Edenton, reading. Later, in Rochester New York, Jacobs ran a anti-slavery reading room associated with Frederick Douglass's North Star. For nearly a decade in New York, Jacobs worked as a house keeper and nanny for one of the most popular journalists in the country.  She also knew and received support from her boss's estranbed sister, the widely popular journalist and fiction writer Sara Payson Willis Parton, known by her pen name Fannie Fern.  In Ruth Hall, Parton's famous novel a roman A clef biography, Fanny Fern, there isa chacter obviously modeled after Harriet Jacobs.  Jacob's maintained an extensive correspondence with some of leading activists in the womens and antislavery movements of her time in both the United States and Great Britain.<br /><br />  Incidents follows the styles and conventions of the sentimental novels so well that for decades many believed that it was actually a novel written by a white female sentimental author, not by a escaped slave. The Sentimental novels whose central work is to create sympathy usually signfied by the reader's tears, by the suffering, the righteousness, and ultimately the lack of physical power in a wicked world for its heroines and heroes. To that extent, they reflected the lack of social power and opportunity for liberation of 19th Century women.<br />  Jacobs has a totally different approach, remarkable given these conventions.  Susan Warner, author of the first big blockbuster novel, Wide Wide World, could make a day in the life of a 10 year old girl seem like a life of torture. Yet, Jacobs forgo the obvious, easy opportunity to dwell on Harriet Jacobs's undeniably extreme suffering hiding in an attick. Instead the book focuses on her spirit of resistance, the availability of allies, and the real possibilities for her deliverence through her own power.

Indeed contrary to what is said elsewhere, even narratives written or told by semiliterate African Americans who escaped slavery never contained dialect, but were written in clear standard English. Indeed, scholars have noted that where Jacobs tries to reproduce Black English spoken by unacculturated slaves, she had to fall back on the conventions of theatrical stereotypical imitations of Black English, rather than reproduce real Black English. She had been reared in a standard English environment, had escaped and lived and functioned among an even more stardard English environment, and by the time she wrote this book, almost 20 years after she had escaped from slavery, she was actually unfamiliar with real Black English!     Not only was Jacobs literate, but she was apparently very familiar with contemporary Womens or sentimental novels exemplified by Uncle Tom and Susan Warner's Wide Wide World.  Jacobs had spent much time in her bondage in Edenton, reading. Later, in Rochester New York, Jacobs ran a anti-slavery reading room associated with Frederick Douglass's North Star. For nearly a decade in New York, Jacobs worked as a house keeper and nanny for one of the most popular journalists in the country.  She also knew and received support from her boss's estranbed sister, the widely popular journalist and fiction writer Sara Payson Willis Parton, known by her pen name Fannie Fern.  In Ruth Hall, Parton's famous novel a roman A clef biography, Fanny Fern, there isa chacter obviously modeled after Harriet Jacobs.  Jacob's maintained an extensive correspondence with some of leading activists in the womens and antislavery movements of her time in both the United States and Great Britain.      Incidents follows the styles and conventions of the sentimental novels so well that for decades many believed that it was actually a novel written by a white female sentimental author, not by a escaped slave. The Sentimental novels whose central work is tocreate sympathy usually signfied by the reader's tears, by the suffering, the righteousness, and ultimately the lack of physical power in a wicked world for its heroines and heroes. To that extent, they reflected the lack of social power and opportunity for liberation of 19th Century women.     Jacobs has a totally different approach, remarkable given these conventions.  Susan Warner, author of the first big blockbuster novel, Wide Wide World, could make a day in the life of a 10 year old girl seem like a life of torture. Yet, Jacobs forgo the obvious, easy opportunity to dwell on Harriet Jacobs's undeniably extreme suffering hiding in an attick. Instead the book focuses on her spirit of resistance, the availability of allies, and the real possibilities for her deliverence through her own power. Rather than the isolated slave mother locked in an attic, Jacob's Linda Brent is a person who is helped in her struggle by white and black, free and slave in Edenton, helped by sailors and antislavery activists up and done the US coast and in Canada, and helped by people as far away as England. Rather than a victim who deserves our tears, Jacobs shows how there are forces to help her fight for freedom, and she wins.

What Fidel does here as the bumbling priest wants to explore the glorious of \\"liberation theology\\" is Fidel uses it to talk about everything else. Fidel talks a lot about his own experience going to Catholic Schools in Cuba, about education, even about how good playing high school basketball was for his life. Besides being one of the few places where Fidel talks about his own biography, there is a certain joy to this book as Fidel outwits the priest and talks about life, philosophy, education, sports, colonialism, and much more.	2004-12-22

They are timeless in their validity, or rather restricted to the time we share now with the days they were written, the death agony of capitalism.<br /><br />  I read George's essays in the mid 1960s, when segregation still existed, when only a few advanced souls thought of what we now know as women's liberation, when the US was trying to crush the Vietnamese struggle for national independence and unity, when laws preventing abortion and criminalizing homosexuality were unchallenged.<br /><br />  What these books do is outline that history is the process of change and that modern history is the process of working people, farmers, youth, oppressed nations throwing off the power of exploitation and oppression that flows from the domination of the big imperialist corporations of Europe, the USA, and Japan. They outline that history is changable and that the inherent weaknesses of capitalism itself will lead to struggles of a power and thoroughness that will topple the system.<br /><br />  These essays were written in what we all thought was the height of the post war boom, of the \\"Pax Americana\\" were the position of American imperialism seemed unchallengable when many even among those who wanted to change the system believed that prosperity would always exist and that peace and solidarity between the big imperialist countries would be eternal.<br /><br />  Today the threat of depression conditions and economic crisis coming out of the conflicts between Europe, America, and Japan, flowing from the declining profitability of imperialism, loom over the whole world. In many countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia conditions worse than those during the Great Depression have already hit. In the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe economic devastation has marked the attempts to open the countries up for direct exploitation by imperialism. In North America, Europe, and Japan, ongoing recessions are teetering on the verge of falling into depression after the next corporate failure, after the next monetary crises, after the next rise in inflation. All foretold in these essay.<br /><br />However, Novack, as a Marxist and a revolutionist, as a long-time leader of the Socialist Workers Party, doesn't just look at history from the outside. What he explains is those of us who want to fight for change can intervene in history, can intervene and win.  He taught me to look to the struggles of working people in this country and around the world to find where change will come from.  The rising resistance by workers and farmers in this country and beyond belongs to the real history that this book teaches us.  Let this book help you change the world the way it helped me.h America, Europe, and Japan, ongoing recessions are teetering on the verge of falling into depression after the next corporate failure, after the next monetary crises, after the next rise in inflation.

For example, in California where it used to be said there were almost no Native Americans, we now know there were at least million people living  before the Europeans arrived. The conquest of the Indians in the United States was Genocide, an attempt to wipe out all the native peoples, to steal their land, to destroy their cultures. North American capitalism was built on this theft and murder, and on the slavery of millions of Africans, the robbery of Mexico, the colonization of the Phillipines, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, and Hawaii, and the exploitation of American working people and farmers for400 year.<br /><br />  In advance of historians who were inspired by the rise of a radical Native-American movement in the 1960s and 1970s, Novack puts the real history of Genocide straight in a rebuttal of the lies of the president of Harvard.  Novack, one of the great Marxist philosophers of all time, puts the record of crime into the contact of the growth and development of the struggle of all working people in this country and the world against U.S. Capitalism.<br />]<br />  Written in the past, this small pamphlet, a segment from Novack's Marxist Essays in American History, provides an understanding that will help the struggles of Native Americans and other oppressed people in the present and the future.<br /><br />While this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!	2004-10-10
US	43002296	R196BOJ64S2H19	0531117472	532850029	With a Banjo on My Knee: A Musical Journey from Slavery to Freedom (Single Title: Social Studies)	Books	3	7	10	N	Y	A good  book, but minstrels arguement is simply unfounded	Rex's book is clearly not a scholarly text backed by research, but a good summary without much probing of some of the standard information about the banjo's history with three in-depth portraits of African American banjoists Horace Weston, Gus Cannon, and Elmer Snowden.<br /><br />It is a well written book for its audience which is not at all scholars, but advanced children! This is also pretty clear from the format of the book itself and its explanations, a good book for children. but not at all scholarly. It reminds me of some of the books that Langston Hughes wrote for children which, although simplified, carry much wisdom and explanation that more advanced texts like. This fits in with Rex's role as a person whose main contribution to history is as a story teller, not a scholar of the banjo.<br /><br />  Rex repeats without any evidence a view that is repeated over and over in books about African Americans and the banjo, a view that is never really supported by any evidence or any reference: The banjo went out of style among African Americans due negative feelings generated by the minstrels.<br /><br />There is simply no evidence for this!<br /><br />Black people tended to stop playing the banjo for the same musical reasons that most white banjoists tended to stop playing the banjo in the general replacement of banjo playing by the guitar that took place in the first four decades of the 20th Century.<br /><br />  The developments that lead to a revival of banjo playing among whites did not not find any resonance in the Black community for cultural reasons: Bluegrass, and the \\"Dixieland\\" and \\"traditional\\"Jazz revivals of the late 40s and the early 1950s, followed by the revivals of \\"folks music,\\" Bluegrass, and \\"old time music\\" since the mid 1950s.<br /><br />By the close of the 19th century, the five string banjo was the most popular instrument in America, indeed, in the English speaking world, being played by everyone from the British Royal family to back country African Americans and whites.  The center of banjo production and playing was not in the South, or the Appalachian mountains at the time as often surmised by the ignorant, but in Boston and New York.<br /><br /> The advent of ragtime, the infusion of Latin music in the great Tango craze of the 1910s, and the beginnings of jazz, led musicians of all types to abandon the five string banjo during the second decade of the 20th Century. The five string was largely replaced by banjos without the fifth drone string which conflicted with the types of harmonies and rhythmic accompaniment required by the new music.  The three most popular instruments in what we now called \\"Jazz banjo\\" were and are the plectrum banjo (tuned like a five string banjo but without the fifth string), the tenor--first called \\"tango\\" banjo--(tuned chiefly like a mandola, but sometimes like a mandolin or like the first four strings of a guitar) banjo, and the guitar banjo (a six stringed instrument tuned like a guitar). They became instruments of choice for rhythm players and lead players who might have onced played five-string banjos in Black, white, and other dance and jazz orchestras.<br /><br /> Another part of this process was that starting in the late 1890s the banjo tended to be replaced by the first availability of relatively inexpensive factory made guitars. At the same time larger guitars that could be heard more than the small parlor guitars popular in the 19th Century became available and started to be used in bands.<br /><br />  During the 1920s and early 1930s thousands of African Americans played four and six string banjos in almost every known dance band or Jazz orchestra and as indiviuals or in groups. This was in addition to continued, though steadily decreasing five string banjo playing particularly in areas like Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia that parelleled a decrease of five string playing among whites as well. Bands like Louis Armstrong's, Duke Ellington's, Bennie Moten's, hardly presented the image of degrading minstrels. Nor did significant Jazz organizations of the time led by by banjoists like Zack Whyte and Nobble Sissle.<br /><br />  In the mid 1930s with the advent of swing, greater amplification, the banjos in such orchestra and groups largely were replaced by guitars in Black as well as white Jazz orchestras. Most four and six string banjoists switched to guitar. In fact most of the older generation of swing band guitarists like Fred Guy with Ellington and Freddie Green with Count Basie began as banjoists, not guitarists (Green never played banjo with Basie).<br /><br />  This happened for musical reasons, not because of any minstrels. Guitars seemed more suited to a more nuanced swing rhythm and had a greater harmonic range. Moreover, the advent of the large hollow bodied Jazz guitars, better amplification for recordings and stage shows, and finally electric guitars made the guitar superior to the banjos which were louded than the earlier parlor guitars and particularly suited for the early pre-electronic recording.  As one of the banjoists turned guitar players of the generation told me 30 years ago, \\"Banjo and Tuba music got replaced by bass and guitar music in Jazz.\\"<br /><br />  Danny Barker, the great four and six string banjoist from New Orleans who switched to guitar in the 1930s when he was playing with Cab Calloway explained that when he decided to return to banjo playing in an New Orleans revival group right after World War II, Harlem pawn shops were filled with \\"thousands\\" of banjos and he had no problem finding a good instrument at a great price. Indeed into the early 1960s, not just in Harlem, but all over America, fine four and five string banjos now worth thousands could be found for easy money or nothing in attics, in garage sales, or even in junk yards! The banjo companies many of which folded in the early 1930s, and most of which had stopped or greatly curtailed making 5 string instrulemnts by the 1920s, produced few banjos of any kind by the 1940s.<br /><br />The banjo itself declined from total popularity at the turn of the century to relative obscurity by the early 1950s, not because of the minstrels, but for musical reasons common to Black and white musicians.<br /><br />To be sure among African Americans traditional five string playing continued among pockets of musicians in rural areas in the Appalachians and especially in the Piedmont regions of Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia into the 1980s.<br /><br />  The desertion of the banjo among African Americans had nothing to do with minstrels, who had actually more or less disappeared from the scene as a major form of entertainment by the late 1920s.  It had to do with musical migration and development that was by and large shared by white musicians from the five string to the four and six string banjo to the guitar.<br /><br />  It is true that vestiges of banjo playing remained in Southern white music.  Even there,before Earl Scrugg's revived the five string banjo when he gained fame as part of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass band, the banjo was playing a smaller and smaller role in white \\"hillbilly\\" music. Generally, the banjoist tended to be a comic figure often playing the role of an old fashioned rube, a vestige of \\"old times\\" until Earl came along. When Earl first appeared on the Grand Ole Opry, Uncle Dave Macom, a great old master who had begun performing in the 19th Century, told Bill Monroe Scruggs would never make it as a banjo player because \\"he ain't a bit funny.\\"<br /><br />Even so banjo playing in the entire country tended to continue to be indentified with jazz banjo playing in Dixieland groups until the folk revival of the late 1950s and 1960s which also tended to popularize bluegrass to wider audiences.<br /><br />  African Americans did not widely participate in the Dixieland revival of the late 1940s and 1950s (although it did keep a number of Black four and six string banjoists particularly in Chicago and New Orleans working), the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s and their revival of 1940s and 1950s Bluegrass and resurrection of older white and black country musics involving the banjo.<br /><br />This has more to do with the fact that African American culture tends to be more progressive than white popular culture. Black people tend not to want to romantically glorify \\"the old days,\\" particularly the days of Jim Crow Segregation.  Black culture keeps trying to develop new expressions to escape the dominant cultures tendency to try to contain and emasculate black contributions.<br /><br />  To be sure, many African Americans see the banjo as an old fashioned or out moded or \\"country\\" symbol, just as many Southern whites did in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s until the dominant urban sophisticated culture embraced Bluegrass and vice versa.<br /><br />  However, there is simply no proof or even reference to minstrelry in any of the real history of Black banjoists and the banjo, just musical ones, shared by non Black banjoists as well.<br /><br />  On the other hand, a new generation of African American banjoists like my friend Myra Hill and I are returning to the black and white traditions of the banjo.d making 5 string instrulemnts by the 1920s, produced few banjos of any kind by the 1940s. <br /> <br />The banjo itself declined from total popularity at the turn of the century to relative obscurity by the early 1950s, not because of the minstrels, but for musical reasons common to Black and white musicians. <br /> <br />To be sure among African Americans traditional five string playing continued among pockets of musicians in rural areas in the Appalachians and especially in the Piedmont regions of Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia into the 1980s.   <br /> <br />   The desertion of the banjo among African Americans had nothing to do with minstrels, who had actually more or less disappeared from the scene as a major form of entertainment by the late 1920s.

Where I sit and type now, my union job provides me some kind of health care, but I know the bureaucrats who sit on top of it have nothing in common with the fighting workers of China, Utah, or Fort Lauderdale.<br /><br />This is one of Trotsky's last works, written in Mexico in 1940s, to analyze the position of unions as reformist governments like Cardenas's PRI in Mexico and Roosevelt's New Deal attempted to involve the union bureaucracies and union structures as reformist obstacles to workers struggles for workers rights, against the war drive that led to WWII, and for Mexico's independent from imperialist countries like Britain and the United States.<br /><br />Trotsky's analysis here is precise, incisive, and scientific, and more useful today that it was in 1940.<br /><br /> The unions must be transformed from organizations that seek only a few priviledges for their members, to fighting units of the fight of all working people. One examples is health care. The incorporation of the union bureaucrats after WWII, led to their dropping the real fight in the US for quality free public health care for all to negotiating contracts for only their members, and now for fewer and fewer union members.<br /><br />  As the unions backed off from being fighting organizations for all of working people, all of the oppressed, they have become easier for the capitalists to pick off, and weaken, fewer and fewer workers now have unions, and the hold of the self serving bureaucrats who sit atop the unions trying to live the life style of the bosses seems complete.<br /><br />  Yet, unions were built by and large by fighting workers in struggle, often as a result of broader struggles of farmers and oppressed nationalities.

Fighting for Principled Class Politics<br /><br />This is a book that is located in the big class battles, even threat of civil war that rocked France in the 1930s. This is a book about a time when it was possible for French workers and farmers to have replaced the rotten capitalist regime with a socialist government of workers and farmers. Sadly, this is a book about how the reformist bureaucratic leaders of the Stalinist and social democratic parties sold out these struggles. Yet, the focus here is not directly on these struggles. Trotsky covers these issues in Pathfinder's Leon Trotsky on France, in the Writings of Leon Trotsky for those years, and in other work. This book is funadmentally about finding for revolutionary politics of a principled nature. Here, Trotsky shows how the sections of the leadership of the French Trotskyists missed giant opportunities among revolutionary minded youth around the Socialist party and among working class youth, by attempting to cater to 'left' social democrat Marcel Pivert who refused to do anything that would displease the leaders of the Socialist party. Trotsky explains the advances that could have been made by revolutionists clearly explaining their program, and orienting to the youth and workers who wanted to fight the capitalists and thus wanted to break from these reformist leaders. Trotsky's writings here are a great explanation why clear, principled politics, not maneuvering, tricks and opportunist adventures, are the way forward for people serious about changing the world.<br /><br />Also recommended: Leon Trotsky on France, Leon Trotsky on Spain, Writings of Leon Trotsky volumes for the mid and late 1930s, Capitalism's World Disorder, Aldabonazo<br /><br />.	2004-09-25

What is at stake here is the issue of power. In this book Trotsky recounts the  practical and the programmatic steps that led the Bolshevik party to seize power, defends the practical process that the revolution  organized itself, defends the practical work that the Bolshevik party and the peasants and workers of Russia defeated the intervention by imperialism and the reactionary armies that sought to defeat the revolution. In this book, Trotsky recounts the truth about the struggle that he and Lenin began against Stalin and other bureaucrats.  In this book Trotsky recounts the genuine Bolshevik response to the 1924  general strike in Great Britain and the disasterous slaughter of the Chinese Communists and Workers by Chaing Kai Shek in 1927.<br /><br />  The falsifications were not just about which picture Trotsky appeared with  Lenin in, but about the bureaucracy's retreat from Bolshevism in regard to revolutions around the world and in regard to its campaign against the freedom of discussion and debate in the party and working class indepedent mass action that Lenin's power had been based on.<br /><br />  The social crisis that is deepening across our planet is going to revive these questions, not as history but as practical life and death questions of survival for billions of workers, peasants, and youth.

His books tend to be more like memories of life lived by a friend, rather than stories.  He never attempts to be catchy, self aggrandizing, or entertaining, apart from telling the truths he can find in stories and novels.<br />  I have read everything here including his great memoir of his mom. It is tempting to buy this book again just because I like it so much. I really loved Ford's Rock Springs so much that I have two copies so I don't have to take the autographed copy out of the house.<br />  This book is an excellent introduction to Ford. Of course once you read him, you are going to need to buy everything else he has ever written. I recommend first reading Rock Springs, one of the great collections of short fiction in the English language, and Wildlife, a novella that Ford tolm me was really the culmination of what Rock Springs talked about. After that read The Sports Writer and Independence Day, two great novels about the same character.<br />  I have been reading Ford seriously since 1985, especially in the late 1980s and early 1990s when I was writing fiction. One thing that hits me is how rereadable he is. Even as I type these worls, I am thinking of when I can get home, pull down one of my copies of Rock Springs and pack it for the trip I am going on this weekend, if I can wait that long to read it!	2004-06-24

There were many hundreds of workers who had led the CIO upsurge in the Minneapolis Sit Down Strikes, the Flint strikes against GM, the battles in Maritime on both coasts, the struggles to organize the unemployed. There were fighters against Fascism and Antisemitism who had organized demonstrations of 50,000 against the American Nazis and fought the US's restrictions on letting Hitler's victims in.  There were youth from the campuses, and youth from mines and mills, and youth who were fighting for jobs. There were Black fighters against racism and discrimination from across the country.  There were veteran cadres who had led the IWW, the American Communist Party, The Communist Leage of America, the Workers Party, and the Socialist Party. They were young writers, painters, and other  artists and intellectuals.<br /><br />  This is the record of their discussion on how to build a revolutionary party to lead workers in the US, how the teachings of Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky and their own lessons in the struggles of the 1930s point to the need for a new revolutionary party.<br /><br />  None of those questions have changed in substance.  This discussion is enlivened not deaded because it comes from this time. It comes from a time when these questions were not abstract questions, but concrete practical questioned need to advance the  struggles these militants led.<br />  We need these lessons, we need such a party, today.  The SWP is still out there fighting in mines, and garmet shops, in packing houses, and wherever workers, Blacks, Asian, Chicanos and other oppressed are fighting imperialism and expliotation.<br /><br />  Read this, and know why. Then fight with them.	2004-06-20

Moreover, it is told vividly because Armando Hart's skill as a writer is reknowned through Latin America and the Spanish speaking world. Pathfinder Press put out a new edition of this book in English and Spanish, working closely with Armando Hart and Cuban historians and fighters. The new book contains extensive pictures, documents and a fine glossary and chronology of Cuban and world history.<br /><br />In this firsthand account by one of the historic leaders of the Cuban Revolution, we meet many of the men and women who in the 1950s led the urban underground in the fight against the brutal U.S.-backed Batista dictatorship. Together with their comrades-in-arms of the Rebel Army, they not only brought down the tyranny, but their example changed the history of the 20th century-and the century to come. Contains many never-before-published documents and letters from the period.Armando Hart was one of the central organizers of the urban underground. For more than four decades he has been a leader of the revolutionary government, serving as minister of education and minister of culture, as well as a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Cuba.<br /><br />While the Brand New Edition may not be available from Amazon, the new Spanish and English editions of this book are available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon store you can find by clicking on new and used books at the top of this page.	2004-05-07

Art Preis, a trade union militant and writer for the socialist newspaper The Militant wrote this book because he believed that the workers of his future, that is us today, would need this history to learn how to fight harder, better and more successfully than the workers of the 1930s. That's why he also explains how the trade union bureaucrats' policy of supporting government war polices and supporting the Democratic and Republican parties helped throttle these labor upsurges. This book tracks the story of the rise of the CIO and other industrial unions and the big strike battles they wages in the 1930s and 1940s. Here we see how millions of workers and their families and allies like farmers, African Americans, and women fought the big business class and won. We need this book because every day the government and the employers try to cut back our benefits, take away rights, and try to break the unions, just as every day we see rising resistance by working people. We need to use the lessons and example of the struggles explained here to launch bigger ones that can win not only union power, but political for working people.	2004-05-03

Seeing it on here makes me want to take off a day, go by the beach and reread to end up the way Mr. Bascomb does. There is something in the modest respect for the real details of life and its limitations and an eye for the realities of life in this and all of Ford's work.<br />Of course, this is necessary reading because Ford's sequel with the same character, married and a decade or so later was his Independence Day that won the Pulitzer and the National Book Award, a larger more ambitious work, but with the same accuracy, modesty, and wisdom.	2004-04-22

The times I have talked to him I have felt an almost priestly demeanor and a respectful attitude as he talks about his writing. He writes to find out about things, depict things, get things out of his system, to know what he knows, and share it with the world. It took him most of a good collection of short stories, a novella, and then another long story to get the whole coming of age thing in Montana amidst life crisis out of his system. Some would argue that Independence Day was just an attempt to rest those ghosts!<br />Here Ford deals with infidelities among the upper middle class. Much as I would prefer he return to what he saw when he was teach out in Montana, much as I feel the usual prejudice to dismiss these people, Ford gets close to the struggle inside all of us to feel we are here, we are touched or touching, and to have a little joy. Ford also gets at the relative emptiness of the whole landscape they people populate.  Every approach makes the whole thing more precise.<br />Unfortunately, this isn't another Rock Springs, but it is good enough to read and reread and to know it helps us remember what life is like.	2004-04-22

What is significant to me about these stories is not the Western setting which is nice and full and accurate, or the feelings for the times, but Ford's approach to the question of the myth of parenthood.  In this book and the stories our characters are faced with the patriarchal myth of the father and the mother as people who can play such a superior role and guide the family safely through the maze of life in capitalism, always being someone to look up to by the child.  Ford brings about explosions, sometimes big explosions--in Rock Springs dad kills a guy in one story and in another story the Dad and the son come and find good old mom and an Airman in the sack--sometimes small and this myth is blown away. The child discovers that the parent is a conflicted person with all the problems and humanity that we know, open to disaster, tragedy, and just plain bad luck. Whether from the parent's point of view, or the child's what we see is this myth receding and the acceptance of real humanity by both the child and the parent.  Would that so many of this could have learned all this as wisely in life as Ford tells this in his fiction!	2004-04-22

This book belongs in every home.<br />  Linn deals with the social image of the banjo from its African and African American origins, to minstrelry's role in popularizing this instrument as well as the conflicts between the racism of minstrelry and the explosion of an instrument suited to popularize African American music. She continues by charting the now-forgetten age of the classic banjo from post civil war period until the  first decade of this century, when manufacturers and teachers tried to elavate the five string instrument from its working class and African American roots, to becoming a polite and priviledged possession for the rich. She then charts the evolyution of the instrument and its image into the jazz age with the various 4 string banjos. Finally she deals with the images in the culture created by the persistence of the instrument in appalachia and its revival in the folk scene of the 1950s through today.<br />  This is a gross summary of a subtle, well written book, that provides pictures about how stereotypes and misinformation based on the racial and class conflicts of society both cloud our knowledge of the real culture and constitutes part of it.<br /><br />  This is a fascinating book about American history and culture and race under capitalism, even if the reader is not interested in the banjo.

If you buy this book because the title might indicate it is an overall look at the banjo, its playing, its musics, and its place in society, that is not what this book is or pretends to be.<br />This is a history of the physical development of the banjo and its construction and manufacture during the 19th Century.  There are some small references to the different musics the instrument was used for, but not many. There is elaborate and detailed discussion of the main lines of construction of the banjos during this period.  The authors also write well and thoroughly about the business dynamics of the chief producers<br />of the banjo during the 19th Century.<br />  While this book is obviously the work of two of leading banjo collectors in the world and of interest to banjoists and instrument makers of all kinds, it is an important picture of America social and economic history as well. Someone interested in the rise and development of capitalist industry, fetishism of &quot;the finer things in life&quot; by the middle class, and how culture wars were waged in the 19th Century would profit from reading this book.<br />  For the artistically inclined there are a number of beautiful plates of 19th Century Banjos as works of art. It is clear that the authors  priviledge the decoration and physical beauty of the instruments as much as they do the instruments &quot;playability.&quot;<br />  This work is great in itself.  I found it very readable and believe someone who did not know much about banjos would also find this readable.<br />If you are interested in the social and cultural history of the instrument to the present day, what you need is<br />That Half-Barbaric Twang: The Banjo in American Popular Culture Culture by Karen Linn.<br />If you are interested in the African origin of the instrument, its development from African playing styles, as well as the roots of contemporary &quot;frailing&quot; and clawhammer and much else about the musical tradition of the banjo, especially as used in traditional folk music  try African Banjo Echoes in Appalachia: A Study of Folk Traditions by Cecelia Conway.

That book makes a lot of pretenses and some small errors and legions of overstatements about Bill Monroe and adds little to our knowledge of Big Mon the musician, but provides a rich and interesting and valuable addition to the literature by giving a well researched picture of his personal problems, his emotional outlook, and his life offstage from childhood on. In providing his true background, it dispels the usual mystifications and idiocies and stereotypes generated by  Nashville.<br />This book does the same for the Carters, something harder to do when you are talking about three to 10 people depending on who you count as a Carter.  This book is weakened by the absence of documentation, even of the type of documentation that has become standard in serious non-fiction books written for a non-scholarly audience now expects, let alone what those of us who would like to think of ourselves as scholars of the music and the culture demand.<br />Yes, I agree there are many gaffs here that a student of the music or a musician would find just plain ignorant. Yes, the book could have been better edited and fact checked.  The publisher obviously didnt care to spend money to have competent editors go over the book, or to have it read by someone with any expertise in this kind of music or the history of music at all, such as one would expect.  This speaks more to the current economics of the publishing industry where to get a book out, you have to offer a budget and a marketing plan like you were going to offer a new shade of nail polish.<br />What emerges here is the story of the Carters as people.  Of course, this dashes away all of the mystification of the simple Carters living up in their Clinch Mountain home and resituates them as modern Americans like the rest of us with ambitions, emotional problems, sexual needs, affairs, divorce, and all the rest.<br />This is the real story that this book centers on. I wont regugitate it, you can do it yourself by buying this book.<br />I found it very very readable. Even though as a former editor, a sometimes published writer, and an English professor I can be a big stickler, the little errors and the big did not halt my desire to devour this book because of its easy and interesting writing style and because it told the lives of the Carters in a compelling way. This is done without creating phony melodrama. Apart from the breakup of the marriage of AP and Sara, which to happen as peacefully as one would expect this to happen, particularly for rural Virginia, and the brush of Maybelle's family with Hank Williams and Johnny Cash who both seemed to be enamored with June, the Carters seem to have lived reasonable lives with good opportunities and the normal surmountable dramas. To tell their story as honestly as this book seems and find a way to make it interesting and have the personal storm inform the music and our understanding of life in general is an achievement.<br />  There is a lot of good fun description of things here.  I particularly delighted in their description of Dr. Brinkley the quack who sponsored XERA the first border radio station the Carters played on. I was charmed by the portrait of the late Chet Atkins as well.  Even a  person with no special knowledge or interest of the music would find this book very enjoyable.<br />  Of course, anyone who wants to have a knowledge and an interest in the music of the Carters must have this book.<br />Other than the bargain basement editing and fact checking job, the real weakness of this book is that it stands alone. We would not be bemoaining this books scant attempts to talk about the musical influences and  musical style and changes in the Carters music if there were serious books written on those subjects. We would simply be placing this book where it belongs, an interesting personal history of the Carters' lives which should have been documented.  I still give it 5 stars!<br />The real problem like the Monroe book is that we need more books about this and similar subjects. We do need a documented book by someone who can really understand the great list of musical and cultural influences that were represented by the Carters.  Likewise, we need more books seriously written about the construction of the country music industry.

These documents sum up 16 years of discussion of the fight for women's rights in the Socialist Workers Party. These documents explain why patriarchal class society is the cause of women's oppression and how deeply women are oppressed in modern imperialist capitalism.  However more than analysis, these documents provide a blueprint for the coming fights that will advance women's rights, the massive struggle by working people to take power out of the hands of capitalism. This is not  an academic discussion, but a discussion by front line fighters for women's liberation, leaders of the struggles on campuses and the fight that won abortion rights in the early 1970s, leaders in the fight for women's equality in industries like coal, steel, and the railroads in the 1980s Important struggles like the unsuccessful fight for the Equal Rights Amendment and the victory that forced the Supreme Court to grant abortion rights are an important part of these documents as is evolution of organizations like the National Organization for Women (NOW) and the Coalition of Trade Union Women.	2004-03-31

In various ways, Luckacs, the Frankfurt School, Althusser, and others like are frequently mistaken for Marxists in part because many of them were affiliated with the Stalinist Communist Parties or with the social democracy.<br />The late George Novack was a leader of the Socialist Workers Party who Leon Trotsky implored to deepen and defend real Marxist philosophy back in the late 1930s.  In this book, originally written in the 1970s, Novack takes on these contrasts these Marxists with the genuine teachings of Marxism.<br />  Novack also shows that basic ideas of dialectical materialism, the philosophy of Marx and Engels, are directly useful tools for working people to try to understand the world and figure how to take hold of the world from the capitalist class.  He explains how revolutionary theory is one of the sharpest tools that can be used in revolutionary practice.<br />  Like everything George Novack writes about philosophy he is objective and precise in describing those he debates, so that his work is both a useful survey of the basic ideas of these so-called \\"Western Marxists,\\" as well as a defense of real Marxism from them.  For any kind of philosophical work, Novack is very readable, not boring, and always clear. This book is an excellent book for a course on Marxist philosophy,<br />on \\"Western Marxism,\\" and on how serious intellectuals debate differences.<br />  When the growing resistance of working people, farmers, youth, and the countries calls out for the tools of genuine Marxism to guide their fight, this book will become a classic, a major tool in their fight to clearly understand the world.	2004-03-22

Yet, in a few years, Blacks, youth, women and millions of others in this country that wiped out Jim Crow segregation, produced mass feminist consciousness and won abortion rights, helped the Vietnamese people defeat US imperialism, and extended the Cuban revolution for four decades.  History is the deep undercurrents produced by the contradictions of society that help us understand why capitalism will undergo great crises, and more importantly how and why workers, farmers, youth, oppressed nationalities will rise against it.  Today the contradictions of capitalism that Novack explains here, show in the long run, even a greater radicalization than that of the 1960s and 1970s can and will sweep over this country and the world. It will give working people the chance to take power out of the hands of the super rich and open the road to building another world.  Read this pamphlet and you will under stand this.

Despite what various comments are, Wardlow's writing is not overly intellectual, rather it is very factual.

Imperialism has cynically used Israel to herd the Jews and others who oppose AntiSemitism  into supporting a racist, colonialist, state which has been linked to every right wing regime in the world, including the Apartheid regime in  South Africa, now  overthrown, a regime led by men whose sympathies with Hitler were  not hidden.  Today, Jews, and those who understand AntiSemitism is a danger to all working people, need to join the struggle that Trotsky proclaimed and led in his time: the struggle against capitalism, the struggle to unite workers around the world, the struggle to defend peoples oppressed by colonialism and by zionism. We need to realize imperialism will use its antisemitism to divide and break the workers struggle, again and again and again until capitlism is stopped.	2004-01-11

This is the story of Tete Puebla, the highest ranking women general in the Cuban army about how Cuban women fought and gained an equal role as combatants in the Cuban revolution, how revolutionary Cuban women played a decisive role in the transformation of Cuban society, about how Cuban women led the fight for literacy in the 1960s, and how Cuban women have fought in Angola, in Grenada, and wherever imperialism threatens the revolution, and how Cuban woman are ready to fight, arms in hands, against Washington's threats to overturn their revolution. This is no Cooks tour about the perfection of Cuban revolutionists, but it does show how Fidel fought for women's equal role because they were recognized as fighters. To me the most wonderful part is the description of how the revolution dealt not just with the orphans of revolutionary martyrs, but with children orphaned because their parents were in Batista's murderous criminal army. They were all treated the same, as children of the revolution. Read this book and you will recognize the depth of the lies that Washington, and Ottawa, and London throw at the Cuban Revolution.

Cannon writings & speeches)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	What future is our present?	Now forgotten by most people, after World War II, this country saw one of the biggest upsurges of struggle by working people against capitalism in its history. There was a seemingly unstoppable strike wave. Hundreds of thousands of troops and sailors in Europe and Asia demonstrated demanding to be sent home and not to war against the Chinese Revolution and other enemies of American big business. Within the labor movement and civil rights groups like the NAACP youth, local fights for civil rights spread that would lay the basis for the struggles of the 1950s and 1960s.  The Socialist Workers Party that had been persecuted during the War gained hundreds and hundreds of members, mostly African Americans and trade unionists.<br />  This book encapsulates the political struggle that broke out in the party. What is the future for the workers movement given the big changes after the war? Were the outbreak of struggles, the new signs of action by Blacks and Mexican Americans, and the opposition to Washington's War signs of a revolutionary future for America, or a passing phase?<br />  Cannon and the majority of the party's leadership answered this question by developing the American Theses, which examined the basic contradictions of American imperialism, how its national and international advances during and after the war would eventually lead to deeper struggles, and even a revolution in America.  Cannon explains the realities of the revolutionary future and building a real workers party against dispirited middle class elements who were caving in to the might of American imperialism and becoming anticommunism.<br />  As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the deepening economic crisis workers in this country and around the world face, show, we are in the future Cannon pointed to. American imperialism cannot solve its problems.  It can only inflict them on working people around the world.  Now more than ever, we need to build a revolutionary movement of working people and oppressed nationalities as Cannon explains in this book.<br />  Like everything Cannon writes, there is so much wit, witticism, and plain wisdom here that The Struggle for Socialism in the American Century is a very enjoyable read.pressed nationalities as Cannon explains in this book. <BR>   Like everything Cannon writes, there is so much wit, witticism, and plain wisdom here that The Struggle for Socialism in the American Century is a very enjoyable read.	2003-10-08

The distinct contribution of this book is not so much what it says about the music. There isn't much here about the music that is new, sustaining, or distinct. In fact, at times, Smith seem to inflate the importance of Monroe in rather trifling ways that really undercut the significance of Monroe.<br />I am very glad Smith accurately and fairly portrayed the role the late Ralph Rinzler played in really saving Monroe's career and making him more known in the folk revival.<br />  What is interesting is what the book shows about Monroe's character. Despite Smith's desire to guild the lily and create a halo around his hero, he unearths a history of great emotional problems that had a heavy impact on Monroe's life.  Smith traces them from the difficult, lonely, childhood Monroe had all the way to Monroe's last days very consistently.  Monroe was a compulsive womanizer throughout his life, never faithul in any relationship, usually having a semi permanent mistress in addition whatever common law or legal wife he had, and usually having several other women out on the road.<br />  Plainly, Monroe was small minded and propriatorial about \\"owning\\" Bluegrass.  He was especially hateful to others like his former employees starting with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs who dared to play it on their own.  Monroe refused to speak to Lester and Earl for decades, threatened to fire his own band members for merely talking to Lester and Earl or members of their band, and refused to appear on the same bill at Bluegrass Festivals with them until he was forced too. This despite the fact both Flat and Scruggs retained a professional respect for Monroe then and now, while Lester Flatt and his wife always had a deep personal admiration and care for Monroe.<br />  It's still shocking to me to read about the great fiddle genius Kenny Baker who played with Monroe on and off for 23 years!.  Baker simply demanded to know where the band would be touring so his family could send him word of the progress of Baker's dying brother.  Monroe refused to tell him because he'd never told band members where the tour was going before. Even though Baker was an acknowledged genius of Bluegrass fiddle whose work suited Monroe's taste more than any of a number of fiddlers who preceded him and followed him, an interview I saw on the web with a long-time band members, explains Monroe always referred to Baker as  a \\"drunk.\\"<br />  Monroe tended to treat and pay band members like they were farm hands on a farm in Western Kentucky in the 1920s.  If Bill Monroe needed his house painted, fence posts put in on one of his farms, or other work around home or farm, if you were in the band, you were expected to show up on time at 6 am in the morning and do that work as well for nothing extra,.<br />  This book seems to accurately root Monroe's character in the difficulty he had with a disability in his eyes as a child and early teen, a disability cured when his older brothers moved to the Midwest and got jobs in factories and oil refineries and got together money for a healing operation.  Monroe never seems to recover for the hazing and unkindness he faced from his brothers before the operation.  This book recounts how even when Monroe was in his late 60s and an internationally famous cultural figure, while his brothers were  in their seventies, men who had been mostly rescued from financial failure by their younger brothers, he would still fall into tears about how cruelly they had treated him as a child when he visited them!<br />  There are many other stories of Monroe's small<br />mindedness, jealousy, and campaigns against musicians who worked for him.  However, on reflection, the important question seems to be, that with all these problems, Monroe always had one of the great organizations in music of any kind, and the seminal group in Bluegrass.  Musicians fought to work for and stay with Bill Monroe harder than some might have fought to get away.  Musicians who Monroe chased away out of jealousy and then castigated once they left the band have seen their careers as a tribute to Monroe.<br />  Monroe was a great, decisive, and innovative musician, singer, performer and arranger.  His ability to lead, train and continue a band that became elite training school for all of bluegrass, matched with his ability to bring what blues, swing, and even jazz offered to the musicwithout losing what he called the \\"ancient sounds\\" congealed Bluegrass out of the ferment that was going through country music after World War II.  Everybody with ears needs to hear him.<br />  Of course, if you aren't familiar with Monroe's musical history and contributions, this book, does provide a basic introduction to that as well.  But the real interest in the book is the conflict between Monroe's contributions to music, and his troubled emotions.ht to get away.

Sadly, the questions Lenin and the Bolsheviks asked were answered negatively in Germany in 1918-1919, when the German working masses overthrew the Kaiser and set about to take power into their hands. This discussion between the leaders of both revolutions is one of the most important in modern history.  The stakes are no less than that of the survival of capitalism in the advanced countries of Europe, Japan, and North America!<br /> The absence of a trained revolutionary party, the absence of a party with a set of democratic demands to defend the rights of Germany's peasants, and the confusions marked by the attempts to build a party in the middle of revolution itself, the conflicting changing banners of different parties, and grouping put before the working class, spelled defeat for the German workers, even though they had some of the greatest leaders in the history of our class in Karl Leibneckt and Rosa Luxemburg.<br />  In this well noted, exquisitely glossaried, scholarly edition, the debates on strategy and tactics, on party building, and on the meaning of the struggle for power among the Bolsheviks, German Revolutionists, and the international movement are collected.	2003-08-11

The writing is this book alone is worth the price. He's a vigorous wise ass and elegant literary dynamo.  If you just read the writing, and dont give a hoot about country music, you will enjoy yourself.<br />  So much of music writing is devoled to haigiagraphy and confirming ignorant common places, whereas Tosches is concerned with the dirty nasty truth, and the wild side of things.  You aren't going to learn that Roy Acuff who appointed himself a great country music icon, decades after he had had a hit, began his work in music with a group called \\"the Bang Boys\\" that specialized in X rated songs.<br />  His description of a Jerry Lee Lewis recording session sometimes in the 1970s is really masterful and still rings in my mind 20 years after I first read it. Likewise, you will love Tosches' description of the dark end of Spade Cooley. Cooley torutured and murdered his wife because Cooley believed she had banged Roy Rodgers--and Cooley got into show business a double for Roy Rogers in the movies!<br />  There is so much uncovered about the real origins of rock and roll.<br />  No one can live without the first book that wasn't afraid to let you know that Hank Williams was bald!<br />  If you don't have this book in your house, buy it, or move in with someone who's got it!<br />  Dont forget his great book on Jerry Lee Lewis, Hellfire.<br />This man knows how to write!	2003-07-22

Tosches is not a fact meister, an assembler of minute bits of information. (Although starting out with wondering and truly fictive chapters in the original version of his Country Music, Tosches launched the change of investigation that discovered the facts about who Emmett Miller was and where he is buried).<br />Instead, Tosches finds the kind of truth that is found in great jazz, in beat poetry. and thrilling novels where even fictions are truer than the most irrefutable facts.  This is what he after here, not uncovering every jot and biddle of JLL's 67 years of life.<br />  In this regard he has a heroic figure, JLL, the greatest artist produced by Rockabilly, the truest synthesis of all that is good and wild and meaniful about southern white Ameica's synthesis of blues, jazz, tin-pan alley, and country represented in JLL's long time declaration that the three masters are Jimmy Rodgers, Hank Williams, and Al Jolson! Tosches captures the drive, the heat, the darkness, and the resonance with the reality of America's story of a culture warped by racism, sexism, greed, and of truths that have been covered over by common place facts.<br />  Just like JLL on a good night, the prose here rips through the story in a way that will wake you up and get you moving, get you thinking.<br />  This is a book for writers, for music lovers, and for those like me who believe JLL is one of the greats.  How can it be that no one else has written a serious biography of JLL? Are they all afraid of JLL and Tosches?	2003-07-22

How right what she talks about seemed then, and how needed does this seem now.  Right now the people who frame the discourses, own everything, buy the politicans, and do stealing and murder on an international basis, try to convince working people, people with a heart, people around the world that their choices are the only choices.  In this book we find that so many of the limitations of our society can be sweetly transcended, whether we are talking about race, sex, money, adults children.  This is not a dreamers book, but a book that talks about how life could simply be truly human with what we know, with what we can do, when the choices aren't dictated by patriarchy, when the choices aren't dictated by capitalism, when the choices are dictated by biollionaire liars, by men elected to presidencies who flew around in planes owned by Emron.  Morever, consistent with every sentence Marge ever wrote, including things I think are just plain wrong, is a simple unromanticized, gut understanding that human beings are better than all the crap thrown at it and we will perserve, we will build a world worthy of the grandeur of life.	2003-06-12

However, I have known of Marge Piercy for about 21 years--actually I bought my first book of hers Vida totally ignorant, but desperate and unemployed and really needing a book to escape into and buying Vida on a remaindered book table outside of a community college where I was then turned down for a temporary clerical job, a college I now teach writing at.  I didn't know that Marge was someone from home, someone who came out of the same struggles and times that I came out, that over the years, long before I met her, I would keep running into people not just reading her work, but her doing her deeds had done good things for, important people in my life who would reel the clock back until I realized how many rooms and demonstrations I had shared with Marge.<br />  Later, as I became a writer, I would run into writers who became my friends who kept telling me the good things, the quiet things, the unacknowledged things she had done for them, particularly minority writers made to feel out of place at writing colonies, writers organizations, working class originated people feeling out of place in stuffy phony poetry circles.  Marge Piercy is a writer,  Marge Piercy is a fighter.<br />  This is going to be direct talk, from reality, as well as from the heart, direct talk for a master of poetry, three or four genres of fiction.  I just know from knowing Marge and Ira and their work, that this is the kind of book I will probably be teaching in my classes, and living in my writing.<br />BUY THIS BOOK	2003-06-12

This is great fiction.  This is the honest story of the French revolution, told from the side of masses of working people, peasants, real French people, told from the side of women and men who live as we live.  This is a story of people finding searching for truth and love.  This is not about disillusion with revolution, disillusion with the great moments when masses of working people take the world in their hands, this is a celebration of it, of love.  This is not about the tragedy of the French revolution, but about the glory of it, and the glory of working men and above all working women.<br />  When big fights will rage to turn back the Clinton-Gore-Bush Cheeny billionaire led attacks on the standard of living of working people, their wars against people around the world, the hideous lame, stupid repulsive culture that blares out of the television and the radio monopolies, books like this will be in the hands of the young women, the young men who will lead the changes.

It is vitally important at a time when the Wynton Marsalis/Albert Murray school of Jazz history is trying to claim that Jazz is a \\"celebration\\" of American capitalism. Kofsky shows Jazz musicians have been and continue to be victims of capitalism! And as someone with a background in studying the history of country music and western swing, I can agree with another reviewer here that the same tales of exploitation can be told about white musicans as well.<br /><br />Kofsky is most effective in the individual stories he tells in the separate articles in this book where as has already been pointed out he \\"names names.\\" Kofsky unmasks a lot of people who have manufactured images that they were friends of the jazz musician like Blue Note Records.<br /><br />One of his most interesting vignettes is his exposure of Vanderbuilt heir, self-praising liberal, and paternalist interferer with Jazz John Hammond. He exposes how Hammond's phoney story about Bessie Smith's death was part of the legend that helped net the already-wealthy Hammond scores of thousands of dollars, back when a dollar was a dollar, while Smith and her estate got zilch. Just the Bessie Smith story is worth the price of the book!<br /><br />While this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!	2003-05-20

The young communists of Cuba requested that Pathfinder Press make this collection available in Spanish to educate the youth of Cuba about courage, audacity, scientific thinking, racism, and the need for pride in the bravery of youth, pride in the strength of the oppressed, pride in the example of Malcolm X.  These are speeches to young people given literally all over the world. Some speeches are given in Harlem. Some of these speeches were given in Selma Alabama at the height of the civil rights struggle in 1965.  One of the richest and most beautiful speeches here is the full text--published for the first time in this edition, of a debate Malcolm participated in at the Oxford University union.  Another speech is given in Tanzania to African revolutionists.  There is one message, Malcolm X's belief that young people, can and will change the world. Malcolm X's believe that the spirit of the then courageous simba fighters in Congo, Viet Cong in Vietnam, revolutionary student youth in France, and civil rights fighters in America could spread to youth around the world and save the world from the racist, imperialist exploiters, and build a world run by what Malcolm calls the \\"field niggers\\" is these speeches.  Now old myself, though of the generations that heard Malcolm in these years and places, I have no doubt that young people of today facing worse conditions than in Malcolm's time, can pick up where the youth of the 1960s left off, and finish the job the old can no longer do!<br /><br />While this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!	2003-05-19

CLR James, the most brilliant of West Indian intellectuals, cricketeer, sports writer, analyst of literature including his prescient writing on Melville done while imprisoned by the INS in NY harbor at the height of the 1950s witch hunt and above all the masterful author of BlacK Jacobins, the revolutionary Marxist History of Haiti's rebellions, and under the prodding of Trotsky and of the US Socialist Workers Party, the Revolutionary Struggle of the Negro people, a modern transformation of Trotsky's ideas on the African American struggle that predicted what happened in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.<br /><br />  This book was written by James in the 1930s when he was an adherent of the real communist movement, the Fourth International led by Leon Trotsky.  It charts the rise and fall of the Comintern, born as the revolutionary international of Lenin, Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev, of James P. Cannon, and so many others and charts its murder by Stalin and his minions.<br /><br />  To supplement this, you must read Against the Stream, on the history of the International, by Leon Trotsky.  This is a discussion of the book, the history, and its merits by Trotskly with James.  Trotsky explains James' errors, his concentration on individual tactics than the inmpact of history on masses of workers, among so many other things.  Indeed, Trotsky's interviews with James contained in his writings of 1939-40 and 1940 are a very good antidote to the general weaknesses of petit-bourgeois intellectualism, and so genuinely wise about life in general, that they deserve to be in every home.<br /><br />  James began to desert Marxism around this time, siding with Schactman and Burnham in their fight against genuine Trotskyism and Leninism. Lured back by the SWP's tremendous success in the Black struggle and the labor movement in the late 1940s, James deserted the revolutionary movement when the Korean war came because he would not defend China and the Korean national struggle against U.S. imperialism.<br /><br /> Sadly James sunk into opportunism and intellectual anticommunism and disgraced himself in his return to Trinidad in the 1950s in his attempts at opportunism in preindependence Trinidad.<br /><br />  This work reminds us he was once a revolutionary communist. Unfortunately, so many, like the editor of this collection, try to blur the line between the Leninist James tried to be in the 1930s and the opportunist he became by the 1950s, even the Leninist James would not have wasted his time to spit upon.nary movement when the Korean war came because he would not defend China and the Korean national struggle against U.S. imperialism.<br /><br /> Sadly James sunk into opportunism and intellectual anticommunism and disgraced himself in his return to Trinidad in the 1950s in his attempts at opportunism in preindependence Trinidad.<br /><br />  This work reminds us he was once a revolutionary communist.

Covered here are how to fight bureaucracy--is it an administrative or social economic problem--the real history of the Russian revolution, and so much more. This is required reading for fighters in the former USSR, in China, Vietnam and other countries trying to fight their way out of the debris of the Stalinist regimes. This is a great asset for Cuban fighters to understand that Fidel and Che's fight against bureaucratism was not the only one.	2003-05-19

This is the story of Tete Puebla, the highest ranking women general in the Cuban army about how Cuban women fought and gained an equal role as combatants in the Cuban revolution, how revolutionary Cuban women played a decisive role in the transformation of Cuban society, about how Cuban women led the fight for literacy in the 1960s, and how Cuban women have fought in Angola, in Grenada, and wherever imperialism threatens the revolution, and how Cuban woman are ready to fight, arms in hands, against Washington's threats to overturn their revolution.<br /><br />This is no Cooks tour about the perfection of Cuban revolutionists, but it does show how Fidel fought for women's equal role because they were recognized as fighters.  To me the most wonderful part is the description of how the revolution dealt not just with the orphans of revolutionary martyrs, but with children orphaned because their parents were in Batista's murderous criminal army.  They were all treated the same, as children of the revolution.  Read this book and you will recognize the depth of the lies that Washington, and Ottawa, and London throw at the Cuban Revolution.

As the world in general, and the West Indies, Africa, and Black people in America are already facing conditions as bad as those of the great depression, working people will return to this battle, and seize not just the spirit and courage of this small island fighting against the imperialist monster, but of the concrete lessons, bad and good, won in their blood.  This small pamphlet recounts that history, those lessons, and that spirit, not in the style of some history teacher, or in the style of sentimentalist wanting you to cry over Grenada's past.

Y no solo fue una clase capitalista en su pais, sino un imperialismo que extraia ganancias de muchos paises del sur y centro de su continente.<br />Parece ironico, pero asi es el dilema del capitalismo en su fase imperialista actual. Sudafrica era uno de los ultimos ejemplos de lo que Lenin explicaba a principios del siglo XX en relacion de los paises sometidos al capitalismo (Imperialismo: la fase superior del capitalismo). Habiendo consumido su periodo revolucionario con la Guerra Civil de los Estados Unidos, de 1865 en adelante la burguesia ya no es capaz de ofrecer el liderazgo para ninguna revolucion democratica en ningun rincon del mundo. Unicamente los campesinos y trabajadores pueden instalar las leyes de igualdad, con la burguesia esperando impaciente de regresar del margen para tomar el poder una vez consumidas las necesidades democraticas.<br />Con Nelson Mandela de frente, el Congreso Nacional Africano impuso los minimos de igualdad, y asi acabo con un imperio pequeno pero tan brutal como el de Israel hoy en dia.

It is a crime that her first book length work had to wait so long. We all needed her writing in book form years ago.<br /><br />  This is a real, no sensationalism, no romanticism, story, not simply of a character's battle with drug addiction, but really with her character's battle with self, with family, with the strange world that we are all born into. Her character goes from a lower middle class high school girl to a heroin user, to a thief to a wanderer back and forth across the country to support this life. You never want to put the book down, because it is all posed out of the dramatic, but realistic way McEnulty develops the emotional and family life of her protagonist. We come to understand and even live in her character's choices, even if we know they aren't right.  She never patronizes her character or her character's world.<br /><br />  I particularly like her realistic depiction of drug \\"rehab\\" programs and their abusive, sadistic treatment of people who need love, understanding, and more than a minor chance to move forward.<br /><br /> I don't want to say anything about how I liked how the book ended or the actual plot, because this is a real page-turner, a book you have to read every word of to find out what happens, that never lets you down.<br />  My only problem is that there is not another Pat McEnulty book in the bookstores or on Amazon to buy and read now that I have finished this one.

Still if you love Pres, you do need this book.<br />Everything the other comments say negative about this book is true. I say this as an academic who has written texts that have been used in Black studies for decades. I do find his comments about racism and reception of Young and his attempt to draw on comment on Young in the Black press to be interesting and to the general point. However, to explain why these forces had one effect on Lester Young, and say another effect on Duke Ellington is the real task of a biographer.<br /> Daniels sounds like a neo conservative of the Albert Murray Wynton Marsalis variety. He tries to shoehorn Lester Young into his own beliefs in the strength of traditional conservative Black middle class culture and institutions regardless of the facts. To do this, Daniels goes off on long digressions where any practical information about or reference to Lester Young disappears, and instead we suffer under Daniels's blather.<br /><br /> For example, even though Lester quit school in the fourth grade and always said he hated school, Daniels tries to paint Lester's success as a product of his parents stressing the importance of education (LOL). Even though Lester stopped going to church as soon as he was old enough not to get a licking for it, Daniels tries to paint him as a product of his own fairy tale view of the \\"Black Church.\\"<br /><br /> There little sytematic discussion of Lester's music, his saxophone playing as it relates to the real art of the saxophone, or of Jazz and popular music. There is no commentary on some of the more interesting studies of Lester's music: G&uuml;nter Schuler's analysis in his Swing book comes to mind. In fact there is almost no discussion of Lester Young's real role in the Count Basie Orchestra on a musical level. This, the central part of Lester's work, is simply brushed aside.<br />  Aside from the interesting comments about his relations with his family that mainly come from Daniel's hard work locating and interviewing friends and family of Lester Young, Lester Young's personality seems to disappear as the book procedes.  What we get instead are excuses for Daniels to launch on 5-10-20 page essays on his views about African American culture, racism in America, the strength of the Black middle class, and other topics.<br /> Even Daniels does not believe the reader can really understand Lester Young by reading this huge expensive tome. He constantly refers to matters that he expects the reader to already know about fully from somewhere else. He leaves out so many things and he has a number of factual errors. He seems to be ignorant of a lot of things that are available in other texts on the subject that would support his arguments as well as stuff that would not<br /> One droll example is that in an interview about continuing swing bands in the 1950s, Pres sarcastically answered, \\"Bob Crosby is still swinging.\\" Daniels is so ignorant of Lester Young and music that he takes this statement for good coin about Pres's appreciation of the Bobcats. Daniels' is ignorant of the obvious sarcasm in the remark. Pres considered Bob Crosby so square that he used \\"Bob Crosby\\" his nickname for narks! If he needed to inform a fellow pot lover to lay low because of a narc, Lester would say, \\"Bob Crosby is here.\\" If the heat was heavy, Pres would say, \\"Yeah and his brother Bing too!\\"  Isn't there someone who really knows about Lester Young and loves him enough not to make such mistakes able to get a research grant and a book contract to write the book this should have been?<br /><br /> What is good about this book is that Daniels has unearthed a lot of material about Lester's family, his growing up, and how relatives and other musicians viewed him personally. The portrait of Lester personally is much more like what people I have met who knew or met him have given thanwhat any other book has given us.<br />He does provide some information, though scant, about Lester's marriages and female affiliations,<br /> Even in this regard facts that are apparent in other texts that would question the picture of Pres as simply a family loving, square representative of Black middle class values that loved family and golf and had a good relationship with his wives all along are neglected. For example Daniels briefly mentions Elaine Swain, the woman who lived with and helped out Pres in every way in the last years of his life when Pres left his wife, home, and kids and moved into the Alvin Hotel in Manhatten. Daniels says nothing about Swain's relationship with Pres. He really doesn't seem to know that other sources indicate that Lester's scene had gotten so far Daniels' picture of Pres's supposed suburban bliss that Swain shoplifted to support Pres during those final days.<br /> Daniel's tries to defend Pres's post war music against those who claim it deteriorated. I agree about that, and find Lester's Last regular recording, Laughing Just to Keep from Crying a masterpiece: it stayed replaying on my CD player a full day after I got it. However, Daniels just doesn't know enough about music to provide a real description of the place of his later music and its relationship to Pres's art as a whole and the history of Jazz. Daniels has nothing to say about Pres's self-destructive drinking other than to say other musicians and Barrymore were alcoholics. Because he is simply ignorant of Jazz and music, he can't really point out the great albums in Young's post war work like that one and The Jazz Giants, or for that matter the great cuts on his work with basie and Billie before the war either!<br /> The information on the family and personal life--taken with a grain of salt and only accepted where Daniels is presenting documented information about Lester Young as opposed to his own general ideas--is useful, but only if it is added to other work on Lester.<br />Again, isn't there someone else who loves lester young, is really familiar with the literature about Lester Young, knows enough about Jazz music to write intelligently about the music, and who cares enough to write the book this should have been.t any other book has given us.<BR>He does provide some information, though scant, about Lester's marriages and female affiliations, <br /> Even in this regard facts that are apparent in other texts that would question the picture of Pres as simply a family loving, square representative of Black middle class values that loved family and golf and had a good relationship with his wives all along are neglected.

Abortion is part of the right of women to their own humanity, to control their own bodies, to live their own lives, to free themselves of the idea they are baby making machines for some man, for some God, for some government, for someone else. Restrictions on it are a recent 19th and 20th Century capitalist affliction--before the late 19th century only rich people could afford safe abortions-- aimed at producing cannon fodder, and keeping women in their place. Read this pamphlet and realize this is not a neutral issue. This right stands as the vanguard in the fight for women's rights against the sexism that is fundamental to society.

But more than that, he was a revolutionist, hungry to do whatever he could to help new armies of oppressed and working people fight with the best weapons and achieve victory.  In this pamphlet, he addresses the then new women's liberation movement.  Novack shows how women's struggles can play an important role in the battle to free humanity from capitalism. Novack explains how deeply rooted women's oppression is in the capitalist system, and how the demands of women for reproductive rights, for equality on the job and in political life, and against the sexist social life and culture of this society are part of the demands of all working people against capitalist exploitation.<br />We can expect a new dynamic struggle of women for their rights to emerge as part of the growing resistance of working people around the world to imperialist wars, near depression conditions in the economy, and increasing repression.  Reading this pamphlet will help us understand, embrace, and support that movement.	2003-03-09

Yet she chose the workers movement, the revolutionary communist movement, without restraint as heartily and strongly as she did everything else!  She had signed up for the duration and fought every battle to the death!  She received a bigger prize than Reuther ever did!<br />  Bea was 10 times smarter than something like Reuther, tied to her class, not by sentiment, but by conviction of who you really need in a fight. She was not some nostalgia monger harping back to the \\"good old days\\" when even Reuther was militant, but a fighter who kept on fighting against world War 2, against the cold war, against Reuther, fought even when her sister sold up and gave up, she fought on until she could fight with people like Malcolm X and Che Guevara.

First there was the struggle the fight by Germany and the US and Japan to push Britain and France aside that led to scores of millions of death in two world wars. Since the late 1960s the growing competition between Europe and Japan with the United States has come to the center of world politics. Trotsky outlines this competition in these two speeches given just after the First World War. Yet, the same contradictions are behind the two Bushes' wars against Iraq. As badly as Washington wants to prevent any nation in the Arab East from being able to defend itself against US aggression, Washington wants to use With its possession of the world's greatest murder machine--the US military-to gain the upper hand over the imperialist powers in Europe and Japan. The oil in Iraq is buts another trump card against Europe and Japan, dependant as they are on that oil. These, and not any greater proclivity for peace or concern with the rights of the peoples of Iraq, are the causes of the frictions between Washington, Bonn, and Paris over conquest of Iraq. Trotsky analyzes these frictions and explains that there is no way out of this wrangling, and the wars and disasters it breeds but replacing the rule of the imperialists with the rule of working people!<br /><br />While this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!	2003-02-08

Barnes, thenational secretary of the Socialist Workers Party, explains why the democratic tasks of national liberation and unification advanced by the ANC and its allies were the correct way forward for the peoples of South Africa. With examples from the policies of Lenin and the Russian Bolsheviks and theCuba and Nicaraguan revolutions, Barnes takes on sectarians who attacked the ANC because it did not have an explicitly anticapitalist program. Along with Barnes' speech, this issue contains \\"The Freedom Charter\\"--the political program the ANC advanced in the antiapartheid struggle -- \\"The Future Belongs to US\\" a Speech by ANC leader Oliver Tambo, a speech by Fidel Castro explainingwhy and how Cuba supported the freedom struggle in Angola, and a summary of the then latest stages in the South African struggle by Ernest Harsch.	2003-01-22

Du Bois Speaks: Speeches and Addresses 1920-1963	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The sharpness of a great mind directed against racism	What struck me with these articles and speeches--after mainly knowing Dubois from his larger works--is the rigorousness of his mind, and his great literary gifts.  Some of the writing is thrilling just as writing. Also quite interesting are his analyses of Garvey and his attempt to look back at his debates with Booker T. Washington particularly on industrial versus academic education.<br /><br />Dubois was never a Marxist.  In 1916 he shocked general Black opinion by supporting the racist segregationist Woodrow Wilson for president and for his support to US participation in World War beliving that Black participation would further progress for Black people and give supporters of African liberation like himself influence in the peace settlement, a cruel illusion.  Likewise, during the 1930s, Dubois tended to be taken in by Japanese imperialism's claims to defend all of the \\"colored races\\" against US and American imperialism.  During the Second World War, Dubois supported Washington's imperialist war, although he criticized the segregation of the US war machine.<br /><br />  In the late mid 1940s W.E. B.  Dubois confused his own progressivist liberal politics with the similarly proliberal policies of the American Communist party and Maoist China. He even became a member of the CPUSA, and left the country for exile first in China and then in Ghana.<br /><br />  However, it is very clear that long before this confusion, Dubois understood that American racism was rooted in the world-wide pattern of imperialist domination of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Dubois' ideas and speeches are needed to complete understanding of racism and imperialism.	2003-01-19

He was a respected figure across the movement by people who agreed and disagreed with him, an an important leader who helped chart a central political course for the movement, often selected to negotiate with the government and police in the biggest demonstrations of the 1960s and 1970s. He also was an experience revolutionary working class militant with experiences going back to the antiwar struggles of GIs and sailors at the end<br /> of WWII. His history is the only decent political history of the struggle against the Vietnam war, and the only political analysis that is useful. It is written not as nostalgia, not as memoir, not as history for academics, but written so future generations of fighters against war, for workers, for women, for Blacks, Chicanos, and other oppressed people can use it to deepen their fights and win the way the antiwar movement did.

Covered here are how to fight bureaucracy--is it an administrative or social economic problem--the real history of the Russian revolution, and so much more.  This is required reading for fighters in the former USSR, in China, Vietnam and other countries trying to fight their way out of the debris of the Stalinist regimes.

It is no less important today as fascist, racist, and other reactionary forces use it around the world to divert workers from the struggle against capitalism, and to divert fighters against Israeli Zionism from the real battle with imperialism and colonialism.  This pamphlet not only explains the Marxist policy on this issue, but also gives the examples of struggles the Socialist Workers against the US ruling class in the 1930s and 1940s on this issue to open the doors to refugees from Hitler.

It centers on the Chinese revolutionary events of the mid and late 1920s, though it continues into the 1930s when the Stalin Bukharin leadership in the Communist International forced the Chinese revolutionists to subordinate their struggle to a block with bourgeois militarist Chiang Kai-shek It is not surprising that when it was made, the founding central leaders of the Chinese communist movement were won to Trotsky's Left Opportunism. In letters and articles and political documents for the Russian Communist Party and the Comintern, Trotsky explains how the only road forward for Chinese workers and peasants was asserting their own power and independence and how only the struggle against capitalism could solve the problems facing China.<br /><br />As such, it provides an adequate background to the middle class and Stalinist nature of the Chinese Communist party that headed the revolution in 1949.  As such<br /><br />It can be read now, as a new generation of fighting workers, peasants, and youth in China looks for real communist alternatives to both capitalism and the pseudo-Communism of China's Stalinist Communist party.<br /><br />While this book is sometimes not directly available from Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, which you can reach by clicking on New and Used further up this page.	2003-01-03

His &quot;In Socialist Norway,&quot; is a humorous well-written account of how the Social Democrats who ruled Norway in the thirties, buckled under to the pressure of native fascists and Stalin to first restrict Trotsky's right to defend himself against the slanders of the Moscow trials, and then placed him under house arrest until he was invited to Mexico. I found his analysis of Kamenev, Zinoviev, and Stalin himself, in his articles written in Mexico explaining the Moscow trials to be interesting studies in how personal character is a factor in revolutionary leadership and retreat from that leadership.  Also very interesting is the correspondence and proposals Trotsky wrote around building the commission led by American philosopher John Dewey that investigated the Moscow trials. As always with all of the Trotsky Writings Volumes, there is a week-to-week, sometimes day-by-day, chronicle of world events, and of Trotsky's struggle to build a revolutionary movement.	2002-12-31

His chief concern is how the social and political ideas in these books reflect ideas about revolution in the 20tjh Century.  What is dissected is not only these novels but also the various alternatives and expressions of revolutionary politics in the US and Europe throughout the 20th Century.  Siegel ranges from late Victorian Fabians to the upsurges of the thirties, to the postwar petit bourgeois fall from anti-Stalinism to anticommunism.  As such he contributes to the political education of revolutionists about these currents of middle class thought.<br />  What is outstanding in these essays is that Siegel never confuses political evaluation of the ideas of these texts with evaluation of these texts as novels.  His introduction is an interesting example of how as Terry Eagleton has stressed, a real Marxist critic of literature does not discard the tools and ideas that &quot;bourgeois&quot; literary studies have offered us, but uses them to advance our understanding of both literature and politics.	2002-12-27

This was a man who had worked with Lenin and Trotsky in the Comintern who had stood up the Chiang Kai Shek, and to Maoism.  This was a serious revolutionary Marxist who became a focus for former Red Guards escaping Mao who went all the way to Paris to learn from him.  These articles and documents explain the nature of the Chinese revolution, its strength and its betrayal by Stalinism, as well as the capacities of Chinese workers and peasants to change the world. In his writing, Peng had the gift to be both theoretically clear as a revolutionist, and to be concrete as a writer showing how what he was talking about affected the real lives of the Chinese people. Of great interest is his depiction of how the &quot;higher officials&quot; actually lived their lives of privilege and luxury in the supposed days of &quot;Maoist austerity.:  As new battles are simmering in China-- strikes, demonstrations, protests--the new generation of fighters must find this wonderful book by one of China's first generation of real communists.	2002-12-27

This book is still pretty good for that.<br /> Trotsky takes apart the bourgeois liberal, imperialist, and \\"democratic\\" illusions about Britain, and shows how in a time of crisis, more and more like the economic and political crisis faced in the US, Britain, and other imperialist countries today, only a revolutionary working class solution is correct. I found his criticism of the philosophy of political gradualism offered by British social democrats and Conservative politicians particularly pointed at both reformist and conservative labor bureaucrats today.<br /> The current editions contains contemporary responses this book by British reformist labor party leaders H. N. Brailsford, Ramsey McDonald, and George Lansbury and philosopher Bertrand Russell as well as Trotsky's responses to their criticism. It also contains 20 pages of reviews of Where is Britain going from bourgeois, reformist, and communist newspapers and magazines from Britain, the US, and Germany.<br /> Just as rich, is \\"After the General Strike,\\" Trotsky's analysis of the great British General strike of 1926 and its betrayal by Britain's trade union and labor party bureaucrats?	2002-12-07

This is a short, clear, but not simple book. It appraises the values and contributions that empiricists made starting with Bacon. It charts their contributions not only to philosophy, but also to the emerging capitalist society's ability to transform science, politics, religion, and the economy. Novack gives us what the value of thinkers as far away from Marxism as Berkeley, Hume, and Mach. He has one of the clearest expositions of their ideas (OH if I had known about this book when I had to read Bishop Berkeley back in college!). He charts how their ideas reflected the limitations and expansions of the point of historical, social, and intellectual development the societies as well as their later influences.  An important contribution in this book is his critique of empiricist thinking by Locke and others who provided the intellectual underpinnings for bourgeois democratic thought, revolutionary in its time, reactionary in our own.  As a Marxist, Novack sees his task also to show where dialectical thinking, even in its idealist phase under Hegel, advanced beyond pure empiricism, and to show how Dialectial Materialism can answer the fundamental problems posed both by Empricism and its Rationalist opponents.	2002-10-21

It has always been useful in understanding Muhammed and Islam from a scientfic Marxist view. For fun, I would recommend reading the book together with the passages on Muhammed in Rhushdie's Satanic verses.<br />I detest the condescension that some people have about Muhammed and this book. Unlike Christ or the Jewish Prophets and most other founds of religions, Muhammed was a person who lived in recorded history, left a mark by real records of his life, and had a recorded life and achievemensts even before he became a religious leader. We know little about him, but almost all of that is known from real history, not hagiagraphy.<br /><br /> Christians are only lucky that no such book exists about Christ, because Christ--if he existed--left much less of a real trace in records than Muhammed. Christians also benefit from the rigorous censorship and recrafting the Christian texts received when Christianity was transformed from being an underground religion of the oppressed and socially alienated, to the religion of the Roman state and ruling class.<br /> Rodison is not a pro imperialist, but a Marxist who defends the Arab revolution against imperialism. He is an objective scholar. If you aren't ready for the theoritical complexity and terse theory of Islam and Capital, please investigate his Israel, A settler colonial state.

Battles went on that could have prevented World War two, prevented fascism in Spain, and more.<br />  Trotsky's advice here is not just directed to analyzing the big questions, but also discussing how small groups of revolutionists were affected by these big events, how they could deepen their role in the mass struggle.<br />  With war, and what some call a gathering world depression looming in front of working people around the world, the same questions before French workers in the 1930s are coming before workers, youth, farmers and others who want to fight today.

He felt a special duty to examine and critique John Dewey, who Novack met and respected and worked with in civil liberties struggles, especially in the defense of Leon Trotsky against Stalin's slanders.<br /> If he began this work in his small book the Origins of Empiricism, he felt this work was completed with this work.  He could have published a simpler critique of Dewey much earlier, but his goal was to get to the roots of American Pragmatism and expose its strengths and weaknesses, and to indicate the answers dialectical thought in general, and Marxism in particular had for it.<br />  When the smoke clears, when the struggles of working people push away the confusion that the Stalinoid Moscow and Peking hacks have anything to do with Marxist Philosophy, or that petit bourgeois opponents of Marxism who masquerade as Marxist from university chairs can help fighting working people, farmers, youth, and real revolutionary intellectuals, this book by a life-long revolutionary fighter will be known as one of the classics of Marxist Philosophy.	2002-10-10

For the first time, we have the story not just from the Cuban side, but using the internal documents of the US and Soviet governments, and the experience of the Cubans. This is the full truth about October 1962. The author reveals that the Cuban's main agreement to bring missiles and Soviet troops to Cuba came in the face of an open military and political campaign by Washington to invade Cuba and how Cuban resistance to this invasion threat, both by its military preparedness, the politica determination of its people, and its support around the world was what really stopped the threat of war and invasion. Acosta also explains how from the first, the Fidel and the other Cuban leaders did not want the Soviets to keep the arms and missiles secret and that they believed there would not have been any crisis if they had publically asserted Cuba's right to defend herself. This book is has more than 80 pages of Cuban documents from the crisis including transcripts of the October 30 and 31, 1962, meetings between Fidel Castro and UN Secretary General U Thant. It as 16 pages of end notes, many footnotes, an 8-page glossary, a 6-page bibliography, and 28 pages of photographs, as well as the only existing map that shows the location of Soviet missiles and other military units in Cuba during the crisis.	2002-10-04

Dobbs was the general organizer, a man who helped turn the Teamsters into an industrial union,together with other leaders of the Socialist Workers Party and the Minneapolis teamsters. They built a militant movement that included not just union members, but farmers, the unemployed and many other working people.  Dobbs and the militant teamsters and the Socialist Workers party refused to give up with the Teamsters bureaucracy and the Roosevelt administration tried to jail and persecute them and drive them out of the union. This is about that fight. Particularly poignant is Dobb's depiction of his last conversation with Teamster's boss Tobin. Tobin dangled a secure position as an IBT international leader before Dobbs, a working man with young daughters. The path of resistance could and did lead Dobbs to prison. Yet, he explains why he chose to fight and continue to fight the rest of his life, long after Tobin had been forgotten.

Barnes, the national secretary of the Socialist Workers Party, explains why the democratic tasks of national liberation and unification advanced by the ANC and its allies were the correct way forward for the peoples of South Africa.  With examples from the policies of Lenin and the Russian Bolsheviks and the Cuba and Nicaraguan revolutions, Barnes takes on sectarians who attacked the ANC because it did not have an explicitly anticapitalist program.  Along with Barnes' speech, this issue contains \\"The Freedom Charter\\"--the political program the ANC advanced in the antiapartheid struggle -- \\"The Future Belongs to US\\" a Speech by ANC leader Oliver Tambo, a speech by Fidel Castro explaining why and how Cuba supported the freedom struggle in Angola, and a summary of the then latest stages in the South African struggle by Ernest Harsch.	2002-08-23

It was not only the abstract need for socialism, that Morrow explains the Spanish revolution could have won only by going to workers power.  The disastrous policies of the Stalinists, the social democrats, and the anarchist labor bureaucrats subordinated the struggle to the dictates of big business in Spain and imperialism abroad, the same forces that welcomed Franco.<br />  Morrow is very good at explaining how this policy prevented the workers, peasants, and oppressed peoples in Spain from solving the many national and democratic tasks, supposedly solved in the US in 1776 and in France in 1789: land to the tiller, freedom from feudal rights and powers of nobility and church, national independence for the colonies in Africa, linguistic freedom and national rights up to self-determination for Catalonia and the Basque Country, to name a few.  Fighting for these things was the natural reaction of popular masses in Spain as soon as Franco tried to overturn the republic.  Sadly, Morrow shows how the Republican government lost because it turned its back not only on these rights, not only on socialism, but even the basic democratic right of workers and peasants to organize political parties, unions, workers councils, to publish and speak freely.<br />  Morrow is not all depression and criticism. He saw with his own eyes the natural response of the working peoples in Spain to fight beyond the limitations of class collaboration.  He saw how that power nearly defeated Franco and how it could have defeated Franco especially if the Republic had joined with the struggle of the colonial masses and oppressed nationalities to gain freedom Read Morrow and learn how the coming struggles will be victories and not defeats.	2002-07-20

I can remember LDC telling me how she strained to hear Corky Gonzales on the radio from Denver, and remebers names like Jorge Angel Guiterrez before they got bought out. That flame still burns in her poetry even if she is a big time poet and a department head at a gavacho university.  Read these poems, read them outloud, listen and u will hear yourself<br />I can remember in 1970 flying from Cairo Illinois where white cops and racist Klansman had intimidated and shot and murdered and embattled Black workers and farmers into a state of terror to Crystal City Texas, where La Raza Unida, a Chicano political party based on working class and farming Chicanos, and white and black workers drawn to the same needs ran Zavalla County.<br />  The Chicano militancy of the 60s and the 1970s road on the backs of the Black and Puerto Rican struggles, rode on the backs on the open ears it had for Che and Fidel, for what was happening then in Chile, and from the fights in Mexico.  It exploded across Texas, across California, across New Mexico, and Colorado, even in places like Minneapolis and Chicago, long before the millions of Mexicans who have come since then arrived.<br />  This volcano erupted then, not as some freak occurrence, but because a people oppressed, denied their nationality will rise and fight until they gain their justice.<br />  .  Yet, the volcano of another Chicano revolt is simmering. Like all volcanoes, like the volcanoes under Blacks, and Puerto Ricans, under workers in and out of unions, under women, the longer the volcano does not explode, the bigger the explosion, the more it can blow the top off the mountain and let the lava flow, hot and burning, sweeping away the oppression of capitalism, remaking the world, making us free.

In its way it is in line with the Communist Manifesto, with the fundamental documents of the Comintern, knitting together the history of world revolution, and of its Marxist vanguard in particular.  This is not just about Trotsky and his contributions, but about how the Cuban communists fit into the continuation of Leninism, of what lessons we can learn from the crushed revolutions in Grenada and Nicaragua and by extension Burkina Faso.<br />  There is so much, how Lenin's understanding of the importance of reaching out to farmers is true today, how new currents of workers searching for communist answers will keep emerging as they did in Cuba, how Trotsky learned Leninism, and how Trotskyists have learned like Trotsky did, not to be Trotskyists, but to be communists.<br />  For many, this pamphlet will take them back to the founding documents of the Communists International. For others this will take the to the continuing revolutionary  politics of Fidel and the other Cuban communists.<br />  If you are serious about changing the world,  you need to read this, study this, and follow the links this important book takes you to revolutionists throughout history and around the world.	2002-07-18

Cannon is one of the central leaders of the US Communist Party known through the labor and civil liberties movement as the leader of the International Labor Defense,sent to Moscow to represent his faction in the party.  In 1928 Cannon along with two of his assistants happen about Trotsky's critique of the draft program of the Communist International.  They decides that these are the right ideas, and they fight for them, knowing they will lose offices, and jobs, not knowing but facing being attacked in the streets, their homes burglarized, pilloried through the labor movement from a leader of tens of thousands to a leader of a dozen. This book shows what Cannon's faith in his ideas meant and how they struggle to build a nucleus of a real movement because of the faith of ideas and in the revolutionary capacities of humanity.

I have friends who paint and sculpt and they don't even think about the fact that their art rarely reaches even middle class people let alone the working and farming majority. When something stirs them and they want to take action, they get afraid about their grants, their patrons, that artist in resident spot at a university, or that artist on a cruise, or on a rich person's art club trip to France or Egypt. They get scared to make a phone call or even write a letter because art in the US in particular is on strings to the rich.......................................................<br />  Once it was different.  Read this. I don't say follow surrealism, because it was just one school, born of another time, trying to surmount problems that only a socialist revolution and retransformation of society can solve.  As a revolutionist as well as an artist--I have a MFA in Creative Writing and write fictional and poetry--what is remarkable about Breton is not his narrow precepts or methods, but about the militancy to which he tried to find truth and resonance and joy without surrendering to acceptance of bourgeois society..................................<br />  The remarkable writings of Andre Breton, as gifted as a writer, as he was a painter, and more gifted as a thinker than he was either.  After World War II US imperialism went to work to try to stifle the courage and outrageousness of people like Breton to channel art into the lack of statement of abstract expressionism.  Surrealism is no more revolutionary than any other form of art.  The most famous surrealist to most people today is Dali, who didn't mind Franco at all and tried to turn himself into an NY advertizing money maker.  What is important about Breton, besides what he says about surrealism and art--and on those things I am no big judge--he was trying to find a way to fight for a free, fighting, critical, irreverant art, faced with the nauseating conservatism of formalism and the smothering idiocy of socialist realism?  What was important about Breton is that in these writings and in the manifestos here signed by non surrealists like Leon Trotsky and Diego Rivera, Breton was fighting for more than his art?  The quest to upturn (boulverser is better but not English) speak out of turn, penetrate, and speak openly that he developed in his art, in the 1930s and 1940s when most of this work was done, was connected with the struggle of artists to link up with the revolutionary struggle against imperialism, and at the same time, with the fight within the workers movement to free it self of the syphilis of Stalinism.<br />Buy this book.

This book about the strike is not a sociological or journalistic analysis, but the analysis of a longtime working class leader, who was also one of the central leaders of the anti-Vietnam war movement.

It seeks to document the changes in Malcolm's ideas in the last years of his life. It also includes Malcolm's Speech introducing his program for the Organization of Afro-American Unity which besides outlining his idea for a political struggle in the Black community, documents Malcolm's collaboration with Cuban Revolutionist Che Guevara.  Also included is the program of the OAAU.<br /><br />  Breitman, a long-time revolutionist, was one of the first people who called attention to the revolutionary significance of Malcolm and the Muslims. He is the editor Malcolm chose to put together Malcolm X Speaks.  Breitman's concern is with the view that Malcolm did not do anything signficant, particularly in the African American struggle, between his expulsion from the Muslims and his murder.  Instead, he shows how the amount of work Malcolm did to energize and organize struggle both inside the US and abroad, is how to believe and documents what Malcolm did.<br /><br />  He also comments on how Malcolm realised he needed to sharpen his critique of the Nation of Islam and Elijah Muhammed, something that is shown in February 1965: The Final Speeches, a collection of Malcolm's speeches and interviews from the last month of his life.<br /><br />While this book may not be directly available from Amazon at times, they are available from the booksfrompathfinder  on Amazon that you can find by clicking on the new and used books on this page.	2002-07-04

These speeches were written as Malcolm's home was being bombed, as men who would murder him were following him across the country, when he was switching residences every day. This is a man fighting for his life, not for himself, but for the struggle for Black liberation he had long served and for the broader world-wide battle against capitalism and imperialism he had joined. Of decisive importance is his unmaking of the corruption of the Nation of Islam, of its terror tactics against dissenters,  its financial swindles, its dealings with racist and facists. If they were most obviously among those who wished his death, he also shows his sense that the CIA, FBI, NYPD and other US government forces were his real enemy.<br /><br />  The speeches also touch onhis growing involvement in the civil rights movement in America as well as Malcolm's growing concern with the war in Vietnam and the need to support African liberation fighters in the Congo and beyond.<br /><br />  Very importantly, the material in this book contains an approach to what Elijah Mohammed and Louis Farrahkahn are about that Malcolm wanted to included in his autobiography. He wanted to revise the book to expose them, but his murder prevented it.<br /><br />While this book may not be directly available from Amazon at times, they are available from the booksfrompathfinder  on Amazon that you can find by clicking on the new and used books on this page.	2002-07-04

Malcolm is depicted as a purely humanist, apolitical person, after his trip to Mecca who simply loved everyone. The speeches and interviews from his last year show him as an increasingly political person who was working with Cuban, Congolese, Algerian revolutionists and with revolutionary socialists in the United States to fight for African liberation and against the growing US War in Indochina.<br /><br /> Moreover, Malcolm's speeches from this year also document the reactionary and corrupt practices of the Nation of Islam under Elijah Muhammad and its terror campaign against Malcolm and anyone else who dissent.  He had held back from this, but he needed to do this to expose the threats against himself and his family.<br /><br />  As in his other speeches and interviews Malcolm speaks in a voice with lots of practical school-of-hard-knocks knowledge and reasoning, in a soul stirring, voice, with lots of wit as well as wisdom thrown in.<br /><br />While this book may not be directly available from Amazon at times, they are available from the booksfrompathfinder  on Amazon that you can find by clicking on the new and used books on this page.	2002-07-04

This book was an effort on his part to expose how the FBI followed Malcolm X from the time he wrote to a radical youth group for information, long before Malcolm X joined the Muslims until his death, a death Malcolm more and more expected would come from the FBI/CIA.  Along the way the FBI has preserved speeches and letters and views of Malcolm as they evolved throughout his life.  Anyone who treats Malcolm X as some sort of prefabricated god, and not a man whose views developed over time, over experience, and particularly after his exposure to the struggles of the civil rights movement, and the anti-imperialist struggles ongoing in Cuba, Africa, and Vietnam at the time, is in for a rude shock as this book shows how his ideas changed and grew.<br />  I recommend Pathfinder Press's series of books by Malcolm X. Malcolm selected Pathfinder to publish his speeches before he died.  The first book Malcolm X speaks was selected while Malcolm was living, though published after he was murdered.  Every book has been published in cooperation and with royalties to Malcolm's family.  Pathfinder has gone as far as the jungles of Guyana to find every speech or interview available with Malcolm particularly in the last years of his life.	2002-07-04

I was always struck by how he shows the imporance of the struggle for land and support to the small farmers, not by analysis but by describing the debates he heard on this subject between Spanish peasants and Franco's troops.<BR>       The rise of Le Pen and France and the attempts of the same social democrats and stalinists to get workers in that country to subordinate the struggle to supporting Chirac is an errie echo of the same policies that Morrow shows led to the defeat in Spain.	2002-05-24

Most of them are academics that simply see Marxism as an angle for them to hold onto cushy university jobs.<br />  This is the most important work of American history by a real Marxist. George Novack was a real Marxist, a fighter to build the real struggles for workers, Blacks, women, Latinos, and other oppressed in the world.  Like a real Marxist, like Marx, he worked not on gaining a university chair, but in fighting to build an international revolutionary movement of Socialist Workers.  He fought to free the Scottsboro Boys, he worked directly with Leon Trotsky, to expose the crimes of Stalin's Moscow trials, he defended worker militants who would not succumb to FDR's war drive, he worked to publicize the ideas of Che Guevera, Fidel Castro, Malcolm X, and he was a key figure in the struggle to expose the FBI's Cointelpro.  He fought this capitalism for 50 years!!!<br />  This is real Marxist history because as a fighter, Novack understood the real lives, the real struggles, the real history of all the American revolutionary fighters in this history and many besides.  That is why this book is not just a nice look at our past, but a tool workers, youth, intellectuals, not just in the USA, but around the world can use to fight for a future where the world is ruled by working people and farmers, not by the filthy rich.	2002-05-24

As a lifelong student of anthropology, Reed has no problem exposing many authors as unscientific and sexist by quoting and then destroying their main arguments. Among these are Lionel Tiger, author of Men In Groups, Robert Ardrey, author of The Territorial Imperative, Konrad Lorenz who wrote On Aggression, and Desmond Morris, writer of aked Ape. She reserved a whole chapter for the famed Harvard zoologist Edward O. Wilson and has a field day describing his version of 'social Darwinism'--the erroneous view that human societies are simply varieties of animal societies and human nature is identical with animal nature. Women surrounded today by these same backward ideas will love this book. for its confident and well-researched content. The ardent animal lovers of today also should read this small, powerful book for our differences and similarities are intriguing in the able hands of this Marxist-feminist author.	2002-05-17

He describes the thrill in 1953 of hearing that Fidel Castro had stormed the Moncada Barracks. The action went down to military defeat -- but it was a sign that there were people who would never waver, and Dreke responded.

Nick Tosches brought Emmett Miller onto the stage of writing about American popular music about 20 years ago in his magic-realistist imagined chapters on Emmett Miller in his original edition of Country Music about 20 years ago. At the time, his comments were imaginary because we knew so little about Miller.  As Tosches wrote, for all we knew then he could be running a candy store in Jersy City.<br />  Over those twenty years Tosches found out about Miller and records a lot of that information in this book.  This is great selfless work by Tosches and by other scholars who were inspired by his work and by Miller's music.<br /><br />  Well, this is not fiction, this is what we know about him, about minstrelry, about his life. You can't blame Nick for the fact that the truth is a bit less colorful and still less filled in than fiction.<br />  Also, Tosches is no academic and does not pretend to be. He's music's best and most literary representative of the new journalism.<br />  Miller is important.  He was good. His music sounds great today.  If you don't think so, you need your ears adjusted, your sense of life, love, and joy revived. He may not have been a financial success, but critical trend setters, particularly in Country Music, have styled themselves after him to this day.<br />  Bob Wills--another former blackface perform-- combined Emmett Miller, the blues of the MIssissippi Sheiks, La Musica Ranchera, and ranch dance music into Western Swing.  Wills auditioned his singers throughout his career by asking them to sing Miller's hits and comparing them to Miller. Wills recorded songs identified with Miller throughout his career.<br /><br /> Hank William's biggest success was essentially an imitation of an imitation of Miller.  Merle Haggard has acknowledged his heritage by recording a Miller tribute album and usually does a Miller-Wills number during every concert.  Leon Redbone gets a very large amount of his singing style and personna from Miller.<br /><br /> The problem of minstrelry can't be discussed without discussing race and culture in America in a way most people can't discuss it, like it is a real problem that is really there and part of the discoursde, win or lose. I don't exactly agree with Tosches' take on the problem, but, at least, he approaches the issue honestly and put it in the center of the discourse where it<br />belongs.<br />  Perhaps, unlike Tosches' Country Music and Hellfire, this is not a book that belongs in every home, every school, every library, every bookstore, but it belongs on every bookshelf of anyone interest in American popular music, especially country music and Western Swing.er.<BR>     <BR> The problem of minstrelry can't be discussed without discussing race and culture in America in a way most people can't discuss it, like it is a real problem that is really there and part of the discoursde, win or lose.

His \\"In Socialist Norway,\\" is a humorous well-written account of how the Social Democrats who ruled Norway in the thirties, buckled under to the pressure of native fascists and Stalin to first restrict Trotsky's right to defend himself against the slanders of the Moscow trials, and then placed him under house arrest until he was invited to Mexico. I found his analysis of Kamenev, Zinoviev, and Stalin himself, in his articles written in Mexico explaining the Moscow trials to be interesting studies in how personal character is a factor in revolutionary leadership and retreat from that leadership.  Also very interesting is the correspondence and proposals Trotsky wrote around building the commission led by American philosopher John Dewey that investigated the Moscow trials.

The real Kronstadt had tried to take advantage of their position as military to demand privileged conditions in a country where civil war and imperialist blockade had produced mass starvation.

The speakers span several generations and range from Roger Baldwin who founded the American Civil Liberties Union to Jack Barnes, National Secretary of the Socialist Workers Party.  In memorializing Cannon as a thinker, a fighter, an activist, a writer, they speak not just of the importance of one human being, but of the legacy of principled working class politics, the lessons of struggle, and the faith in humanity that Cannon brought from the generations of fighters that preceded him, from the generations he represented.  Though it has been 28 years since this meeting, we need the lessons, the principles and the struggles concentrated in these speeches.	2002-04-10

If you like old timey music this is it.<br />The emphasis is on the most songs per page written down in music, not on tab or instruction.  All these songs and what little commentary there is in this book was impossible to find elsewhere when this came out in 1964.  Remember this comes from the early 60s when you were a weirdo pinko freak if you liked this kind of music (contrary to fantasies some folks have about the folk revival)s.  This is a book to buy, go through all the songs, and enjoy.<br />To go along with this book, you should get the recordings of the NLCR.  Several compilations are available on Smithsonian Folkways that can be bought wherever you get CDS.  However, if you contact Smithsonian folkways, they will dub you a CD or a cassette tape of any of the original complete albums (I think there were about 20).  This is not exactly stereophile music where a dubbed version will be unenjoyable.  In fact, it probably will sound more like the original old time music 78s that the Ramblers were trying to imitate.<br /> The most perfect matches here would be the records of the original group with Tom Paley.  I am not one to claim, as many do, that the NLCR was no good after Paley left.  In fact, the band continued and expanded its own musician horizons. Now with them nearing their 70s they still put out good interesting music although the NLCR has now disbanded officially.  John Cohen and Mike Seeger continue to put out solo albums.<br /> All I am saying is that these were the records made before this book, originally their songbook, came out and contain most of the songs in the book.  I would note that \\"Songs from the Depression\\" is a masterpiece with some of the best picking and best songs I have ever heard.<br />Here's the list of the original; records.<br />FA 2396 New Lost City Ramblers (1958)<br />FA 2397 New Lost City Ramblers, Volume 2 (1959)<br />FA 2398 New Lost City Ramblers, Volume 3 (1961)<br />FA 2399 New Lost City Ramblers, Volume 4 (1961)<br />FA 2395 New Lost City Ramblers, Volume 5 (1962, released 1963)<br />FC 7064 Old Timey Songs for Children (1959, originally a 10\\" disc)<br />FH 5264 Songs from the Depression (1959)<br />FA 2494 Tom Paley, John Cohen and Mike Seeger Sing Songs of the New<br />Lost City Ramblers (1961)<br />FH 5263 American Moonshine and Prohibition (1962)iginal; records.<br />FA 2396 New Lost City Ramblers (1958)<BR>FA 2397 New Lost City Ramblers, Volume 2 (1959)<BR>FA 2398 New Lost City Ramblers, Volume 3 (1961)<BR>FA 2399 New Lost City Ramblers, Volume 4 (1961)<BR>FA 2395 New Lost City Ramblers, Volume 5 (1962, released 1963)<BR>FC 7064 Old Timey Songs for Children (1959, originally a 10\\" disc)<BR>FH 5264 Songs from the Depression (1959)<BR>FA 2494 Tom Paley, John Cohen and Mike Seeger Sing Songs of the New<BR>Lost City Ramblers (1961)<BR>FH 5263 American Moonshine and Prohibition (1962)	2002-04-07

I realized library priviledges I had had for 12 years would be gone in a couple weeks, I went to the music section of the FIU library and bumped into this book. I loved it, it loved me. I read it straight through--didnt go to work the next day.  I have been studying and playing traditional American music for 40 years, and this is one of the best books on any level I have ever read. Ater talking about picking up the banjo for 40 years, I bought one right after I read this book and have bought another since.<br /><br />  So much of history and opinion about popular music is just congealed prejudice and wishful thinking.  This is science and real life. The banjo is an African instrument, the traditional way of playing it is the African way of playing it. Not to speak of the non traditional post WWII guitar influenced Bluegrass way which simply adds as many blue and blues notes into the music as can be found.<br /><br />  What romanced me in this book is her interviews with African American banjo players from North Carolina and Virgina--some of whom have passed on since the book came out.  The Photographs in there are great too.<br /><br />  Cece Also made a movie of these guys that was shown back when the book first came out.  While it has been out of circulation for years, she will be showing it at the April 7-10 2005 Black Banjo Then and Now Gathering at Appalachian State College in Boone North Carolina.<br /><br />  You see that scene in the library was 6 years and three banjos ago. The book and the recordings and other development have brought many African American artists back to the banjo and back to the roots players that inspired Cece's book. Earlier this year (2004), I launched Black Banjo Then and Now, a group on Yahoo that carried forward where this book leaves off. We gather together Black banjoists from around the country, many scholars of the banjo including Cece, and folks of many types who honor or are interested in the Black legacy of the instrument. You might want to join us.<br /><br />But back to this book: Buy it, give it to your friends, make sure every library has this book, make sure this book is taught in the schools,  This is it!ed in the Black legacy of the instrument.

Some of these writings come from the public debates in the leaders of the Soviet Government with other political parties or within the leadership of the Communist Party.  All of them illustrate the triumphant strategy of advancing politics, the politics of the liberation and empowerment of working people, oppressed nationalities, and peasants as the key to military victory.  This should be read for the battles of the future.	2002-03-28

On the one hand, a great advance against European, Japanese, and American colonialism, and China's own exploiters. On the other hand, dominated by middle class Stalinists opposed to the real victory of workers in society. This set of documents chiefly by leaders of the US Socialist Workers Party documents the social transformation in China and its contradictions.  As Chinese workers, students, and farmers move forward to confront the bureaucracy, this analysis written by revolutionists who look to their struggle will become a useful tool for struggle.	2002-03-28

There is a feeling for Flaubert's 'fundamental accuracy of detail,' a feeling for raw moments of honest life. Without moralizing or drying up there are moments here when we understand life as it is, perhaps not as we want it to be. In this brilliant collection and its accompanying addendum, the novella Wildlife, which Ford told me was the extension, the last getting out of the idea, there is such tender honesty, and raw facts  particularly showing the moments his teenage male protagonists realize their parents are flawed pained people striving for things, not getting there, doing what they say is wrong, living life, and that is what life is.

There is a great modern introduction, and footnotes to make the current reader familiar.  This was not written for academics, historians, or critics, but as a tool for workers to fight Fascism in the streets, in the plants, and in battle. This tool we need now. Too many people are disoriented by the idea that Fascism is some strange product of history. Trotsky shows what is becoming all too obvious in so many countries today, that Fascism is a permanent threat as long as capitalists and workers struggle.<br /><br />While Amazon may say this book is not available from time to time, it is always available from Pathfinder's Amazon z-shop which you can reach by clicking on new and used at the time of this web page.	2002-03-09

We learn the personal strengths and weaknesses of revolutionists of the generation that made the Russian Revolution, and the generation that rose in struggle for and against Stalin in Russia and the World. Even with his worst enemies, Trotsky attempts to be objective.  He is after the lessons of character, the problems of human strength and weakness, in this world of economic crisis, imperialist wars, fascism, Stalinist betrayal, working class struggle, and proletarian revolution.  There is some eloquent inspiring writing here in his writing on Lenin and on his son Leon Sedov, murdered by Stalin's assassins.

Culture cannot be judged simply as propaganda, but as an organic expression of society, of humans struggling to depict reality. Culture needs freedom. This book contains not only works from the 20s, but works from the 1930s when Trotsky joined with Diego Rivera, the great Mexican muralist, and Andre Breton, the master of surrealism, in a revolutionary defense of modern culture against Stalinist and capitalism.	2002-03-09

Trotsky wrote this book at the request of Lenin who edited it. They saw fighting against those who wanted to impose a so-called \\"proletarian\\" culture as the official culture of the Soviet Union, as a threat to a real Marxist understanding of culture. Judging culture by its explicit politics, rather than by its expression of human life, Trotsky explains, is as far from Marxism as you can get. Trotsky explains that even some of the most reactionary minded writers have create some of the most stirringly real and vibrant literature, how to road to real socialism will come by giving working people full and free access to the best and the worst of the literature and art that capitalism has produced.

The phrase \\"Life is Beautiful\\" in the Italian film came from Leon Trotkys's last testament. It was written in exile in Mexico.  At the time Trotsky's friends, family, and comrades were being harassed, slandered and murdered by Stalin, when he himself faced imminent assasination. He also faced death from the growing illnesses that had slowed him. Yet, in his testament he proclaimed that life is beautiful. Life must be cleansed of the evil and garbage Capitalism and Stalinism have left to this world.<br /><br /> Read this book and you will see how Trotsky's life became valuable for him because he decided to fight oppression, decided to learn about the world to fight, and never stopped fighting. Maybe your life can be beautiful if you read this book, and decide to fight like Trotsky did.<br /><br />The introduction by the late Joseph Hansen Trotsky's secretary in Mexico is worth the price of the book. Joe explains how the household and work center in Mexico functioned, about how Trotsky valued hard work, but also valued celebrating comrades birthdays, hobbies like raising rabbits, trips to sites of Mexican history. Reading this also tells you how Joe organized the staff at World Outlook/ Intercontinental Press, working with him was one of the great privileges of my life.<br /><br /> In these pages and memoirs of Trotsky by Joe, George Novack, Farrell Dobbs, and other comrades who knew Trotskty, you could find how serious Trotsky enjoyed and embraced life. In Turkey if he wanted to go fishing, he went to sea with Turkish fishers in their trawlers. If he wanted to raise rabbits as a hobby, he soon was taking care of something bordered on a commercial rabbit farm.  Both in valuing work--chained to his desk was the term Trotsky passed down--and valuing parties and celebrations of new people coming onto the staff and leaving, Trotsky made his life beautiful.<br /><br />  Read this book, valued as much as a literary work as a political statement, and learn how you can make your life beautiful.	2002-02-18

A lot people who support feminism identify it with advancing middle class women in the business world and supporting women politicians in the Democrat and Republican parties. Many think feminism and Marxism don't together, given the antiwomen policies in countries like the Stalinist USSR and China.  Waters sets the record straight about the long history of struggle by the Marxist movement against the oppression of women.  She explains how capitalism is the cause of the oppression of women, and how the emancipation of women will come through the struggles of working class and farming women. Rather than opposing feminism, she charts a socialist and working class program to gain the goals of feminism, different from the goals of middle class and big business feminists.<br /><br />While this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!	2002-02-18

The most interesting to me was his story of how he went from being a forman at Western Electric and a small store owner to being one of the great leaders of the labor upsurge of the 1930s and a leader of the Socialist Workers Party.	2001-11-16

We learned of how they were won to the revolution, and of struggles of Cuban soldiers from the Bay of Pigs, to<br />Bolivia, from America to Vietnam, and in Cuba itself. Those memoirs and these interviews are a clear sign that the Cuban revolution and its leadership, especially the armed forces that the US has tried to get to subvert the revolution were holding true to the revolution, and they explained some previously unknown achievements of the Cuban military. Read these interviews, done by Socialist activists from the US, and see why. The interviews in this book explain the stories of the leaders of Cuba's armed forces, the stories of fighters who changed themselves and the world and continue to want to fight.<br /><br />While this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!	2001-11-09

The McCarthy Truman Eisenhower, Democrat Republican, Liberal Conservative capitalist witch hunt tried to take away his pension.  Jimmy fought. The Socialist Workers Party fought.

Thousands of workers, youth, intellectuals and students have struggled to build Pathfinder press, to expand its sales, editing, printing. We do this because in Pathfinder the struggles of Lenin, Trotsky, Che, Malcolm X, Maurice Bishop, Rosa Luxembourg, Thomas Sankara, Mother Jones, and many other working class, women, and national liberation fighters Pathfinder publishes have not died, but continue and deepen. This pamphlet is a speech given in Havana by Pathfinder Press's publisher, Mary Alice Waters, that explains this history and this struggle. Through it we see that the October revolution has not died in the cesspool of Soviet Stalinism, but lives in the revolution in Cuba, in the fights workers are waging around the world against the US-UK war against the people against Afghanistan, in the struggle to build and expand Pathfinder.

Cannon writings & speeches)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	when you fight you win!!!!	Jim Cannon's books are filled with wit, wisdom. As the book opens in the summer of 1940, the party hadsuffered its biggest split, as middle class elements left to get out of the way of fighting Roosevelt.  Shortly afterward, Trotsky was assassinated, and Cannon, who had become Trotsky's closest collaborator in the world revolutionary movement gives his assessment of the murder, and of Trotsky's place in history. Then, the SWP faced persecution from the FBI, from the Roosevelt Administration, and from the bureaucracy of the Teamsters Union. The SWP chose to stand and fight for revolutionary internationalist principles. Cannon's also to bring younger working class members of the party into the leadership as he and other leaders were threatened with prison Cannon's struggle led to the biggest expansion of the party in the working class, in the black, and in the immigrant community in the party's history. When you fight you win.  To read what happened next, read his books Letters from Prison and then The Socialist Workers Party in the American Century also from Pathfinder.	2001-10-10

Che lives in the Cuban revolution.  If you don't believe it read this book that contains articles on Cuba reprinted from the Militant newspaper in 1997, the 30th year after Che was murdered in Bolivia. They are mostly interviews with Cuban revolutionists, summarizes of debates in Cuba, and speeches and writing about Che by his comrades, his friends, and by his daughter.  They show how Cuba's communist leaders aim to continue and deepen the revolutionary struggle for socialism Che led. Whether it is the interviews with Pombo and others fought alongside Che in Cuba, Africa, and Bolivia, or the speeches by Cuban communist leaders on why they reject the Soviet model of socialism and why they continue to fight for revolutionary  communism, this is an inspiring historic collection of documents and reports.<br />  Former Algerian  President's Ahmed Ben Bella's article from Le Monde Diplomatique about Che and Cuba's  collaboration with the Algerian and African revolutions is worth the whole price of this book by itself.

He shows how Bolivian revolutionists, workers, students, and peasants welcomed Che's struggle and how the class struggle in that country advanced by Che's struggle.  At the country's biggest tin mines, entire unions pledged one day's salary to support Che.  Saldana, a founder and leader of the Bolivian Communist Party until he broke with them to work with Che's guerrilla, shows how the Bolivian CP sabotaged Che's struggle.  With economic and social conditions in Bolivia and other parts of Latin America much worse than they were in the 1960s, this book should be read as a manual for future upsurges of struggle by workers and peasants in Bolivia and throughout the Americas.	2001-09-08

This book is based on articles he published in Jazz magazines in the middle 1960s, interviews he did with Coltrane.<br /><br /> Despite its weaknesses, this book is important in that it stresses the importance of the African American nature of Coltrane and modern jazz, and its links to Black militancy in the 1960s. It places Jazz not just in the historical links to aFrican American musical survivors but the Jazz of the 50s and 60s in the context of the ferment in the Black community arising from the civil rights and Black power movements.<br /><br /> As such, it is a good answer to the current Wynton Marsalis-Stanley Crouch-Albert Murray mafia's insistence that Jazz is not African American, but a product of 'greatness\\" of American capitalism and that Jazz needs to acquire the forms, conventions, and practices of European classical music.<br /><br />.  . And this is vital to Coltrane's importance in the advancement of Jazz completely against these conventions.<br />This book has weaknesses.  Kofsy's analysis is distant from Marxist cultural theory, especially as he tries to identify artistic validity with political content. Kofsky seems unaware of the question of class within the African American people or among jazz musicians.  Kofsky never really lets the reader know how religion and spirituality became central to John Coltrane and his music in his later years.<br /><br /> Still, this book is part of the defense of the place of John Coltrane in the history of Jazz, and of Jazz's own place in history.<br /><br />While this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!	2001-09-07

This is the story of the founding, the struggle of American Communism before Stalinism turned the Communist Party into its  opposite.

I am not surprised that out of the four of five of us who studied this book then, most are still  fighting to change the world, and several became nationally known figures in the antiwar, Black rights, and women's movements. . . .

Real education is learning the tools to understand this system, learn to fight, learn to do real things in a real world, real education can come only through mass struggles against this system. Real education can't be separate from work, from life, from struggle.<br /><br />While Amazon may report this book is unavailable from time to time, it is always available from the Pathfinder Amazon partner z store that you can reach by clicking on new and used at the top of this page/	2001-07-09

The Cuban revolution and especially the resistance and defeat of the US mercenary invasion at the Bay of Pigs is the starting point of this book. The author and tbe book's editor Mary Alice Waters were students at Carlton College in Minnesota in the early 1960s. This discuss how the Cuban revolution, and building a student movement to fight for the truth about that revolution radicalize them and other students, and the lessons they learned building a movement to defend Cuba during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Barnes extends this at the end to a discussion of a program for working people in the 21 Century accurately evaluating Bush and Gore as the same poison. He provides real a real program against both liberal and conservative probusiness politics. What I love about this book is the stream of history: the fighters of Cuba, the students and Black activists who defended the revolution, and going forward to fight for socialist in this world in the 21st Century.<br /><br />While these books may not be directly available from Amazon at times, they are available from the booksfrompathfinder  on Amazon that you can find by clicking on the new and used books on this page.	2001-07-09

Instead, it is a book about continuing to fight. Inside prison, Cannon and the others educated themselves about Marxism, discussed plans to explain the workers movement when they got out of prison, surveyed the changes in the world that World War II brought, and fought the pessimism that the war, Stalinism, and imprisonment had brought to some of them. Cannon, as always, is humorous, insightful, and just plain wise	2001-07-09
