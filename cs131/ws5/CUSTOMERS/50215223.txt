In chapter 2 he looks at the effect broadcasting information can have on events, focusing on how revealing the Ku Klux Klan's silly rituals emasculated the organization and how real estate agent margins are tightened when home prices are posted for all to see. Chapter 3 looks at the economics of drug dealings and, surprise!, they're just like the economics of McDonald's with burger flipper and management level jobs.<br /><br />Chapter 4 is probably, in the US anyway, the most controversial part of the book. It deals with the positive correlation between the increased number of abortions following its legalization and lower crime rates two decades later. Chapters 5 and 6 are almost as controversial: they examine the effects parents and parenting have on a child's development.<br /><br />Levitt is a gadfly; he has his fun by asking unorthodox questions and deflating conventional wisdom. However, I wouldn't call Freakonomics a deep or important book. It is celery for the mind, in other words it's healthy mind candy. You can read it in one sitting and at the end you'll have improved yourself.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyo	2005-10-07

I had learned of the allegory of the cave in class and wanted to know more. Also, in one M*A*S*H episode, the Republic was among the books Frank Burns was burning, so of course I had to read it. I did, and apart from Book One's denunciation of the maxim \\"Might Makes Right\\", I felt uneasy about the rest of the work. At the time, I felt that there must have been something wrong with me, that I wasn't reading it right, that after all having stood the test of time for over two thousand years Plato simply couldn't be wrong. If only I had known of Popper in 1985!<br /><br />Popper is in many ways pointing out the obvious: that Emperor Plato is wearing no clothes. His Republic is nothing more than a totalitarian state and his value system represses the individual in favour of the State.<br /><br />Popper begins by describing what he calls \\"Historicism\\" or the belief that history develops according to laws from which the future could be predicted, with Heraclitus being the first \\"historicist\\". Popper then continues with an overview Plato's thought, especially his Theory of Forms and his brilliant sociological insights. He then exposes over three chapters Plato's political programme to bring about a perfect City-State, and here is where Popper points out the obvious: Plato's Republic is a totalitarian state that controls every facet of the lives of all its citizens and represses any every invidual path to happiness.<br /><br />In the last chapter, Popper sketches out how an Open Society would work and gives the example of Athens just before Plato. Unlike others who have savaged Plato (e.g. Ayn Rand) Popper doesn't lay out a master plan to replace Plato's. He doesn't believe in utopias, Platonic or otherwise. Popper believes in what he calls \\"Piecemeal Social Engineering\\" i.e. fixing problems as they come up, or improving institutions when the opportunity arises.<br /><br />This is Popper's Open Society. One where we accept that things are as they are, that they can be improved, that individuals are the only judges of their own happiness and that they should have complete freedom to pursue it as they see fit, insofar as they don't harm others too much. His test for an Open Society is very simple: a society is open if its government can change without bloodshed.<br /><br />In 1948, Scott Buchanan wrote, in the introduction to Penguin's Portable Plato, that \\"the reading of Plato's dialogues by a large number of people could make the difference between a century of folly and a century of wisdom for the world\\". Perhaps, but only if the reader approches Plato without awe and with a critical mind. As did Popper.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyoitutions when the opportunity arises.

We don't, we only guess...	We guess. We make up a story that explains the phenomena we observe. Why is there night and day? Because the sun rises from the east and sets itself down in the west. Aha! Let's check that. Let's go east. After a while we realize that we're living on a sphere and so we know our story is wrong. The sun does not rise up and set. So what does it do? We're on a ball and the sun is above and it moves around us! Great! Problem solved. But wait! Let's check that. The stars also move. Let's plot their course, and then... and so on and so forth.<br /><br />For Popper, this is how we've built up our picture of the world. We make bold conjectures to explain what we see see and then we check, or rather we establish a failure test. If the test is true, then our guess is false. But if we only test to see if a guess is false, rather than to try and prove that it's true, then how do we know our guess is true? Popper answers that we do not and cannot ever know that. Knowledge lies beyond our grasp, we can only seek knowledge without ever hoping to attain it.<br /><br />This is the central theme of Conjectures and Refutations, which itself is a comprehensive overview of Popper's epistemological thought. The book is divided in two parts titled, you guessed it, I-Conjectures and II-Refutations.<br /><br />Part I, Conjectures, comprises the first ten chapters. Popper begins with an overview of his thesis, then explores the nature of the problems that face people who think about the world and who act in it (chapter 2), he presents three other views of what we mean by knowledge (ch. 3), he describes tradition and the history of thought (chapters 4 to 6) and then turns to a critique of Kant, and of the effect that Newton's astonishingly successful theory of gravity, unrefuted for over 200 years, had on the development of western science (chapter 7). Popper then closes part I with discussions on what the difference is between science and metaphysics, on why mathematics works so well in describing the world, and finally on the nature of scientific knowledge, i.e. what do we mean by \\"knowledge\\".<br /><br />In part II, Refutations, Popper does not present anything, he destroys existing theories which he feels are wrong. He returns to metaphysics and because it deals in existential statements that are irrefutable (e.g. you can't prove the Devil's existence or non-existence) he seeks to separate its pursuits from that of science. Science deals only in refutable statements.<br /><br />Then Popper attacks other theories and problems. He gives a succinct summary of his attack on historicism, his name for the belief that History follows laws (e.g. Marxism) and that historians should be able to predict the future course of mankind.<br /><br />In short, Conjectures and Refutations is a complete introduction to Popper's thinking. It sketches out all his thoughts on the social sciences and describes in fair detail his thinking on the development of science. He ends on a positive note. It may seem depressing that we can never obtain true knowledge, but we can certainly find sufficiently rich rewards in the pursuit of it.nally on the nature of scientific knowledge, i.e. what do we mean by \\"knowledge\\".

At The Water's Edge is about about the evolution of large and important changes in species; Zimmer focuses on change in habitat, the move from sea to land, and then back to sea.<br /><br />Zimmer begins by describing different fish lineages and concentrates on the branch that leads to our own chordate subphylum, the tetrapods. How and why did legs evolve? How did our left and right walking motion appear? Zimmer reveals a surprising answer. Tetrapods, legs, and walking did not evolve to help fish survive on land; they evolved to help fish swim in shallow swampy river deltas at the ocean's edge. These features allow fish to move more efficiently among the river plants and to sneak up on prey more easily. Once the left right motion was established, it was easy for fins to strengthen. At some point there came a need to move from puddle to puddle, or perhaps to escape predators, or to lie in wait out of the water. Strong alternating fins, which had evolved in a purely aquatic environment, were ideally suited to these new tasks.<br /><br />To emphasize this original unplanned use of an existing feature, Zimmer uses Stephen Jay Gould's strange neologism \\"exaptation\\" rather than a more familiar term like pre-adaption. Zimmer prefers exaptation because pre-adaptation somehow implies that the final use of a thing was planned from the beginning. Zimmer emphasizes that it was not.<br /><br />Once he's done with how tetrapods appeared and then came to land, Zimmer makes an about face and returns to the seafollowing whales and dolphins. Here too we find surprises. Early whale ancestors probably behaved like crocodiles and alligators. They would stay in the water with only their eyes and nose protruding, waiting for a land based prey to come close.  Later, Zimmer describes echolocation, one of the most complex and useful features of cetaceans. Dolphins and many whales have a superb sonar system that works by echoing clicks out and back in through a fat-filled cavity in their forehead called the melon. The melon<br /><br /> acts as a sound lends letting dolphins \\"see\\" small objects hundreds of feet away. How can such a useful and complex organ evolve? The current hypothesis is that the melon's first function in early whales was simply to block the nasal passage during deep dives, to keep water out. Once it existed, it probably provided very rudimentary echolocation which gave natural selection something to work with. Another exaptation.<br /><br />Another topic Zimmer touches often is cladism, which is the sorting of species into a genealogical table by identifying key features. Features common to a group of species can imply a common ancestor even if we haven't found any trace of the ancestor itself. Two cladistic schools are at this moment fighting it out: the biological and morphological school one side, and the genetic school on the other. The schools often arrive at different conclusions. The strength of the biological school is that its discoveries are practical; key features mean something concrete like a backbone (chordates) or a melon (dolphins and many whales). However, key features are very difficult to identify. Genes on the other hand are easy to identify and to compare among different species. Also, there's a mechanical logic to genes that readily lends itself to cladistic sorting. However, genes often don't mean anything, i.e. have no effect on how the organism works, and they can mutate at random, appearing and disappearing for no reason. Each camp will probably have to find a way to learn from the other.<br /><br />Charles Darwin famously called his Origin of Species \\"one long argument\\", by which he sought to establish Natural Selection as the main means of evolution. You might take Zimmer's book as one short argument to establish exaptations and cladism as the main engines of macroevolution.ir forehead called the melon.

He forcefully defends most of his policies and a few times admits that he got some important things wrong.<br /><br />The first nine chapters are chronological and recount his childhood, his early life in business and politics, his rise within Thatcher's cabinet, and finally his attaining the Prime Ministership. The remaining nineteen chapters deal with his days in office. Each chapter addresses a topic or issue, beginning with his first international test in leading the UK through the first Gulf War. He deals with domestic issues like Ireland and the poll tax, but spends much time on Europe as European issues hogged the agenda during most of his tenure. He explains his position as a pragmatic Eurosceptic. On one hand, Major has always wanted to remain British and fears the coming of a United States of Europe; on the other hand he sees the foolishness of the UK giving up its influence by refusing to participate.<br /><br />Pragmatism colours all of Major's decisions and policies. Unfortunately, Major led a party polarized by extreme views on Europe, on Monetary union, and even on the question of Ireland and to many at the time his pragmatism looked weak or lacking in beliefs.  It was not. Major convincingly recounts how he was trying to save the Tories from splitting. He saw the Conservative party as a crucial institution, one whose survival in the long term mattered much more than the transient questions of Europe. But Major is an opinonated pragmatist. He believes in the basics of Toryism and then had to watch in frustration as New Labour under Tony Blair appropriated (Major bluntly says \\"stole\\") basic Tory social and fiscal policies.<br /><br />Thus pragmatism had drawbacks. It caused Major to back off a little in order to appease; he accepts responsibility for the Conservative failure and the new Labour landslide.	2005-09-18

Celts and Germans worked in the Roman Emperor's personal Praetorian Guard, King Edward I employed professional companies of archers, and the Swiss fought all over Europe, and are still guarding the Vatican. It's only in the 19th and 20th centuries that the state has become the sole legitimate agent in the conduct of military operations. The 1990s, however, have witnessed the emergence of private organized interests at every level of military operations. The twist comes because today these private military firms (PMFs) are organized as twenty first century corporations, with business plans and long term profit objectives.<br /><br />Singer's analysis begins with an account of private military interests in ancient and modern times. This gets us used to the idea that PMFs have been around before and are really nothing new. In the second section, Singer classifies PMFs in three segments, each characterized by how far its activities are from actual fighting.  First and most obvious there are the military provider firms that place frontline military units (e.g. Executive Outcomes) second there are the consulting firms who train and shape a client's military (e.g. Military Professional Resources Inc.) and third there are the firms that provide logistical and support services such as food delivery (e.g. Brown and Root).<br /><br />Lastly, Singer examines the implications of using PMFs, which of course being corporations are motivated by profit. Singer illustrates how seemingly simple precepts result in fiendishly complex moral problems.<br /><br />Do we feel uneasy at for-profit military firms? Of course we do and so we are tempted to dismiss any question of using them. But In 1994, one of the more unsavory firms, Executive Outcomes, created a plan that for some 150 million dollars could have stopped the Rwandan genocide and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.(*) The UN Security Council balked at the costs, nothing was done until the genocide was well under way and half a million people were butchered.<br /><br />Do we support relief organizations such as CARE? Do we give them money? I do. But how should we feel about the Red Cross and CARE using that money to hire PMFs as protection? Is it right for them to support PMFs? Is it right of us to expect them to go into dangerous situation with inadequate UN or local military protection?<br /><br />Singer's conclusions are only tentative, and given the emphasis he's placed on how complex the moral dilemma is, this is only proper. He neither condemns nor supports the rise of PMFs, he merely states that they exist and are on the rise, he describes how they operate, and he points out the practical and moral dilemmas that arise from making use of them. He ends with a rewording of the proverb that war is too important to be left to generals: war is too important to be left to private industry. In other words, he warns us that while PMFs are here to stay we must keep them in check and on a leash.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyo<br /><br />(*) See comments for more on this.<br /><br />VPCouncil balked at the costs, nothing was done until the genocide was well under way and half a million people were butchered.

The book developed from research into Japanese society conducted for the American leadership, civilian and military, during the Second World War.<br /><br />Benedict describes social customs and traditions found in Japan at the outbreak of WWII. For instance, Japanese love bathing and the eldest male gets to go first and women having their period go last; everyone uses the same water but this is no worse than everyone sharing a pool because bathers wash >>before&lt;&lt; getting into the tub. Another tradition is that women usually control the family purse with the husbands handing over their wages to their wives and getting an allowance. This is still largely true today.<br /><br />For over ten years I avoided this book because it was written by someone who had never been to Japan and also because I avoid books that \\"explain\\" the Japanese. So when I picked up a copy lying around at a coffee shop and began skimming, I was very surprised at how insightful it was. Benedict was unable to do her research in Japan because of the war, so she obtained all her material from interviews with Japanese POWs and also with second generations Japanese-Americans interned in American concentration camps.<br /><br />It is still worth reading today. Things have changed in Japan, as they have everywhere else in the world, but her people are still basically the same.	2005-05-27

The drama ends as both a sad farce describing Teddy's troubles and as a tragedy invading the lives of the lost generation of Kennedy children (The Lost Boys).<br /><br />The book centers, as did the family, around the elder Joseph Kennedy and his wife, the queenly Rose Fitzgerald. JPK's generosity and his sincerity surprise the reader given his raw ambition, his selfishness, his manipulation of people, his womanizing, and his incompetence as a diplomat. All this was equaled only by his talent as a business man and in the end surpassed by his devotion as a father. On the other hand, Rose comes off rather dry and unappealing, which is a little difficult to believe given that she had nine children.<br /><br />A disturbing revelation of the book was how high on drugs (usually prescribed) Jack was during his presidency. His awful health mandated pain killers and other drug therapies to allow him to function, but at the same time must have affected his judgment and his ability to work. Given the confrontational character of the Kennedys, one shudders to think of how badly the Cuban crisis could have turned out.<br /><br />I have two strong criticism of the book. First, not enough space is given to JPK's most important contribution to the United States: he created and established the Securities and Exchange Commission, which gave the USA for decades a virtual monopoly on fair and transparent financial markets. (President Roosevelt apparently responded to critics of this appointment that \\"it takes a crook to catch a crook\\".)<br /><br />Second, in the interest of protecting privacy, the material on the last Kennedy generation should have been left out. The book was published in 1984 when the lost Kennedys were still in their teens and twenties. The authors needlessly (though with sympathy) sensationalized sad stories, at too early a time in those lives to pass any sort of critical judgment.<br /><br />The most interesting discovery for me was Lem Billings. He basically followed all three generations: best friend to Jack Kennedy, reassuring JPK that his son had someone supporting him outside the family, and surrogate father to some of the young Kennedys after Bobby's assassination until his death in the early 80s. A short book on Billings would be welcome.ond, in the interest of protecting privacy, the material on the last Kennedy generation should have been left out.

Taleb believes the human mind isn't made to understand randomness and that really complex systems operate more or less as if they were random.<br /><br />Taleb wants us to change how we think about risk. He wants us to abandon the attitude that because something's happened before, it'll happen again (e.g. my portfolio will continue going up) or that because something hasn't happened before, it'll never happen (e.g. others traders have gone bust, but I never have and I never will). Taleb chides traders who prefer frequent small gains and tries to explain their behaviour. A trader who makes small profits 4 days out of 5 and a small loss the other day will have a solid record, he will feel good about himself but he will not be prepared for Black Mondays or other financial shocks and he will blow up, to use Taleb's phrase, and disappear.<br /><br />Taleb also wants to debunk the assumption that the bell curve (the Normal distribution) is a good model. He points out that financial disasters like the 1929 crash or Black Monday in 1987 have happened more frequently than the bell curve predicts. Why then, he asks, do risk managers still stick with Normal models? These models have failed to predict large movements and are dangerous.<br /><br />Taleb does not take credit for the views he presents and he gratefully acknowledges debts to a range of thinkers from Montaigne to Popper to Mandelbrot. But a good teacher is hard to find and we should be grateful for someone like Taleb. The ideas here are not original, but Fooled by Randomness presents them forcefully and dramatically.	2005-03-17

Life is like that. It's open ended; it doesn't follow the Aristotelian rules of composition; it doesn't have a plot. However, leaving a work >>unresolved&lt;&lt; is not the same thing as leaving the plot open. The latter is a device, the former is laziness. It's like painting half a canvas or like a musician leaving halfway through a performance.<br /><br />This would be a one star novel except for a few scenes and characters.

In another scene, Murakami breaks a stereotype by having Sumire's stepmother support her decision of quitting college when the father strongly opposed it.<br /><br />While these scenes aren't enough to save the novel, they do show that Murakami can economically create lifelike characters. Better to read his \\"Underground : The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche\\" where he interviews victims of the 1995 gas attack on the Tokyo subway. You'll learn more about life in general and the Japanese in particular, and be less subjected to mediocre flights of fancy.	2005-02-12

We see plankton at the bottom of the food chain and ourselves at the top, graveyard worms notwithstanding. We see a cycle where each member specie contributes something to its environment; under this worldview, we see parasites as anomalies, and disgusting ones at that. Carl Zimmer thinks it's time we changed our attitudes towards creatures we label parasites. How can parasites be anomalous when the term applies to three quarters of all species? In a way, they are the chief participants in all ecosystems. And when we eliminate a certain class of parasites, such as worms and flukes, there are unintended consequences.<br /><br />For instance internal parasites might help prime our immune system. Population studies in Venezuela have shown there is an inverse relationship between the presence of parasites and the occurence of allergies. Richer segments of the population eat better, cleaner food but suffer more of cat and dog allegies, while the poorer segments are more afflicted with intestinals worms but suffer less from allergies.<br /><br />Zimmer in addition describes the life cycles of many parasites. Some of the more spectacular cases seem to jump out of science fiction movies and novels, such as the little worms that make fish jump around the surface more than they would normally, increasing the odds of being eaten by a sea bird, thus carrying the worm to the next host in its life cycle. Studies have shown that similar worms in humans make men more reckless and women more promiscuous. In other words, mind control by bugs. Ugh.<br /><br />On the down side, I would have enjoyed seeing a few more figures, more lists, more statistics. The book is too anecdotal for a hard science book, but this is a minor point. All and all, a great little book, though it might be best to avoid discussing it at the dinner table.	2005-01-19

He invented micro-credit, or lending very small amounts to the poorest of the poor, without asking for collateral. This, rather than simple handouts, would help the poor become self-reliant enough so that they could lift themselves out of poverty. He concentrated on women. He relied on peer support to motivate repayment of the loans by making loans to one member of a group of women who would have access to credit only if the entire group had a good credit record (when a group started, they were assumed to have good credit). Professor Yunus's organization, the Grameen Bank, is a cooperative owned mostly by its members and boasts a repayment rate over 98%.<br /><br />In the 30 years since Professor Yunus's first loan of 27 dollars, Grameen has now lent out billions to millions. It has liberated women in small villages, it has brought capitalist market mechanisms to the economic bottom 2% of the world population.<br /><br />This first hand account by the American-educated Bangledeshi founder of Grameen Bank might not win any literary prize and it might end with a (I think) slightly naive vision of social work, but it effectively presents a simple story about a practical man who has made millions of the world's poorest people significantly better off.	2005-01-04

Reading this book will change this.<br /><br />Darwin sailed on the Beagle, a small three-mast sailing ship, and circumnavigated the globe. Over five years, he visited numerous islands in the Atlantic and Pacific and extensively surveyed the east and west coasts of South America. He hiked up and down mountains, traveled on horseback across the arid Argentinean plains, crossed the lonely Peruvian desert, and trekked the grandiose Chilean Cordilleras. He thought nothing of packing a train of mules for a two-month overland journey across the Andes going from Chile to Argentina and back again. On all his land expeditions he hired local guides, from Gauchos in Argentina to South Pacific islanders in Tahiti. Darwin's accounts of his expeditions are not only interesting adventures, they are also good portraits of the people he met. These include Latin American governors and generals, Argentinean ranchers, very primitive natives on Tierra del Fuego, and so on.<br /><br />The journal begins with an account of Cape de Verd islands, then most of the book is spent on Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, and we have to wait until Chapter 17 before we get to what all Darwin fans really want to read, namely the account of his visit to the Galapagos. Though short, the account does not disappoint. We read of Darwin's finches, of two allied species of lizards, and of the giant turtles. Darwin also presents his great insight: that geographical isolation contributes to speciation. He came by this insight when it was pointed out to him that nearly identical species were seldom found on the same island. Another insight was that the fauna and flora an island depends more on that of the nearby mainland than on latitude. For example the plants of the Galapagos Islands were similar to those of the American west coast, while those of Cape de Verd, at the same latitude but in the Atlantic, resembled plants found in Africa. Darwin then continues with accounts of Tahiti, New Zealand and Australia, where we read how he thought coral reef islands were formed.<br /><br />In the last chapter Darwin tells us of his visit to St-Helena and he does in fact mention its most famous resident, Napoleon Bonaparte.

An easy way to approach this book is to imagine that it is the narration to a movie, but that for some reason we can't see the screen. Remember that Faulkner was a successful screen writer, with Humphrey Bogart's The Big Sleep to his credit. A book usually tells a story, but a movie shows us people. This book might not spend much time on a story, but it does tell us a lot about the people in it.<br /><br />We find Faulkner's novels difficult because of their style. This classic tale of a morose family burying their matriarch is a stream-of-consciousness novel, meaning Faulkner wrote something that mimics our \\"internal monologue\\", i.e. the verbal thoughts that go through our head whenever we daydream, or take a walk, or do something that requires little concentration.<br /><br />The difficulty, and the pleasure, in this technique comes from having to piece together ourselves what really happens. Faulkner has the main characters talking to themselves and since they already know themselves and the people around them, they don't need to describe what we want to know, leaving us always confused. However, they do drop hints. For example, when we meet Darl early on, we know this is a younger character because he refers to \\"pa\\" and \\"ma\\". A couple of short chapters later, Cora says that all he needs to become right is to find a wife, so we know he's a young man of age to marry.<br /><br />By the end of the novel, all that we know of the Bundren family was revealed to us this way. Once we turn the last page, we realize that we know everything important about this family: who has courage, who is generous, who is self-righteous, who is short tempered, who has suffered and when and why. And all this without a plot.	2004-09-22

Why is fish so soft and flaky compared to beef or chicken? What makes white and red meat different? Why does bread rise? Why does flour thicken a sauce? Why do vegetables become softer as they cook? This book answers all these questions and many more.<br /><br />We learn to cook by following recipes from grandma, from books, or from TV; that is by following step-by-step instructions. But, for example, why do we have to brown a slab of beef before roasting it? McGee describes in great detail the properties of the materials we cook with (meat, milk, vegetables, and so on) and the effects when we simmer, broil, grill, steam, or braise them. So a quick browning of a block of meat caramelizes the outside, which creates complex flavours as the dish is then slowly roasted; browning doesn't seal in flavours already present, as is commonly thought. That's a useful thing to know, and can be applied to other things besides roasting meat. For instance, do you want those complex flavours in your soups? If so, stir fry the vegetables a few seconds before adding them to the stock. Do you want a lighter, softer sauce? Then don't broil the bones before simmering them to make the stock you'll use.<br /><br />The section on sauces is perhaps the most useful in the book. We find out the characteristics of a good sauce, how they are classified, how to make them, and why each step followed is needed. Understanding all that will improve your gravies and sauces immensely, without having even to follow the rather heavy demands of professional sauce making.<br /><br />This book belongs in every family's kitchen and in every chef's private library. McGee's clear and detailed explanations will improve your understanding of cooking and thus the quality of the meals you prepare. I've had it for five years now, and refer to it constantly.	2004-09-03

First I'm a Will Ferguson fan; I've read and loved most of his books and his being listed as co-author was good enough for me. Second, despite being Canadian, I am completely ignorant of ice hockey, which comes mostly from a lack of interest. As a Canadian living abroad, I realize that I have ambassadorial duties regarding the promotion of Canadiana, and ice hockey tops the list of Canadiana must-know items. So since girlfriends are seldom interested in sports (he he he) a book written by a woman for women would logically need to drum up interest in the topic, and this it did for me.<br /><br />Teene Spencer wrote most of it and presents the history of the game, a basic overview of the rules, a survey of the organization, and lists of the greatest players and teams. Husband and boyfriend Bruce Spencer and family friend Will Ferguson pepper the pages with comments and disputes, most prominent of which is the fight-to-the-death over the Montreal Canadiens.<br /><br />Good read, and informative if you want to get into hockey.	2004-08-26

We've forgotten that the first man to brew beer in Canada, i.e. Jean Talon, intendant (industry supremo) of New France. Montreal has a street and subway station named after him, but do we have a beer or a holiday named in his honour? We do not and we need to do something about this.

Wine buffs will find a long list of short but distinct entries, organized geographically and alphabetically within a country. There are also many tips on which wine goes with which food, the different ways to serve different wines, and descriptions of under appreciated and under publicized wines such as port and sherry.<br /><br />Wine lovers know of the rivalry between wine critics Robert Parker and Hugh Johnson, and Johnson fans the flames with two pages poking fun at Parker's 100 point scale. To be frank it is hard not to agree that Johnson's system is better. A simple four star system to rate quality coupled with a highlight to show his own preferences. This strikes me as the correct level of precision for the topic.<br /><br />However, this trivial dispute about how to rate wine overshadows the real disagreement between the two men, which is about how to make wine. Johnson believes in terroir (geography) and technology while Parker believes in traditional manufacture and grape varieties. Unfortunately, Johnson hardly ever acknowledges that particular dispute with Parker and completely lacks generosity to opposite viewpoints on these two issues. That I tend to see things Johnson's way does not make it less of a pity to me. The last failing costs the book one star. Or perhaps I should give it 96.5 points.	2004-08-22

Their method is covert and premeditated murder. Their de facto charter comes from one hundred blank presidential pardons signed by former President Jack Ryan.<br /><br />In the 16th century, King Henry VIII of England established the Star Chamber, a closed court where he passed sentences on people that were in his way without giving them the benefit of due process. This court flew in the face of all civil rights that had been evolving since King John signed the Magna Carta in the 13th century. Later, the post-Elizabethan 17th century saw the virtual elimination of unchecked executive action. Due process and civil rights have been progressing since, most obviously in the United States, and it is these that have made the U.S. perhaps the greatest and freest nation in world history. Protecting the American Way means protecting these civil rights.<br /><br />As readers, we get to follow the narrative from the terrorist's perspective as well, so we know that in the story it was the guilty who were eliminated. In the real world, how does anyone know this? We know because due process aims at eliminating reasonable doubt. The system is imperfect but it's all we've got. Mr. Clancy does away with due process and his Campus is nothing less than a 21st century version of the Star Chamber.<br /><br />Civil rights are not absolute and there are good arguments for suspending them in emergencies. This can be done in a supervised and controlled manner. For a much less extreme, even reasonable, conservative view of civil rights, see Chief Justice William Renhquist's \\"All the Laws But One\\", which deals with the suspension of due process (habeas corpus) in wartime. As for Mr. Clancy's naive and misguided novel, skip it.	2004-08-13

You should also have medical and plain term life insurance, and cash on hand for a few months in case of an emergency. This book is a complete course in how to manage your money effectively, whether you're a millionaire or a low-income earner. It also gently but firmly chastises proponents of get-rich-quick schemes such as day traders.<br />First, the book explains what is financial risk, and points out that everything is risky, even insured savings accounts since inflation can destroy the value of cash. Malkiel describes just how risky various investments are, and how the risk is one investment is often offset by the risk in another. Second, Malkiel describes a variety of specific investments (e.g. no load index funds, your own home, individual stocks) and suggests how individual investors should mix them, depending on their personal circumstances. For instance, an ambitious young woman in her twenties can consider aggressive high-risk high-growth funds. If they boom, she's rich, if they bust she's young enough to recover her losses through income. This would not be true of a middle-aged couple about to pay for their children's college years.<br />&quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot; should be in every family's library.	2004-07-15

The Writ of Habeas Corpus is perhaps the most basic right established in common law. The phrase \\"habeas corpus\\" is latin for \\"produce the body\\", and a writ of habeus corpus is an order from a judge to an official requiring the official to produce a prisoner in the judge's court to justify the imprisonment. It is the testing of this basic right, in wartime, which Chief Justice Rehnquist examines in this book.<br /><br />Rehnquist concentrates on three periods in American history where habeus corpus was suspended: the Civil War, World War One and World War Two. He describes, analyzes, and even criticizes how the courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, decided how and to what extent civil rights can be suspended in wartime.<br /><br />As insight into the Supreme Court's decisions on habeas corpus, the book is invaluable: e.g. holding civilians prisoners without charges is OK, but prosecuting them in a military court is not. As raw material this is timely. However as a whole the book fails to hold our interest, despite its brevity. The book's chief flaw is also possibly a good judge's virtue: impartiality. Rehnquist avoids conveying a strong position on what he thinks the law should be and what future course it should take. Just as well. Better to have as Chief Justice a known conservative unwilling to commit himself but willing to listen, than to have a clear doctrinaire who expresses opinions too clearly from which he won't deviate.	2004-07-05

(Would you take home a kilo of fresh tuna?) There aren't any guided tours either. Yet the market is described as a must-see in most tourist books, and this in a city that has next to nothing in terms of tourist attractions. But perhaps this makes sense; Tokyo is a place where one can be and do rather than look and marvel, and the Tsukiji market is exactly that.<br /><br />Tsukiji is almost nothing to look at but walk in and its people have things to do and places to go. The marketplace's grimy aging rows of cramped wet stalls house a teeming population of busy auctioneers, stevedores, and customers. Theodore Bestor's book brings it all to life and goes further by analysing in depth several aspects of the market.<br /><br />After justifying Tsukiji (chapter 1) as a fit study for an anthropologist to pursue, Bestor gives us a thorough description of the key aspects of the Tsukiji marketplace: Tsukiji's neighbourhood, its (in the 1930s) avant-guarde form-follows-function layout (chapter 2); it's history (chapter 3); the importance of food culture in Japan and Tsukiji's lead-and-follow role in it (chapter 4); an economic analysis the value Tsukiji adds to the production chain (chapter 5); a true anthropological study of Tsukiji's society (chapter 6); a description of the mechanics of Tsukiji's auctions (chapter 7). At the end (chapter 8) Bestor peers a little into the future and reflects on Tokyo's changing landscape and the effects and likelihood of moving Tsukiji to a new location.<br /><br />I originally intended to give Tsukiji only four stars because of a few drawbacks, but decided that this would have been churlish given how much I loved it. But here are a few warnings. Chapter 1 for instance is really meant for anthropologists who might question the study as legitimate anthropology; this chapter could have been shortened and included as a preface instead. Also, some of the material will confuse people who have never traveled to Japan. For instance while Bestor does point out that Japanese households buy their food daily, he doesn't dramatize it much. A section on how a typical Tokyo family spends a typical weekday from dawn to dusk, with a description of the children's lunch box, the husband's favourite eatery, and the wife's shopping would have helped the chapter on food culture.<br /><br />But these are quibbles. Readers who live or visit Japan will love this book, readers who don't will need to work a little harder at visualizing some of it.

A section on how a typical Tokyo family spends a typical weekday from dawn to dusk, with a description of the children's lunch box, the husband's favourite eatery, and the wife's shopping would have helped the chapter on food culture.

What makes Davis's book special is her concise presentation of everyday life in the early renaissance (1560 is not in the Middle Ages, which ended about the time of Christopher Columbus 1492). We see village life, village institutions, we get a feel for what businesses the people ran (e.g. sheep for wool) we learn of legal procedures, of &quot;dangerous new ideas&quot; on marriage (from protestant influences) as well as inconvenient old one (secret marriages made without priests, nevertheless legitimate). We learn of differing customs on inheritance among different regions (the Basque and Gascon customs) of the role of women in public life.<br />The only problem I find with the book is that it is incomplete. We know what end Arnaud du Tihl meets, but we do not learn what happened after the trial to the real Martin Guerre or to his wife. Of course, the records are probably lost so we cannot fault Davis for this. But while we learn much of Jean Coras, the court official who published one of the two contemporary accounts of the case, a more detailed account of what befell him following the Martin Guerre case would have been interesting.<br />But that's a lack, not a flaw.

This is the author's coming of age story, set in the world of investment banking in the 1980s. As a growth and wisdom book, it's pretty good, but it's really a non-fiction version of Tom Wolf's Bonfire of the Vanities. Of course what makes it interesting is that Michael Lewis came of age by successfully trading bonds for Solomon Brothers.<br />Among other aspects of the firm, LP describes Solomon's Mortgage Bonds department, its influence over the savings and loans, and the effect of Fed Chairman Paul Volker's 1981 decision to let interest rates float. Lewis does a brilliant job of explaining how this lead to S&amp;L's selling their mortgages in order to fund investments in higher yield securities.<br />Here's the catch: Liar's Poker appeared before the S&amp;L debacle but it laid out all the signs needed to predict the disaster to come.<br />Much of the hand wringing over S&amp;Ls in the early 90's could maybe have been avoided if the warnings given in this book had been acted upon. To be fair, the warnings are clear but they are implicit. Lewis never actually projects the current state of the S&amp;L industry into the future, even if he does mention that the basic problem with mortgages (short term funding of long term loans) is not solved.<br />Good read.	2004-05-27

The Largest Municipal Failure in U.S. History	Books	4	5	7	N	Y	Risk Management, emphasis on management	Jorion gives a good text book account of the Orange County debacle, concluding that this was a gross but purely human error, and not a failure of the financial system or the derivatives market.<br />The first part of the book introduces the problem quickly then proceeds to give the reader a crash course in risk management theory, explaining among other things the concept of Value-at-Risk (VaR). Many types of derivatives are described and their proper use explained. We are given a manager's working knowlege of finance.<br />Jorion then moves to the Orange County debacle proper and his conclusion is frighteningly simple: the financial managers of Orange County, entrusted with billions, did not know what they were doing. They were ignorant of what we learned in the first few chapters. They were amateur money managers playing roulette.<br />The book is still topical. The Basel II banking agreements mandate strict capital reserve requirements for a variety of risks, such as market and liquidity risk, so that understanding the concept of VaR is more important than ever. Most importantly however, Basel II requires preparation and reserves for operation risk, which most often has to do with the people side of finance rather than the mathematical vality of the models used. Jorion's book is thus also a good introduction to the human side of risk.	2004-05-18

The characters here are youthful, sexy, passionate. There are bombs and there is bloodshed. There is a hint of sophisticated sex, and there are lovers seeking comfort in each other's arms. We are a long way from George Smiley's Circus, but the novel is filled with the same brooding atmosphere as Le Carre's Karla novels.<br /><br />We meet Charlie, an out-of-work young bohemian actress with a somewhat violent boyfriend. She is recruited and offered a part in an Israeli secret-service production: she plays out the role of lover to a terrorist and is then sent out into the field to trap the terrorist's brother. As usual, Le Carre's style is to develop characters slowly and indirectly. For instance, rather than read that Charlie's boyfriend is violent, we just read what he tells Charlie as he bosses her about: \\"Carry my bag. Men don't carry bags, see\\".<br /><br />Also following his formula, Le Carre sets his characters in a dark joyless world. Amazingly enough, he manages to infuse lively Greek islands with the bleakness of the Yorkshire moors. Charlie is not happy on Mykonos and is easy to recruit.<br /><br />The novel is somewhat dated. There are no suicide bombers, there is no infatida. The Palestinian terrorists and their allies are sophisticated Marxist socialites, a common portrayal in the 70s and 80s. But it works as a story, as character development, and as a snapshot of the Palestine-Israel conflict in the early 80s.	2004-05-18

Diamond's insight (not in the title) lies in why the west got these before other societies. The answer is surprisingly simple: geography.<br />First, the fertile crescent, located in modern Iraq, held most of the important domesticable large animal and plant species. Second the east-west orientation of the large Eurasian land mass offered a better environment for spreading societies than did north-south orientation of the Americas or the restricted area of Africa and Australia.<br />The east-west orientation means large areas with more or less identical weather in which domesticated plants and animals could be moved, which in turn favoured the spread of farming and other technologies, including writing. The same east-west orientation also enabled diseases to spread easily along with the cattle that often incubated them. The populations of the Eurasian land mass were thus immunized against most diseases while those of less spacious Oceania and north-south America were not.<br />Ultimately the coastal people (e.g. Spain, England) of the Eurasian land mass were favored over the inland people (e.g. Persia) so that only the Europeans and Chinese were left as possible world conquerors. The Europeans went for it, the Chinese did not. The book resorts to an interesting but unconvincing political explanation for this: China was politically stable so had no need to go overseas to build its empire, while the European nations did. This feels like an oversimplification.<br />Nevertheless, the fundamental insight of geography being the determining factor, rather than genetic or racial superiority, into why the world is as it is, makes this an important book destined to remain on reading lists for a long time to come.	2004-05-17

Lincoln arrives in Washington incognito in the middle of the night to avoid assassins. He is protected by Pinkerton. A little nobody, sympathetic at first because he is a boy growing up, becomes progressively less so as he enters the world of amateur conspiracies. Political foes Chase and Seward work in Lincoln's shadows. U.S. Grant appears briefly with his son. Much of the story accompanies John Hay, Lincoln's young personal secretary.<br /><br />Hay's is possibly Vidal's most interesting portrait. In real life, John Hay started his political career as private secretary to Lincoln and ended it as Secretary of State to Theodore Roosevelt. He served three presidents assassinated in office: Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley. (I have not yet read Vidal's later American novels, but I presume John Hay reappears.) We see Hay move through Washington society balls, handle Mrs. Lincoln's scandalous purchases and indiscretions, or be heartbroken by Salmon Chase's daughter Kay.<br /><br />The image of Lincoln Vidal presents is that of the knowing father, but not that of a saint. Vidal's Lincoln is never at a loss as to what needs to be done, but he can be unsure of how to do it. Vidal's Lincoln does have his faults. He is a racist. He is dead set against making slaves into American citizens and wants to ship them back to Africa. His priorities are crystal clear: if he could save the union by preserving slavery, he would. The myth of Lincoln the emancipator is shattered, and yet Lincoln emerges as a greater man for it. By presenting his true objective, saving the Union, Vidal shows us Lincoln's political skills and his compassion. He values the union more than he does the immediate abolition of slavery, but he recognizes that slavery is a blot on American history. He prefers African repatriation because he believes America would be a bad home for former slaves.<br /><br />Vidal shows us Lincoln's civil war. Lincoln doesn't get to Gettysburg until November 1863. During the momentous battle of July, he was at the telegraph office waiting for the  news. The novel starts with Lincoln arriving in Washington and ends at his assassination.  Vidal's novel redefines Lincoln the man and dramatizes a historical reevaluation of Lincoln's role in American history.us battle of July, he was at the telegraph office waiting for the  news.

To that end, they manipulate the media and seek to create precedence for pre-emptive war in international law.<br />Chomsky's analysis is impressive and the facts he presents are disturbing, especially where he describes &gt;&gt;how&lt;&lt; BRC&amp;Co are planning their diplomacy, but he strikes too idealistic a pose.<br />Yes BRC&amp;co obviously try to manipulate the media, but all politicians use spin to do this. Yes, BRC&amp;co are seeking to establish preventive war (as opposed to pre-emptive war, an interesting distinction well explained by Chomsky) by the US as valid international law but they are in fact meeting with opposition from most governemnts, most importantly from Europe.<br />In the end, the book's thesis is questionable. Chomsky clearly shows that the US is opposed to current international law, but he does not show the US is opposed to the concept of international law. The US is not seeking to rule the world, it is seeking to protect itself from threats that can originate anywhere in the world. The US already recognizes the need to share power with other forces, but it refuses to accept the current status of international law, as embodied by the United Nations.<br />Still while he might fail to prove his thesis, readers are left with disturbing facts about the means BRC&amp;co.<br />Ben Franklin said 250 years ago that those who desire security at the expense of liberty deserve neither. That statement is too cut and dry, but the principle deserves respect. We should perhaps view with more concern BRC&amp;co's violation of well-established domestic laws rather than worry about their plans for changing the still weak international system.	2004-05-14

Today, Mao tends to be either lionized or demonized but Short avoids sensationalism and sticks to presenting us with information, insights, and informed opinion.<br />The chapters on Mao's childhood and youth are particularly interesting. Short shows us how a well-to-do peasant with one or two farm hands lived at the end of the 19th century, and how an eldest son (Mao) was expected to behave. He shows us what a large Chinese town looked like at the turn of the 19th/20th century and how a young man would have felt seeing it for the first time. Short forces us to remember the obvious: at 14 years old, Mao was a boy, albeit a bright one.<br />A good example of the insights Short gives us can be found in his treatment of Mao's schooling. Mao was taught to read, write, and think in a traditional Confucian village school. The loud and mindless rote repetition methods worked, but they impress neither the author nor the reader. The insight we get from Short's presentation is that youths who in the 1960s memorized Mao's Little Red Book were following the same pedagogy, substituting Mao for Confucius, and youth groups for village schools.<br />As an example of realism, Short deflates some of the sex scandals around Mao. Yes, Mao enjoyed the company of young women, but these were enthusiastic communist girls, more like rock groupies than members of an imperial harem.<br />Where the book loses its balance is that not enough is made of Mao's real failures, both as a leader and as a human being. Short faces these failures square on, but late and he does not give them nearly enough emphasis. Short's evaluation of Mao as being not as bad as Hitler or Stalin fails to convince us, perhaps because the effect Mao had on China was as bad as Stalin's on Russia: millions of dead and a crippled economy that could not sustain the population..	2004-05-11

David Halberstam presents an accurate evaluation of how Japanese business often works, especially manufacturing businesses. Halberstam doesn't advocate following Japanese practices, he merely presents them and evaluates their success. Sometimes these practices can be applied, and sometimes they can't.<br />Japanese office practices work well in Japan because they rely on local customs. For example, the reason Deming found a voice in Japan is that a Tokyo University professor took notice of his work and called several old students who were now executives in Japan's car industry. They invited Deming and listened to his lectures. It's a characteristic of Japanese society that teachers retain some authority over their students for their entire lives, not only for the year they spend teaching them. This would not have worked in the West. However, once the value of Deming's work was obvious American car companies studied and implemented them, even if late.<br />The lesson is that while Deming's methods can work as well for U.S. car makers as for Japanese, the politics of getting them accepted depend entirely on local conditions. Japanese car men were open, and sincerely enthusiastic, of listening to their old professor's ideas, while American car men needed failure to humble them enough to change their ways.k was obvious American car companies studied and implemented them, even if late. <br />The lesson is that while Deming's methods can work as well for U.S. car makers as for Japanese, the politics of getting them accepted depend entirely on local conditions.

The National Dream is the first of two chronicles. It recounts  the preparations to the actual construction work, which is covered in the second volume \\"The Last Spike\\".<br /><br />We read of the political negotiations with British Columbia, which at first only wanted a wagon trail. We witness the fighting between the surveyors of different routes through the Rockies. I was surprised to discover that the greatest political difficulty was getting the railroad to go through Ontario, over the desolate granit of the Canadian shield, so that it avoid going south of the lakes, through the US. The Pacific railway had to be an all-Canadian venture. Still in politics, Berton describes the money politics of 1870's and ends by putting us in the House of Commons during the CPR debates of December 1880.<br /><br />Canada today is a country stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, capping the lower 48 of the United States. At Confederation in 1867, Canada ended at the Great Lakes; west of there but not part of Canada was the Hudson's Bay Company's land, the Red River colony (today Manitoba) and British Columbia. Canadian visionaries correctly saw the railway as the only way to ensure Canada survived American expansion. The CPR was a ridiculous undertaking. Imagine a country the size of New Zealand deciding that survival meant a space program and you get the picture.<br /><br />The CPR was an instance of a particularly Canadian National Policy whose purpose is to keep Canada whole. The price we had to pay then was that expensive all Canadian route. Interestingly, we still live with the legacy and expensive transportation is still a Canadian \\"feature\\". While travel between cities is cheap within the US, flights between any two large Canadian city are expensive as the money is used to subsidize transport to Canada's more remote areas.

The text then moves to how salt was used in Roman times describing a sauce called garum made from pickled and fermented fish parts. Kurlansky then continues with Mediteranean fish industry. Salt's main use was in preserving fish. The next big change came when cod was found off the coast of Newfoundland. Cod's low fat meant more salt was needed.<br />Eventually, the American colonies developed their own salt and cod industries. Kurlansky describes the importance of salt in the American Civil War, how salt works led to the marketing of Tabasco sauce, how canals were dug through New York state to take salt from the Great Lakes to the coast.<br />After a quick recounting of how salt was used by Ghandi to spark India's revolution, the book ends back in China and how the salt industry there has moved into the modern age. The old traditional derricks are gone; no one wanted to pay to preserve even the most important ones as historical landmarks.<br />Kurlanski gives a good outline of how salt was taxed in various parts of the world. His description of how the salt tax was an important factor in both the French and Indian revolutions deserves special mention.<br />As he describes how salt was traded and produced, Kurlanky peppers his narrative (sorry...) with short recipes that illustrate how salt was used in different parts of the world and at different times of our history.<br />If you love food and history, you'll love this book. If you love one and only moderately like the other, you'll find the book bogs down a bit.	2004-03-25

On one hand Black praises his subject no end, going so far as to call him the Man of the Century and the Champion of Freedom. On the other hand, the author frequently describes FDR's faults, episodes of cruelty and outright malice, making no excuse for them.<br />Black has two explicit purposes. First, he wants to show that the New Deal was a good program. Second, and more controversially, he argues that Roosevelt got the best possible deal he could from Stalin. In both cases, Black shows that FDR achieved his ends entirely because of his formidable political skills, because of his knack for getting people to do what needed to be done.<br />For Black, the New Deal rescued the U.S. from the Depression. Other historians often describe the New Deal as medicine taken by a sick man for lack of anything better, that the New Deal didn't actually do much to improve the economy, which was finally rescued by the war effort. Black argues that this his unfair to FDR and the New Deal was instrumental in restoring life and growth the economy, and that war production was only its last phase. Black leaves us thinking that without the New Deal of the 1930's, the U.S. would not have been in a position to supply the Allied war needs of the 1940's.<br />Black's second more controversial purpose is to debunk the view that the dying Roosevelt gave too much to the U.S.S.R. during the negotiations towards the end of the war. Black argues that FDR acted brilliantly to the very end of his life and got the West the best arrangements that could be obtained from the Soviets. He first skillfully guided American public opinion away from isolationism and led them to support the European war and eventually to participate in it to rescue the Old World. Realizing that France and the U.K. would not matter as much in the post WWII world, there was very little he could do to stop Stalin from taking eastern Europe. The USSR, having losing millions more men than the other Allies combined, would have its way. Without FDR, things would have been worse.<br />Throughout the book Black stresses FDR's political skills and paints a picture of an amoral (not immoral) president, showing him a much less admirable man than we are used to seeing. And while FDR the man was moral and principled, FDR the politician knew that he needed to give way on many things in order to get many others. As a politician, he seldom held any single cause so dearly that he would not give it up to further what he saw as the more important ends.<br />For example, FDR was a true liberal, largely thanks to his wife Eleanor's influence. He nevertheless failed to integrate the army. Reasoning that despite being a good thing, racial integration would interfere with war preparations. He listened to African-American (then called \\"Blacks\\" or \\"Colored\\" of course) leaders and their complaints and requests. He did too little, but did something by promoting a black officer to general. He prepared the way for later leaders.<br />But Black paints a true portrait of Roosevelt, warts and all. A quick count between pages 350 and 450 yielded no less than 12 rather unpleasant stories, anecdotes, or traits about FDR, including a shocking tale of ordering IRS investigation and prosecution of his political enemies with a viciousness unmatched even by Richard Nixon.<br />In spite of these failings, FDR's skills enabled him to build the New Deal and to successfully lead America into the war, to free America from the Depression, to free the world from Nazi oppression, and to keep the Soviet Union from attempting indiscriminate conquests. Black's book is one long justification of the subtitle: Champion of Freedom.The USSR, having losing millions more men than the other Allies combined, would have its way.

One of WSC's purposes is to rescue Marlborough's reputation from the attacks of generations of historians. The book becomes a brilliant defense and of course it cannot be unbiased. WSC is Marlborough's defense attorney, not his judge.<br /><br />By the 1920s, Marlborough had been called miserly, greedy, ambitious, duplicitous, disloyal and treacherous. As he recounts Marlborough's life, WSC continually picks up an episode that seemingly illustrates one of these traits, but turns it around.<br /><br />Where unsympathetic historians saw miserly habits, WSC saw thrift and WSC goes further. Marlborough was miserly when it came to his own needs, such as when he insisted surgeons cut his stocking along the seem so that it could be resown. Yet he paid his army's bills and wages on time; apparently this was unusual in those days. He paid, from his own discretionary funds, which other generals often pocketed as a matter of course, for military intelligence that proved crucial to securing many of his victories.<br /><br />Where accusers saw ambition needlessly prolonging a difficult war, WSC presents Marlborough has being bound by duty to achieve the best results possible, and to reject a timid peace, which would have left Europe in the hands of a despot.<br /><br />WSC has a more difficult, but no less successful time defending Marlborough's continued correspondence with St-Germain, the exiled English court of James II and later his son, as recognized by Louis the XIV. The problem here is that today such acts would indeed be treason, but in the seventeenth century they were part of the normal workings of diplomacy, war time or not. After all, if passports and safe conduits were routinely given to enemies to allow them to rest and confer in between campaigns, it could not have been that unusual to keep in touch with people one knew, even if they were officially enemies.<br /><br />WSC also presents Marlborough's most important relationships: with his wife Sarah Jennings; with his military ally Prince Eugene, with whom he won at Blenheim; with his political colleague Godolphin, who secured funds for his military work; with the kings and queen of England from James II to George I;<br /><br />But WSC does accuse Marlborough on occasion of having been unwise. He is particularly critical of the Duke's obsession with his palace at Blenheim (where WSC himself was born). Marlborough didnft want an opulent residence, rather he wanted to leave a monument that would survive centuries and remember his name to future generations. WSC writes that as such Blenheim was a failure: it added nothing to the Duke's reputation and the worries it caused may have taken years from his life. Winston Churchill must have felt his biography was a better memorial to his ancestor.the normal workings of diplomacy, war time or not.

Marlborough didnft want an opulent residence, rather he wanted to leave a monument that would survive centuries and remember his name to future generations. WSC writes that as such Blenheim was a failure: it added nothing to the Duke's reputation and the worries it caused may have taken years from his life. Winston Churchill must have felt his biography was a better memorial to his ancestor.	2003-12-15

Schom should have toned down his attacks, and frankly admitted his dislike of the subject. Napoleon is and will remain controversial. Schom could have easily made a case against Napoleon without resorting to mere rhetoric. As it is, it feels like he wants to lure his readers into his camp.<br />One star for the impressive list of facts, and that's all.	2003-04-16

We follow Edwin de Valu, mediocre editor, through the ordeal of finding and publishing the ultimate self-help book: the one that works!<br />And here we already have the best things about Happiness(TM)--its title and premise. The rest of it is good, but not as good. Ferguson comments intelligently but not cleverly. Some of the supporting characters are colorful, in general they are well developed, and the plot is consistent. Everything is good, polished, well presented, and so on and so forth. But the novel feels contrived, it doesn't have the wit of Ferguson's non-fiction books.<br />On the minus side, Ferguson is a little preachy. He gives his own recipe for happiness, a seize-the-moment philosophy of life. Ferguson probably didn't intend this ironical twist, but his attack on self-help literature can be read as the author's advice to the world on how people can be happy, i.e. get away from self-help schemes. Sounds like self-help to me.<br />I so wanted to love this novel! I've been a Ferguson junkie ever since I picked &quot;Bastards and Boneheads&quot; as a quick travel read; he showed me the light and I am a born-again Canadian because of him. So maybe I expected too much. As it is, I moderately liked it. Three stars.	2003-04-14

For instance, the Iroquois confederacy was established shortly before the French landed in the mid-16th century; North America housed a diversity of distinct nations; many Amerindians cultures lived in permanent settlements; west coast nations had developed explicit property rights and had a system of land entitlement.<br />The colonial era was one of co-operation and alliances between the Ameridians and the Europeans settlers and soldiers. The Europeans brought their wars and diseases with them, while the First Nations brought their wars too. The partnership was equal and the First Nations on the winning side benefitted, at least until the 19th century.<br />From the 19th century onwards however, White rule has much to answer for. The diseases of the colonial era were brought inadvertently, but not so the 19th century land grab, or the disastrous assimilation attempts of the 20th century.<br />The end of the 20th century has seen a revival of Amerindian self-government. The First Nations have begun using Western institutions to their advantage. In the 1980's Elijah Harper, then member of Manitoba's provincial parliament, single-handedly, and rather heroically, derailed a Canadian constitutional accord (Lake Meech) which failed to address First Nations concerns. Earlier in the 1970s, the First Nations successfully negotiated with Hydro Quebec and created the precedent that their agreement was needed for development on their lands.<br />Overall, an excellent reference.	2003-04-14

Theory	The term &quot;Evolution&quot; refers to organisms changing as they reproduce and generate. Over millions of generations, the accumulated changes are substantial and diverse enough that descendants and progenitors can no longer be included in the same species.<br />This is fact, not theory.<br />But by what path did the ecosystems of yesterday change into the current biosphere? What &quot;forces&quot; operate on specie to push them one way or another? What is selected, and what process does the selection? Tentative answers to these questions are what we call theory. A theory is an explanation of accepted facts. Evolution is not &quot;just a theory&quot;. The word refers to both a fact and to a theory to explain the fact.<br />Let's compare with physics 400 years ago. For instance, let's look at the theory of things-falling-down. Everybody agrees that things fall down when deprived of support. &quot;Things-falling-down&quot; is thus fact. Aristotle stated that heavy objects fall faster. That was a &gt;&gt;theory&lt;&lt; of things-falling-down; it tried to describe precisely how things fall down. It so happens that Aristotle's theory was wrong, as Galileo found when he began measuring how fast balls rolled down a inclined plane.<br />That a theory of gravity was found incorrect did not nullify the fact of gravity. Same with evolution.<br />Evolution is documented. Examples of speciation (one species coming from another) abound in the fossil record. These are the facts. Men like Mayer, Gould, Dawkins study the &quot;how&quot; of these facts. They are the great theorists seeking to explain how evolution works. That it does is obvious, how it does less so.	2003-04-10

He strives for more and more and takes it, until there's nothing left to take. Then his benefectors and followers realize something's wrong and Alcibiades must find another venue to plunder.<br />He's very charming, but we the readers know better than the characters in the novel, and we never trust him or really like him.<br />I couldn't figure out what Pressfield wanted to show with this novel. The message I got (ruthless ambition leading to disaster) seems trite. Alcibiades's continual rejoinder that he simply follows the goddess of Necessity, just doesn't jibe.

This event from the 5th century BC is ideal for presenting dedication as a virtue.<br />The story itself grips the reader early enough: one man explains how the Spartans trained for war, then recounts their terrible stand at the gates of Thermopylae where a mere 300 of them held back 20,000 Persians and died doing so.<br />The novel explores the soldier's mind, or more properly his mindset. The total dedication to training, to winning not so much over the enemy as over oneself, and ultimately the total dedication to the mission, even at the cost of one's life. The novel evokes this dedication, rather than thoughtless fanaticism.<br />To drive this theme home, Pressfield draws very bloody scenes; the gore spills off the page into our laps and we get an inkling of the Spartans's toil.	2003-04-02

Luck serves as the raw material on which the creative processes of evolution, such as Natural Selection, operate.<br /><br />His device is the fauna of the Burgess Shale, animals from just after the Cambrian explosion, half a billion years ago.<br /><br />Wonderful Life gives us the story of the re-evaluation of the Burgess fauna that revealed them to be animals utterly different from anything alive today. Gould gives a fascinating biography of Charles D. Walcott, administrator extraordinaire, who discovered the Burgess Shale and classified all its animals into existing phyla. Gould uses the image of a shoehorn to stress that these classifications were forced.<br /><br />Gould then introduces us to the three men who re-evaluated the fauna: Harry Whittington, Derek Briggs, and Simon Conway-Morris. They return to the Burgess fauna with a suspicion that these animals might not be correctly identified after all. Gould describes their work in detail, letting Whittington, Briggs, and Conway-Morris show us how very different these creatures are.<br /><br />Gould's point is that though the Burgess animals were exquisitely adapted to their environment, their phyla are today extingt so of course most of them left no descendant. More importantly, the surviving creatures from that age did NOT seem better adapted than their now dead contemporaries. The lesson is that the fittest died too and that surviving lineages made it because they were just plain lucky. Survival of the luckiest.<br /><br />To underscore his point, Gould uses the plot of Frank Capra's movie \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\": what would happen if we started again, if this or that event in the history of life on earth was different? His conclusion is that we probably wouldn't be here.<br /><br />I read Wonderful Life for the first time in 1992. One of the rewards was that I was reading science as it was happening. If today we read Darwin, we can still converse with his thought and still appreciate the works, but we can never experience the thrill of reading the Origin of Species right off the press as a completely new and (r)evolutionary theory.<br /><br />Some of the facts in WL have been already shown incorrect, but most of the book's conclusions are still being debated.

In fact as a reporter in the Boer war, he worked as what we are calling today (during the Iraqi war) an embedded reporter. So deeply embedded that the Boers made him a POW though he was a non-combatant.<br />My favourite chapters deal with his schooling. He laughs at himself, poking fun at his younger self's total ineptitude at subjects such as Latin and mathematics, all the while humbly pointing out that he became such a good writer because being perceived as such a dolt by his teaches, the only thing they'd bother teaching him was English.<br />The accounts of his military life are interesting but are today overshadowed by the first and second world wars, so that I was unfamiliar with the background that led to conflicts in the Soudan or against the Boer. I recommend reading up on the Boer War in a good enclyclopedia.<br />Througout the book, WSC displays wit and irony. WSC reminds his readers that following the Boer War, the public thought that no more wars would be fought among white people (don't ever expect WSC to be P.C.--he calls a spade a spade) and that World War One came along anyway. Since he was writing before WW2, the intent was clearly to wake his countrymen up to the possibility of future conflict.<br />Recommended.	2003-04-01

Gould offers readers a comprehensive revision of Darwinian thought. His revision disagrees with the current orthodoxy, known as the Modern Synthesis, though adherents of each view call themselves Darwinists.<br /><br />In SoET, Gould identifies three defining features of Natural Selection: agency, efficiency, and scope. To survive the revision, Darwinism's tripod (Gould's image) must keep all of its three legs; amputation of any one would topple the whole structure.<br /><br />By agency, orthodox Darwinism argues for evolution happening exclusively at the organismic level. Ultimately it is individuals who survive and breed, or die. It is this or that particular being who will outlive its siblings long enough to have children. Groups, species, and populations, for Darwinism, don't do anything.<br /><br />By efficiency, Darwinism argues that from many random variations, only those variations that help the organism do something better (see more clearly, run faster, etc.) will be transmitted. Features appear because they are useful to the organism, because they have a function that contributes to the living being's survival and progeny.<br /><br />By scope, Darwinism argues that Natural Selection operating on individual organisms can explain the entire history of life on earth, and that no further process needs to be introduced into the theory. Natural Selection would be a complete theory.<br /><br />Having presented the image of the tripod, Gould continues with an exegesis of Darwin's Origin of Species. The first part of the book develops a history of evolutionary thought, presenting and rehabilitating many discredited formalist thinkers, such Geoffroy St-Hilaire and Hugo DeVries. The first part ends with a description of the Modern Synthesis (current orthodoxy).<br /><br />Then, in the second part, we are given a revised evolutionary theory, much of which was in fact developed by Gould and his colleagues Niles Eldredge and Elisabeth Vrba (to both of whom the book is dedicated). The book describes Gould's and Eldredge's own theory of Punctuated Equilibrium (PE): that often and in most cases (though not all) in between long stretches of nothing-happening (equilibrium, or stasis) evolution happens quickly (punctuation).<br /><br />Gould also presents the concept of constraints as positive forces, and shows them as channels of direction aiding flow. He contrasts this positive interpretation with the usual negative one of constraints restricting movement. Gould uses this with his earlier rehabilitation of formalist thinkers, to present historical and structural constraints as creative forces of evolution that operate independently from Natural Selection (i.e. orthogonally or sideways rather than with or against).<br /><br />Throughout the second part, Gould revises each leg of the tripod. Following Gould, Natural Selection does not explain all of history (the scope leg) e.g. it fails to explain lineages that don't change. Immediate usefulness (the functional leg) is only one of the forces at work; constraints in particular work independently to, the functional drive; 3) evolution occurs at many levels (the agency leg): at the gene, cell, organisms, species, and clade levels.<br /><br />Throughout the book Gould also emphasizes two concepts. The first is Relative Frequency and the second is the distinction between Historical Cause and Current Use. Neither of these concepts belongs to Gould, nor does he claim them, and Darwin himself was intimately familiar with them. Gould champions these ideas because he feels even experts aren't paying them enough attention.<br /><br />First, by relative frequency Gould means determining how often different processes occur throughout the history of life. For instance, Gould accepts that species often evolve gradually (classical Natural Selection) but he does insist that much of the time speciation happens quickly following long periods of no change (Punctuated Equilibrium) and even suspects that this is true in the vast majority of cases.<br /><br />For the second concept, Gould emphasizes that what something does today might be completely unrelated to why that something appeared in the first place. Darwin added a whole chapter to later editions of the Origin of Species to answer this problem, which critics called Natural Selection's failure to explain the incipient stages of useful features. The classic example is the wing.<br /><br />Five percent of a wing is useless and has no aerodynamic effect whatsoever, so how could wings evolve at all if evolution proceeds gradually? Recent work, in the lab and in the field, has conclusively shown that incipient wings help organisms regulate heat by giving them the ability to modify their total exposed surface area. As these heat regulators got bigger, they were more useful, but only up to a point. As luck would have it, that point turns out to be precisely where heat regulars have an aerodynamic effect. So, if the heat regulators get bigger from this point on, they help the organism to flutter, glide, or fly even though they don't dissipate much more heat. Heat regulators thus also become flying wings.<br /><br />The book ends by returning to Darwin and his work. Gould shows that evolutionary theory, as he sees it, is still fundamentally Darwinian despite all three legs of the Natural Selection tripod having been substantially revised to the point Darwin would not recognize them. Nevertheless, for Gould, Natural Selection is still one of the chief motors of evolution, and remains the foundation of current theory (another of many architectural metaphors in the book). Natural Selection still operates on individual organisms, and it is still needed to explain much of life's history. Gould's final words glorify Darwin's importance, not only in having &#34;done the work&#34; of developing evolutionary theory, but also, and for Gould more importantly, for having conveyed his view of life: beautiful and full of grandeur.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyost majority of cases.

An excellent survey of environmentalist literature. Ever since Malthus, there has been scaremongering about overpopulation, dwindling resources, etc. but fears have always been proven vain. Remember the scientific predictions of the 60's that we'd be living on a barren earth by the year 2000?<br />Truth is, everything we use has gotten better and better and cheaper and cheaper: we have more food than ever before, we have more energy resources, we get more and more metals and chemicals from the earth.<br />Not everything is perfect in the world, but the problems aren't nearly as bad as the green movement makes it out to be.  The attacks on Mr. Lomborg are political rather than reasonable.<br />The 1-star reviewers should be ashamed of themselves for sinking to this level. I give the book the full five stars in support of Mr. Lomborg and for having done with his book what he set out to do. He has re-ignited the debate.	2003-01-13

On a good day he was about as eloquent as George W. Bush. Yet he would see what needed to be done and do it; words never entered the process.<br />This theme runs through Ms. Strouse's book (the review's title is a quote). Yet Morgan's inability to clearly express himself in no way affected his ability to understand his work. Ms. Strouse wrote a beautifully ironic book: an eloquent elegy to an inarticulate leader, and this way voicing in her biography what Morgan could not himself express.<br />The book gives serious readers a refreshing dose of humility; it is a welcome argument on why we need to look beyond the sound bite when evaluating today's leaders (such as GWB, like him or not).	2002-04-13

Mr Johnson covers the pre-war colonialist  era as well as the post-war reconstruction and focuses on government  economic policy. He ends by questioning the Japanese model's effectiveness  outside of Japan.	2000-09-01
