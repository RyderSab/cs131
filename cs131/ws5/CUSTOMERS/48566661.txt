US	48566661	R1GURSEKNYROUI	0439784549	162568542	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)	Books	5	5	11	N	N	An Uncanny Mirroring of the Muggle World	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ( hereafter HBP) is a book which arrives with startling, unintentional, ironic timing: Terrorists are attacking the Wizarding world, just as terrorists are in our world. Those on both sides of the political debate will find succor: Liberals will point to those who are kept prisoner for morale purposes; Conservatives will point to the repeatedly stressed need to defeat evil despite the losses which might be sustained. <br /> <br />Ms. Rowling takes neither side, marching forward with a message of honesty in standing up to evil, the potential for redemption and the powerful magic called love. <br /> <br />HBP spans 652 pages of print, in 30 chapters of danger, darkness, comedy, love and excitement. Far and away the most adult of her books, she continues to successfully age her characters: 16-year olds can be snarky at times, and she shows it here. Darker by far than even \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" we are treated to a number of revelations, masterful literary slight-of-hand and a tale which ends in death, treason, tragedy, yet with a maturation of character and a growth of determination and resolve. <br /> <br />There's more than enough here to warrant several readings to fully ensure that the reader has unpeeled all the layers Ms. Rowling has created in her story: <br /> <br />We start off in a place we've yet to see: The office of the Prime Minister of the Muggles. <br /> <br />There's a new Minister of Magic. Harry quickly departs from the Dursley residence, and gains an unwanted inheritance. <br /> <br />The Wizarding World now knows that Harry was telling the truth all this time and there's an impact upon him as such. There's a new captain for Gryffindor's Quidditch team. Harry receives unknowing aid from someone known as \\"The Half-Blood Prince\\" who was once at Hogwarts. Another year, and another new instructor, in this case an interesting person by the name of Professor Slughorn. Harry and Draco's enmity reaches new levels, with Harry convinced that Draco is up to something. <br /> <br />There are romantic resolutions (with one book left to go, the end fate of those resolutions is yet to be determined) for Harry, Hermione and Ron, as well as a surprise or two for other characters. <br /> <br />And, yes, a major character dies (along with some minor characters we've met before, not necessarily at the same time. <br /> <br />Some familiar faces from prior books will reappear: Lupin, Luna, Ginny, Neville, Mundungus, Fudge, Percy, Fleur, and Tonks, to say nothing of the usual mob of Weasley's, a family which will have its share of adventures this year, including some they'd rather not have had. <br /> <br />Reading this book, I can't help but feel that Ms. Rowling had an eye out for the fanfiction writers, giving them plenty of new material to take and run with on their own. <br /> <br />This is a book which answers a lot of questions, yet leaves us with at least as many questions as at the end of Book 5. Further, questions which we think may have been answered might yet turn out to be trick questions, or at least far more complicated than they appear, for Ms. Rowling is a master of misdirection. And the new questions are simply huge in significance. <br /> <br />The dark tone of this book might be difficult on some of the youngest fans of the Potter series, so parents should keep that in mind; this isn't the same level of danger that Harry faced in Book 1. Bad things happen to good people, some of it \\"on camera\\" as it were, other incidents which are merely referenced( news story of a 9-year old who attempts to kill his grandparents; parents and family members of students dying, includoing one as young as 5). <br /> <br />Still, the darker tone is appropriate, (we are talking about a series which starts with the attempted murder of a 1-year old) and recalls the needed transition in other series, including C.S. Lewis's Narnia saga, and, of course, The Lord of The Rings, naming just a few. It is to Ms. Rowling's credit that she has, again successfully met the challenge of writing for the age group, and above, which Harry belongs to for each of her novels. This is a great book, one which doesn't pull its punches. Yet despite all the darkness in this book, there's a message that life, humor and love, do go on. <br /> <br />There is just one unsatisfying issue I have with this book: The wait until the release of Book 7.	2005-07-17
US	48566661	R3VS61K69Q6UTI	034544423X	851987429	American Empire: The Victorious Opposition	Books	4	5	10	N	N	WWII Turtledovestyle  Is About to Start	The strongest outing of the \\"American Empire\\" trilogy still possesses an abundance of the flaws in logic that have marred this entire series, starting with \\"How Few Remain\\".<br />For those who don't know, this series kicked off with HFR, wherein the Confederacy won the Civil War, backed by Britain and France, and that a second War was lost by the USA, setting the stage for an alternate WWI, an alternate Pax Americana, and soon to come, an alternate WWII.<br />The Victorious Opposition is again burdened by a huge logical flaw. As Pearl Harbor and 9-11 showed, attack America and you will reap a whirlwind. Here, the Japanese bombed Los Angeles and the war ends with a treaty leaving things as if the brief war never happened.<br />...!<br />This is just an impossibility, even by the logic of Mr. Turtledove's universe, where a revenge-driven USA has waited decades to get back at the CSA, Britain and France. The idea that any form of America would just be willing to let bygones be bygones for such an action is logically unforgiveable.<br />However, this sin, although it does taint this book, is a sin of the prior book in the series. Mr. Turtledove's books are always intellectually stimulating, but he does seem to have a blindspot regarding logic, as this problem, actions defying the laws of logic laid down in his own universe, is one that seems to permeate his writing.<br />Speaking of permeating his writings, the American version of the Holocaust, directed towards African Americans in the CSA, is well underway by this point.<br />When we last left our characters, Jake Featherstone had won election as President of the CSA, and was well on his way to becoming a Confederate version of Hitler. This book continues this trend, working its way up through the moment of war beginning again.<br />This is a true transition book, with a lot of characters dying, by various means and for various reasons. Perhaps the reason why this novel is the best of the \\"American Empire\\" books is possibly because of anticipation, an unspoiled sense of anticipation.<br />For we know that the next books will present a new version of WWII. As things stand now, no logical flaws yet have marred the anticipation of how Mr. Turtledove's creativity will render such an epic event.<br />The problem is that such an event could have only one result: a CSA, British, French, Russian and Japanese defeat. Here, Germany would not have started WWII with a subpar navy: instead, it would have been Britain and France with navies far removed from their level of greatness. By that standard alone, Great Britain would be starved out with ease.<br />Here, Russia is still under the Tsars. Therefore, no upheaval of the earth-shattering degrees that resulted in the Soviet Union's industrialization, which is what enabled the Soviets to hold back the Germans; plus here Germany had the lands of Poland and Ukraine under their control - much closer to Moscow. France would've had no Maginot line; France, driven by revenge after the Franco-Prussian War in our world, got their clocks cleaned by the Germans in WWI. But for the British Empire's soldiers, the Germans would've been able to outflank the Allies in the opening months of WWI, and WWI might really have been over by Christmas of 1914, with a triumphant Germany. France hasn't won a war in almost 200 years; they wouldn't be able to change that in Turtledove's universe.<br />Also: USA stole Japanese code secrets during the Washington Naval Treaty talks, which don't seem to have happened in this world.<br />The Brits got their big breakthrough on the Enigma code via Polish intelligence; here Poland is actually part of Germany.<br />Lastly, the CSA itself. In our world, the South of that time was well under the population of the rest of the USA. This is a difference which would have been magnified in Turtledove's universe, as immigration never ended (a Red scare was the big justification for ending open immigration). The industrialization difference even with an independent CSA, would still have been much greater than the population difference between the two countries.<br />The American Empire saga comes to a close, with a new saga waiting in the wings. Where logic will reside in that new series remains to be seen, but you can count on intellectual stimulation.	2004-02-19

There are inevitable comparisons to Lord of the Flies, except that BR is that on amphetamines, plus hormones. Terrifying, and heart-breaking, this is a tale of friendship, love and betrayal, that should not be missed. This is the second volume of the manga, which is based on the book of the same name, which resulted in a movie.<br />Japan. The not-so-distant future. It is a nation run by a military dictatorship, which has control over the media and the country. This most popular of television shows makes Survivor look like Sesame Street.<br />Its simply called the Program, and its the highest rated show of all time. In Japan, 9th grade is the last year of required schooling, the last year of junior high. And it is the year that 9th grade students are subjected to a state run lottery. But no one wants to win this lottery.<br />Youve just woken up after passing out on your class trip. The 42 students in your class, including you, have just found out that theyve lost the lottery: the class has been selected to be on the Program. Its a chance to be a star...if you live.<br />21 boys. 21 girls. The winner? The sole survivor. The Program has been on for years, and no one has ever escaped. Youre trapped on an island, with an explosive collar around your neck. If everyone refuses to play, and if no one is killed in a 24 hour period, all the collars detonate, and everyone dies. Try to swim off the island? Youll be shot by the patrol boats; the collars are tracking devices, and transmit the health of the player. Hide, and hope to last things out? Well, the place is divided into grids on the map youve been given with randomly rotating danger zones. When an area is announced as a danger zone, youve 5 minutes to get out, or your collar explodes. Band together, try to take out the sadists whove done this to you and your friends? Ah, but theyre located inside a permanent danger zone. Youve all been given an assortment of weapons, ranging from knives, sickles, crossbows, shotguns, pistols, and semi-automatic machine pistols.<br />So, youre in the game. What do you do? What will happen to the class cute couple? Will she turn on him? Will he, high on fear and adrenaline, kill her? Will idealists keep to their ideals? Will the person that helped you one day, be driven to kill 2 days later? What will happen when fear, desperation, and hysteria strike? Could you, would you kill your friends? Could you, would you, kill the girl you had a crush on, the guy who youve dated, the friend you grew up with? And if you cant kill them...will they kill you?<br />Thought-provoking, this series is not for kids. This story uses graphic violence to drive home the horror of what has been done to these kids. There is gore, graphic gore, sex and rape. And it all is necessary; the rawness drives home the horror, shows the waste of lives. We often have flashbacks, showing the kids in prior times. Some of these are rotten kids, some of them are merely the products of a terrible background. Others are so sweet, so nice that youll agonize should they die. <br />And die they do. By the end of the first two books, 15 are dead. There deaths serve to illustrate how no one deserves to die because of the actions of outside authorities, whether it is at the orders of mad government, or from the bullets of a moron shooting up a workplace or school. The morons who did Columbine would no doubt have gotten the wrong message about this book. But the violence serves not to glorify violence, but to excoriate it. It serves not to praise murder, but to condemn murder and those who kill.<br />This manga is about how incredibly precious life is. The only encouragement from the government? Try to die where there are at least two cameras, all the better for the DVD sales.	2003-07-11
US	48566661	R2VGGZZQHRR0CV	0345444213	374292569	American Empire: The Center Cannot Hold	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Alternate History, Flawed By Unbelievable Actions	This series started with \\"How Few Remain\\", which had the South winning the Civil War, aligning with France and Britain to humiliate the North in a 2nd Civil War, similiar to the Franco-Prussian War.<br />This series is intelligently written. It's flaws have been Turtledove's meandering style of visiting a character for a couple of pages to see how the world has been impacting that character, and to reveal through that character what had been happening in the world; and the fact that Turtledove all too often has his characters and world perform unrealistic actions based upon the author's need to take his story in certain directions.<br />Both of these flaws are evident here, although one flaw is greater than the other. In this instance, the flaw is the unrelaistic actions which occur in this book.<br />A dwindling number of readers might remember Pearl Harbor. Most should remember the events of 9/11. In both instances, the USA united demanding vengence on the attacker. Therefore, if a foreign power attacks the USA, it is to be expected that the American reaction will be one of outrage and a quest for vengence.<br />Well, not in this book. Los Angels is bombed by the Japanese (for reasons which remain unkown) and the reaction of the USA seems to be pretty much of a yawn. This is just absurd.<br />As matters stand at the start of this book, the USA and it's ally, Germany, remain victorious in this world's equivalent of WWI, having defeated the CSA, Britain and France. Disgruntled Confederate soldier Jake Featherstone was well on his way to becoming the Adolf Hitler of the CSA, when his plans were derailed by an unauthorized assassin's killing of the president of the CSA. Covering a period of about 10 years, we witness the Great Depression of this world, which results in absurdities. <br />FDR managed to obtain public support and help to restore public morale by the socialist actions he took; however, this book has a socilaist as president whose actions are ineffectiveon every level.<br />Much of what is to come is predictable, such as the character who ends up running a prison camp during Mexico's civil war, and later works a jailer in Birmingham, Ala. I don't think you need worry what this person will do when concentration camps open in the CSA.<br />Still, what will be truly interesting is how this series depicts the eventual version of WWII between the USA and the CSA. If the author tries to compare post-WWI France with his version of the USA, a mistake will have been made. France had a large, well-equipped army, and actually had better tanks than the Germans of 1940.<br />But France had the Maginot line, and a large army, and importantly, not a very long frontier between the two nations. The USA and CSA share a border spanning thouands of miles. This means there would be vast changes between the French army of our world, and the USA army of Turtledove's story.<br />Newcomers should start earlier in this series. This is a well-written series, but be prepared to quibble.	2002-12-17

It never bothered to re-introduce most of the characters, it never bothered to explain all manner of details from March Upcountry which had importance and relevance to the understanding of this story. For example, although the enemy Saints are mentioned, they are never explained or introduced, something which could have been done in the briefest of paragraphs.<br />I expected better from this story. A lot of the problems which plagued the first book, the reason for the limitations on their high-tech military equipment, the overnight transformation of Prince Roger, the lightening fast love interest story (which never had a proper foundation), etc., all of these were flaws which shouldn't have impacted this book, meaning the authors didn't have to deal with these defects.<br />What happens? The romantic interest is put aside for about half the book before returning to it. <br />But the book gets better in the second half. The writing and story telling get sharper.<br />Prince Roger MacClintock arrived on the planet Marduk by chance, marooned there in an assination attempt. The tertiary heir to the Throne of Man is guarded by Bravo Company of Bronze Battalion of the Imperial Marines, the bodyguards of the spoiled Roger. Stranded, in enemy space, the Marines arrive with equipment discovered to be defective, and realize that they need to fight their way across the continent upon which they landed, reach the sea, cross it, and then comandeer a spaceship at the sole spaceport on the planet, a spaceport believed to be under the control of the enemy.<br />March Upcountry began the tale, and March to the Sea tales up the story, as the title says, of the Marines' March to reach the sea. In the course of the first book, Roger's petulant ways had been corrected, and he's taken to the role of a barabarian war leader.<br />March to the Sea continues in this vein. Essentially there's verylittle new territory in this book. Like March Upcountry, Roger & Co. befriend new groups of natives, and battle the enemies of their new friends.<br />The good news, having read some of the advance previews for the upcoming March to The Stars, it appears that the third book of this saga is much better than the first two efforts.<br />There's a good story here, but the devil is in the details.	2002-12-10

It is a vast improvement to the deeply flawed House Harkonnen.<br />This prequel series has a problem familiar to prequels, you know certain characters are going to survive. This series actually manages to get around that, although clues were given as to the ability for this character to be killed, and yet still be present in the book \\"Dune\\". But in most cases, the reader is aware that the characters who are placed in danger are going to survive.<br />HH was a mess because it told a story set across years, resulting in changes to characters' personalities without proper development.<br />House Corrino, fortunately, doesn't suffer from that problem, taking place over a much shorter period of time. It's a lot of fun exploring the Universe of Dune, and explore it we do.<br />This book takes up where HH ended, Leto still inmourning over the death of his son, Victor, killed in an assination attempt upon himself by his son's mother, Leto's concubine Kailea, an exiled noblewoman from Ix, driven against the Duke by an undiscovered Harkonnen agent.<br />Prince Rhombur, his body virtually destroyed, and now turned into a cyborg, is determined to free Ix from those who stole his world years earlier, and he and Leto get serious about planning to take back the world.<br />Emperor Shaddam is continuing with his plan to gain control of spice by having control of a synthetic form of melange, known as amal.<br />And the Bene Gesserit are rejoicing in the upcoming birth of a special child: the daughter of Jessica, the new concubine of Duke Leto. The problem is, the Sisterhood doesn't know that Jessica is pregnant with a boy, not a girl.<br />House Harkonnen is up to no good...imagine that? We follow Freman, freedom fighters on Ix, Guild Navigators, Swordmasters, Spies, Actors and others as plots twist within plots.<br />This series is fun, but there should be no doubt: these three additions to the Dune novelsdon't hold a candle to the original works.	2002-12-10

Meanwhile in Manticore, Commander Honor Harrington is on her way to her first cruiser command, the aging light cruiser \\"Fearless.\\"  She arrives to find that her new command has been stripped of most of its weaponary to make room for an experimental weapon, a weapon which works well in theory, but realistically is unusable in battle, especially on something as small as a light cruiser.  Despite this, Honor is able to make the weapon's test a successful one. . . but only the first time.<br />After numerous failures, due to the weapon's limitations, the head of the weapon's project is displeased, and Honor's dispirited crew finds themselves banished to Basilisk Station, the place where the navy has been sending its screwups and disgraces.<br />Basilisk Station has been used to incompetence from its Naval picket forces, as have other interested parties.  The present commander of the station, Lord Pavel Young (remember that name) has an axe to grind with Honor, and abandons her to picket the system by herself, as he takes his ship home for a refit.<br />One ship to patrol an entire system, a populated planet, and a wormhole junction.  All with a ship whose crew has had their morale hit rock-bottom.  With years of slacking by incompetent commanders, what might happen when a competent commander finds herself in charge of Basilisk Station?<br />With action, derring-do, intrigue and political machinations, this is space opera at its best.

Honor's Star Kingdom of Manticore is seeking allies against the People's Republic of Haven (Peeps) which has been funding its welfare-state economy by conquering and looting worlds.<br />The good news for Honor is that the diplomatic mission is commanded by her mentor, Admiral Raoul Courvosier, detached from the Navy to the Foreign Office for this mission. The bad news: Grayson is a feudal planet, a planet founded by religious zealots, a planet where women don't even have the right to vote, and equality of the sexes is unheard of. to say nothing of the idea of women serving in the military. And no one's told the Graysons that the Manticoran commanding officer is a woman.<br />It's bad enough that Honor has to deal with sexism form the Graysons, but even worse, Grayson's long standing war with the far more extreme and repressive zealots who live on the planet Massada is heating up, dramatically. Even worse, the Peeps are attempting to take advantage of the situation.<br />This is a truly enjoyable novel, with a high fun factor. Mr. Weber does a nice job of portraying the conflicted nature of much of the Grayson high command, and he takes the relationship between Honor and Nimitz even further than before. Mr. Weber's chaacters are fascinating, and a number of characters introduced in this novel will be recurring characters throughout this series.	2002-07-15

This is an outstanding work of fiction, and &quot;Memory&quot; works well as a stand alone novel, but it can be seen as the second half of an adventure begun in &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; and also as the start of a story which will continue into &quot;Komarr&quot; and conclude in &quot;A Civil Campaign.&quot;<br />The Vorkosigan Saga follows the adventures of Miles Vorkosigan, starting with the early stories of how Miles' mother and father met. Miles is only 4'9&quot; tall, and was born with brittle bones, the reult of a poison gas attack on his parents while his mother was pregnant with him. Miles is the heir to one of the 60 Counts on his home planet of Barrayar, a planet which places great pride on military (and therefore physical) skill. Circumstances resulted in a 17 year-old Miles creating a mercenary unit, the Dendarii Mercenaries, of which Miles assumed command, in the persona of Admiral Naismith.<br />In the world of Barrayar, Miles is Lieutenant Vorkosigan, publicly a mere galactic courier for Imperial Security (ImpSec). But Miles is also Lord Vorkosigan, heir to his father, Count Vorkosigan, future ruler of one of 60 Districts on Barrayar, foster brother to the Emperor himself. But out in the galaxy, Miles has the persona of Admiral Naismith, commander of over 5,000 people and a fleet of warships.<br />In &quot;Memory&quot;, events conspire against Miles, who has always managed to overcome his physical defects by sheer will-power, forcing him to lose his positions as both Admiral Naismith and Lieutenant Vorkosigan. Miles is forced to ask himself &quot;Who is Miles Vorkosigan? Is he Lord Vorkosigan, Admiral Naismith or Lieutenant Vorkosigan? Or perhaps he's someone more.<br />Simon Ilyan, feared head of ImpSec (and whom Miles had called Uncle Simon until he entered the Imperial military academy), is also forced to find out who he is. Ilyan had a memory chip installed in his brain on the orders of the past emperor, giving him perfect recall. But if a chip containing 40 years of memories goes haywire, is it the man or the chip that has been responsible for Simon Ilyan's legendary success?<br />&quot;Memory&quot; is an outstanding work of fiction.

A young man is forced into command of a mercenary unit, trains non-Mechwarrior's to join his new unit, and takes on an invading force. Sound familiar?<br />It should, because this is also the basic plot of \\"Ghost of Winter\\", the first in the Mechwarrior series from FASA, and a part of the Battletech Universe. <br />This book is an absolute mess. The characters are shallow, the pacing is absurdly quick, motivations are ridiculous, etc. The Battletch series has produced a number of excellent books; it's a shame that FASA decided to start the Mechwarrior series with such a piece of worthless tripe. The scary part is the ending of this book, which leaves room for a sequel. Perish the thought. Please?	2002-06-26

But it is \\"Mirror Dance\\" which finally has Mark come into his own as a character and as a member of the Vorkosigan universe.<br />For the uninitiated, Lois McMaster Bujold has created the Vorkosigan Saga, one of the best written science fiction series yet created. It is more space opera than hardcore science fiction, but Ms. Bujold has a keen awareness of any number of ethical questions which will no doubt face humanity in the coming centuries. Besides, she's one hell of a writer, a true master of wordcraftsmanship.<br />The Vorkosigan Saga follows the adventures of Miles Vorkosigan, starting with the early stories of how Miles' mother and father met. Miles is only 4'9\\" tall, and was born with brittle bones, the reult of a poison gas attack on his parents while his mother was pregnant with him. Miles is the heir to one of the 60 Counts on his home planet of Barrayar, a planet which places great pride on military (and therefore physical) skill. Circumstances resulted in a 17 year-old Miles creating a mercenary unit, the Dendarii Mercenaries, of which Miles assumed command, in the persona of Admiral Naismith. <br />In the world of Barrayar, Miles is Lieutenant Vorkosigan, heir to Count Vorkosigan, future ruler of one of 60 Districts on Barrayar, foster brother to the Emperor himself; but also a mere galactic courier for Imperial Security (ImpSec). Out in the galaxy, Miles has the persona of Admiral Naismith, commander of over 5,000 people and a fleet of warships. <br />Mark, introduced in \\"Brothers in Arms\\" is a clone, who doesn't quite know who he is, save for a burning hatred of the clone breeders on Jackson's Whole, a planet where everything has its price. Mark had been created by terrorists to replace Miles and assassinate Miles' father, the Prime Minister of Barrayar. Now Mark is stuck with trying to find his way in a universe where his purpose for existence no longer exists. Clones are breed to be replacements for the aging wealthy; when the clone is \\"ripe\\", just undergo the risks of a brain transfer, and a rich and powerful person starts over in a young, perfect body. Too bad if you're the clone though, as your brain gets tossed out with the trash.<br />Mark undertakes a daring scheme to rescue some of these victims, and disaster strikes. Recovering from a sudden loss, Mark is faced with finding out who he truly is, and finding his own way in life, not merely as a duplicate of Miles.<br />This book is highly reccomended. Ms. Bujold is a terrific writer and she is at the top of her game in this novel.	2002-06-24

Vol. 1: Wrong Number	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Wrong Number is Just Right	Well, I've just finished reading \\"Wrong Number\\", chronologically now correct as the first \\"Oh My Goddess!\\" graphic novel from Dark Horse. <BR> <BR>If those of you who have \\"1-555-Goddess\\" were wondering if \\"Wrong Number\\" would be worth getting, the answer is \\"YES!\\" <BR> <BR>Only the first story is a repeat from \\"1-555-Goddess.\\"  Keiichi Morisato, young college student, dials a wrong number. Instead of a take-out food joint he gets the goddess Technical Helpline. The goddess Belldandy arrives to grant Keiichi one wish.  Thinking it's a joke, he wishes, \\"I want a goddess like you to be with me always!\\"  And the wish is granted, resulting in Belldandy staying with Keiichi.<br />So far so familiar, as this is also the first story from \\"1-555-Goddess\\".  But the remainder of the stories were not included before. We get to see how a goddess  can affect even the most hardcore otaku, how Keiichi and Belldandy got living quarters at the Temple, how Belldandy became a student at Nekomi, the start of Sakoyo's rivalry with Belldandy, Otaki in love, and Megumi's arrival.<br />Both the artwork and story-telling styles are a bit rough around the edges compared to the later stylings of this manga, but it is all quite enjoyable. <BR> <BR>All in all, very much worth the ...price.	2002-06-11

The first compilation combined the novels \\"Shards of Honor\\" and \\"Barrayar\\", to tell the story of Miles' Mother, Cordelia, his Father, Aral, and ended shortly after Miles' birth.<br />\\"Young Miles\\" is an outstanding compilation, consisting of two novels, \\"The Warrior's Apprentice\\" and the Hugo award winning \\"The Vor Game\\", divided by a novella, \\"The Mountains of Mourning, which won both the Hugo award and Nebula award for best novella.  At the end is an afterword by author Lois McMaster Bujold, which is an interesting piece in its own right, telling the story of how these works came into existence.<br />All three tales are available in seperate forms, the two novels by themselves, and \\"Mountains\\" is included in \\"The Borders of Infinity\\", but this definitively compiles the present tales of Miles as he embarks on his early career.<br />Most would envy Miles Vorkosigan's position in life.  The \\"Vor\\" at the start of his name signifies he's a member of his planet's nobility.  He is heir to his father's title of Count, destinied to be one of the members of the ruling legislative body of his planet.  He's foster brother to the Emperor.  His father was the Regent in the Emperor's youth, and now serves as Prime Minister. Wealth, power and nobility; a grand and enviable destiny.<br />But no one would want to be Miles Vorkosigan, especially not on Barrayar, a planet which had been isolated from the galaxy at large long enough to lose much of its technology, including medical technology, until the past few generations.  A planet where mutated children were killed at birth, so that precious resources would not be wasted.<br />For Miles is a mere 4'9\\" tall, hunchbacked, a mishapen head, and with brittle bones which break with alarming regularity.  Not a mutant, despite the epithets he deals with daily, but the victim of a poison gas attack on his parents while he was still in his mother's womb.<br />The adventure starts with \\"The Warrior's Apprentice.\\"  17 year old Miles washes out on his attempt to join Barrayar's military academy because of breaking a leg during the physical testing stage of the entrance process.<br />Discouraged, he ends up taking a trip to Beta Colony, to visit his grandmother Naismith, to accompanied by his bodyguard, Bothari, and Bothari's daughter, the beautiful Elena.  Along the way, he picks up two additions, a mad jump pilot, Arde Mayhew, and a Barrayaran deserter, Baz Jesek.  Events result into a jump into a war zone.  Events further result in the creation of the Dendarii Mercenaries, by Miles, and led by Miles Naismith, an unexpected creation of Miles Vorkosigan.<br />\\"The Mountains of Mourning\\" tells the tale of a newly minted Ensign Miles Vorkosigan forced to investigate an infanticide in the back country of his father's district, a child killed simply for having a deformed mouth, for being a mutant, a matter of personal significance to the deformed Miles, and to his parents.<br />\\"The Vor Game\\" has Miles receiving his first assignment after graduation from the military academy, unexpectedly to a desolate frigid base as a meteorolgist.  Dealing with an insane commander results in his arrest and confinement, which ends with his going on a mission to Miles' Dendarii Mercenaries.  But there's more to it, as Miles ends up stumbling on an old friend, an extremely important old friend, in the most unlikely of places.<br />If you already have these three tales in their seperate incarnations, fine.  But this compilation is truly exceptional and should be obtained whenever possible.	2002-06-10

Miles has come a long way, from the botched asassination attempt while he was still in his mother's womb, resulting in his diminutive and deformed status, to his present existence as an expectant father.<br />Miles' delayed honeymoon with his wife, the lovely and intelligent Ekaterin, is winding down, the happy couple returning home to Barrayar, where they have two children waiting to be born in uterine replicators. However, trouble has been brewing, and Emperor Gregor has a mission for Miles in his capacity as Imperial Auditor: Free up a merchant convoy which has been detained in Quaddiespace, due to the heavy-handed behaviour of the Barrayaran military escort.<br />Things are not quite what they seem, which should come as no surprise to Ms. Bujold's faithful readers.  We get to meet again with Bel Thorne, last seen in &quot;Mirror Dance&quot; a Betan hermaphrodite who was formerly a captain with the Dendarii Mercenaries Miles had commanded in his Admiral Naismith persona.  We also meet several other past members of the Vorkosigan Universe, including Nicol, the lovely Quaddiemusician introduced in the  short story &quot;Labyrinth.&quot;  Quaddies were genetically engineered to have 4 arms, the second pair where the legs would be, the better to live and work in zero gravity.<br />There are plenty of twists and turns, but this is perhaps the weakest novel in the entire Vorkosigan saga.  This novel has the feel more of a novella than a true novel, almost more like one of the short stories in &quot;Borders of Infinity&quot;.  Still, Ms. Bujold on an off day is better than most authors at their best.	2002-06-09
US	48566661	R2YJTFVLK5RATG	0609808443	187071102	How Hitler Could Have Won World War II: The Fatal Errors That Led to Nazi Defeat	Books	4	2	4	N	N	A Clear, Concise and Solid Examination of Hitler's Errors	Alexander Bevin's book examines the military errors that led to the Nazi defeat in WWII.  This book presents the Eastern and Western European campaigns, along with the Italian and African campaigns, with a level of concise clarity that has rarely been matched.<br />Bevins pays particular attention to the African campaign, showing how the Mediterranean campaigns were totally mis-managed by the Nazis, and how Hitler and far too many of his generals' lack of vision saved the world from starting 1941 with Germany having conquered Africa and taken the oil fields of the Middle East, poised on the southern borders of the Soviet Union and on the western borders of British India.  And so it could have been, but for sending an Afrika Korps, instead of an Afrikan army.<br />Bevins does an excellent job of examining the military campaigns of the fall of France, Africa, Greece, Crete, the Soviet Union and the invasion of Normandy, and the invasion of Germany from both the east and west.<br />However, he passes on examining the impact of the war at sea, and the German failure of developing a strategic bomber force, factors that played a significant part in Germany's loss.  Not enough attention is paid to Germany's delay in going to a full wartime economy, or the failure of the German industrial model as it applied to mass production of military components.  <br />He does mention in passing the impact that the resources tied up in the extermination campaigns had on Germany's military ability.  Not mentioned is that many of the Jews who would be slaughtered or uprooted and placed into ghettoes or concentration camps in Poland prior to the start of Barbarossa were in a postion to have helped, even by force, to support that campaign as cobblers, tailors, farriers, etc.<br />Still, despite these minor shortcomings, this book clearly shows how the world was blessed by Hitler's incompetence.	2002-04-22

Coleman doesn't dissapoint Battletech fans with the this tale of the developing civil war within the Federated Commonwealth.  There is plenty of action in this tale of the universe 1,000 years in the future.  However, the book misses out on a 5 star rating because of the underdevelopment of minor romantic subplots, and the breaking of the credulity meter due to the actions of one of the characters.<br />&quot;Flashpoint&quot; tells the story David McCarthy, a hero of the Inner Sphere invasion of Clan space.  At that time, David had held the equivalent rank of major and was a battalion commander in the Kathil Uhlans, an elite Federated Comonwealth regiment based on David's homeworld of Kathil.<br />Upon his return to the Inner Sphere, David learns that the Federated Commonwealth has been taken over by Katherine (Katrina) Steiner-Davion, the sister of it's rightful ruler, Victor Steiner-Davion, who had lead the expedition which had rescued the remnants of David's unit, and had won the victory against the Clans which had ended the Clans' invasion of the Inner Sphere.<br />Although the rest of his unit had decided to join the new Star League Defense Force, following Prince Victor into exile, David wanted to return home to his native Kathil.  Reduced in rank to a captain, David arrives on Kathil to find tensions building between the supporters of Katherine, and the supporters of Victor.  The Militia unit David reports to is loyal to Victor; but on planet is another unit, whose loyalty is to Katherine.  Trouble is brewing.<br />But David has troubles of his own.  Named a hero of the Inner Sphere invasion of the Clan worlds, he is scarred by the memories of a hopeless battle that wrecked his last command.  Can he re-train his new Militia command to understand the reality of war, and put his own demons to rest?  <br />There's more, of course.  Political intrigue, lots of action, on the ground and in space, and even a li'l bit of romance.  The romance angle falls flat, as that subplot is poorly developed.  You can see it coming, even though the author gives little reason as to why it is coming.<br />But this book's worst flaw comes from the actions of the main villian of this tale, an unscrupulous and ambitious officer who is a battalion commander in the unit loyal to Katherine.  This guy's a lot of fun, but a certain decision on this character's part is totally unbelievable.<br />Still, Battletech fans probably won't mind to much.  This is a good book, McCarthy a likeable character, and unlike the prior book in the series, &quot;Path of Glory&quot;, the author is given enough space to tell his story.<br />&quot;Flashpoint&quot; is one of the better recent books in this series.  Battletech fans will approve.	2001-12-06

The world of Battletech is filled with massive Mechs which can tower 12 meters high.  Elementals are Clan warriors who are genetically gifted with height and muscle, and who wear powered body armor.<br />Jake is a warrior who has never known true loss or defeat.  But, as the saying goes, there's always someone better out there, something Jake will discover.  How he deals with this revelation is the crux of this story.<br />Jake's story is set against the backdrop of the Ghost Bear's reaction to a rogue Draconis' Combine's unit's attack on the GB's new capitol of Alshain.  There is also opportunism on the part of the crusader branch of the splintered Clan Wolf, resulting in treachery by Clan Hells Horses, mortal enemies of the Ghost Bears, especially the HH Khan, Malavai Fletcher, the mad, maimed leader of Hells Horses.<br />This novel started off strong, but dealt fairly poorly with Jake's reaction, IMHO.  There was a credibility problem with a certain military action set in space.  No Combat Aerospace Patrol, apparently.  It is a daring piece of well written action.  The problem is that it's just not believable.<br />The biggest problem of this book is the end.  Far to much is reaveled about certain future actions and events, without offering any followup.  And a followup with certain characters, to see their reaction to Jake's maturation is not included, as it should have been.<br />This book will still be liked by most fans of the series, and it offers a nice glimpse from the infantry point of view, instead of the usual mechwarrior viewpoint.  Throw in a good look at the Ghost Bears, and most fans will be satisfied.<br />However, this book was not all it should have been.	2001-12-06

I rank it a tad higher than 3 stars, but round it down since it is closer to 3 than 4 stars.  It is a good story that is hindered primarily by its brevity.  The characters and the story are interesting, but the length of this novel limits the exposition and exploration that would have done a better justice to this story.<br />The bulk of this story takes place in 3062.  It tells the story of Zane, a Mechwarrior in Clan Nova Cat.  After the Star League Defense Force (SLDF) had traveled to the Clan Homeworlds, and challenged the Clans to a Trial of Refusal on the issue of the Clans' invasion of the Inner Sphere, Clan Nova Cat decided to side with the SLDF, and fought in the Trial as part of the SLDF.  The Clans were incensed by this action, and voted to Abjure, cast out, the Nova Cats, giving them 30 days to leave Clan space.  Some Clans didn't wait for the 30 days to expire before launching attacks on the Nova Cats.  <br />As a result, the Nova Cats lost large numbers of warriors in battle, who fought hopeless rearguard actions, but were able to evacuate some of their civilian populations to the Nova Cat holdings in the Inner Sphere.  <br />Zane feels betrayed by his leaders, first, for siding with the Inner Spere forces.  Second, for agreeing to accept worlds from the Draconis Combine.<br />Zane has a counterpart, Palmer Yoshio, a Draconis Combine officer who feels betrayed, first, that his nation has let in the Nova Cats, and second, that his nation has not gone after the powerful Clan Ghost Bear, which still holds Combine territory.<br />&quot;Path of Glory&quot; tells the story of these two warriors, disparate, but similiar men, and their emotional and mental sorting out of their predicaments.  It also features high level intrigue, and gives a nice glimpse into Clan Nova Cat, including a meeting with Minoru, a Nova Cat warrior, who was born in the Inner Spere with the the last name of Kurita.  Oh yes, there's a good bit of action as well.<br />This is a solid story, with intriguing characters.  Although it deserved and needed greater length to fully do this story and these characters justice, this a nice first effort by Mr. Bills.	2001-12-02

There is an undeniable amount of nostalgia for some readers, like myself, but this book reads like popcorn, it's light, it's filling, and it's ultimately no big deal.<br />Decades have passed since I first visited the Temple of Elemental Evil and the Village of Hommlet.  There is an undeniable amount of fun in revisiting places I once saw only through the imagination of my mind and that of my fellow gamers.<br />The story:  Shanhaevel, a young elven wizard is accompanying his aging master on a mysterious mission to the village of Hommlet, for reasons unkown to Shanhaevel.  An ambush on the road results in the death of his master, and the burden of the mission falling to the elven wizard.  <br />His task: go with several adventurers to scout out the ruins of the Temple of Elemental Evil, a place of powerful evil (as the name implies, ^_^ ) and find out if the forces of the temple, which were defeated at great cost a decade ago, are on the rise.  As often happens, things don't quite go as planned.<br />Nostalgia aside, this is a fairly pedestrian book.  Mr. Reid doesn't spend much time on character development, the group bonds far too fast, etc.  The wit and verve of a writer like Paul Kidd, who has written 3 other of the Greyhawk dungeon novels is not apparent in Mr. Reid's style.<br />So, this book is nothing special, but it doesn't commit any major offenses.  The book reads sort of like a checklist: it appears that the author was told he needed to do certain things, which he did, but it still has almost an outline feel to it.<br />The true rating of this book should be 2.5 stars, but I freely admit to being a tad biased by nostalgia, which is why I gave it 3 stars.	2001-11-25

It is a name which stirs emotions in the shrinking number of Americans who know the word.  Americans have not forgotten Pearl Harbor, but few realize that an even more shameful ambush occurred in the Philippines.  On December 8, 1941, despite hours of advance warning, virtually the entire American air force in the Phillipines was caught on the ground by Japanese aircraft and destroyed.<br />Because of this, plans to directly confront an invading force fell apart.  The forces in the Philippines were forced to fall back on an older plan: withdrawal to the peninsula of Bataan, where American and Filipino forces would hold out and wait for American reinforcements to arrive.  But the old plan was based on there being an adequate supply of food and medical supplies within Fortress Bataan.  There wasn't enough food: the men starved.  There wasn't enough medicine: easily treated wounds and illnesses took lives that should have been saved.  And the Pearl Harbor disaster combined with the threat of Germany meant there would be no reinforcements.  <br />And so, on April 9, 1942, having held out for 4 months without adequate supplies, Gen. Edward King surrendered his forces.  The Japanese were ill-prepared to accept the prisoners and had badly underesitmated the number of prisoners they would capture.  <br />&quot;Ghost Soldiers&quot; by author Hampton Sides, tells two intertwined stories. One is the story of how a small band of Rangers took off on a quickly prepared mission in late January of 1944 to rescue POWs at a hellhole called Cabanatuan, where over 500 Allied, mostly Amercian, POWs were kept.  The other story tells of how the prisoners came to be at Cabanatuan.<br />Mr. Sides pulls few punches in telling the horrifying hell through which the American POWs went through, from the stories of the thoudands who died on the Death March out of Bataan, to the thousands more who would die in the custody of the Japanese.<br />Both stories are compelling, from the matter-of-fact attitude of the Rangers on their mission, to the tortures the Japanese inflicted on their prisoners.<br />The juxtapositon of the two stories is masterful.  It should never be forgotten that there are those who would undertake a 30 mile trek through enemy held territory to rescue Americans who were in real danger of being massacred by their guards, as had already happened to American POWs at another camp in the Philippines.<br />But it also should never be forgotten what was endured by the veterans of Bataan.  They fought for far longer than could have reasonably have been expected of them, and did so with valor and honor.  What they endured, from being forced to stand at attention without drinking water at a spring mere feet away, to watching civilians killed for acts of humanity, to the years of inhumane imprisonment, must always be remembered with honor and gratitude.<br />Read this book about the Battling Bastards of Bataan.  They sang that they had no mama, no papa, and no Uncle Sam.  But by remembering, show that we definitely give a damn.	2001-11-24

This story primarily tells the story, and it is a good one, of one pilot, his upbringing, training and combat experience during WWII.  That pilot is George McGovern, a long time friend of Ambrose.  The 2 men have known each other for decades, and for a while, in the 1980s and perhaps early 1990s, both taught at the University of New Orleans, McGovern lecturing on Political Science, Ambrose on History.<br />This history is too much from the pilot's perspective, with all too little input from the enlisted men.  McGovern started flying combat missions with the 15th Air Force in late 1944, from Army Air Forces (AAF) bases in Italy.  By this point, the war had been won, and air supremacy had been achieved.  <br />If you're interesested in finding out about bombers undergoing heavy attacks from fierce German fighter resistance, you won't find it in this book.<br />This book works well as a history of McGovern during the war.  The man who was against the Vietnam War, and the bombing in North Vietnam flew 35 combat missions, the maximum limit allowed by the AAF.  Yet even here, Ambrose doesn't follow-up.  McGovern relates the story of how a live bomb failed to drop on the target, getting hung up in the plane.  Landing with a live bomb would have been suicidal, so the crew worked to get rid of it.  It finally got loose, and landed onto a peaceful Austrian farm house.  When McGovern got back on the ground, he was greeted with the news that his wife had given birth to a baby girl.<br />Ambrose doesn't address the obvious question as to how this incident might have shaped McGovern's later political views, despite McGovern's statement that the incident had haunted him.  This should have been addressed.<br />This book is incomplete.  That Ambrose tells a history of the oft-forgotten B-24 is to be lauded.  But, ironically, although Ambrose discusses how the B-24 has been forgotten, his book gives short shrift to this important plane, ignoring the B-24s flying from England as part of the 8th Air Force, and concentrating so heavily on one perspective, pilot George McGovern.  McGovern served ably and well, and others have contributed to this book as well. <br />But the story of the air war is incomplete.  It's as if Ambrose has only told the story of a single rifle squad of Easy Company.  This book is of value to read, but it should have been much more that it ends up being.  Too many stories are left untold, most especially the terror of the bombing war of 1943 - early 1944.<br />This is *A* story of the bomber war.  *THE* story of the bomber war has yet to be told, at least by Ambrose.	2001-11-15
US	48566661	R3ACH397WUS5F1	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	12	14	N	N	An Excellent Portrait of an Under Appreciated Patriot	John Adams is often thought of as a mere footnote in American History.  The American education system seems to lose sight of Mr. Adams, letting him slip through the cracks, positioned as he is between the glory of George Washington, Father of his Country, and the brilliance of Thomas Jefferson, writer of the Declaration of Independence.<br />But as David McCullough so splendidly points out, Adams was the man who nominated and orchestrated the selection of George Washington as Commander of the Contintental Army.  And it was Adams who led the fight for the Declaration of Independence.  It was Jefferson's pen which wrote the words, but Adams' was the voice which was foremost in favor of the Declaration and was paramount in obtaining passage of the Declaration, changing the world.<br />&quot;John Adams&quot; by David McCullough is a favorable look at one of the most important men in attendance at the Continental Congress which gave birth to the United States of America.  This book follows Adams' modest New England beginnings, to his crucial role defending the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre, his involvement as the leading proponent of American independence, his manuevering to have Washingotn appointed Commander-in-Chief, his role as a diplomat in France and Holland, resulting in Adams' key role in obtaining the Treaty of Ghent, establishing peace between the United States and Great Britain, his role as Ambassador to Britain, his role as the first Vice-President of the United States, his role as the secong President of the USA, his role in obtaining peace between the USA and France, and his role as a retired statesman, who would die on July 4th 1826, 50 years after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.<br />&quot;John Adams&quot; is not the most thouroughly detailed or unbiased of biographical histories.  But it is intelligent and approachable.  Further, we are blessed with the abundance of correspondence between Adams and the notables of histime, especially Thomas Jefferson.<br />McCullough inevitably ends up comparing these 2 American giants who were so closely linked: Adams was crucial for bringing Jefferson on board the effort to write the Declaration, and Adams would be senior to Jefferson throughout much of their careers, until Jefferson would win the election of 1800, defeating Adams.  Both men would die on the same day.  Jefferson doesn't do well in McCullough's eye, coming across as a man who did not practice what he preached.<br />Adams comes across quite well in this biography.  But Adams own words, correspondence which he largely expected to be private, support McCullough's view of Adams as a man who was unappreciated by most of his contemporaries, and yet who was a true man of the people, a man who did practice what he preached.<br />McCullough sheds light on the undeclared conflict with France, Adams role in the founding of the American Navy, and the truly vicious attacks of the press.  The underhanded dealings and backstabbing that Adams sustained at the hands of Alexander Hamilton.<br />This book drives home the living conditions of the age, and the sacrifices Adams made in the service of his country, acrifices which included years of seperation from his beloved wife, the remarkable Abigail.  Yet we benefit from that separation by the correspondence between husband and wife.<br />Although accused of being balanced in favor of Adams, there is nothing wrong with this affectionate yet acurate portrait of one of the most important of America's Founding Fathers.  This is highly recommended reading, to be savored, not devoured.	2001-11-09

That &quot;The Curse of Chalion&quot; is not another one of those excellent adventures is one of the few faults of this marvelous and intelligent book.<br />Cazaril is a man who has been through life's wringer.  Caz is a former soldier of the nation of Chalion, who when taken prisoner was sold as a galley slave.  The broken remnants of a shattered man have walked across two countries in the hopes of finding some menial service and a warm place by the fire in service at the castle where he served as a page in his youth.<br />Instead, he finds himself swept up in events seemingly beyond his control, and is appointed as the royal tutor and secretary to the Royesse Iselle, as well as tutor to Iselle's older companion, Lady Betriz.  <br />Iselle's younger brother, Royse Tedeiz, is the heir to the throne of Chalion, and as a result, Cazaril ends up with his charges amidst the scheming, plotting and corruption of the Royal court, where the childless Roya is not well, and vultures in human form are waiting to swoop in for what scraps of power can be obtained.  Worse for Caz, he finds himself forced to defend his young charge from enemies from his own past, as well as newer foes.<br />But more is at work than mere political corruption.  A curse is at work, blighting the entire royal house.  To his horror, Cazaril finds himself forced into the position as a pawn of the gods, a place that no man should be.<br />This is an intelligent book, and Ms. Bujold paints her characters, especially Cazaril, with an exquisite touch.  The author has created a vivid and vibrant world, with an intriguing theology, well defining the costs of what it means to be a &quot;saint&quot; of the divine.<br />The sole flaw of this book is that it is perhaps a bit on the short side, with certain matters being resolved a bit too quickly.  As a result, the true rating of this book is 4.5, but 5 stars have been awarded due to the superior nature of this novel.<br />If you've only read Ms. Bujold's outstanding sci-fi works, &quot;The Curse of Chalion&quot; provides a great chance for the reader to see the consistent excelence of this author.  Get this book!	2001-10-17

In the previous 2 books, the Emperors of the Eastern and Western Roman empires had joined forces to devast and defeat Persia.  But the tactics of the Eastern Emperor cost some of his allies dearly, resulting in the destruction of the city-state of Palmyra.  Prince Maxian, youngest brother of Galen, Emperor of the West, had discovered that there was an Oath which cast restrictions on the Empire, attacking and destroying anything that the Oath perceived as a threat to Rome.<br />Maxian set out to destroy the Oath, convinced that the Oath was actually harming Rome.  He was blessed with healing magical talent, and quickly grew in power, resurrecting Julius Caeser and Alexander the Great.<br />But there are other plots and stories, all intertwined.  A young student named Dwyrian, from far off Hibernia (Ireland) is drafted into the Roman army, and gains magical powers far faster than he should.<br />Dwyrian's teacher, coming after him, meets a merchant named Mohammed of Mekkah.  And there is an evil, inhuman sorcerer, Dahak, who is in league with Persia.  There is Thyatis, an agent in service to the Emperor of Rome, and more characters and subplots than you can shake a stick at.<br />Book 1, The Shadow of Ararat, was sheer brilliance.  Book 2, The Gate of Fire, was well done, but not as good as the 1st volume, due to a host of new elements which were introduced without enough foundation being laid.<br />The Storm of Heaven is not as good as Book 1, but it is better than book 2.  Maxian deals with the devastation that he wrecked by accidently causing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.  Thyatis deals with her own survivor's guilt, and ends up in the arena of the Colosseum.  Dwyrian grows in power.  Mohammed leads, along with Dwyrian's one time companion, Zoe, who is now the Queen of the destroyed city of Palmyra, the march for vengence against the Emperor of the East.  Empress Martina of the East struggles to hold the Eastern Empire together for the benefit of her young son, while her husband is wracked by an illness of mysterious origin.  Her Uncle, Prince Theodore, the brother of her husband, has his own plans for who should rule the Eastern Empire.<br />Gaius Julius Caesar and Alexandros, have their own dreams of power, which they have not given up, even though they have been cast aside by their master, Prince Maxian.  Oh, and the Persians are on the march as well.<br />ALthough a long book, TSoH, suffers from covering too much ground with too few pages.  THe author's note at the end indicates that the author exceeded the size limit which had been decreed by the editors, and excised portions are available via a website.  <br />Still, despite that flaw, author Harlan has created a highly detailed alternate Roman world, with compelling characters and a complex and entertaining storyline.  I look forward to Book 4 of this series.	2001-10-10

Much More of Ringo than Weber in this Book	&quot;March Upcountry&quot; is billed as a collabarative effort between crack sci-fi writer David Weber and &quot;rising star&quot; (A matter of opinion) John Ringo.  Unfortunately, this book appears to have largely been written by Ringo, which explains the character development, which is both poor and uneven.  Compared to Weber's collabarative efforts with Steve White, this effort is truly sub-par.<br />&quot;March Upcountry&quot; tells the story of Prince Roger MacClintock, 3rd child of the Empress of Man.  Roger is a spoiled brat's brat.  Ordered by his mother to conduct a ceremony on a distant planet, he ends up stranded on a distant world after his spaceship is sabatoged.  His only hope is to travel to the other side of the planet to a space port, while hiding from an enemy and trying to survive on a hostile planet, filled with warring city-states and ravenous wildlife.  <br />Roger's sole hope is his bodyguard company of Marines.  As a result, there is a lot of action.  Too much in fact.<br />There are a lot of problems with this book.  As someone else has noted, the character of Cord mostly disappears after an important buildup.  There is sudden, and unexplained maturation of a character.  There is the beginnings of a romance, with an instanteous attraction between 2 unlikely characters.  It would have been nice to know why the characters would be attracted to each other, but Mr. Ringo can't be bothered with such details.<br />I say Mr. Ringo, because there is very little of David Weber in this book.  Mostly we have Mr. Ringo cramming Kipling's military poetry down our throats at every opportunity, no mater how laughable the situation is rendered by these inappropriate actions.  <br />Further, the author forces things greatly, including relying on the crutch of a corrupt appropriation process to reduce the technical advantage possessed by the marines.  Never mind that marines regularly infiltrate other worlds which are hellholes, meaning that deffective weapons would have shown up prior to the events of this book.<br />Still, this book is not a total washout, and Ringo did improve after his first book.  There are a number of interesting characters, who will become more interesting if they're no longer 2 dimensional.  The good news is that several characters do threaten to take on 3 full dimensions.  There is interesting high level intrigue and an interesting universe which has been created.<br />Just don't go into this book expecting the high sci-fi standards regularly used by Mr. Weber.  Keep your expectations low on this book, and you won't be dissapointed.  It will be interesting to see if the sequel &quot;March to the Sea&quot; is an improvement.  Still, I can't help but think how much better a David Weber/David Drake version of this book would have been.	2001-09-13

Harry Turtledove's &quot;American Empire: Blood &amp; Iron&quot; continues his alternate history begun in &quot;How Few Remain&quot; and continuing through the &quot;Great War&quot; trilogy, in which the Confederate States of America (CSA) won the Civil War.  &quot;How Few Remain&quot; told the story of a  second War Between the States, in which the USA lost to an alliance of the CSA, Britain and France.  That book began the alliance between Germany and the USA.  The &quot;Great War&quot; trilogy replayed WWI, with the USA allied with Germany, the CSA aligned with Britain, France and Canada.  <br />WWI is over and the USA and Germany have emerged triumphant, with heavy penalties for reparations on the CSA, just like what happened to Germany in actual history.  Canada has been occupied by the USA, except for Quebec, which has formed a Republic, allied with the USA.<br />&quot;Blood &amp; Iron&quot; covers the time from the end of the Great War, in this world, 1917, into 1924.  Turtledove is clearly planning to use this new series to set up his own version of WWII.  We even have the emergence of the CSA's version of Adolf Hitler in Sgt. Jafe Featherston.  He transfers the inflation that ravaged Germany to the CSA, and does a number of things to set up parallels between the defeated Germany of our world, and the CSA in his own.<br />As always, Turtledove is a highly intelligent writer.  But this book suffers from the flaw which ruined &quot;How Few Remain&quot;; Turtledove forces his world to do illogical and unrealistic things in order to have his story go where he wants it to go.  While not as blatant as in &quot;How Few Remain&quot;, there is, at times, an unnatural feel to the flow of this book.  <br />That many of the things happened in the actual history of our world is not an excuse, because the circumstances are different.  France lived next to Germany, and yet it maintained a strong fighting force, a fatally flawed fighting force, but one which built the Maginot line, and continued tank development.  <br />Turtledove continues his style of visiting his characters for a few pages, then returning to that character 50, 60, or more pages later to see how events are affecting that individual.  The result is a series of character studies, rather than a cohesive novel.<br />&quot;American Empire: Blood &amp; Iron&quot; is an intelligent and intriguing book, in what has been an intelligent and intriguing series, despite the flaws that have at times marred this series.	2001-09-07

Leary, Commanding	Books	5	5	6	N	N	An Intelligent and Fun Naval Adventure	David Drake's 2nd book following the adventures of Republic of Cinnabar Naval Lt. Daniel Leary, a scientifically inclined, politically connected, slightly overweight skirt chaser, and Signal Officer Adele Mundy, a former librarian, deadly shot, information expert and spy, takes the reader to new levels of emjoyment and entertainment.<br />This series is a sci-fi descendant of Patrick O'Brian's New York Times best-selling &quot;Aubrey-Maturin&quot; series, which is high praise indeed.  <br />This book is sheer fun, as Leary and Mundy are caught up in high intrigue as Daniel's first command, the corvette, &quot;Princess Cecile&quot;, sets out on its first mission.<br />Drake does a nice job of establishing the worlds upon which his characters live and visit, painting an intriguing portrait of Cinnabar and other environs.<br />Leary and Mundy find themselves in high adventure, as they must deal with plots by exiled royalty, the dangers of being marooned, a prig of a commanding officer who just doesn't take a liking for young Lt. Leary, the dangers of interstellar travel, the unexpected appearance of powerful enemies, deal with pirates and have a face-off in a desperate showdown.<br />Drake truly expands the Leary-Mundy universe in this book, and there is a lively sense of humor throughout this adventure.  Plus, there's a great supporting cast of characters, starting off with Leary's man-servant Hogg, and Mundy's equally deadly servant, Tovera.<br />This book is intelligent, humourous, and swashbuckling space opera at its finest, ranking right with David Weber's &quot;Honor Harrington&quot; series.	2001-08-19

S. Forrester.  However, the past decade has brought focus on a new series of naval adventures, the late Patrick O'Brian's New York Times best-selling &quot;Aubrey-Maturin&quot; series, which looks to remain, at 20 novels, one of the most comprehensive stories of naval and scientific adventure ever to be set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812.<br />In that vein, author David Drake has created his own version of British Royal Navy officer Jack Aubrey, with the introduction of Lt. Daniel Leary, a young officer in the Republic of Cinnabar's Navy.  Young Lt. Leary is a ladies man, although he could be in better shape.  Still, Leary is a highly skilled and promising young officer, who thrills in his love of scientific knowledge, but who feels that his naval career might not amount to much, given his estrangement with his politically powerful father.<br />Drake finds his Dr. Steven Maturin, a man who is physician, scientist, scholar and spy, in the form of Adele Mundy, a librarian and information specialist, who has been given the job of setting up a library for the newest ruler of Kostroma, an erstwhile ally of Cinnabar.  <br />Adele is an expatriate of Cinnabar, formerly having been one of the aristocracy, like Leary.  Lt. Leary is on Kostroma as part of a diplomatic mission, and stumbles onto Adele as he goes to the new library in pursuit of his scientific hobbies.  Adele is not well disposed towards Daniel, as his father was resposible for her exile from Cinnabar, as well as the death of her parents and 10 year old sister, all the result of political machinations.<br />This novel is rich in political intrigue, derring-do, swashbuckling, the exploration of the natural world, and the importance of information.  Adele and Daniel are thrown together as they combat a plot by the Alliance of Stars to drive Kostroma out of the arms of Cinnabar, and into the clutches of that ruthless interstellar empire.<br />This is a truly enjoyable book, with enjoyable characters, and what looks to be the start of a beautiful friendship between Mundy and Leary.  I highly recommend this book.	2001-08-19

He still needs some more seasoning as an author, but most of the major flaws of his first book have been eliminated and/or reduced to the point that they don't interefere with the enjoyment of a rock-em-sock-em adventure.<br />Our story: In the near future, mankind is approached by the Galactic Federation, which is composed of a number of alien races, none with the psychological makeup to be warriors. Soldiers are needed because an alien horde has been ravening, unchecked through the galaxy.  It won't be long before they arrive at Earth.<br />To save dear ole Earth, half-trained expeditionary forces were sent out to learn more of the alien menance, try to delay the horde, and find ways to fight the bad guys.  &quot;A Hymn Before Battle&quot; featured recalled former Airborne enlisted man Michael O'Neal, who ended that book as a true hero, who helped gain humanity's first victory over the bad guys.<br />Now a captain, commanding a company outfitted with the new battle armor which he helped design, O'Neal faces bureacratic fights, but the big show is coming.  For the aliens are due to arrive by the millions on Earth.  And mankind is not yet prepared, with too few modern weapons, officers and generals who are still fighting the last war, and the secret dealings of some of the &quot;good&quot; aliens.<br />The bulk of this novel deals with the alien invasion itself, and Ringo indeed has a talent for writing action scenes.  This book benefits by the additional length to expand the back story, characters are much more realistic and human, and although we don't see much more of the &quot;good&quot; alien plotting, a new, yet (presumably) related level of intrigue is introduced.<br />Still, there are flaws, as certain changes in American society have not been fully explored.  Some of the problems to this book are merely the result of the poor foundation laid in the first book of this series, &quot;A Hymn Before Battle.&quot;  Mr. Ringo still needs to work on his characters, (the 8 year old Rambo was just a tad much) although he has made vast strides.<br />This book packs an undeniable emotional punch, and I had a difficult time deciding whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars.  (If there was a half star rating, it would have received 3 1/2.) I gave it 3 stars, partly because 2 stars was an overgenerous rating for the first book, but mainly because there are still just a few too many rough edges to merit 4 stars.<br />However, sci-fi action fans will not be disappointed.  I look forward to the next volume of this saga, and compliment Mr. Ringo for his improved writing skills.	2001-08-14

So humanity is recruited to fight the bad guys.<br />The only problem is that the horde will be arriving on Earth before mankind can adequately prepare defenses to protect dear old Earth.  So half-trained poorly equipped forces must be sent out to try and delay the aliens, find out more about this devasting menace, and try to develop effective tactics for fighting the alien horde.  But the &quot;good&quot; aliens have their own hidden agenda, so matters become even more perilous for humanity.<br />Ringo's main hero is Michael O'Neal, a former Airborne soldier called up to help troubleshoot solutions for combating the horde, and who ends up being part of the design team that comes up with a powerful suit of battle armor as a means of fighting the bad guys.<br />If this sounds like a good story, you're right.  The problem is this book is poorly written.  Ringo is a rookie author, and it shows from the painful amount of flaws in his book.  Shame on Mr. Ringo's editors for not having him kept trying till he got it right!<br />His narrative is a mish-mash, most of his heroes are jingo spouting cliches, every non-combat soldier in the US Military is a moron whose sole goal seems to be to impede the fighting efficiency of America, and vastly important episodes, such as the disciplinary collapse of the American military is dealt with &quot;off-camera&quot;, when such vital plot components should have been delved in closely.  His heroes are practically supermen, having far too much access to high levels of power, being near perfect physical specimens, and/or having far too many abilities (the street gang which turns out to have hacked into the army database and then seems to be able to do anything, including a circus act springs to mind).<br />This book is both poorly written and too short as too many important plot points are glossed over.  Yet the good news is that Ringo's writing style does improve through the course of this book.  And there actual moments of decent writng and drama during the climatic battle sequence.<br />2 stars is probably too high a rating for this book, but the great concept and improved writing ability by the author had made me decide to award this book with that rating prior to reading the sequel.  As this is the first book of a series, the reader should know that Mr. Ringo's second book is a much better effort.oorly written and too short as too many important plot points are glossed over.

Although a uniquely Japanese story, the appeal of this timeless classic is universal.<br />Maison Ikkoku is a run down apartment building in Tokyo. Living there is struggling and wishy-washy college student Yusaku Godai, who has fallen head over heels in love with the beautiful, young manager of the building, Kyoko Otonashi. Kyoko has some feelings towards Godai, but she's a widow, and still is not over the death of her beloved husband, Soichiro. <br />Complicating matters between the two are rich, suave, hysterically dog-phobic, and handsome tennis coach Shun Mitaka, Godai's rival for Kyoko; and Kozue Nanao, a sweet, cute, and naive girl, who accidently has become Godai's platonic girlfriend. Kozue is clueless that Godai is in love with Kyoko.<br />But the crowning touch is the 3 other residents of the apartment building: hard drinking, hard partying and hard gossiping Mrs. Ichinose, who lives with her young son Kentaro; Akemi, a sexy party animal who is the bar hostess at local hangout ChaChaMaru, and who wears her see-through negligee around the building; and then there's the mysterious Yotsuya, who gets his kicks out of peeping, and breaking through Godai's wall so that he can mooch food from Godai. These characters would be at home in &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;.<br />All 3 regard Godai as their personal toy, and they get their kicks from teasing him and holding their drinking parties in his room. They've also discovered that Kyoko is fun to tease as well.<br />The 9 chapters contained in &quot;Empty Nest&quot;, Volume 5 of the 14 volume saga which is &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;, are heavy on comedy, although a hint of romance always lurks around the corner.  The 3rd anniversary of the death of Kyoko's husband, Soichiro, is upon us, and Kyoko's parents have become more awareof the absence of grandchildren in their lives.  This discussion brings Kyoko to consider the possibility of raising a family with either Coach Mitaka or Godai.  Baseball is the national sport of Japan, and the manager of the gang's bar ChaChaMaru, has recruited everyone to play in a game against the local merchants, for a wager, of course.  Kyoko's going to a class reunion, while Godai's playing host at a freshman mixer.  Godai ends up with a cute, intoxicated freshman gal, who's supposed to be verrrrrry lonely.  What a coincidence that Godai is in the Shinjuku District, the same area as Kyoko's reunion.<br />The remainder of Volume 5 covers a story arc that continues into Volume 6; Godai's grandmother comes to visit.  Granny Yukari drags Godai and Kyoko to her class reunion.  Granny finagles Godai into taking her with him on a date with Kozue, and we see that Godai has been indecisive since he was a child.  Granny learns that Godai has a rival, and Coach Mitaka mistakenly invites Granny, Godai and Kyoko to his luxury apartment, where Granny has a lesson for Godai to learn.  Granny gets a shipment from home of her homemade plum wine, which helps to show that alcohol and dogs don't mix.  Granny invites the gang to a hotel pool to swiim, and Kyoko misunderstands the hickey Godai is sporting.  It is embarrasing, since Godai got it from his drunken college buddy Sakamoto, who's decided to take a &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy about the hickey, which only infuriates Kyoko.  Godai takes off for Hokkaido, to escape Kyoko's wrath, and winds up making friends with a chatterbox of a gal who helps Godai sort things out.<br />A few notes of interest: when Granny Godai arrives, it's clear that she &amp; Kyoko had met before. The reason for this is that an early volume that contained Granny's 1st visit to Ikkoku was not translated/published in America, for unknown reasons.  At the mixer, Sakamoto says that he &amp; Godai had been buddies since they failed their college entrance exams.  The English translation of the series had Godai introduced as a college student; the original Japanese had Godai as a &quot;Ronin&quot;, a person who failed his/her difficult entrance exams and who is cramming to retake the exam.  <br />This wonderful Volume keeps this great story rolling along with it's drop-dead funny humor, and yet the romantic angle keeps things touching.  &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; is better than &quot;Oh! My Goddess!&quot; and is superior to most books which make Oprah's Book Club.  Buy it, you'll love it!	2001-07-15

Too bad his nursemaids are Mrs. Ichinose, Akemi &amp; Yotsuya.  Christmas comes to Ikkoku once again.  Godai's got his eye on the perfect present for Kyoko.  Since this involves Godai &amp; Kyoko, there has to be a string attached.  New Year's results in two visits by Godai to the local shrine, first with Kyoko, then with Kozue.  A drunken Akemi starts off a kissing chain reaction with Godai &amp; Kyoko thinking about lips and the meeting thereof.  Kyoko &amp; Akemi buy leotards.  Naturally, Yotsuya wants a peek.  A trip home by Godai leaves Kyoko taking care of Godai's basket of flowers.  Did anyone tell Kyoko that the flowers were a gift from Kozue?  Speaking of Kozue, frustrated by Godai's lack of affection, she looks for some expert advice on the subject.  The expert?  Coach Mitaka!  Welcome to misunderstanding city.  Mrs. Ichinose's young son Kentaro has taken comfort that despite all the weirdos at Ikkoku, at least manager Kyoko's normal.  This opinion might change after the results of an unplanned costume party, triggered by an innocent Kyoko.  Finally, Kyoko's father-in-law gives Godai a package to give to Kyoko; Soichiro's diary.  Can Kyoko get jealous of a dead man?<br />With no connecting story arc, this volume emphasizes humor and offers insights on both Japanese culture and the characters.  The New Year's day chapter is especially rich in cultural references, showcasing the most important of Japanese holidays.  Note that Kyoko &amp; Kozue's kimono's have different length sleeves.  Kyoko's sleeves are short, since she's been married.  Kozue's sleeves are long, since she's stll young and single. <br />A good example of character insight is offered in this conversation between Kyoko &amp; Mrs. Ichinose:<br />KYOKO:  Do you think I'm the jealous type?

A Perfect Mix of Comedy, Drama &amp; Romance!	&quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;, Volume 3 of the international masterpiece of romantic comedy, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;, continues the great comedy and touching romance seen in the previous volumes and steps things up a notch.  This is a uniquely Japanese story, but it is universal in its appeal.<br />Maison Ikkoku is a run down apartment building in Tokyo. Living there is struggling and wishy-washy college student Yusaku Godai, who has fallen head over heels in love with the beautiful, young manager of the building, Kyoko Otonashi. Kyoko has some feelings towards Godai, but she is a widow, and still is not over the death of her beloved husband, Soichiro. <br />Complicating matters between the two are rich, suave and handsome tennis coach Shun Mitaka, Godai's rival for Kyoko; and Kozue Nanao, a sweet, cute, and naive girl, who accidently has become Godai's platonic girlfriend. Kozue is clueless that Godai is in love with Kyoko.<br />But the crowning touch is the 3 other residents of the apartment building: hard drinking, hard partying and hard gossiping Mrs. Ichinose, who lives with her young son Kentaro; Akemi Roppongi, a sexy party animal who is the bar hostess at local hangout ChaChaMaru, and who wears her see-through negligee around the building; and then there's the mysterious Yotsuya, who gets his kicks out of peeping, and breaking through Godai's wall so that he can mooch food from Godai.  These characters would be at home in &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;.<br />All 3 regard Godai as their personal toy, and they get their kicks from teasing him and holding their drinking parties in his room. They've also discovered that Kyoko is fun to tease as well.<br />Things get kicked up a notch in the emotion department in Volume 3, which contains 12 parts.  Kyoko Otonashi, is sweet, kind, caring, generous and beautiful.  Volume 3 shows that Kyoko has her own flaws: jealousy and a significant temper.  Her temper and jealousy have made brief appearances in the first two volumes, but they shine in this volume.  <br />A visit with a married classmate who has a child causes Kyoko to have her first thoughts about remarriage.  However, she is quickly aggravated by the men in her life; Godai for his continuing indecisive relationship with Kozue, Mitaka for a compromising position she observes the dog phobic coach in.  Kyoko's Mother meets Coach Mitaka and highly approves of him as a match for her daughter. It's not good for Godai that she can never remember his name.  Godai also really meets up for the first time with Kyoko's Father.<br />Kyoko's dog, Mr. Soichiro gets lost; we discover why this dog shares the same name as Kyoko's late husband, and Kyoko sees Godai in a new light.  Godai's college buddy Sakamoto crashes at Godai's place, while they work a temp job nearby.  If you ever wondered how Kyoko acts when drunk, now's your chance.  It's festival time, with the whole gang going to the fest, while Kyoko &amp; Mitaka, and Godai &amp; Kozue get some semi-private time.   Platonic Kozue tells Godai she wants &quot;Something to remember this summer by.&quot;  Does that mean she wants to &quot;do IT?&quot;  <br />This volume ends with a 5 part story arc.  Wedding talk between Kyoko and Mitaka causes Godai to leave Maison Ikkoku, moving into an apartment in which the previous tenants, a woman who works in a massage parlor, and her gangster, gambler husband have not yet moved out.  Confusion and misunderstandings abound, and a bad situation gets worse and worse for Godai.<br />This volume shows off Kyoko's temper and jealousy, but also gives the first good look at her feelings for Godai.  Japanese culture abounds in this issue.  We get to see a fair bit of Pachinko. A scene with Kyoko carry lots of canned food home shows that she was able to convert her Pachinko winnings into the canned food.  The Lantern festival scenes show off some of the games, dancing and clothing which is common at these events.  The yukata, a cotton summer kimono,also gets a nice showing as well.<br />The best of the volumes so far in this series, it manages to mix comedy, drama and romance to perfection.  &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; tells a great story and just keeps getting better.	2001-06-14

Family Affairs, Volume 2 of the international masterpiece of romantic comedy, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;, continues the great comedy and touching romance which began in Volume 1.<br />Maison Ikkoku is a run down apartment building in Tokyo.  Living there are struggling and wishy-washy college student Yusaku Godai, who has fallen head over heels in love with the beautiful, young manager of the building, Kyoko Otonashi.  Kyoko has some feelings towards Godai, but she is a widow, and still is not over the death of her beloved husband, Soichiro.  <br />Complicating matters between the two are rich, suave and handsome tennis coach Shun Mitaka, who is Godai's rival for Kyoko; and Kozue Nanao, a sweet, cute, and naive girl, who accidently has become Godai's platonic girlfriend.

They've also discovered that Kyoko is fun to tease as well.<br />Volume 2 gives some nice overviews of several traditional Japanese holidays, as well a how they approach Christmas.<br />In this volume, Kyoko has a fall and Godai gets an eyeful; a rainy day conversation between Kyoko &amp; Kozue reveals more about Kyoko's late husband, Soichiro; Christmas comes and gifts are exchanged, but not exactly as planned (we also find out Godai &amp; Kyoko's ages); New Year's Eve has a bumbling Godai &amp; Kyoko alone at last; Godai's trip home is longer than expected, discover if absence make the heart grow fonder; and find out what happens when you secretly take care of a cat with the same name as your building manager.<br />But the biggest story-arc occupies nearly the entire last half of the book: Kyoko's parents want her to quit her job and move back home.  Her mother wants her to remarry, her father just wants Kyoko back home.  The tactics that are used by her parents, especially her mother, are true to Japanese life, and have actually been used by Japanese parents toward their children, especially daughters.<br />We witness the observance of the 2nd anniversary of Soichiro's death; we see the depth of feelings the tenants actually have for Kyoko; dog phobic Mitaka makes some moves towards Kyoko both on the court &amp; off; Godai gets introduced to Kozue's family but he has his own vision of the future.<br />Better than &quot;Oh! My Goddess!&quot;,  &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; will tickle your funnybone and tug at your heart strings.  There are serious moments in this continuing storyline, but the emphasis is still on humor, although the sweetness of this story is always present. Don't call this a graphic novel; call it graphic literature.	2001-06-07

Filled with helpful and original material, this companion book gives readers a look at the geography, society, and present &amp; past history of this highly detailed fantasy world.  This is a must read book for fans of this series.<br />However, there are two important caveats.  First, the original artwork contained in this book can be described in one word: dreadful!  Hideous, terrible, yuck, ugly, and other negative adjectives are also accurate.  The artwork in this book is on the level of bad fan art, except most fan art I've seen is better than what is contained in this book.  When compared to the cover art of Darrell K. Sweet, which is also found in this book, its enough to make you cringe when looking at the pathetic interior illustrations of Todd Cameron Hamilton.  But bad as the artwork is, and it is BAD, it does not overcome the information contained in this book.<br />The second caveat is that &quot;World&quot; was published prior to the release of book 8, &quot;A Path of Daggers&quot;.  Two books have now been published (with who knows how many yet to come)since the release of &quot;World&quot;, so there is some dating to this companion book.  But there is enough original material to still make &quot;World&quot; a good purchase for any fan of this series.	2001-01-04

Books	4	5	8	N	N	Enjoyable Yet Uneven Speculation	Who hasn't wondered about a decision not taken or the string of uninterrupted causation that is required for any single person to exist?  Think about your own life: the chain of events which resulted in your parents meeting; how you ended up in your current job; the college you attended; you never attended college; or how you met your current significant other.  We are all shaped by historical choices, both ones made by ourselves, and those made on a scale that can alter history.<br />&quot;What If?&quot; gathers some of the world's foremost military historians to offer hypothetical counterfactuals, including: What If Alexander the Great had died in battle at the age of 21, before he had built an empire?  What if the American Revolution had resulted in disaster? What if certain key battles in the American Civil War had changed?  This is fun reading as it is always interesting to consider alternative paths not taken or paths unavailable by happenstance.<br />This book contains a number of excellent examples of counterfactual speculation, with only a few medicore essays.  The authors examine how individual actions can have an impact as can the whims of weather.<br />This is an enjoyable book and, because of the broad area of military history, invites the potential for sequels.  For example: One counterfactual I've always wondered about occurred in December of 1814 here in my home town of New Orleans.  A prosperous son of Creole planters was awakened by the sound of British troops landing at the back of his plantation.  Young Mr. Villere jumped out the window and headed for New Orleans, dodging a shot from a British sentry.  Villere arrived in New Orleans and spread the alarm.  Gen. Andrew Jackson gathered his forces and launched a surprise attack on the British.  The British, unsure of the forces facing them, slowed their advance to give time to consolidate their forces.  This gave Jackson time to throw up some defenses on the plains of Chalmette.  Within 2 weeks theBritish had been defeated after suffering enourmous casualties attempting to storm Jackson's fortifications.<br />But what if the British sentry had not missed young Mr. Villere?  Had the British continued their advance it is conceivable that these veterans of the Peninsular campaign could have won the Battle of New Orleans.  Today people only remember that the Battle of New Orleans was fought after a peace treaty had been signed.  But the treaty had not yet been ratified.  Further, in the treaty the British recognized the status of borders prior to the war.  But Britain had never recognized the Louisiana purchase, as the Spainish had violated a treaty with Britain when Spain secretly sold Louisiana to France.  Britain could have attempted to keep New Orleans.  This would have meant a widening of the war.  It also begs the following question: Would there have been sufficient British troops to win at Waterloo?<br />As you can see counterfactual speculation leads to a never ending string of alternative possibilities.  But it is enjoyble to speculate, as is &quot;What If?&quot;	2001-01-04

Sadly, little of this is available in Terry Brooks' adaptation of 1999's top grossing film.  Little is learned in this book that was not covered in the movie.  This adaptation sheds less light on the events of the film than the average adaptation.  Still, the story of &quot;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace&quot; is presented in a an adequate manner.<br />None of this is the fault of Brooks, who was clearly constrained by the restrictions set upon him by Lucasfilm and its mania for secrecy surrounding the release of the movie.  The result is an unexceptionally written book, which fully tells the story of the movie, but offers nothing of additional substance.	2000-12-06

Set in the most vivid fantasy world ever created, Jordan takes readers further into this world, weaving new plotlines, introducing new characters and growing the roles of characters first met in &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;.  This series continues to work on multiple levels, containing nuances which have clearly been missed by the few critics of this series.  (Critics of this series often focus on its length, reminding one of the emporer in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, who complained that Mozart's concert had &quot;too many notes.&quot;)<br />In the first book, Rand, Perrin and Mat, 3 young men from the village of Emond's Field were forced to flee from minions of the Dark One, accompanied by Egwene, a village girl who wanted adventure, and Thom Merrilin, a gleeman who had come to the village to entertain at the village's spring festival.  Guided by Moiraine, a member of the mysterious order of Aes Sedai, women who can channel &quot;saidar&quot;, the female half of the One Power, and Lan, Moiraine's Warder, the group was soon joined by Nynaeve, the village's Wisdom, who had followed them to protect the young people from her village who had been had been swept up in an Aes Sedai &quot;scheme&quot;.  The group, minus Thom, would eventually be joined by Loial, an young member of the long-lived race of Ogier, a gentle giant of a bookworm who had left home to see the world.<br />One of the joys of the first book was the maturing of the characters, all of whom would change in significant ways: Perrin discovered he could talk with wolves, and now has the yellow eyes of wolf, and has also run afoul of the Whitecloaks, an intolerant military order of zealots; Mat had been uttering the Old Tongue in moments of battle &amp; stress and was then tainted by a cursed dagger from the foul city of Shadar Logoth; Egwene discovered she had the ability to channel and now desiresto become an Aes Sedai; Nynaeve learned that she could already channel, having survived what only one in four women do, channeling on her own without Aes Sedai training; Nynaeve has also fallen in love with Lan, a love he also feels, but does not believe he should return; and Rand has discovered that he is a man who can channel.  Men who channel inevitably go insane, and have ever since the breaking of the world some 3,000 years ago.<br />&quot;The Great Hunt&quot; picks up shortly after the end of &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;, with everyone in the borderland town of Fal Dara.  The Amyrlin Seat, Siuan Sanche, head of the female order of Aes Sedai, arrives, purportedly to meet with the three young men from Emond's Field, all of whom are &quot;ta'veren&quot;.  A person who is &quot;ta'veren&quot; has a certain ability to manipulate events and chance, e.g. a leader who intends to reject a treaty might end up signing it.  But the Amyrlin has arrived for reasons of her own, with plans she means to make with Moiraine.<br />But before any of these plans can be implemented, a sudden raid by Trollocs and Myrddraal, minions of the Dark One, results in the freeing of the peddler Padan Fain, a Darkfriend who had been altered to hunt for Rand, Perrin and Mat, and who had been further changed by following them into cursed Shadar Logoth.  The raid resulted in Fain stealing Mat's tainted dagger, and the Horn of Valere, which is locked in its own box.  Whoever sounds the Horn of Valere will bring forth heroes of legend who will fight for the Light against the Dark One.  Or so it is believed.  In truth, these heroes will fight for whoever sounds it. <br />Rand, Mat and Perrin, accompanied by Loial, set out to recover the Horn and Mat's cursed dagger.  Mat is still linked to the dagger and it is needed for him to be fully Healed by Aes Sedai.  They will be joined by Verin, an Aes Sedai who has motivations of her own.  On this journey, Rand will meet a beautiful woman, Selene, whohas also has motivations of her own.<br />Egwene and Nynaeve head to the White Tower in Tar Valon, to begin training to be Aes Sedai.  They will also meet an Aes Sedai with private motivations, Liandrin.  They become friends with Elayne, Daughter-Heir of Andor, and Min, a young woman capable of seeing auras around people, both of whom we briefly met in Book One.<br />But people who are &quot;ta'veren&quot; have a way of drawing to them people of whom they have need and our characters may well meet before this book is over.<br />In this book, readers learn the fate of Thom Merrilin, the missing gleeman; learn about the mysterious invaders called Seanchan; meet up with ship captain Bayle Doman again; learn more about the mysterious Aes Sedai; get involved with &quot;The Game of Houses&quot; in Cairhein; witness the plots of Darkfriends and Ba'alzamon; and meet an Aiel for the first time.<br />Jordan has created the most fully realized fantasy world to date, and it is a pleasure to visit again.  With stong, complex characters, including numerous strong female characters, vital cultures, and skillful, intelligent word crafting, this series cannot be recommended enough.	2000-11-29

What's the fuss all about?  Simply put, this is the most fully realized fantasy world ever created, surpassing even Tolkein's vision.<br />Not only is this a world with intricate and detailed cultures, a world with a vibrant history that resonates with a reality rarely found in any type of fiction, it possesses complex and vivid characters.  This series is enriched by Jordan's skill as a wordcrafter - this novel, and the books that follow, works on many different levels, and contains a level of subtlety that the few critics of this series have obviously missed.  &quot;Eye of the World&quot; is a great start to this series:<br />You are Rand al'Thor, a young man who raises sheep and tabac with your widowed father Tam, on your farm outside the isolated village of Emonds Field, a place were nothing ever happens.  Except that its the eve of the Spring Festival and it still feels like winter.  Except that there are strangers in town, a Lady with a commanding presence named Moiraine, and her companion, a man named Lan who can obviously handle himself in a fight.  Oh yes, there's the gleeman, Thom Merrilin, an entertainer who just arrived to perform at the festival.  But you can't forget the man you saw on the way into town, a hooded man in black whose cloak doesn't move in the wind, a man who had disappeared before your father could see him.  A man seen by some of the other young men of the village.  Scary as that mysterious man might be, you're even more befuddled by Egwene al'Vere, youngest daughter of the mayor, to whom you are virtually promised. Egwene, whose braided hair announces that the women of the village have determined that she is now old enough to marry.<br />But there are troubles in the world.  The peddler Padan Fain has arrived with news of war, of a man who declares himself the Dragon.  But surely it is merely another False Dragon.  Lews Therein Telemon, the man called the Dragon, had led a succesful strike by male Aes Sedai, men who could wield the male half of the one power, against the Dark One and his most important minions, 13 humans known as the Forsaken, imprisoning them 3,000 years ago.  But the Dark One's counterstrike tainted the male half of the one power, driving every male Aes Sedai insane.  These insane men caused the Breaking of the World.  In his insanity, the Dragon gained the name Kinslayer, for killing everyone he ever loved.<br />But prophecy says that the Dragon will be reborn to face the Dark One again, and that he will save the world, but break it. Is this another False Dragon?  Pray that it is.<br />But these worldly problems are washed away in a night of terror, when Trollocs, monstrous creations of the Dark One, attack Emond's Field, wounding Tam.  In his delerium, Tam uttered things which have turned your life upside down.  The frighting man in the black cloak is revealed as a Myrddraal, a servant of the Dark One and a leader of the Trollocs.  <br />But this was a selective attack.  Your farm, and the homes of your friends Perrin Aybara and Mat Cauthon, were the primary targets.  Moiraine is revealed to be one of the Aes Sedai, women who are not trusted and are feared by many.  It is said that an Aes Sedai is bound by oath to speak no word that is not true, but that they can make the truth dance a jig.  Lan is her Warder, mysteriously bound to his Aes Sedai.  Moiraine says the Dark One is hunting you, Perrin and Mat. <br />And so you, Perrin and Mat, guided by Moiraine and Lan, along with Egwene who wants to see the world, and Thom Merrilin, who feels that his company will not be welcome if he's associated with Aes Sedai.  Soon they are joined by the young Wisdom of Emond's Field, Nynaeve al'Maera, who has come after them to return them to her village.<br />But there's a man in your dreams, a man whose eyes and mouth are sometimes filled with pits of endless fire.  How can you return home with such a man in your dreams?  Can you ever find a place of refuge?<br />Again, I cannot reccommend this series highly enough.  It possesses a depth which is rarely found in any type of writing.  With a vivid world and remarkable characters, the reader will be anxious to read the next chapter in this compelling saga.	2000-11-20

This is not just a story of the Aliies vs. Japan, it is very much a story of man vs. nature.  The author gives the reader a glimpse of the difficulties all parties faced fighting in such adverse conditions.  This book is not concerned as much in giving a detailed history of the campaign in the South Pacific, but concentrates on the human factor.<br />Author Bergerud gives plenty of attention to this often overlooked area of combat, giving special attention to the horrific combat over the Kokoda Trail, a narrow track winding its way through the jungles and mountains of New Guinea.  The Australian and Japanese troops fought through sweltering heat in the jungles, but also fought in conditions near freezing in the Owen Stanley Mountain Range.<br />Although the author gives special attention to the usually ignored Australian contributions, he also closely examines American and Japanese experiences in the South Pacific.  Combatants were often in wretched physical condition, due to the often overwhelming assault of tropical diseases and heat, which in turn contributed to mental breakdowns.  The wrenching images of men who belong in hospitals serving as frontline soldiers will remain with the reader.<br />&quot;Touched by Fire&quot; is not a great history of the South Pacific, but is instead a masterful telling of the experiences of the combatants who were involved in this grueling endurance match.	2000-11-15

This book concentrates on following the 1999 hurricane season, with an examination of the horror inflicted by 1998's Category 5 Hurricane Mitch, which killed at least 9,000 people in Central America.  The author gives a riveting account of the power of Mitch, telling of its absolute devastion to the nation of Honduras.<br />The author concentrates on the Hurricane Research Division (HRD), the scientists who try to learn more on these powerful storms, and who fly into them for first-hand scientific observation,and the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the people responsible for making the forecasts as to where these dangerous storms will go.  This is interesting stuff, especially when the scientists fly into the storms.  <br />Unfortunately, it seems that that the author simply took info off his tape recorder and stuck it into the book, beacause a lot of the heavy science conversations which are included in this book do not have enough explanation or context.<br />This book is also hindered by certain editorial decisions.  This book suffers from the lack of maps showing the tracks of the hurricanes the author discusses, especially because the author spends a great deal of time discussing the meandering nature of the hurricanes.<br />The book also contains some minor errors, some of which can be chalked up to the author not being a native American (e.g., describing as one of the highest points in Florida as &quot;Disney's Magic Mountain&quot;, when everyone knows that he meant Disney's Space Mountain.)  While these minor errors do not really detract from this book, and the above-average number of typos is not much of a problem, the real problem comes from the feel that there are times when this author does not go into needed detail.  For example, the author talks about the rapid intensification of Hurricanes Opal and Camille, but while the author examined the rapid intensification of Opal, he made no such prior mention of Camille.  <br />The author fails to provide detail in other areas.  While expalantions are provided for some criticism of the media, we really don't know why the huuricane jocks at HRD are so critical of the Weather Channel's staff, especially weatherman Jim Cantori.  This book has a slap-dash feel.<br />However, the descriptions of the hurricanes themselves surpass the author's limitations in other areas of writing.  As a native of New Orleans, I've seen my share of hurricanes.  One of my earliest memories is of Hurricane Betsy.  I lost family in Hurricane Camille.  I was one of the tens of thousands of people who evacuted, with my family, from 1998's Hurricane Georges, which was a near miss.  I've done research on hurricanes for school, so I have a bit more scientific and personal knowledge than the general public.  There are flaws in this book, but the postives far out weigh the negatives.<br />The author has not written the perfect book on hurricanes, but he is to be commended for spelling out the dangers these massive storms pose, for pointing out the lack of funding which goes into hurricane research, and for his skill in relating the tragedy which is inflicted on hurricane victims, especially the devastation of Hounduras.	2000-11-03

McKiernan's Mithgar stories.  First timers would be advised to start elsewhere.  This book starts slow, but picks up and improves throughout, although the ending is somewhat anti-climatic.<br />McKiernan himself describes this book as a sequel to all his prior Mithgar stories.  The problem is that this is a lot of extra baggage for a less than 500 page novel.  This is not the author's best work, although it is enjoyable.<br />The Mithgar novels are not for everyone.  Mckiernan writes in a highly formal style that can best be described as &quot;High Tolkein&quot;.  McKiernan has been the great master's most slavish imitator, not that there's anything wrong with that.  But if you get irritated by an overdose of &quot;thees&quot;, &quot;thine&quot;, &quot;thou&quot;, etc., these books are not for you.<br />&quot;Silver Wolf, Black Falcon&quot; is chronologically the last of McKiernan's Mithgar novels.  It tells the story of Bair, a young man born to a female elf, and a Baeron, a human shapechager of mixed heritage.  He is called an Impossible Child, because elves cannot give birth on the plane of Mithgar.  Millenia ago, the ways between the planes were sundered to defeat the forces of evil.  Only those who have the blood of another plane can travel to that plane.  Thus elves can return to their home plane of Adonar, but can't return to Mithgar; the foul beings of evil known collectively as Rucks, can return to their evil plane of Neddra, but can't return to Mithgar, etc.  Bair is of mixed blood, so he can freely travel the planes.  This novel spends the first 100 plus pages watching Bair grow to the age of 16, and then, finally, picks up speed as we accompany Bair and his Elven &quot;uncle&quot;, Aravan, on a mission of great importance.<br />As I stated, this is not the author's best novel.  He provides no explanations for certain mysterious events (perhaps for future books), but the resultis he provides solutions out of nowhere.  Mithgar fans should know that the author leaves room for future Mithgar stories.<br />This book starts slow and has too much baggage.  The book is also too short to be a worthy climax of the Mithgar saga.  Still, McKiernan fans will be entertained.	2000-11-03

An Outstanding New Version of the DM Guide	When Wizards of the Coast (WoTC) came out with the Players Handbook, it needed a bit of polishing.  The extra month of work which went into the new DM Guide shows, as this is the best version of the Dungeon Master's Guide yet written.<br />The new DM Guide has everything a beginning DM will need.  While much of this book is geared for newbie DMs, even the most experienced of DMs will find useful material.  Perhaps the most exciting development is the change in corporate outlook.  In the old TSR days, house rules and customization were considered sacrilege of holy writ.  Not anymore.  If a DM wants to have Trolls as players, make changes to a character class (such as the flawed Ranger class), or even create new character classes, WoTC actually encourages DMs to give it a try.  Never fear, there's also plenty of information on playing strictly by the written rules.<br />WoTC has added a number of fun enhancements, one of which is the prestige class.  This is a character class which is added to an existing class, and is not available as an initial character class.  Included in the prestige class are the Assassin (remember him/her?), the Arcane Archer, the Blackguard (think anti-Paladin), the Dwarven Defender, the Shadowdancer, and the Loremaster (think the sage Non-Player Character [NPC]).  Although a bit more info would have been useful, the prestige class gives additional depth for characters and allows for interesting NPCs.<br />The old 0-level NPC has also had a sensible reworking.  Now NPCs can be Artistocrats, Experts, Warriors, etc., with level advancement within these NPC classes.  Hence you could run into a 6th level Aristocrat and her 8th level Warrior bodyguard.<br />One of the most enjoyable sections in the DM Guide has always been the magical items listed at the end of the book.  WoTC has done a great job detailing these items, and has provided useful illustrations.  There are some changes: wands, staffs and rods all have 50 charges, and it doesn't seem that items can be recharged, unless specifically listed.  But this section is well done.<br />The latest incarnation of the DM Guide is the best yet, and is a must have for any DM.	2000-11-01
US	48566661	R1GSZY9TQ4GWTF	0786915528	342936691	Monster Manual: Core Rulebook III (Dungeons & Dragons)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Adequate: A Mix of Flaws and Inspiration	It used to be that the only tools needed to play D&amp;D were dice, graph paper and pencils.  Now add a calculator as a requirement for all DMs who aren't math geniuses.  Why?  WoTC's first take on the Moster Manual does not include experience points (XPs) in its statistics.  This is a major flaw, and will be a drag on gameplay.  WoTC did include a nice way for calculating XPs in the DM Guide, but, incredibly, they don't copy it in the Monster Manual (MM).  As a result, DMs will need to go back and forth between 2 different books, just to figure out how much XPs a party of adventurers will get for slaying some foul beast.<br />The other major flaw is that the descriptions of the beings fair and foul is abreviated compared to previous issues of the MM.  The MM has a claustrophobic feel, no longer does each entry merit its own page.  This results in fewer illustrations than in previous versions of the MM.<br />However, not all is bad in the MM.  There is sufficient information to interact with the beings listed, and the statistics are well laid out.  The illustrations that do exist are perhaps the best ever for a MM.  The addition of listing the advancement possibilities for certain beings is helpful, as is the inclusion of Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution and Charisma stats.  The decision to have certain types of beings as templates, e.g. liches, ghosts and vampires, seems like a smart move.  There is also sufficient information to play some beings as player characters, and to create new friends or foes.<br />Despite some irritating flaws, the new Monster Manual is a must have for any DM or interested player.	2000-10-30
US	48566661	R2COBSZF0P7RXA	0345416619	426738597	How Few Remain	Books	2	7	14	N	N	Bad Novel - Good Character Study	&quot;How Few Remain&quot; is an immense disappointment following on the heels of the author's successful &quot;World War&quot; series, and the alternate Civil War novel, &quot;Guns of the South&quot;.  The sole purpose of this book is to set up Turtledove's alternate WWI series, &quot;The Great War&quot;.  As a result, this book's flow is artifical, forced, and unbelievable.<br />In this alternate novel, the South won the Civil War and achieved independence, aided by France and Great Britain.  The Confederate States of America (CSA) purchases an area of Northern Mexico, giving the CSA access to the Pacific Ocean.  This results in the USA, which is still seething from its defeat, and the high-handed manner of the British and French, declares war on the CSA.  Britain &amp; France declare war on the USA.  With the exception of a group of volunteers against a British incursion from Canada, Turtledove has a woefully unprepared USA fight the war with a stupidity almost unparalleled in human history.  There is an obvious comparision to the Franco-Prussian war, but one doubts if even the French were this stupid and incompetent.  Even incompetence by Union generals during our Civil War was matched by the competence and skill of other Union generals.<br />While this book fails as a novel, it contains some wonderful character studies.  Abraham Lincoln as a prophet of socialism; J.E.B. Stuart commanding camel cavlary in the western war; Frederick Douglass as a war correspondent who when captured, is interviewed by the commander of the CSA army, Stonewall Jackson; Teddy Roosevelt as the commander of volunteers who has to work with regular army Colonel George Armstrong Custer; Samuel Clemens, aka Mark Twain, as a San Francisco newspaper man who doesn't approve of this war; the president of the CSA James Longstreet; and Alfred von Schlieffen, of WWI's von Schlieeffen plan, as a German observer in the USA, who begins the formulation of a USA-German alliance.<br />Although the character studies are enjoyable, they cannot hide the artificial feel of this book.  This book is one of Turtledove's weakest efforts to date.	2000-10-27

His devasting account of the horrors he witnessed are a must read for anyone interested in WWII.  This could be the best personal memoir of combat ever written.  If you want a full appreciation of what the generation of Americans who endured WWII combat went through, buy this book now.<br />Sledge takes the reader with him as he joins the Marine Corp, goes through boot camp, and ends up with the grizzled combat veterans of the 1st Marine Division.  He takes us through his initiation of combat on Peleliu, a coral island which had some of the worst fighting, up to that point, in the Pacific.  Today, there is a general belief that the battle for Peleliu was unnecessary, owing to the advancement of the schedule for the invasion of the Philippines.  If this was an unneeded battle, Sledge shows in full detail the horrible sacrifice young Americans suffered.<br />His account of the battle of Okinawa is even more devasting.  Where Peleliu was a dry, parched hell, Okinawa is a hell of rain, mud, muck and decay.  Sledge is unstinting in exposing the horror and ever-present danger facing those in the frontlines.  He shows the casual brutality of combat, and does not turn away from showing the hatred most Marines had for the Japanese. He shows the close bonds that develop between the members of a combat unit, the terror of shell-shocked soldiers, dodging bullets &amp; shells on stretcher bearer duty, the stench of fighting in the middle of human decay, and the loss that is felt when friends die.<br />&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; is mandatory reading for anyone interested in WWII.	2000-10-06

This book is a must for any person interested in WWII.<br />Beevor gives the reader detailed information from the viewpoints of everyone involved in this battle: Hitler and Stalin, the generals on both the Soviet and German sides, right down to the officers and soldiers who fought in conditions which went beyond human comprehension.  <br />&quot;Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege, 1942-1943&quot;, is unstinting in exposing the atrocities committed by both sides.  It also exposes the follies and blunders committed by the Germans and Soviets.  Readers will learn the plight of Soviet citizens who chose to fight for the Germans, understand the fate of Soviets captured by the beseiged German garrison, endure with doctors who have no medicine to treat their patients, witness the harsh fate which awaited Soviet citizens and soldiers who showed any signs of &quot;defeatism&quot;, and see the strategies which resulted in German defeat right at the moment Hitler believed that he had won.<br />This book is a masterwork of the horror man can inflict upon man.  I read this book during the heat of a summer which broke records, yet I got chills from reading of the freezing hell of Stalingrad.  Buy it now!	2000-10-05

In this universe, there are nations who serve as proxies for the nations which fought WWII, e.g. Algarve is Germany, Unkerlant is the Soviet Union, Zuwayza is Finland, Forthweg is Poland, Valmiera is France, etc.  We see dragons instead of aircraft, behemoths instead of tanks, leviathans instead of submarines.<br />The period of time paralleling WWII in this book is roughly Summer 1941, to Spring 1942.  As a result we get to see the equivalants of Operation Barbarossa, and the beginning of an alternate Holocaust.<br />Turtledove has not created a mirror of our own universe and thrown magic, dragons, mages, and behemoths into the equation.  This is a seperate universe, which results in differences which can be significant.  For example, the equivalant of the Jewish people, the Kaunians, are rounded up for execution not merely because of their race, (which is, of course, why they are chosen), but because their blood sacrifice results in powerful military magic.  <br />However, the people of this world are well aware that a person's lifeforce can be sacrificed for magic.  This results in strained credulity because the Kaunians' reaction parallels that of the Jews in our own world, which is unbelievable, given that the Kaunians have a greater knowledge than the unfortunate victims of the Holocaust in our world.  <br />Turtledove does a masterful job of creating characters.  The sheer number of characters is almost overwhelming, but less so than the first book of this series.  To his credit, Turtledove always makes me think when I read his books.  This book benefits from not being an absolute duplicate of our world, and is a worthwhile read.	2000-09-30
US	48566661	R38Y5ANOMW0YIA	0440235642	845964663	Black May	Books	4	9	10	N	N	An excellent but exhaustive history of the defeat of U-boats	This is an excellent history of the defeat of Germany's U-Boats. Germany believed that it was on the verge of winning the Battle of the Atlantic.  Then, disaster struck the U-Boats.  The German submariners dubbed the month of May, 1943, &quot;Black May&quot;, because of the incredible reversal of fortune they had sustained.  Gannon's book shows the reader, in extreme detail, how this turn of events occurred.  Anyone interested in the U-Boat war in the Atlantic should read this book.<br />Black May is full of detailed information on all of the technical systems which resulted in the ultimated defeat of the U-Boats.  The author concentrates on telling the story of the fate of a small number of convoys, as opposed to an in-depth examination of each and every German loss during the climax of the Battle of the Atlantic.  The result gives this history a truly personal feel, and gives readers a good sense of what convoy duty was like.<br />Readers should be warned that Black May is not an easy read, but it is well worth it for any WWII history buff.	2000-09-28

First King of Shannara is the prequel of Sword of  Shannara, and faces the problem of many prequels: you know what is going to  happen.  <br />Despite this handicap, Brooks weaves an interesting story,  creating a believable cast of characters.  But, this book may be better  appreciated by readers who read this book prior to reading  Sword.<br />Character development exists, but it seems that the rich writing  that made Sword such a major fantasy event is lacking in King.  A lot of  time is spent setting up events for the future story to be found in Sword.   Naturally, this is the purpose of any preguel, but it does cast a shadow  over the storytelling aspects of this book.<br />First King of Shannara is a  good book, but does not qualify for greatness.  It should be enjoyed by all  fans of Brooks' Shannara series.	2000-09-18

It provides a ready made  world which has a proven track record as a great &quot;place&quot; to play  D &amp; D.  It is well worth the purchase price for any DM who wants to  play in the Greyhawk world, or is looking for inspiration to create his/her  own campaign world.  It is also great to for players, as it gives them a  taste of how a game world operates.<br />Greyhawk was the original world for  the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Campaign. Originally created by Gary  Gygax and crew, this campaign area was largely abandoned after Gygax left  TSR.  <br />The Greyhawk campaign has always been a popular and vibrant world,  a world where all races had areas where they were dominant.  Indeed,  speculation on the abandonment of this campaign world was not because of  any problems with the campaign world itself, but because the the management  who replaced Gygax wanted to distance themselves from anything Gygax had  personally created within D &amp; D.<br />But Greyhawk would not die.  After a  long absence, several new modules and accessories were developed, just  prior to the financial problems which resulted in Wizards of the Coast's  purchase of TSR.<br />The new Gazetteer is heavily derivative, and quite  faithful to the previous Greyhawk Gazetteer and other Greyhawk supplements  (which is not a bad thing).  DMs have been given a world with plenty of  room for expansion, and adventure.<br />The only quibbles with this Gazetteer  are that it doesn't contain much in the way of new information, and is on  the brief side.  It will be interesting to see what will be contained in  the forthcoming Living Greyhawk book, which will purportedly contain more  detailed information on the Greyhawk world.	2000-09-13
US	48566661	R20DEICZ3WW727	0786915501	633963573	Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook: Core Rulebook 1	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Diamond in the rough with common sense	The newest incarnation of D&amp;D is, in most ways, a significant improvement over the prior system.  Finally, common sense and logic are  applied to the grandaddy of all role-playing games.  As someone who has  played and been a DM since prior to when the first AD&amp;D books came out,  it is nice to see the removal of such artificial and ridiculous concepts as  class limitations, race, and for the most part, alignment.  In the old  system Elves were supposed to be highly magical and Dwarves were renowned  as fighters, yet the racial limitations on class resulted in these races  eventually being wimps compared to human characters.<br />The multi-class  rules are a drastic improvement, again showing a bias towards common sense.   The return of the half-orc race, and the barbarian and monk classes were  long overdue.  It will be interesting to see how the new sorcerer class and  the changes to the wizard class work out, but things look promising.   Changes to ability scores are a plus, as is the ability to customize  characters with the skill and feat abilities.  <br />The new edition is a  diamond, but it is a diamond in the rough.  It appears that some additional  polishing might be needed.  Although many of the explanations are well  done, (this contains far and away the best explanation of alignment), and  there are excellent and helpful illustrations to help guide readers, the  layout is a bit confusing as it relates to the expalnations of the skill  and feat abilities.  Also, there has not been enough clear explanation on  weapon restrictions.  Wizards are limited to certain listed weapons, which  do not include the short bow.  But Mialee, Wizards' model wizard, possesses  a short bow, presumably because all elves, such as Mialee, have proficiency  with bows.  Clarity is needed, because elves also have proficiency with  other weapons not available to the wizard class and there may be conflicts  with other class restrictions, especially the druid.  <br />Anotherproblem  area is the ranger.  Back when the old system first introduced skill  abilities, they goofed by not automatically giving the ranger the survival  skill.  Wizards has similarily goofed by not automatically giving the  Wilderness Lore skill to the ranger class.  I mean, come on, a ranger  without wilderness skills?   The ranger class benefits by finally getting  numerical spell equality with the paladin, and the change to the  &quot;special enemy&quot; is also nice.  Both changes were long overdue.   However, every other special ability granted to the ranger class can be  quickly duplicated by a fighter.  Not enough care has been spent evaluating  this character.<br />Other changes have more of a personal taste quality:  halfings are no longer Hobbit clones, but are more like Kender without  wrinkles; weapons generally inflict less damage; the changes in the way  spells are listed, etc.<br />In short, vast improvements have been made, but  rough edges remain which could still use refinement.  A full verdict will  have to wait until the DM, Monster Manuals and any supporting manuals are  published to fully realize the changes which have been implemented.	2000-08-28
