Today we mostly think of this phenomenon in the context of the O.J. Simpson trial, or the juries that refused to convict racist killers in  the South during the Civil Rights era.  As the author points out, that's a  small part of the jury nullification picture.  The Framers considered such  injustices well worth it in light of the jury's ability to frustrate the  actions of would-be tyrants.  Such discretion on the part of juries has its  downside, of course -- but so does the unbridled discretion of prosecutors,  which is generally considered to be a Good Thing by many of those who fear  giving the same discretion to juries.  As Conrad makes clear, it's not  obvious why this should be the case.	1999-11-21

The Swiss system is  superior to a lottery-based conscript army because it encompasses everyone,  not just the unlucky and the young.  That not only makes it fairer, but  provides protection for democratic values against the standing professional  army that the Framers feared.  Read this book together with Gary Hart's  excellent book &quot;The Minuteman:  Restoring an Army of the People&quot;  (Free Press 1998), which argues for a Swiss-style approach in America.	1999-04-07

As for what he thought and  felt -- who knows?  Even he can't be sure in retrospect.  But that rings  true, too.  Lots of us started out impressed with Clinton, only to be  disappointed by lies and opportunism.  One place where I disagree with  Stephanopoulos is in his characterization of Dick Morris -- Morris and  Clinton seem like two sides of the same coin.  That's not a compliment to  either.<br />The book is well-written, enjoyable to read, and quite useful in  understanding what went on in the Clinton White House -- and why.  My  favorite observation is when Stephanopoulos wonders, early on, whether you  have to be crazy to make a successful run for President.  The answer, by  the end of the book, is pretty clearly &quot;yes.&quot;  Maybe we should  start taking the Electoral College seriously....	1999-03-22
US	52960872	RBWB58DAKXHVY	0691004153	532733532	Taking the Constitution Away from the Courts	Books	5	16	20	N	N	An interesting approach; defies left/right stereotyping	We know the stereotype:  liberals love the courts, conservatives attack them as undemocratic.  Like most stereotypes, it is based on truth, but out of date.  Nowadays, many on the right are calling for more judicial action  -- e.g., striking down laws passed by Congress as outside the Commerce  power, or violative of the Second Amendment.  And many on the left are now  advocates of judicial restraint. <br />  One may explain this away by noting  that the switch is suspiciously correlated with a switch in the ideological  attitude of the courts.  But Mark Tushnet's book can't be explained away on  these grounds.  As Tushnet notes:  &quot;we have to remember that we buy  judicial review wholesale:  In getting the decisions we like, we run the  risk of decisions we despise.&quot;  (p. 141).  More importantly, Tushnet  notes that winning in court doesn't mean as much as you might think.  Roe  v. Wade energized the antiabortion movement and took the wind out of the  sails of prochoice forces; a series of legislative victories producing the  same result may have been less divisive, and more final.<br />Tushnet's  solution is given away by the title:  taking the constitution away from the  courts, and returning constitutional interpretation to the people.  He also  argues -- rightly, I think -- for paying far more attention to the  principles set out in the Declaration of Independence.  Early commentators,  like Justice Joseph Story, saw the Declaration as the animator of the  Constitution.  More recently the Declaration has been largely ignored --  perhaps by those who fear its radical implications.  Tushnet is right to  suggest reversing this trend.<br />I am rather dubious about whether Tushnet's  populist enterprise will succeed, but his book raises some excellent  questions.  It is certainly the case that constitutional debate over the  past several decades has been too elitist, too narrow, and too influenced  by academic fashion and interest group politics.  In calling attention to  this fact, Tushnet has produced an interesting, provocative book that  should be read by anyone interested in the future of constitutional debate  and decision.	1999-03-21

The timing seemed too  good, with a book that reflects well on the Swiss coming out just as Swiss  Banks were getting a lot of bad publicity.  But having read it, I've  changed my tune.   Halbrook doesn't waste time defending Swiss banks (who  at any rate may have been no worse than Chase Manhattan -- read Charles  Higham's &quot;Trading with the Enemy&quot; for the disgusting story of  American business' collaboration with the Nazis), but rather tells the  story of the Swiss people and the Swiss Army.  Those two entities are more  or less the same thing, which in part explains how the Swiss mobilized  one-fifth of their population (and armed most of the rest) to deter a Nazi  invasion.  The most persuasive part of the book consists of quotations from  fulminating Nazis -- Hitler, Goering, Himmler, etc. -- about those damned  Swiss and their incomprehensible willingness to die fighting rather than  surrender to the Reich.  Halbrook also notes how the Swiss traditions of  armed citizenry, federalism, and democracy made the kind of  surrender-by-elites that took place in Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands,  etc. impossible and pretty much unthinkable in Switzerland.  If the rest of  Europe had done as the Swiss, Hitler would never have made it out of  Germany.  Even though I knew the ending (naturally) the book kept me  turning pages until the end.  I highly recommend it.	1998-08-23

Yet, in fact, quite a bit has  happened since then:  though no Presidents have been impeached (so far),  cases involving federal judges in particular have made new law and raised  new questions.  Gerhardt's book goes into more depth than either Black or  Berger, and provides an excellent guide to a wide range of issues.   Gerhardt is more a Blackian than a Bergerian -- heavily influenced by  structure and relationship, and prone to avoid judicial review of  impeachment in most circumstances.  An excellent book, and well-written.	1998-08-23

Okay, I'll admit it -- thriller novels turning on obscure parts of the  Constitution aren't all that common.  But I enjoyed this book and -- as a  professor of Constitutional Law -- I've often assigned excerpts as a way of  illustrating that obscure parts of the Constitution really *do* matter.   (Eric Harry's &quot;Arc Light&quot; is another that gets similar service).   But even if you don't teach Constitutional Law you are likely to find  Greenfield's book interesting and enjoyable.  The ending is a bit  implausible, but heck, it's fiction.  A good read, at least for  political/legal junkies like me.	1998-08-23

His answer, in short, is geography.  Well, maybe.  He does admit that geography shapes culture, but culture also makes a huge difference in what people *do* with geography's endowments.  For my money, which I spent, David Landes' &quot;The Wealth and Poverty of Nations&quot; is a better take on the same question.  Landes focuses on culture; he admits that geography plays a role (he's not as monocausal as Diamond) but emphasizes cultural traits over geography because, well, they matter more.  Best statistic:  the GDP of the 30 million overseas chinese exceeds that of the entire People's Republic of China.  Why?  The overseas chinese -- who thrive everywhere -- have a culture of thrift and hard work.  The PRC Chinese have a culture of sucking up to the authorites.  That's changing now, of course, but the point holds.	1998-07-29

All such books are open to criticism for what they choose to emphasize and omit.  That said, this is an excellent book, better than Jared Diamond's &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; which won the pulitzer prize that -- in my opinion -- this book should have received.  Landes is relentlessly self-critical and undogmatic.  His conclusion:  that culture matters more than resource endowments.  Is it true?  As &quot;true&quot; as any broad statement in the humanities can be.  Just compare resource-rich Nigeria to, say, Malaysia.  Because of the book's scope, everyone will find something to quibble with, but overall it's well worth reading and pondering.	1998-07-29

Brin's book challenges several reflexive views held by cyberthinkers -- most significantly that strong encryption is the key to liberty.  (He's clearly right about that.  Encryption always fails.  Look at ULTRA, MAGIC, cellphone encryption, DES, etc.)  His occasional efforts to prove to readers that he really is a good liberal (anti-gun, anti-Limbaugh, etc.) and not some sort of nasty cyberlibertarian are a bit annoying and out of place, but aside from that I find little to criticize.  As he freely admits, Brin may be wrong about many of his assertions, but he's clearly right that there needs to be far more discussion and far less groupthink than there has been on the subject of privacy and surveillance.	1998-07-19

It's hypocritical for me to simultaneously rush out to buy every Turtledove book (in hardcover yet) when it comes out, and to also suggest that he's spread too thin writing too many books, but I think that's the case.  &quot;American Front&quot; is an excellent book, one that would do credit to most any writer, but it's not up to Turtledove's high standards.

The title, &quot;More Guns, Less Crime,&quot; really says it all.  According to Lott, efforts to limit the availability of guns mostly serve to make innocent citizens more vulnerable to criminals.  By making crime, safer and more rewarding, such measures also make it more common.  By contrast, Lott finds that when states relax gun-control laws -- particularly by making it easier for law-abiding citizens to carry guns concealed -- criminals rationally respond to the increased risk by shifting to nonconfrontational crimes (e.g., auto theft, burglary of empty buildings) or by moving.  The book relies on the most extensive study of gun and crime data anywhere, encompassing *every* county in America rather than just a few selected locations.  And some of the studies were coauthored with Lott's extremely eminent University of Chicago colleague William Landes.  A first rate book, informative, readable, and persuasive.	1998-05-06

Hart's proposal is a military something like the Swiss model:  universal service, with a very large force of part-time citizen soldiers backing up a professional military much smaller than at present.  The proposal is interesting, but  the most thought-provoking part of Hart's book is  his critique of the current system, in which he concludes that maybe the Framers weren't crazy to fear a standing professional army, and that maybe we should too.	1998-05-06

Another review of this book says that Sharur is a lot like other Turtledove characters:  Gerin the Fox, Krispos of Videssos, etc.  That's true, but it shouldn't be an indictment.  Like the works of Robert Heinlein, Turtledove's novels are works of moral instruction -- though Turtledove is lighter-handed about it than Heinlein sometimes was.  But like Heinlein, Turtledove is fascinated with competence and moral responsibility.  His characters play that out.

It is not as good as The Guns of the South or the Worldwar series, but that's praising with faint damns.  The characters are interesting, the parallel world is plausible (though it's not entirely clear why the British Empire of the 1990s is so far behind our world -- no WWII to stimulate technical progress?  that's my guess, but he gives no hint) and the action satisfying.  If Turtledove has a flaw, it's that he writes too many books.  I shouldn't complain of that, as I eagerly read each one that comes out.
