There are sections on the economics of magic selling and various types of magic sellers. There are great descriptions and useful ideas. This is gurps so it can be applicable directly to the gurps system or easily converted into others such as D&amp;D.	2001-08-24

It covers levels 1-3. The orignal game went to 36 levels. These rules have been superceded by Advanced and then  2nd and now 3rd edition D&amp;D but they are a classic and provide a workable game on their own, providing character creation, monsters, magic, and evoking the atmosphere for adventure gaming. The rules are fairly simple, character creation is fast and it is not difficult to play.	2001-08-22

The mystara setting has a developed history that this book contradicts, it is set in Mystara's gaming past but the cultures are from the current game time and the events of the book would ensure that they changed significantly. The author's writing style seemed a bit awkward, due, I believe to English not being his primary language. <br />For a medieval fantasy series I don't like seeing characters say things like &quot;we had a Dickens of a time&quot; and other anachronisms.<br />It seems as if part of the books were written as chronicling the author's RPG game experiences, and that does not translate well in this instance for making this an enjoyable read.<br />Plotwise, the trilogy is OK in parts with some neat surprises, but there are annoying elements, and part of the invincible superhero aspects are grating.<br />I enjoy the Mystara RPG game materials, the setting background, and fantasy writing in general, but this series did not meet my expectations for quality writing and consistency with the setting.	2001-08-13

It provides for political soldiers, gladiators, oratory before the Senate, street thugs in the capitol city, witches, and priests for all the ectsasy cults and Roman gods. It is set in a low magic background as are all the historical settings but the magical details are great including the three witch spells it includes (dream curses, love charms and protective amulets).	2001-05-07

This is not 3rd edition but the original game. It contains a more straightforward set of rules and character options than advanced D&amp;D had, leaving less room for imbalanced power abuses. This set covers character levels 4-11 (I think that is the top end of this set) and expands on the setting to include more wilderness adventuring. It contains character info for the higher levels including spells for MUs and clerics. It also has quality sections on new monsters and magic items.	2001-04-23

It is designed for high level PCs, features the Archmage Tenser, planar travel, the crook of Rao, a jungle setting, a few new jungle shaman type spells, and the biggest ape in any D&amp;D module ever.<br />Some of the pregenerated PCs show up in the rebuilt council  of eight in the second edition greyhawk module featuring Tenser's return. The crook of Rao is also used later in the setting series to turn the Greyhawk setting from apocalyptic and evilly oppresive in the _From The Ashes_ boxed set to the more standard fantasy atmosphere present in the end of the 2nd edition Greyhawk  products and the current 3rd edition base setting.	2001-04-23

It contains very powerful monsters, some of which are useable in any setting, some of which could easily be ported into any desert campaign and many which are just bizaare and tough but appropriate for dark sun. The Greater and lesser elementals (along with the spells for summoning them) are the most portable elements and should have been included in the core series of monsters and spells. On the other end of the spectrum are the ash golem made from defiling magic and the answer to what happens to dwarves in Athas who die deviating from their foci.<br />In Dark Sun, land of desert where there is high magic but no metal, things are bigger, badder, and usually psionic to boot and this is reflected in the critters included in this compendium.	2001-04-23

This is a 2nd Edition D&amp;D compendium of extraplanar monsters from  the fiends of the lower planes to the angelic but powerful minions of the higher planes and plenty of just plain wierd critters from the odd bits of the D&amp;D universe. Demons and Devils  are renamed Tanari and Baatezu but the descriptions of them and their society are the best you are going to get in any D&amp;D product. In 2nd edition all outer planar creatures were removed from the core compendiums, until this came out and then they were reintroduced a little with the last release of the monstrous compendium, this however is the only source to in depth cover them and their hierarchies providing a solid framework to guide in using the creatures.<br />Highly recommended for anyong using 2nd edition rules or those using 3rd who want information on planar creatures beyond their combat stats.	2001-04-23

It uses a level system and magic is well developed and has great flavor. This captures the feel of tolkien and of RPGs well. I would recommend it for anybody who enjoys RPGs and either wants to use middle earth (there are many quality supplements though most are out of print)or new material to incorporate into an existing RPG (as I have done with the material in this product).	2001-04-13

It is the second volume of the Monstrous compendium, after this volume they were all appendixes. It contains monsters that were not as basic as the ones in the first volume but that are still supposed to be applicable to any basic D&amp;D world as opposed to the world/setting specific appendixes. It comes in a three ring binder format with each monster taking up one or two pages. This allows individual monsters to be taken out for use if you don't want to lug around the entire massive volume. The art is great and the monster descriptions are incredible, going into details about physical desriptions, culture, habitat, habits and charachteristics of each creature (as opposed to just combat stats as in 3rd edition).<br />For descriptions of D&amp;D creatures the second edition monstrous compendium series can not be beat.<br />The 2nd edition	2001-04-10

This adventure has some of the best roleplaying death traps I have ever seen in an RPG product. They are all deadly regardless of game mechanics, and are true challenges, meaning they can be figured out and overcome. In the scenario each character must face a different one alone without any aid and progress on to the next challenge.<br />I would recomment this for any RPG as the challenges and ideas can be effortlessly applied to any game and the challenges are real and doable.	2001-04-10

In particular it deals with Castle forlorn and its temporal anomalies. It deals with Goblyns and ghosts, and background history on ravenloft's druids and the magical powers that occasionaly arise in redheaded individuals.<br />Not the best ravenloft supplement but it does deal with this core domain as it has never been dealt with before or since.<br />The redheaded individual information is also available in an abbreviated form in the third part of Van Richtens monster hunter's compendium volume three.<br />This product is for those wishing to use the ghost castle as an adventure site either in ravenloft or plunked down in any roleplaying campaign.

Maztica is a central american Aztec type setting  dominated by a Jaguar war god who demands lots of sacrifices. The setting covers a continent sized area across the ocean and west of the main realms continent. There is a trilogy of novels and a trilogy of modules that support the setting.<br />The Jaguar and eagle knights (magic using warrior kits) and the corresponding Talon and Pluma magic are intersting as are the pseudo mesoamerican gods who are not covered in the faiths and avatars or powers and pantheons products.<br />This product is probably best for those who wish to own the complete 2nd edition Forgotten Realms world settings (along with the core boxed set, the Horde campaign set, Al-Quadim, and Kara Tur) or those wishing a central american type setting for 2nd edition D&amp;D.	2001-03-30

It is designed for mid leel adventuerers.<br />I liked this adventure because it focused on a non-lord villain and was easily tied into _Touch of Death_ another adventure involving mummies which is designed for lower level parties. Also it made use of information from Van Richten's guide to Ancient Dead.<br />Unfortunately Nova Vaasa and its lord have some of the worst consistency problems of all of the Ravenloft settings and characters. Its lord has yet another background and description in awakening (making 5different backgrounds and descriptions in separate products, each incompatible with the others) and the realm is described as having five moons in this product.	2001-03-30

In this adventure Soth has deteriorated a lot so everything is less powerful than it used to be making this only appropriate for low level characters as written but it still seems to have interesting components and a well done out demonstration of party progress that can build suspense for the climax of the adventure, which again provides the DM with an opportunity for the party to exit ravenloft.	2001-03-30

This series takes stock gothic monster types and demonstrates how monsters can be individualized and backstories created for better effect in a ravenloft or other RPG game.<br />It takes the perspective of the investigator Van Ricten's guide book to hunter's including his experiences and those of his contemporaries with game statistic information separately blocked off.<br />This volume focuses on mummies, undead creatures generally brought back to guard crypt areas and with disease powers.<br />I was expecting more from this volume, I particularly found it lacking in the realm of magic and spells, either for use by the greater mummies, Mummy hunting, or mummy creation. I also would have preferred more on curses to protect the realms of the dead. However, it is a good series and this volume has some neat points and back stories that can be used in games easily for good background or atmosphere.	2001-03-30

There is a novel trilogy based on this setting and the mongol type hordes that live there. There is also a trilogy of modules based on this product and setting.<br />The boxed set covers a vast geographic area (roughly small continent sized)and so does not get as specific as smaller focused products. It does go into depth about the Tuigan people and culture.<br />Probably best for having the complete overview of the official realms along with the products for the areas described above and Matica if a complete world overview is desired. Also useul if a DM plans on having a party actually travel to or from Kara Tur and the normal realms.	2001-03-29

It contains a great section on the effects of magic on economies and how this impacts a roleplaying setting realisitically.<br />All the magic items in the book can be created using the spells in the book and it includes a system for rating the power of the items in levels.<br />It also includes non magical treasures such as gems (with tons of charts and descriptions) and supernatural materials from the well known mithril and adamant to the not so well known laen, eyog and black alloy.<br />Unfortunately the proofreading was very poor on this book.<br />Similar to a GURPS supplement, this is well thought out, useful for behind the scenes use in running a role playing game providing ideas on how to make the background rolepalying world make sense and have some flavor. It is easily adaptable to most game systems including D&amp;D, GURPS and of course Rolemaster or MERP.	2000-12-29

Now it is based on necromancy and recovering its lost arcane  knowledge and power. A great reason to go explore old dungeons.  it  provides new spells for the eight colleges in AD&amp;D and required  specilist wizards classes which have neat powers but are signigficantly  reduced in spell choices compared to normal wizards. The common minor  magical items and the mass use of animated dead in society for physical  labor are great.<br />It also contains limited information on the invading  barbarians who hate all magic users and are detailed in the other Jakandor  supplement Island of War.	2000-08-11

Very useful for turning  the full VTM world into gurps or for adding stuff to a normal gurps world.	2000-08-08

The mad lands are dominated by arbitrary  harsh gods,  intensely powerful magical creatures and curses for every failing that turn  people into horrific monsters (skinless, headless, etc.). Nothing is  settled or secure and death jumps out everywhere, luck can be the most  valuable survival trait.<br />The mad lands are somewhat similar to the  nightmare lands in TSR's 1st edition Ravenloft campaign setting.<br />Not that  even though it is labeled Fantasy II it seems to have nothing to do with  Gurps Fantasy or the Fantasy setting in Gurps Fantasy I.<br />Characters are  hunter gatherers with no swords and armor and magic is considered a  killable offense.<br />A very different setting from the norm.	2000-08-08

It creates classes of psionicists for each group of psionic  powers that it comes up with and powers are done out in points and levels  and are generally underpowered compared with the tsr and net versions.  However they are good for a more medieval flavor than tsr and for  increasing variety in powers.	2000-08-02
US	51353735	R2K5538FVLQ8P9	1574570072	329864464	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Rpg	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Mutant animal RPG	This was a fun RPG. Lots of different animals turned human like.  The animal system is balanced giving roughly the same power for mice as  elephants as they change to be more human like. Small animals have points  to change with, growing in size and becoming more human like and gain  animal powers while big animals just have their size to give up. However,  none start with animal powers/senses/features so these must be purchased  leading to weird designs like elephant characters being small if they have  a trunk, tusks and a thick hide.   Unfortunately the TMNT themselves can't  conform to the rules and it is very easy to create characters that would  trash them and their enemies with no problem.	2000-08-02

No  mutants or magic in this one just a lot of walking around getting shot at  and blowing things up.	2000-08-02

For higher level characters it had a  vampire deception, reality bending scenarios and others.<br />If you can get  your hands on it, it is a good supplement	2000-08-01
US	51353735	R3I11CMOZEZH6K	1555602827	482451769	Magic: A Manual of Mystic Secrets	Books	5	4	4	N	N	great magic supplement	This is another great FASA magic supplement, designed for Earthdawn but useful for inspiring spell ideas in D&amp;D as well.  Earthdawn's magic system is one of the best in RPGs for the ideas  governing how magic works  and the execution of the spells as game materials with great flavor.<br />Even  if you don't use the Earthdawn system I would get the magic supplements  (this, arcane mysteries of barsaive, earthdawn[the basic game] and  earthdawn companion)for the quality materials that they are and adapt them  to the system you use.	2000-08-01
US	51353735	R3C48S98XV18UL	156076127X	632708399	Ship of Horror (AD&D 2nd Ed Fantasy Roleplaying, Ravenloft Setting, RA2)	Books	3	6	6	N	N	2nd ravenloft module	A good ravenloft adventure with curses, undead, dark magic and sea travel. It was the second ravenloft module and continues the Grand conjunction series of undead adventures this time dealing with Ghosts.<br />It can be  inserted easily into any campaign where the group chooses to or needs to  travel somewhere by sea.<br />However it does require lots of work on the part  of the DM to flesh out significant parts, one central section just has lots  of adversaries with family relationships done out but no stats, no maps, no  significant use of their unique powers and scant plot outline. one section  is set underwater but no provision for allowing the party to do so is  provided if they do not already have the appropriate magic.<br />There are  good base elements provided and many parts are well designed and can be run  straight as written. I found it a fun game to run after reworking it.	2000-08-01
