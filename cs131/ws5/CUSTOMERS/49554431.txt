It's a system which  gives maximum readability and minimum flicking back and forth to check the  meaning of words and phrases - ideal for the student.	2000-05-19

Ignore this: the best part of the book is the middle, where a Winnebago trickster  story plus a few others are included, supposedly in full. If you believe  Radin's description of collecting the myths (got them from an informant,  translated by two more informants and 'tidied up' by him), then they seem  to be pretty much OK.. certainly nothing obvious has been left out, as  self-mutilation, genitals, and jolly exploits with faeces are still in  there.

It won't teach you much about the theory behind  ragtime guitar, but it does a good job of pointing out the relevant parts  in the solos so that, hopefully, you'll absorb it by osmosis. And it works!  Well, sort of. Whether you end up able to improvise ragtime guitar or not,  you'll certainly know a hell of a lot of licks to amaze any old folks who  may happen to remember one of the ragtime revivals. (Plus, you'll be  prepared for the next one). Recommended.	2000-05-19

Starting with licks, progressing to (very) simple songs and eventually getting into complete  (but simplified) solos as recorded by greats like Tampa Red and Robert  Johnson, it even has a small section on slide guitar in standard tuning  (for wimps, of course).

The  story progresses much as you think it might, and the ending isn't anything  unexpected, but where this book really shines is in characterising the  obsessed fan. His exquisitely kooky personality comes through in every word  he writes, in his casual arrogance, the way he puts some phrases in  apostrophes as though they hadn't passed into common use hundreds of years  ago.. he'd be perfectly at home on alt.usenet.kooks.	2000-05-19

Then this book isn't for you. <br />Medievalists, SCA  members, fashion designers, and novelists looking for a little added  authenticity in their old-timey stories will probably find this fascinating  and indeed useful - because this is a very practically-oriented book,  helpfully divided into sections covering general pointers on dyeing, plus  specific chapters for 'reds, purples, blues,' 'yellows, golds, oranges,'  and 'browns, blacks' - you WILL be able to use this to dye clothing,  assuming you can come by the raw material. <br />Others, however, will most  likely feel _Ancient Dyes for Modern Weavers_ to be not so much bad as  pointless.	2000-05-17

All of these are engrossing enough on their own, but the heart  of the book, taking up almost half of the pages, is a section called  'Dinosaurs Identified' - a meticulous catalogue of all known dinosaur  families and their genera. Like the rest of the book, it's generously  illustrated with black-and-white pictures that are clean and elegant.  <br />Perfect for reading from cover to cover, paging through in the bathroom,  or pulling down from the shelf to settle arguments (assuming you and your  friends are as nerdy as me and mine).	2000-05-17

And  you'd be right: nothing ever seems to please Larkin quite so much as  old-school big band or dixieland, and he's not afraid to say so. Still,  he's a good writer and all, so if you're looking for a collection of jazz  reviews from the 60s written by a slightly stuffy guy who never really got  over Woody Herman, this is the book for you.	2000-05-17

As the story progresses,  his revelations (about his family life, his history, his relationship with  the Bomb) swing between totally bizarre to tragically plausible; Hino's  genius is that with every new revelation, our conception of the character  and his insanity turns itself inside out - which, by the end of the story,  has shattered all the reader's assumptions, leaving only an unidentifiable,  almost primeval dread.<br />The work hasn't been mirrored - you turn pages and  read from right to left. Some might find this a little awkward for the  first few pages, but it does allow us to see the layout and artwork as Hino  intended - i.e., idiosynchratic (I like it), striking, and often incredibly  gory. It's horrible, but it expresses the central obsession of the  narrator, the ghastly legacy of the atomic bomb, extremely effectively.  Recommended.	2000-05-16

This book is an admirable attempt to summarise the campaign against the comics in Britan, which actually led to them being banned.<br />The comics themselves (of which three are reproduced  in full and many others in part) seem almost quaint now; the campaigners  seem as silly as their intellectual descendents do today. The work is  well-structured and never dull, but the writing lets it down a bit -  there's a weird undergraduate feel throughout. Still, worth a look for  comic book or pop culture fans.	2000-05-16

It's very depressing, but then, evidence of society at large's complete backwardness and bigotry always is.	2000-05-16

It's little-known in the  English-speaking world, largely because of the lack of a good, faithful  translation, and this edition is obviously intended to remedy the  situation.<br />It's a worthy goal, and the translation itself is lively and  fluid without straying too far from its Germanic roots. The story itself is  a good read, which moves too quickly from scene to scene to ever get  boring. The trickster hero more or less devotes his life to deflating the  pompous, the rich, the smug, the petty, and anyone else who dares obstruct  his merry path through life. He does this largely by interpreting  figurative or idiomatic phrases literally, like an infuriating younger  sibling, but there are a good many tales that centre around more complex  and witty scams, and it's these which make the book worth considering as a  read. And, like other books in the _World's Classics_ series, the  introductory essay is broad-ranging and stimulating. <br />It's not  _Gulliver's Travels_ or _The Decameron_, but it's a very respectable cousin  to both.	2000-05-15

Less pretentious than Ferlenghetti and more perceptive than Ginsberg, his poems are like modern haiku, brilliant observations and juxtapositions that  somehow manage to express what most artists simply cannot.<br />_Earth House  Home_ is a collection of Snyder's prose, which happily enjoys the same  distinction. It's an eclectic mix, with journal excerpts that read more  like rough notes for poetry; book reviews that illuminate their subjects  from unexpected angles; an account of day-to-day life at a Zen temple in  Kyoto; and more, concluding with my favourite section, an almost Joycean  account of Snyder's views on society and culture.<br />Get this, any way you  can. You won't regret it. Also recommended for those just discovering  Synder: _No Nature_, a 'collected works' of sorts.	2000-05-15

Glen Baxter is a true breath of fresh air; his single-frame cartoons are always original and often so funny they can reduce readers to tears. The style is old-school, and wouldn't be out of place in a Boy's Own Annual  circa 1930, with cowboys, swashbucklers, vintage private schoolchildren and  more all represented. The real humour comes from the captions, which put  phrases like &quot;We don't hold with post-structuralist analysis around  here&quot; in the mouths of cowboys and imbue schoolboys with creepy,  sinister motives.<br />This collection is all a fan of cartooning or indeed of  humour could ask for.

But Max Dublin's relentless attack on just about every aspect of &quot;futurology&quot; is a little too  depressing for my tastes. So Buckminster Fuller's inventions won't change  the world - isn't there room for dreamers in our society? <br />The solution,  perhaps, lies somewere between what Dublin says andhow things are: we need  people prepared to guess at what the future might be like and how it could  be better than today, but we also need to recognise that everything these  people say is just an educated guess, at best, and not a foregone  conclusion. <br />At any rate, the writing is tight and the argument is  certainly worth a look, but you might find the leaden tone a little  offputting.	2000-05-15

Instead, it's very much in the autobiographical genre, taking a gently inoffensive  look at his meteoric rise to .. well, wherever he was. The writing is  fairly witty and fresh, and towards the end he does make some pointed  remarks about where journalism is today, but unless you're really  interested in the man behind the self-satisfied smirk, this book probably  isn't for you.	2000-05-15

But really, as far as literary descriptions go, this is  about as comprehensive as &quot;Finnegan's Wake is about this guy who's  having a dream.&quot; The book's more like a kaleidoscope of American  (specifically black) culture, leaving nothing out.<br />The quality of the  writing can't be denied, and it's so full of brilliant images and ideas  that it'll leave your head buzzing.	2000-05-14

The age of the  stories ranges from the earliest SF to the 1960s, which limits the scope of  the book somewhat since great changes have occurred in the genre since  1970.<br />The quality of the writing is far from inspiring, but the case it  argues is sound and rather persuasive. Not essential for every SF fan, but  certainly worth a look.	2000-05-14

Although it's definitely rooted in the American teen experience, the embarrassment of adolescence seems to be pretty much universal (in the  English-speaking world at least), so this book is sure to strike a few  chords no matter where you're from. Appealing illustrations round out the  package. Recommended.	2000-05-14

Ranging from laugh-out-loud funny to non-schmaltzy poignance, this is Will  Ferguson at his best: dismantling myth piece by piece to give us a better  view of what really lies at Canada's heart.<br />A Canadian himself, Will  decries Canadian 'niceness', skewers Canadian attitudes towards America,  despairs at the country's politics, and (in my favourite section) takes a  merciless and hilarious look at Canadian popular culture. He doesn't hate  Canadians - he loves them, and it shows.<br />Beautifully written, insightful,  touching, and entertaining, this book should be read by everyone interested  in what nationhood really means.	2000-05-14

It's more or less an attempt to update the Bardo Thodol for the modern (lazy) man. There's more here than there seems to be at first, but  if the prospect of introductions by John Lilly and RAW doesn't excite you,  then the book probably won't either.	2000-05-14

Need more persuading? Okay, how about visual art: all of the lyrics are typeset in innovative and  original ways that really bring out the spirit of the music, and there are  rough, striking illustrations of many of the artists represented in this  work (which, incidentally, includes just about anyone you can think  of).<br />An unexpected but very welcome addition is the final section,  entitled 'A Survey of Sorts: Various Voices', which has quotes from  everyone from Basho to Blind Blake on the nature of poetry and melancholy.  <br />This book is truly unique among lyric collections, well presented and  full of surprises. Get it if you're even remotely interested in music.	2000-05-14

This book, which looks at the nature of women's speech (focusing mainly on conversation in medium-sized  groups), is no different. It's liberally dotted with actual transcribed  examples, and the analysis is generally very sound - although Coates does  have a tendency to romanticise things, denying that women's talk (and  indeed friendship) can be anything other than completely equitable and  non-hierarchical. <br />This is an academic book, but Coates' fondness for the  topic is obvious. A very good read, although non-linguists might find it  heavy going.	2000-05-14

Get a copy now, before they become valuable - and they will, believe me, because this book is fantastic.<br />The book covers Will Ferguson's experiences in  Katimavik, a Canadian youth program which lets young adults work and travel  around Canada, expanding their horizons and hopefully turning them into  fine upstanding Canadians. His trademark brand of sardonic humour is in  fine form throughout, and he does an excellent job of portraying the other  people in his Katimavik group, from the arrogant boy from Quebec to the  good-hearted but criminal-minded guy who joined Katimavik on court's  orders.<br />Yes, they sound like caricatures, but it's obvious that they're  based on real people, and it's the sympathy and skill with which their  interaction is recorded which makes this book so great. It's a unique and  unmissable work, beautifully combining travel journalism, autobiography,  and sharp observation into a brilliant whole. Get it now!	2000-05-14

Most of them are just a couple of pages long, and a good many are  not so much stories as remarks, but the whole thing is endlessly  engrossing. Anyone interested in mythology or in Japan should own this.  I've never read another book that does what this one does so elegantly and  comprehensively.	2000-05-13

When you're Stephen Fry, though, a 'comedown' book can still be better than most of what's out  there.<br />The eponymous Hippopotomas is Ted Wallace, a cantankerous theatre  critic who drinks too much, and his skeptical investigations into  'miraculous' goings-on at his old friend's mansion in the country. That's  the plot, really; it doesn't sound like much, but the characters pull it  off (for which see below). It's a lot more straightforward than _The Liar_,  very much in the mystery genre with clues sprinkled throughout which are  tied together at the end in a maddeningly logical way that will have you  kicking yourself - unless you're more observant than me and actually figure  it out yourself, of course.<br />While this book is very, very funny and very,  very readable - stamped with Fry through and through - I will say that it  didn't engage me emotionally the way most of his other work does. That's  okay, though; it did engage me on an intellectual level, and the writing  itself is a treat. One reviewer has called it 'fruity', and I can't think  of a better word; it'll have you wanting to read out loud, just to savour  the phrasing.<br />Much has been made of this book's &quot;shocking&quot;  nature, but most broad-minded adults should be OK with it; it does include  a lot of graphic sex of various descriptions (including bestiality), but  never of a gratuitous nature (I know it might seem hard to imagine  un-gratuitous bestiality, but trust me) and certainly never in a way that  resembles pornography - except as satire, possibly.<br />It's definitely not  for kids aged 4-8, though - let's hope Amazon fix this soon!	2000-05-13

Those interested in international pop music will probably also find it worthwhile. <br />I would have liked to see a little more analysis of  the actual music, but that's really my only negative comment - and the  chapter which breaks down a juju performance piece by piece is one of the  finest works of ethnomusicology I've had the pleasure to read.	2000-05-13

It's obvious that this has been cobbled together  from a few different sources, but anyone after fastidious consistency in a  book of blues songs is a bit odd. <br />There are a few songs here that don't  seem to be many other places, and the piano arrangements are, for the most  part, simple and ready for ornamentation and adaptation to other  instruments. Worth getting if you're a blues fan.	2000-05-13

It's an interesting idea, to be sure, but the problem is that with all the other  great books about Elvis' afterlife out there (I like Greil Marcus' one),  once the thesis is stated the argument seems a little irrelevant. Still,  what's there is well-researched and there are a few tidbits you might not  find elsewhere. 'Who Did He Say That He Was?' is my favourite chapter,  focusing on what Elvis himself believed about religion and his place in  it.<br />For Elvis fans, kitsch collectors, and people who want to start their  own religion.	2000-05-13

This is a collection of essays and interviews from Sirius' considerable writing career, jumping from recent years to the  mid-eighties and back again. Some of the pieces are humorous, some  philosophical, some just stupid (some all three). The whole thing's very  firmly rooted in the psychedelic-cyberpunk literary scene, and some of the  pieces really fall flat, but the ones that work are brilliant. A great  collection overall.	2000-05-13

This book isn't for the squeamish, but if you  like Acker, Coover, Pynchon, Borges, or the short stories of David Foster  Wallace, you'll probably enjoy it. It's definitely a horizon-broadener.	2000-05-13

I don't regret the decision (after all, it  only cost $2), but it was a big disappointment after _Alien_. It's along  the same lines - unconnected vignettes of observation poking gentle fun at  the English - but just doesn't have the same spark. For Mikes fans only, I  would say.	2000-05-13

It's not something you'll devour in  one sitting, but if you have an interest in the underbelly of pop culture  (whether or not you believe the theories themselves), you'll come back to  it again and again. <br />The standard of writing is actually surprisingly  high; this isn't like the garbled photocopies that guy in the park hands  out. There's work here by Carl Oglesby, Jim Keith, and Robert Anton Wilson  (his piece is actually a bit tired and disappointing, but oh well), and  genuinely interesting interviews with Jack Hoffman and Kerry Thornley  (among others). Overall, worth having on the bookshelf.	2000-05-13

This book is the conceptual if not the chronological follow-up to 'How to Make Love to a Negro', and shares many of the same traits: it's oddly written, occasionally infuriating, and defiantly un-PC. Basically a series  of loosely connected vignettes about America, success, race, and sex, it  doesn't sound very unique but the writing puts it ahead of the pack -  great, weird journalism, in the tradition of Hunter S. Thompson. It's not  essential by any means, but it is worthwhile and it certainly shouldn't be  out of print.	2000-05-13

Anyone even remotely interested in folklore, folk music, or American  history should get this book. It contains over 400 rhymes (some with music)  collected in the early 1900s by Thomas W. Talley, a black chemistry  professor from Tennessee. Most of the rhymes are American, but there are a  few from Africa, Jamaica, and elsewhere.<br />This alone would be worth the  price of admission, but this edition also contains a new essay on the work,  plus an updated bibliography and index, plus the original introduction by  Thomas W. Talley (an excellent 50-page essay which covers performance  practice and even details of instrument construction), plus additional  rhymes and music that didn't make it into the original edition.<br />Great to  page idly through or to read cover-to-cover, this book would be a fantastic  addition to anyone's collection.	2000-05-13

Alli's thoughts on the nature of ritual are  iconoclastic (to put it mildly), but that's why I like him: when you read a  book by Alli, you're entering territory that few other (published) authors  have even sighted.

It's well-researched and makes some very intriguing points about science in  general, but if you have no patience for geology you probably won't get  that far - it's nowhere near as accessible as his essay collections, but  that's only to be expected.

It's neither new-age saccharine nor knee-jerk nihilistic, and offers a fresh take on a range of major American literary  themes - the immigrant experience (both legal and illegal), family,  landscape and character, history and memory, the Depression - as well as  looking at a few less common ones, like ageing. <br />The book falters a  little towards the middle, but quickly picks up again. (This is the only  reason I don't give it five stars, by the way). It does take quite a few  risks with structure, but all of them pay off, making it a truly unique and  eminently readable book that you won't forget in a hurry.	2000-05-13

He fails. The best that can be said about this book is that it is a  good insight into Naimy's mind, with half-baked anticapitalism, stupid  comments on science, and smug self-satisfaction included. (Not that I'm  against self-satisfied nonscientific anticapitalists, you understand, but I  prefer it when they have a cogent position and can write well enough to  express it).<br />If you think you can read passages like 'Verily, Man is the  darling of the Universe. All things are glad to pamper him' or 'All orders  of being below Man are enclosed in group ova . . . always the more evolved  enclosing all the orders of Life below it down to the central nucleus' and  still think that the author is wiser than you, then go right ahead and get  this book.

My favourite invention has a dog running on a conveyor belt, surrounded by four armed guards so that he does not run away!<br />Get this book, any way you can.

It takes a similar approach, looking at the history, sociology, tradition and musical nature of the Shona mbira (also  known as the kalimba, sanzhi, likembe, or 'thumb piano' - though after you  hear Paul's comments on the latter name, you won't want to use it again).  <br />Other musical instruments by the Shona are also covered, but to a much  lesser degree. The section on performance is nice, but it is the part which  suffers most from 'dancing about architecture' syndrome. <br />The appendix on  'building and playing your own mbira' is informative, but unless you have  access to an anvil and fire, not very practical! It isn't hard to modify  the design and make your own anyway, though, it just won't be as  traditional.	2000-05-13
