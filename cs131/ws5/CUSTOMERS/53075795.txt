In fact, if Bloom has the final say about Faulkner in the canon, it's probably \\"As I Lay Dying\\" that makes the cut.  A shame, because as nifty and tidy a novel as that dark comedy about language and consciousness is, it's not as representative of Faulkner's towering genius as either \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" or \\"Absalom! Absalom!\\"<br /><br />Before writing \\"Absalom,\\" Faulkner himself made it clear that \\"S & F\\" was his greatest accomplishment, an inspired and \\"ecstatic\\" adventure in language against which the later \\"As I Lay Dying\\" and \\"Light in August\\" paled into far more commonplace, deliberately-plotted narratives.  Caddy's muddy drawers represented the resplendent moment that Faulkner thereafter tried but in his own mind failed to recapture.<br /><br />In this exceptional instance, an author's words about his literary children are to be taken seriously.  Nothing in American literature quite matches the sheer exhilaration and extemporaneousness of Quentin's chapter, which documents the final day of a suicidal teenager yet ends in rhetoric as thunderous as the sermons in \\"Portrait of an Artist\\" and \\"Moby Dick.\\"  The daunting words are those of Quentin's father, and they resonate even more powerfully in Quentin's and the reader's mind than the ominous charge the ghost lays upon Hamlet.<br /><br />Like Hamlet, Quentin's world is threatening to disintegrate because of the failures of parents.  But whereas Hamlet resists the heroic in favor of a realistic assessment of life's fragility, Quentin clings to the Chalice and his ideals as a defence against mutability.  And whereas Hamlet imagines he has to deal with \\"incestuous sheets,\\" Quentin actually supplies the incest theme to insure his actions can unfold in a context no less heroic than Hamlet's or Oedipus'.<br /><br />Unlike these latter heroes, who fixate our attention, Quentin's consciousness surrounds us, drawing us into its contents.  We identify not only with Quentin but Caddy and Benjy.  All three are  the child in all of us, seeking reassurances and guidance in the face of loss, real and imagined.  And most readers who have lived long enough to experience disillusionment will simultaneously identify with Mr. Compson, so well-intentioned, so capable of providing the children the strength they need, yet so paralyzed by his own Hamlet-like obsession with death and dissolution.<br /><br />Quentin may repeatedly invoke Macbeth's \\"walking shadow,\\" and the novel's title may echo that same play, but this is story that rivals \\"Hamlet\\" in its forcefulness, vitality, and inexhaustibility.t no less heroic than Hamlet's or Oedipus'.<br /><br />Unlike these latter heroes, who fixate our attention, Quentin's consciousness surrounds us, drawing us into its contents.

And of course the only  palatable title--\\"My Fifty Favorite\\"--probably wouldn't sell any books let alone spark any conversations.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with the first 4 on the list--except with their order.  If Rizzo's main criterion is keyboard command and forceful swing, then Oscar's lofty place can remain unchallenged.  But if his aesthetic includes a depth and complexity of expression equal to the greatest composers--Bartok, Debussy, Shostakovich--Bill Evans belongs on top.  If harmonic legerdemain deserves extra weight, put Art at the pinnacle; or for complex melodic-rhythmic lines on the level of Bird, give the nod to Bud.<br /><br />After the number 4 position, Rizzo merely exposes the problems of a ranking like this, let alone the gaps in his (or any individual listener's) knowledge and listening experience.  Monty Alexander belongs on the list--but in the number 5 position?  (I have a hunch he'd be personally embarassed to find himself 19 places above Nat Cole.)  And Benny Green and Andre Previn at 5 and 6?  Or for that matter Erroll Garner in a lowly 25 slot?  Worse, the seminal Earl Hines all the way down in 39?  (More understandable if the author's exposure to the father of jazz piano is limited to post '75 recordings.)  At least he gets Billy Taylor right.<br /><br />The author plays it safe by pulling out a couple of comparative obscurities--Tete Montoliu and Derek Smith.  But anyone can play that game.  I would insist that any short list ought to include Carl Perkins. As for the \\"honorable mentions,\\" where's Dave Catney?  There's a list of women pianists, but where are Pat Moran, Ellyn Rucker, and Alice McCleod (Coltrane)?  (At least Terry Pollard gets a mention.)<br /><br />The bios tend to be general and aimed at the uninitiated.  There are no attempts to \\"justify\\" the ranking of each pianist or to provide disclosure of the contributors to those rankings.  Overall, a handsome coffee-table book.

His zeal and self-righteous certitude along with its widespread appeal must severely test the credulity of any reader who remembers the Court's partisan politics in determining the winner of the 2000 Presidential election. But nothing less than a thoroughly conservative, orthodox, fixedly fundamentalist mandate will satisfy the author, whose fire is stoked by any opportunity to deplore the decline of society due to \\"activist,\\" \\"liberal\\" readings of law that deviate from some imagined inviolable blueprint.<br /><br />Even as some of us as teachers struggle to empower our students to become closely engaged and \\"active\\" readers, Levin would make the reading of a text such as the Constitution the passive reception of an absolute, static document that somehow announces its own \\"objective\\" meanings in a vacuum.  Unfortunately, all reading/interpretation is subjective and personal just as all texts are contextual and responsive to the changing meanings that readers necessarily bring to them.  Any reading is an interpretation, and any interpretation is subject to the biases of the interpreter and the community that he represents.  To pretend otherwise is to arrogate the law onto oneself.  Supreme Court justices serve both the law and the commonweal best when they exercise their judgments with a profound sense of humility--acknowledging the \\"constructed\\" nature of all \\"law\\" and the fallibility of the human beings entrusted to interpret it.	2005-09-03

Readers familiar with James Joyce's \\"The Dead\\" may recall the earth-shaking, redemptive epiphany of Gabriel in the last two paragraphs of the novelette (I usually work through the paragraphs with students sentence by sentence if not word by word as he keeps oscillating back and forth, making us wait until the final word of the story before, like Dante at the end of \\"The Paradiso\\" attaining the glimpse of the force or power of grace that shatters his pride and unites him with all humanity.  Faulkner offers a similar critical moment to Rev. Gail Hightower in the penultimate chapter of \\"Light and August\\"--but with a different result.  As I grow older, that moment, its universality and present applicability loom ever larger in personal consciousness, making me question my own life and motives--am I still clinging to the outdated, Romantic and enchanted notion of heroic but highly problematic chivalry, dominance and fame?  or have I learned to renounce, completely and irrevocably, the white Knight fantasy that once seduced me into regarding it as a worthy model?  (Considering for a moment three other prototypal protagonists in American literature and film--Jay Gatsby, Willie Loman, and Charles Foster Kane--they all come to the end no more self-enlightened than they were doing the periods of their greatest, but adolescent and ultimately destructive, self-delusions.)<br /><br />At first I was skeptical of Oprah's recent choice of a third Faulkner novel, since \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" would have introduced readers to not only Faulkner's masterpiece but perhaps the \\"Great American Novel.\\"  Upon second thought, \\"Light in August\\" makes a lot of sense.  It's more accessible even than \\"Sound and the Fury\\" and \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" with an action-packed, frequently suspenseful multiple-threaded plot.  In the character of Joe Christmas, moreover, the novel begins to confront the inescapable, universal yet personal, questions of race that \\"Absalom\\" explores with the introduction of the Octoroon.  Moreover, the novel's plotting is likely to \\"hook\\" the majority of readers until that challenging penultimate chapter, at which point no reader in his right mind would dare quit on the story.<br /><br />Suspicions to the contrary, Faulkner doesn't waste words, and the reader must have in the back of his mind the early reference to Hightower's sermons about a cavalry officer being shot off his horse.  That officer comes to life in Hightower's astonishing climactic epiphany (perhaps rivaled only by Gabriel Conroy's vision at the end of Joyce's \\"The Dead), offering the reader a penetrating glimpse not only of the character but of Faulkner's theme and moral purpose.  If \\"Light in August\\" lacks the epic sweep of \\"Absalom,\\" along with the intense interior monologues of the female characters, it offers what might be considered Faulkner's most \\"theological\\" view of a fallen but redeemable humanity.<br /><br />Highly debatable is the question of Hightower's \\"salvation.\\"  Even as readers, we may feel that we along with Hightower deserve some sure sign of the character's redemption.  Flannery O'Connor, for example, satisfies the reader's needs in ways that are not the concern of the \\"Dixie Express\\" (O'Connor's admiring characterization of Faulkner's unassailable genius). There would be no problem whatsoever were it not for that final paragraph (if only I could erase it) alluding to the distant sound of galloping cavalry still resonating in Hightower's consciousness.  Is he reclaimed by his illusion or (the charitable construction) giving it up albeit grudgingly?  At least Faulkner doesn't leave us there.

For a depressive to change her reality, all she has to do is substitute new interpretations and constructions for her old, counter-productive readings of experience.<br /><br />Although Yapko tries to provide some balance, he essentially opposes biological, genetic, psychoanalytic, and even behaviorist approaches to depression.  Negative thinking isn't in your genes, your psyche, or the \\"external\\" world (though the environment influences its increasing hold on individuals): it's in you.  Consequently, Yapko reasons, you can control it if you follow his advice: stop thinking about yourself (self-consciousness leads to paralysis); avoid \\"global\\" thought (produces despair) in favor of concrete, practical thinking; forget about the past and direct your attentions to the individual's capacity to create the future.<br /><br />Yapko's advice, directives, and exercises will no doubt appeal to some readers more than others.  For those who suffer from occasional \\"down\\" time, or smoldering but mild \\"dysthymia,\\" the book could prove inspiriting if not inspiring.  Other readers will no doubt have a \\"that's easy for you to say\\" kind of reaction to this book.

No American author--not even Melville--has the potential to alter human consciousness as profoundly as Faulkner.  The \\"bait\\" may be sensational plots, seemingly grotesque characters, and Southern Gothic settings, but the reward is knowledge of the innermost workings of the mind, of both the self in the world and the world of self.  Faulkner is as advanced, as universal, as human as any author on the near side of Shakespeare.<br /><br />Oprah's three selections are inarguably indispensable though not sufficient to a complete understanding of Faulkner's vision.  Some readers may wish to start out with something lighter--for example, the short stories that are anthologized in introductory literature courses (\\"Rose for Emily,\\" \\"Barn Burning,\\" \\"That Evening Sun,\\" and \\"The Bear\\"--short edition).  And for those readers who jump right into the novels and survive the challenge of Faulkner's syntax, jump cuts, and stream-of-consciousness technique, there yet remains his masterpiece: \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\"<br /><br />In reading some of the previous reviews, I see there are a number of readers who either dismiss or condemn Faulkner in no uncertain terms.  Just give him a chance and your undivided attention.  I've witnessed high school students with little to no interest in reading come to life after participating in and constructing the meanings of \\"The Sound and the Fury.\\"  For those who have doubts that the pay-off is worth the effort, I'll offer a glimpse of the rewards.  Here are the areas where Faulkner has affected me most deeply and indelibly:<br /><br />1.  History and the personal sense of the past.  The present is always \\"filled\\" with the past and hence cannot be understood without a willingness to own the past--all of it.  On the other hand, many of Faulkner's characters remain entrapped by the past, simply unable to escape their imprisonment in a dream gone bad, or in a \\"magnificent idea\\" (the Grand Old South) that was tainted from the very beginning.<br /><br />2.  Gender.  Faulkner probes into the recesses of human consciousness, men and women.  His strong women characters outdo his strongest men in wisdom, resilience, and stoic backbone.  And just at the moment when we think we've got one of his characters figured out, he removes another layer of the outer persona, repeating the process until finally we've arrived at the inner sanctuary of a desire so  ineffably private and intense that it's as if the mystery of human personality itself has been bridged.<br /><br />3.  Race.  It's everybody's business, as no author has made clearer.  A reader who has completed these three novels along with \\"Go Down Moses\\" and the crucial \\"Absalom, Absalom!,\\" is unlikely to see race and color as before.  Every reader must \\"earn\\" the insight for themselves, but for Faulkner \\"blackness,\\" pure and simple, equates to \\"humanness.\\"  Color is less a marker than part of the human condition.  To insist on a pure ethnic or racial strain is to invite \\"incest,\\" Faulkner's metaphor for the terminal disease of racial pride and segregation.<br /><br />4.  Language.  This area is the most elusive for the general reader, but for Faulkner language is not only medium but subject and substance.  \\"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was made flesh.\\"  For Faulkner, language is what distinguishes humans from all other creatures.  It's not merely a \\"tool\\"; it's human consciousness itself.  Paradoxically, one of his most \\"alive\\" characters, Addie Bundren (\\"As I Lay Dying\\"), hates words because they seem inadequate to represent her desires.  The very expression of those desires refutes her aversion to words; in fact, the very force of her words (the language of a dead woman!) controls all that transpires in her story.<br /><br />If this is your first conversation with Faulkner, I almost envy you.

When Emmy's belly started drooping to the floor, swaying  awkwardly with every step, my son and daughter insisted I take her to a vet for diagnosis and, at the very least, some cosmetic surgery.  Nothing about this condition in the book (I even looked under \\"tummy tucks\\").  The vet assured me that it was a perfectly \\"normal\\" condition, especially in spayed domestic female short-hairs, and that surgery of any sort would be contra-indicated.  Is this information too much for a \\"dummy\\" reader of this book to expect to find?<br /><br />The same goes for a condition, variously referred to by vets as \\"excessive, or obsessive, grooming,\\" \\"self-mutilation,\\" and \\"psychogenic licking.\\"  When Emmy started tearing her hair out, I did the same trying to pull some enlightenment out of this book (this time I even looked under \\"baldness\\").  Again, the authors offered nothing on a condition so common my vet was able to hand me several fliers about it.<br /><br />Finally, the authors certainly haven't met my cat or they wouldn't be so sanguine about the prospects of getting a pill down such a creature.  They neglect to say that medications such as Prozac, Valium, and amitryptyline are now available in transdermal form (that's for the cat, not the owner).<br /><br />Emmy is once again beginning to look like a felicitous furry feline, but no thanks to this book.	2005-06-03

This book paints in broad strokes, characterizing religions quickly and melodramatically for the short-attention-span reader who wants to make a judgement call without excessive strain.  For Ridenhour, there's Orthodox Christianity, followed by 4 major religions, followed by 4 major cults, with Unitarianism foremost among them.  The reader who accepts the premise that Unitarianism is a cult may have greater difficulty swallowing the author's claim that \\"those who remain in Christian churches while holding [Unitarian] views are called 'Liberals'.\\"  Moreover, liberals \\"do not believe that the Bible is the Word of God\\" and also \\"deny the Christian doctrines.\\"<br /><br />So now we understand why the \\"L\\" word ranks only with the \\"N\\" word as a known but unmentionable word in the English language (though Ridenour's characterization of godless \\"humanists\\" may create a third taboo: the \\"H\\" word).  If the author were less zealous about covertly judging other religions, he might be in a position to make a compelling case for the \\"invisible\\" church founded on a God whose power and grace are made manifest in a lowly manger.<br /><br />The most engaging aspect of this \\"obvious,\\" biased book is trying to determine the author's personal religious agenda.  No major Protestant religions are discussed, but Luther comes off so well as a reformer and a man of integrity and faith that I'm going to guess the author is Lutheran (Mo. Synod or further to the right).  It becomes clear that he's no fan of all of the sacraments, creeds, and dogma of Roman Catholicism, yet he comes down strong on the side of one true catholic (the small \\"c\\" version of many Lutheran creeds) Christian faith.<br /><br />Three stars is overly generous, but my middle name is Luther.	2005-02-24

But what's most notable about Gollob's enthusiasm for Shakespeare is that he puts his finger on what the plays are all about: language.  Reading (and seeing) Shakespeare is not primarily about remembering plots, drawing concrete and fixed images of characters, or extracting nuggets of moral wisdom: it's all about spotting and being able to deal with \\"irony, antithesis, and ambiguity\\" (I would challenge him a bit on this last term.  Shakespeare's language is perpetually \\"in play\\" but not necessarily ambiguous).  If Gollob can get his students to buy such an approach, additionally making them comfortable with meanings that are not only elusive but constantly in motion and open to change, my hat's off to him as a teacher.  We could use many more like him in a culture that prefers fixed certainties in black and white.<br /><br />Where the late-arriving teacher falls a bit short, not as a teacher but a critic, is in his over-reliance on the \\"Western eye\\" (Camille Paglia's term for an Apollonian heroic perspective).  Hotspur, he tells us, is his favorite character in Henry IV,Pt.1, and moreover the play's great hero whereas Falstaff is a gross, cowardly drunk with little to no redeeming qualities.  Much of his evidence is based not on the language of the world's first great existentialist thinker but on the portly character's physical actions on stage (hauling Hotspur's corpse offstage).  What would we think, the author asks, if Falstaff carried on this way at the Viet Nam War Memorial?  Gratuitously, the author tells us that his enthralled elderhostel students agreed with him (sadly, I must report that college students these days are equally unimpressed by Falstaff).<br /><br />So in the final analysis we do need Harold Bloom, not only to affirm my first love affair with a Shakespeare character, but to remind us of why Falstaff is so much bigger than either his own girth or the arms of modern-day critics who try to put him in his place (he's far too protean and multi-dimensional for that).  We certainly don't need any more war-hungry, anachronistic \\"heroes\\" like Coppola's Captain Kilgore, getting their highs from the smell of napalm and honor-sanctioned blood lust.

In his powerful, climactic \\"corset\\" speech he rises to social indictment of the highest order--a recognition of the \\"horror\\" and a denunciation of the shallow, exploitive, self-deluded, spiritless society that he would prefer to be no part of (his epiphany is also suggestive of Charles Smithson's in \\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\\").<br /><br />Juxtaposed with the film, Pomerance's play makes us aware of the power of the theater of the imagination.  Unlike the movie, whose requirements for verisimilitude led John Hurt to putting on facial make-up for six hours prior to each day's shoot, the play's John Merrick appears without disguise.  His normal features are soon replaced, however, by the audience's realization that Merrick could be--and is--any one of us.<br /><br />Both a little less realistic and less sentimental than the film, the play is at the same time a provocative and moving study in self-discovery.	2005-01-10

It's curious how a new historicist like Greenblatt can combine rigorous, often meticulous, historical sleuthing with imaginative license and produce a credible, personable Will yet not necessarily strengthen our identification with the artist himself.  Just as Bloom is frequently self-serving in his appropriation of Shakespeare to his pet theories about Romantic genius, Greenblatt may be no less misguided in assuming the Bard can (or must) be explained by historical-social-political contexts.  Learning about Robert Green, for example, does nothing for my understanding or appreciation of the protean consciousness of Falstaff.  I confess I'm no less impressed by the so-called \\"rational theolology\\" that reconstructs the life of Jesus, from Renan's in the 19th century to Mel Gibson's in the 21st.<br /><br />Greenblatt, in the preface, claims that he wishes to show that Shakespeare was no distant \\"God\\" but someone who can be explained in human terms.  As a new historicist, he does so by minimizing the boundaries between \\"context\\" and \\"text\\" and, in effect, \\"reading Shakespeare\\" as some of us might read Hamlet or Lear.  His reading, from that point of view, is cogent, well-informed, and often persuasive.  Does it explain, or make more comprehensible, Shakespeare's \\"genius,\\" as the author suggests he's determined to do? If so I missed it, and am frankly glad that I did.  Even reading a biography about Faulkner, about whom we know so much more, fails to illuminate the \\"life\\" of the texts or explain the genius behind them.  Yes, the author experienced contemporaneous events and influences producing understandable, even logical, emotions and views.  His imagination had materials to work with but if we therefore assume we know its working, we've made a reduction that distances us from the creative result.<br /><br />The greatest mind in the history of humankind (in my humble opinion), Shakespeare is simply greater than the sum of his historical circumstances and creative interpretations of them.  As the consciousness that comes closest to embodying that larger field of consciousness we refer to as \\"language,\\" Shakespeare's mind will always resist confinement to a specific period and place let alone a 400-page book.  Like Bloom I'm content to participate in the surge and flow of signifiers that point less to the Bard's habits of mind than to the reader's own potential for growth and expanded awareness.  If, as Bloom claims, the characters are more real than real people, I know which reality to prefer.  So do students: show them an A&E \\"bio\\" of the Bard, and the good ones zone out.  Perhaps if Greenblatt had placed even more emphasis on Will's world but less on Will, we might have hoped to gain a better understanding of what for me has always been a more intriguing question: how the ironically elusive, verbally allusive, syntactic \\"rush\\" and oceanic power that is Shakespeare's language--poetic-dramatic discourse capable of confounding the most educated and patient modern readers--could be processed in a single pass by a pitful of groundlings.hem.

US	53075795	R1E5QPY8WSRLUV	0573626510	305433087	Moon Over Buffalo	Books	4	1	5	N	N	The world's a stage, and it belongs to actors.	Seeing all the negatives this review has attracted, I'm led to wonder whether the responses are reflective of what I said or of what the reader thought I said.  Perhaps nothing is lost in issuing a disqualifier or two: I'm admittedly writing for a somewhat specialized audience, assuming the reader is familiar with the sub-genre known as \\"screwball comedy\\" as well as some of its leading examples (Capra's \\"It Happened One Night\\" and \\"You Can't Take It With You\\"; Hawks' \\"His Girl Friday\\" and \\"Bringing Up Baby.\\"  I'm also assuming some knowledge of early Hollywood screen personae, especially \\"action-figure, swash-buckling romantic leads such as Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn, and finally with some knowledge of the Dionysian in the positive sense as, say, Nietzsche or Jung regard this realm of the human psyche.  In addition, a personal note: I had the opportunity to see a first-rate, near-professional, well-acted production of \\"Moon Over Buffalo\\" at my college, which was fortunate to be host to the legendary director Frank Capra on 3 occasions, perhaps because we discovered him before \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" was rediscovered by the greater public.  Consequently, the writer is: 1. no doubt favorably biased toward the play even as he attempts to divorce his experience as a spectator from an \\"objective\\" review of the text itself and 2. especially alert to cinematic allusions and references, primarily to \\"screwball comedy\\" and to Capra's and Hawks' importance to its most vital examples.<br /><br /> \\"Moon Over Buffalo\\" is a backstage farce that unavoidably evokes the classic screen comedies of Howard Hawks (\\"Bringing Up Baby,\\" \\"His Girl Friday\\") and Frank Capra (\\"Arsenic and Old Lace,\\" \\"You Can't Take It With You\\").  Oddly enough, it uses the expected presence of Capra in the story as a normative \\"foil\\" to the eccentric behavior of the Hays' family.  One might expect, especially at the comparatively late date of the setting (1952), the use of a more contemporary and influential director such as Huston, Preminger, or Wilder (it would be 30 years before \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" would be rediscovered and Capra restored to influence.)  But this is a play that, while inarguably entertaining its audience, serves as a \\"consolation\\" for actors.  The play's \\"message\\" seems to be that notwithstanding unpredictable employment, unstable relationships, and bottoming out with the bottle, actors are blessed with a kind of insanity that enlivens our own dull existences while affirming their own free agency.  But the play succeeds by reminding each of us, as spectator-participants, that upon closer inspection we are all at heart actors on our respective stages, and the choices we make with regard to \\"controlling\\" life and its attendant stress in the end determine whether we're overcome by what we can't control or able to accept our humanity, our imperfections, and to \\"go with the flow.\\"  The tendency to over-rate \\"normalcy,\\" to seek to control life and repress stress, can only make us sick--far sicker, in fact, than anyone who, like an imaginative actor, remains open to life's unexpected course, the rough patches as well as the smooth-sailing stretches.<br /><br />In short, \\"Moon Over Buffalo\\" is great entertainment and a broad and physical, fast-moving play that may come up short of the deft and smart humor of the best cinematic \\"screwball\\" comedy scripts.  On the other hand, there's no question that George Hays is a worthy predecessor, or successor (however you choose to view him), to that adorable if not always coherent lush, Peter O'Toole, himself an heir to Doug Fairbanks, John Barrymore, Erroll Flynn,  and a host of impulsive, grown child-actors whose Thespianic ties were more with Dionysus than with modern-day press agents, career advisors, and personal trainers.  These latter belong to the overly rational, calculating, perfectionist types whose unrealistic view of human nature brings no smiles and fewer laughs.  It is they who surrender to a stage that is all but devoid of the life and energy represented by the Hays' family and those spectators capable of relating to them.but devoid of the life and energy represented by the Hays' family and those spectators capable of relating to them.	2004-11-15

The primary text is sufficiently contained and the representative critical methodologies presented clearly enough to introduce students to both literature and literary theory without overwhelming them.  Moreover, \\"The Dead\\" is capable of repaying the close and observant reader with a Joycean \\"epiphany\\" perhaps not surpassed by any other literary text (the last several paragraphs, especially, require attention to the developing, altering meanings of each and every word).<br /><br />I have one caveat: the essay representing feminist criticism I frankly find baffling.  The writer, apparently trying to have her cake and eat it too, manages to indict Joyce as a sexist while applauding the story as a critique of sexism and patriarchal hegemony!  It does not \\"seem\\" to occur to her that Joyce may be removed from his central character, Gabriel, or that her evidence for Gabriel's male arrogance may actually be Joyce's idea from the start.  A close reading of the character certainly suggests an ironic portrayal--everything that appears to be in Gabriel's favor is exposed through Joyce's subtle language as self-delusion.  The feminist critic, however, impugns Joyce by suggesting that his \\"intentions\\" are less honorable than the meaning of the text itself!<br /><br />Perhaps the writer is overstating a point in order to provide a better example of the type of critical approach she was asked to represent for the purposes of this anthology.  I know that I will suggest as much should I again have occasion to use this particular essay.	2004-10-10

But Friel manages to make the reader/spectator ponder the seriousness of what can be lost in the translation of the marginal language into the majority discourse.  In some instances, the signifer and signified, the sign and its referent are irrevocably separated.  In such cases, the resulting loss is not merely to the \\"richness\\" of a country's culture but to human consciousness itself.  What we can't say we can no longer know or even think.	2004-10-09

Unless you're interested in the recommendations for sugar-free food substitutes and the many recipes for hypoglycemic and sub-clinical hypoglycemic diets, there's really no point to picking up this book.  In fact, if you have copies of Atkins or the South Beach diet, you have the recipes already.<br />It does strike me that the author, if anything, is a bit more permissive in this edition about what's acceptable in the diet.  Medicinal herbs and topical solutions with salicylates are still strictly forbidden, but as far as ingesting the herbs as &quot;food,&quot; apparently the sky's the limit.  Also, it can be frustrating trying to reconcile what appear to be contradictory statements.  For example, the author says on p. 17 that feeling much worse after taking guaifenesin is a sure sign that it's working: the toxins are being flushed out and you're on the yellow brick road to recovery.  But then on page 22 he says that most blocked patients begin to feel rapidly worse, a sure sign that the guaifenesin is being neutralized by salicylates.  So should the patient celebrate feeling lousy or seek to alleviate the condition through a more vigilant search for salicylates?  Also, Dr. Amand stresses the importance of consulting your physician regularly for &quot;mapping,&quot; then admits that most physicians don't know how or won't do it (guess who will).<br />All in all, unless you're interested in about a hundred pages of sugar-free albeit admittedly tempting, recipes, you can probably safely pass up this purchase.	2004-06-27

Bill Clinton had everything the Presidential Office should demand--rhetorical gifts of the first order, intellectual scope and depth, skills at negotiation and bridge-building, knowledge of history and the Constitution, reassuring body language and television charm, tireless energy and a genuine aptitude for the job (no need to build up his chest in the weight room), compassion for the underdog, and distrust of ideologies from either the left or the right.  But he also had Kenneth Star and a tremendous ego.  The former receives his castigation in this tome, but the latter pretty much gets a pass.<br />What Clinton fails to admit is that his hubris, not his carnality or power, was his fatal flaw.  In the face of a vengeful political wing and a relentless prosecutor, he continued to behave irresponsibly in his personal life, blithely if not arrogantly assuming that he could not be touched by his enemies.  It was a misjudgment of colossal proportions, and his outrage about the prosecution and impeachment can only serve to make his own miscalculation seem all the more unforgivable.  Kenneth Star and the impeachment are not, as he claims, his badge of honor but his badge of shame.<br />Looking back upon a similar episode in American culture, we may judge the witch hunt conducted by the Salem prosecutors to exceed the sins of Hester Prynne, but it was never within Hester's power to make us see the pain and injustice inflicted upon her by the righteous Puritan fathers.  History, or we the gullible public, must eventually come to a judgment about Kenneth Star, his use of the internet to immerse us in the President's sex life, the railroading of the President by the opposing party through the \\"excuse\\" of a private sexual affair.  But the best Bill Clinton can do now, and all we could have hoped for in this chronicle, is to provide an admission not merely that he had \\"sinned\\" but that he had allowed his pride to blind him to his primary responsibilities to the community that had given him its trust.  What we get in this account is the portrait of a victim--a victim of Kenneth Star as well as of his own personal appetites.  Unfortunately, he is no tragic hero in the Aristotelian sense. The savor of victory in the impeachment proceedings prevents him from grasping the horror of his misdeed.  The hubris remains in place, and he fails to rise to self-knowledge.

Not merely the sign of a lack of moral clarity, it demonstrated the absence of logical-semantic clear-headedness as well.

It's hard for me to believe that Bennett is someone for whom I once reserved trust and admiration--this self-proclaimed philosopher-king who ranks Clinton's sex lie as a greater calamity than our present leaders' costly lies about terror's place of origin.  If you wish to know the heart of a terrorist, read Joseph Conrad's \\"The Secret Agent.\\"  If you wish to see with stunning clarity the greater horrors attendant upon those who first dignify terror by giving it a place and then succumb to its horrible grip, read the same author's \\"The Heart of Darkness.\\"	2004-06-22

But then come the \\"catches.\\"  So many, in fact, that the reader who follows the program has no choice but to reverse the disease or blame himself for failing.<br />To begin with, following this relatively complicated, three-pronged program will require studious effort, unrelenting energy, and great will-power.  Committing to it could in itself prove highly therapeutic for individuals whose problems are multiplied by idleness.  The first part of the program consists not merely of taking the guaifenesin but determining the optimal amount.  Too little or too much could prove of no use.  Moreover, the patient has to believe that feeling bad and even worse as a consequence of taking the product is a sign that it's working (very much like the \\"die-off reaction\\" that alternative medicine claims is a sign of improvement in those diagnosed with systemic candida yeast infection).  The second part of the program involves detecting and eschewing all products that contain salicylates--not just aspirin but virtually all herbs and plant products. Lipstick containing aloe along with shampoo with balsam must be astringently avoided as must toothpaste or any product containing peppermint.  Otherwise the potential benefits of the guaifenesin will be completely voided.  The third part is to go on a hypoglycemic diet, one similar to Atkins or South Beach in that sugar, carbohydrates, and caffeine are absolute no-no's.  Given the amount of work involved in selecting and preparing food meeting the no-carbohydrate criteria, a person's compliance might be seen as either therapeutic or as a sign of recovery from disabling conditions.<br />Does the program work?  I don't know yet.  Will it?  Most likely, yes.  There's no evidence that the first or second parts of the program do individuals harm and plenty of evidence that the third part will result in weight loss and greater energy reserves.  And the author's claim that disorders like fibro, IBS, CFS, and numerous other maladies have a common origin in the inability of the body's cells to produce sufficient energy seems highly plausible.<br />The immediate problem, it seems to me, is that the program is too complex and full of contingencies to be medically verifiable.  Moreover, the program makes it difficult for an individual experiencing improvement to know exactly what he might attribute the difference to.  On the other hand, it's equally difficult if not impossible for an individual whose condition is non-responsive to blame the program, given its stringent demands and the fallibility of human nature.  It would seem to be insult added to injury if a person who fails to improve must now add to the plague of fibromyalgia the burden of guilt.will result in weight loss and greater energy reserves.

Popular self-help books can be judged by two criteria: 1. Do they reduce a complex subject to accessibility without distorting it?  (Writers like Chopra, Bradshaw, Dyer often succeed admirably.)  2. Distorted or not, do they work?<br /><br />Concerning the first question, the author gives no evidence that he's had as much as a basic introductory course in linguistics or, for that matter, thought long and deeply about language.  Although he refers to \\"vast amounts of research,\\" his secondary sources consist of cover stories from Time, U.S. News Report, and USA Today as well as \\"authorities\\" such as Tony Robbins, Marlo Thomas, and Bill Bennett.  The extent of his primary research appears to be asking people to choose between two lists of words.  The first list contains \\"love-vacation-puppy\\" or \\"civil-respectful-kind,\\" while the second has \\"destroy-kill-hurt\\" or \\"rude-crude-raw.\\"  When asked which list provides better feelings, the subjects of the experiment invariably prefer the first list, thus presumably making the author's case that positive words evoke positive feelings.<br /><br />Even though the words selected for these lists are mostly abstract, the author claims that words themselves are \\"pictures,\\" capable of having strong and lasting effects, either for the positive or negative.  Once we have recognized this potential in words, the next step is to use them \\"wisely\\"--that is, select only those words that present positive, affirming, celebratory pictures.<br /><br />It appears that the author has never thought excessively about the relationship between such things as thought and language, the word and its referent, or the word and its context in a sentence.  He acknowledges that words can become part of our consciousness yet, by placing the \\"chooser\\" of words outside of the field of language, he implicitly  separates consciousness from language.  It does not seem to occur to him that \\"positive\\" words would not even have meaning were it not for their binary opposites or that the \\"decline\\" of civilization to which he alludes may have more to do with language impoverishment than with failure to adhere to a prescriptive list of positive words.  One wonders how his list might assist the reader of \\"Hamlet\\" or \\"Macbeth,\\" should such reading even be permitted.  In sum, a close reading of this book (which is probably a mistake) will expose not merely reductive but circular and contradictory logic not to mention sophomoric pronouncements (\\"my theory is that words have a great impact\\").<br /><br />To be fair, the author is apparently an exceptional individual, one we might all do well to emulate.  For each of his 30 years as a high school teacher, he met each of 170 students at the classroom door with a personal greeting, then began each class period with the question: \\"What are we celebrating today?\\"  Moreover, there can be little argument about the effectiveness of his method.  Despairing over the possibility of getting back his investment in a second printing of an earlier book, his fortunes were turned around by his wife's words: \\"You will sell them.\\"  My purchase of the book must be added proof of the power the author attributes to words.<br /><br />Motivational books and various forms of popular \\"pep talk\\" literature are like candy bars to many consumers.  They're a constant necessity, even if of questionable lasting value.  The author himself claims that he starts his day with them and suggests we do the same.  All the same, the words I'm taking with me after this experience are \\"Simon and Schuster,\\" a new synonym for \\"caveat emptor.\\"language, he implicitly  separates consciousness from language.

There's no shortage of critical commentary about Pound's modernism, imagism, multilingualism, vorticism, influence, etc., but much of it doesn't necessarily help the reader with the specifics of Pound's poetry let alone provide a coherent pathway through it.  Pound's obscurity is compounded, it seems to me, by those who keep insisting on seeing the Cantos as &quot;cinematic collage.&quot;  The problem is that the poem paints relatively few memorable images.  Its poet was, above all, a troubador, inspired by the frequently coarse, frequently sublime and visionary music of Robert Browning's Sordello.  To hear Pound's voice is to discover the musical basis of the poem.  And as polytonal as the work is, Pound's relentless, frequently reactionary jeremiad begins to take on both narrative and thematic coherence because of the sound of his voice (which in parts of Canto 99 doesn't even have spoken word correlatives).<br />For anyone seeking either to further their understanding of Pound or simply to get into him, this recording is a better bet than most of the commentaries.

Books	5	31	33	N	Y	The Best Available	This is the most comprehensive yet systematic, accessible, and intelligent book I've read on IBS (I had read 7-8 others before finding this one).  You can waste much time and money on all sorts of herbal and medicinal products as well as alternative therapies with absolutely no gain--in fact, in many cases you may decide you feel worse.<br />Salt and Neimark provide a complete analysis of the mind/body/spirit connection, taking you from the causes of your problem to the resolution of it that only knowledge and action can provide.  Their approach employs all of the latest research in mainstream medicine as well as some bold and positive understandings that are unliikely to appear in the conventional literature.<br />The only slight &quot;negative&quot; may be many of the illustrations, which are frankly insipid and unilluminating.  On the other hand, they do provide some &quot;breathing space&quot; for the reader, possibly providing the text with a lighter tone and feel.	2004-03-18

But as much as I had tried to follow my grandmother's advice to limit sugar, refined foods, and cheap carbs, I've been more successful since this book.  Unlike some of the other publications  bearing the name of the same program, author and publisher, this one lays out a complete, totally prescriptive, no-brainer regimen of meals for every day of the program.  Simply make a list of all of the ingredients (many of which I'd never heard of), buy them, and follow the script to the letter.  Some people may do just as well trusting common sense which, in my case, proved not so common.<br />As far as results, I experienced 5 percent loss of body weight during the first 4 days despite not exercising, and my carbohydrate cravings, for the most part, vanished.  By the 5th day, however, I'd run out of pre-prepared meals and time and began to cheat with Snapple Meal Replacements and Zone Bars.  The scale immediately punished me for my indiscretions and hasty improvising.  The lesson: this isn't jazz; stick to the score.	2004-01-23

The style is reader-friendly but in no way condescending; the examples are generous and representative of classic as well as current developments; the coverage is comprehensive.  Indeed, with the accompanying CD-Rom and Website, the text is a virtual encyclopedia of information about the cinema, thereby justifying its slightly higher price.  Moreover, this is the first text that begins to realize many of the media-specific qualities of the subject it attempts to illuminate.<br />This is a first edition, and understandably there are problems, some admittedly attributable to individual preferences.  A few things I've noticed:<br />1.  The website can be \\"buggy,\\" at least to a Macintosh operating system.  Numerous \\"Java Script\\" messages are appearing along with failures to play visual and audio files.  Even with the misfires, the website is the most impressive I've ever used in conjunction with a text.  Because of it, an instructor need have no apologies about using a text that includes discussions of numerous films unknown to students and impossible to screen in class.<br />2.  The accompanying VCD contains valuable film examples but unfortunately doesn't include any clips from \\"Citizen Kane.\\"  I would hope that a future edition includes a DVD with Kane and other useful illustrative and instructive materials.  Website information and quizzes often have too many technical glitches to make them effective time-savers for a teacher, who now must solve each student's difficulties with the website (the required 8-digit password doesn't help).<br />3.  Barsam uses much personal and arbitrary descriptive language that subsequently becomes \\"reified\\" in the quizzes about the components of film.  As a result, the quiz becomes as much about remembering the specific language of the author and textbook as about the properties of a filmic element (equally true of the book's competitors).<br />4.  The order of topics will not appeal to every instructor.  For example, the most basic element of film--the shot--isn't addressed until the discussion of photography in Chapter 4.  Also, the attention to previously marginalized films and filmmakers can be quite uneven.  African-American issues receive considerable space in several chapters in the book and on the website whereas feminist issues receive a couple of paragraphs.  Moreover, there is very little consideration of \\"auteurism,\\" the enabling and prevailing approach of academic cinema studies.<br />5.  The author's lack of experience with literary and composition issues is frequently apparent, though to the book's credit ample space is given to student writing.  Still, the treatment of point of view in cinema becomes problematic, especially when the author refers to the camera's perspective as \\"omniscient.\\"  Also, the inclusion of an exemplary student essay, while extremely welcome, represents an unfortunate choice, in my opinion, since the essay is somewhat sophomoric, exhibits clumsy writing and omits a thesis(!).<br />All in all, a promising production by Barsam and Norton.  I look forward to giving it a test drive.element (equally true of the book's competitors). <br />4.  The order of topics will not appeal to every instructor.

A welcome and insightful anthology, bringing much needed attention and light to the affective dimension of film.  Too often the undeniable emotional power of  the cinematic experience has been ignored by scholars and critics, unless this elusive register of film was being &quot;politicized&quot; in Marxist or feminist critiques of the &quot;insidious&quot; messages of a dominant ideology.<br />The essays about &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; and &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; are especially useful (though I would argue that no director has captured the &quot;sound of silence&quot; more affectingly than does Lynch in the disturbing montage sequences representing Merrick's consciousness).<br />Since Jeff Smith's essay addresses my own somewhat &quot;pioneering&quot; analysis of Friedhofer's score for &quot;Best Years,&quot; I'll briefly respond.  The representation of my own position and approach--influenced by Lacanian &quot;suture&quot; theory--is impressively accurate.  But I would suggest that Smith's counterproposal of a more cognitive-based approach would not necessarily produce a more reliable account of the viewer's response to the film score--especially given the widely-accepted discreditation of music's inherently narrative, or &quot;programmatic,&quot; features.  Rather, music is one of cinema's most fluid and elusive signifiers, capable of reaching the viewer at both conscious and sub-conscious levels as well as evoking emotions through incongruous juxtapositions of the ironic and the literal.  Representing this &quot;transaction&quot; between the film's emotive messages and the viewer's claiming them as &quot;his own,&quot; will always be an activity located in a rhetorical as much as an analytic space.	2003-12-17

Once again, Culler shows that he can explain theory in a manner that is relatively accessible to the neophyte yet likely to go down well with his peers.  All the same, the final effect is less than satisfying.  As thoughtful as the seven meditations on theory and language are, they don't have sufficient cohesion to make much of an impression (let alone a memorable one) on a reader fresh to theory.  One wishes the author had paid more attention to the historical periods of theory and the revisions of successive generations, if only to clarify key distinctions.  Or that this commentary (like many other recent explanations of literary theory) did not pass by archetypal criticism, which may be reductive and out of fashion in the academy but for many younger readers offers an edifying and useful approach.  Instead, he manages to touch on Foucault, Derrida, and Lacan in the introductory chapter and devotes later chapters to discussions about J. L. Austin and performative language along with a section about Judith Butler.<br />The Appendix, which provides a summary of various schools and methodologies, is written in unhelpful, \\"humanless\\" prose, as unaware of an audience as it is deaf to voice (certainly this isn't what Barthes had in mind when he sacrificed the author to the life of the text).<br />In short (or in this case, the very very short of it), there are some good things to be gleaned from this little text (especially if an instructor wishes to use it for \\"departure points\\"), but I'm afraid it's too arbitrary, personal, and eccentric to be of great service in the undergraduate classroom.	2003-09-10

Unlike similar discussions, Foster focuses not only on &quot;how&quot; literature means but &quot;what&quot; it means, which for the author has more to do with Jung, Joseph Campbell and Northrop Frye than Freud, Marx, or Roland Barthes.  In other words, he's big on archetypal patterns, and he supplies them in accessible and economical terms that should encourage his readers to find out more on their own.<br />The book seems quite loosely organized, a chatty collection of brief post-class meditations that must have numerous teachers wondering why they didn't come up with the same title and premise themselves.  If there's a critical omission, it's the inadequate attention to the role of language.  A central problem for many, if not most, beginning readers of literature is the assumption that words are of value only insofar as they refer to meanings &quot;out there.&quot;  Consequently, they read literary texts in &quot;chunks,&quot; looking for broad paraphrases that will be sufficient to point to a connection between the literary work and its underlying archetype, or to a link between the &quot;symbolic&quot; text and &quot;real&quot; life.  But an experienced reader of literature finds the &quot;primary&quot; pleasures and meanings of a text to lie in the individual word choices of the author as well as the syntactic structures that engage the reader's consciousness in the dynamic life of the text.  Not to attend to these matters first is not merely to invite irresponsible readings but to imply that literature is somehow separate and secondary from its &quot;meanings.&quot;<br />&quot;How to Read Literature Like a Professor&quot; addresses some of the major responses of the literature teacher (one can only hope readers would ever want to read like him).  But it never quite locates where, for the professorial reader, the real action takes place.  Reaching that place, or nexus between the life in the text and the reader's consciousness, can be a highly demanding task, but for those who profess the rewards of literature there can be no short cuts or substitutes.the professorial reader, the real action takes place.

Lewis, and Tolkien are writers who divide their work between \\"serious\\" and \\"entertaining\\" literature. My time constraints are such that I normally limit my focus to the former category, which has already expanded beyond the reading capabilities of any mortal in the course of a single lifetime (thank goodness, the amount of guilt does not grow in proportion to the books remaining to be read). Books from the latter category, I've always consoled myself, are primarily escapist narratives that can be enjoyed equally, and certainly more efficiently, in the medium of film.<br />In spite of my principles, I found myself alone in a room with Michael Craft's \\"Desert Winter\\" and enough time to read the first page. Bad mistake--especially for addictive personalities such as mine. The theme of murder hits you in the first sentence with cinematic forcefulness, then quickly yields to a POV that would be impossible to capture in a movie: a Christmas ornament in the form of a meticulously described, watchful cherub blowing a trumpet. On whom? I immediately ask myself. The narrator plays with this motif through the end of the chapter, employing it in comical and suggestive ways that could never be translated to film. And the narrative, moreover, practically makes a case for its own integrity when, still in the first chapter, an allusion to \\"Laura,\\" both the film classic and its literary antecedents, calls attention to the more realistic but also more obvious and less playful status of the film version.<br />By this point I'm hooked. Normally, reading for me is a form of \\"work,\\" with chapter endings representing welcome respites. Not so this backstage mystery story. With its colorful cast of characters, sharply observed descriptions, and playful plotting, I found it hard not to get ahead of the author's game. My advice: Don't try to match wits with Claire Gray unless you're absolutely assured you have the self-discipline not to peek ahead.	2003-06-09

Compelling (but no adventure story)	The familiar French expletive is uttered by the narrator after an exploding shell has spilled ink on the song he's just written for his wife, negating his night's labors but not his determination to rewrite it.  It's this sort of touch that separates Blackburn's uncommon account about the common soldier's experience from other books about the Normandy campaign or any other war.<br />\\"The Guns of Normandy\\" describes the two-month mission of the author's regiment in the ferocious and decisive battle for Verrieres Ridge, but it is clear from the outset that the author is on another mission. Like Toni Morrison's narrator in \\"Beloved,\\" who insists that hers is \\"not a story to be retold,\\" Blackburn insists that his account, however gripping it may be, is \\"never, never an adventure story.\\" It is time to salvage this critical moment in history from the dispassionate reconstructions of the academics, from the fanciful fabrications of the \\"war games\\" crowd, and even from the fading memories of the participants themselves. The resulting account is at once a powerful tribute to the Canadian 2nd Division's contribution (the victory at Falaise seals the doom of Hitler's forces in the west) and a stirring memorial to the author's comrades. But above all it is an honest portrayal of men engaged in a protracted \\"real\\" war, not an in-and-out invasion where the primary focus is on high-tech weaponry and smart bombs.<br />Blackburn's use of the second-person narrator, in effect, de-emphasizes his own persona and directly engages the reader in the experience-from the undeniable fascination of war to the horrifying spectacle to the depressingly prosaic daily business. The narrator's question before landing in France quickly became my own: Would I be able to stand up in a similar situation? Doubts entered my mind even when, shortly after landing, the narrator describes a herd of distended, dead cows, each with two legs pointing toward the sky. That unsettling scene much later becomes a powerful, unshakable metaphor representing the horror, the absurdity, the futility of war. A Canadian gun officer, preoccupied with guiding his weapon, jumps down from his quad-and finds himself buried in the rotten intestines of one of those swollen carcasses, the bowels of hell literally engulfing him in an instant.<br />Other images become indelible with little help, and certainly no hype, from the narrator. We register disappointment at the overmatched Allied tanks vs. their heavily-armored German counterparts; we're attracted to the German Nebelwerfers that unexpectedly discharge terrifying \\"Moaning Minnies\\" at the Canadians' expense; we share the narrator's helplessness and dismay while his comrades fall victim to the misdirected bombs of the RAF; we can't shake off the image of a barely recognizable human form after it has been run over the previous night by a column of tanks. Throughout, we share the narrator's amazement at the tenacity and sheer will of men who continue to fight in the face of relentless dysentery, massive lice infestation, and overwhelming fatigue.<br />But our final impression--standing out from the grizzly details, the courageous actions of the men, the ultimate victory even-is one of comradeship, of a mutual trust so strong that the infantry soldiers view the gunners as protectors while the gunners, in turn, take extra care not to disturb the precious few hours of sleep granted the frontline soldiers. And the narrator takes this theme one additional, unforgettable step when he finds himself struggling to administer medical care to a critically wounded German soldier whose face reminds him of his own brother. At that climactic moment, the depersonalized narrator materializes fully for us, validating not just the authenticity but also the value of his mission-both as soldier and historian.<br />\\"The Guns of Normandy\\" certainly is no mere \\"adventure story.\\" It's an unflinching record, a powerful elegy, a story of faith, hope and, not least of all, charity.of all, charity.	2003-06-02

Fowles goes considerably beyond a novelist such as A. S. Byatt and even most historians in painting the portrait of an era and its citizens as well as evoking the multifarious \\"Victorian sensibility,\\" with its ambivalence about social class, morality, progress, science, religion, and, of course, sex.<br />The affair between Charles Smithson, amateur gentleman paleontologist, and Sarah Woodruff, alluring, forbidden \\"outcast,\\" is, in many respects, no more than a ruse (readers who express disappointment at the ending have no doubt swallowed too much of the bait, reading the novel as conventional romance). The epigraph to the final chapter, Matthew Arnold's \\"True Piety Is Acting What One Knows,\\" can be taken as a key to the story's compelling theme and purpose. The narrative is a variation on the quest pattern, with the salvation of the story's everyman-protagonist at stake. Moreover, his progress from ignorance to self-knowledge, contrary to Marxist theory and, for that matter, inexorable Darwinian laws of natural selection, requires that he separate himself from his \\"age,\\" the very culture that has formed him, defined him, and threatens to deform him.<br />The climax in the story is not Charles' meeting with Sarah in the home of the Rossetti's but his epiphany, in Chapter 48, while viewing a Crucifix in the sanctuary of a church. At this moment he sees his preoccupation with fossils as representative of his society's fixation on custom, externals, and respectability at the expense of the interior self and its own priorities. Charles and Sarah find their heart's bliss \\"through\\" but certainly not \\"with\\" each other.<br />I read this novel at the same time I was reading \\"The English Patient,\\" Michael Ondaatje's poetic novel that challenges spatial boundaries much as Fowles' narrative does the same with temporal ones. Ondaatje takes fewer chances, constructing a fantastic, impressionistic narrative that makes very few mistakes and admittedly casts a lingering spell.

It offers a comprehensive history of the Victorian era, a Dickensian gallery of characters, an dramatization of the faith-doubt struggle found in the poetry of Tennyson and Arnold, a critique of Victorian and modern cultural malaise, a postmodernist literary conceit, an archetypal journey with an existentialist twist.  Above all, the attentive reader of this allusive, multi-layered, yet remarkably focused story will be rewarded with a unique understanding of narrative and the reader's place within it.  The narrator's offering the reader a choice between two endings has the effect of \\"liberating\\" the narrative and relating it to the examined life of the reader's own present.<br />It's difficult to see how a triumph such as this could be excluded from any short list of greatest novels written in English during the second half of the twentieth century.he same with temporal ones.

They're essentially the same book--a continuing proclamation of likes and dislikes and list-making exercises by the great American oracle whose sins are too numerous to mention, or too easy to enumerate. On the whole, he's a useful authority figure whose judicious selections are well-served by his arrogance. If he's going to throw his weight around, we can be grateful he's championed worthy causes. Where he frequently comes up most short, it strikes me, is as a \\"close\\" reader of the texts to which he pledges his and our allegiance. And it is this lack of persistent proximity with his chosen texts that unavoidably raises doubt about the depth of his readings.<br />Bloom likes \\"characters\\"--the Falstaffs, Hamlets, Ahabs--and he pleasures himself in being one. Like his favorite characters, he uses language less to dissect, analyze, and interpret experience than to portray his competencies, appetites, and judgements. An author such as Joseph Conrad passes his character test--until Kurtz. Unlike Marlowe, Bloom cannot be impressed by a \\"horror\\" that seems to elude its own author's comprehension. Similarly, he can credit Faulkner with creating memorable characters who embody racial relations in the old South but seems oblivious to the self-recognition that Faulkner's characters--the son of an octoroon, for example--are capable of awakening in the present-day reader. But it would take both a close and humble reader to see that Faulkner's \\"blackness\\" is the humanness that resides within us all and that Faulkner's incest is the pride that isolates us from our humanity, a commonness that must seem antithetical to the project of self-characterization.<br />Exclusivity has its place.

My title is controversial, I'll admit, but after close consideration of the other major candidates (and I don't exclude great novels that have come to be considered unworthy of academic \\"canonization\\"), and after teaching it (or attempting to) on three separate occasions, this is not only the Faulkner work but the single American novel that remains in tenaciously ensconced in consciousness, continually vibrant, informing the reader about him or herself as well as American history past and present.  But even on the two occasions when I taught a class that \\"seemed\\" incapable of staying the course, students continued to remain attentive, practically insisting I tell them the story through a teacher's \\"translation.\\"  Also, Faulkner's short story \\"Wash\\" can be very useful in conveying the fate of Thomas Sutpen in concise, clear terms that do no serious injury to Faulkner's narrative idea and thematic purpose, especially in the novel's last half.  The following analysis is necessarily dense and a trifle abstruse, at least initially, for an author whose primary \\"ostensible\\" subjects are language and race, but if the reader simply approaches the story as a good yarn--perhaps with the aid of a bare-bones break-down or outline at her side-the novel should prove highly accessible--admittedly difficult at times, but it's an \\"earned difficulty,\\" repaying the reader many times over for the investment of time and work (I've never subscribed to the notion that reading literature has to be \\"fun.\\"  Moreover, it's hard for me to believe that those readers who complain about the \\"Absalom's\\" difficulty have as yet tackled the work most often used to represent Faulkner--\\"The Sound and the Fury.\\")<br /><br />As physical beings we exist in that spatial-temporal order designated as \\"nature.\\" But as humans we also exist in an exclusive realm of \\"consciousness,\\" which might be described as a vast, collective energy field made up of the signs, i.e. \\"language,\\" by which we try to make sense of existence. This field is beyond the grasp of any of us, not only its vast and oceanic proportions but its dynamic, protean flow resisting ownership by a single instance of consciousness. Perhaps one individual has tapped into this immense reservoir more completely, directly, and vitally than any other--William Shakespeare. Who else even comes close to harnessing the stream and containing the flood long enough to permit the rest of us some sense of its unlimited potential?<br /><br />Despite the Bard's uniqueness as the fountainhead, the matrix, the mother of modern Western consciousness (I tend to agree with Harold Bloom's assessment on this point, at least), a handful of succeeding language-bearers have proven capable of tapping into the same source. In American literature, and certainly literature of the 20th-century, Faulkner is the chosen one, the Promethean genius who affords the rest of us an opportunity to ride the stream.<br /><br />As a preceding reviewer has suggested, there's no way to summarize \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" without misrepresenting it. The \\"themes\\" are the mere toeholds Faulkner offers to readers who try to mount the surfboard and stay with the churning, changing syntax and shifting referents of his 500-word sentences long enough to reach the beachhead. Even getting thrown (which is inevitable on many of the more torrential tidal waves) is, to say the least, a heady if not visceral and energizing experience. Despite the unique achievements of \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" \\"Sound and the Fury,\\" \\"Light in August,\\" and \\"Go Down, Moses,\\" this is Faulkner's most impressive and most rewarding novel. It's likely to frustrate, but don't quit on it. It's capable of paying more dividends than perhaps any other American literary work. Compare Faulkner's story about Thomas Sutpen and his \\"Grand Design\\" to any similar stories about the \\"American Dream\\"--by Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Wolf, Steinbeck--or to any of the subsequent writers said to be \\"Faulknerian\\" in their style. The others are suddenly diminished, and the singular achievement of this Southern, uneducated, probably possessed, alcoholic becomes all the more remarkable.  in many respects, Faulkner's narrative structure is closer to Orson Welles' in \\"Citizen Kane\\" than that of his literary contemporaries or forbears (though Browning's \\"The Ring and the Book\\" adapts a similar technique of gradually exposing what is true through ever tighter circles drawn by a succession of different narrators).<br /><br />Most of us would do well to write more simply and concisely ourselves and to bring suspicious minds to verbiage that seems disproportionate to its actual content and meaning. But there's no need to be suspicious of Faulkner's story or storytelling style. Simply trust it.  The style and meaning are a match, a perfect fit. Faulkner's meanings about the tragedy of a \\"grand design\\" gone wrong become significant because of our underlying sense of one that is going right.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, the novel can be read as an allegory of the rise and fall of the Old South.  But it's at least equally absorbing in its probing into the recesses of individualized human consciousness.  Much has been made of Faulkner's psychological portrayal of Addie Bundren through her sole monologue in \\"As I Lay Dying.\\"  But it quickly pales when compared with the unexpected yet exquisite and supremely rewarding journey into the psyche and heart of Rosa Coldfield, who is suddenly transformed from caricature into a woman of infinite complexity, possessing depth commensurate with her heart's capacity for desiring.<br /><br />As for the novel's heart, it's as big as its creator's--compassionate, humble, loving of all creatures born equal under God.  A key question posed by the story is: what is the difference between the \\"illegitimate\\" offspring of a white plantation owner/black slave relationship and the \\"despised\\" child of an octoroon?  The answer to that question is one of the novel's great epiphanies, a moment in which the reader recognizes his own place in the narrative and is one with Faulkner's world.  It's an insight that is better \\"earned\\" than explained.  After seeing so many of Faulkner's characters paralyzed, crippled, and destroyed through stubborn, incestuous adherence to the pure and abstract ideal of achromatic \\"whiteness\\" (not simply Southern supremacists like Sutpen and Old South reactionaries like the Compsons but Northern Puritans like Joanna Burden), the reader suddenly apprehends Faulkner's profoundly simple moral lesson: \\"blackness\\" is humanness.iminished, and the singular achievement of this Southern, uneducated, probably possessed, alcoholic becomes all the more remarkable.  in many respects, Faulkner's narrative structure is closer to Orson Welles' in \\"Citizen Kane\\" than that of his literary contemporaries or forbears (though Browning's \\"The Ring and the Book\\" adapts a similar technique of gradually exposing what is true through ever tighter circles drawn by a succession of different narrators).    Most of us would do well to write more simply and concisely ourselves and to bring suspicious minds to verbiage that seems disproportionate to its actual content and meaning. But there's no need to be suspicious of Faulkner's story or storytelling style. Simply trust it.  The style and meaning are a match, a perfect fit. Faulkner's meanings about the tragedy of a \\"grand design\\" gone wrong become significant because of our underlying sense of one that is going right.    As others have pointed out, the novel can be read as an allegory of the rise and fall of the Old South.  But it's at least equally absorbing in its probing into the recesses of individualized human consciousness.  Much has been made of Faulkner's psychological portrayal of Addie Bundren through her sole monologue in \\"As I Lay Dying.\\"  But it quickly pales when compared with the unexpected yet exquisite and supremely rewarding journey into the psyche and heart of Rosa Coldfield, who is suddenly transformed from caricature into a woman of infinite complexity, possessing depth commensurate with her heart's capacity for desiring.    As for the novel's heart, it's as big as its creator's--compassionate, humble, loving of all creatures born equal under God.  A key question posed by the story is: what is the difference between the \\"illegitimate\\" offspring of a white plantation owner/black slave relationship and the \\"despised\\" child of an octoroon?  The answer to that question is one of the novel's great epiphanies, a moment in which the reader recognizes his own place in the narrative and is one with Faulkner's world.  It's an insight that is better \\"earned\\" than explained.

And it fascinates, even puts its hooks in, readers with its grotesque situations and dark humor. But Faulkner's fable about human encounters with death resonates because below the \\"story-level\\" quest of putting Addie Bundren's corpse to rest is the deep-structure quest of the human struggle for \\"meaning,\\" of finding words that represent and give shape to human experience.<br /><br />Addie hates words because they separate her from their referents, from the experience itself, increasing her sense of loneliness. But it's her words that assure her presence in the consciousness of all of the other characters--most notably Darl, who inherits her facility with language. She tricks not only her own family but the reader into undergoing the absurd quest that is the product of her words.  It is words, moreover, that distinguish Addie and Darl from all of the other characters, marking them as the only characters who can think abstractly. The cost is, in Addie's case, extinguishing loneliness only in death; in Darl's, becoming estranged from a \\"sane\\" social order. The gain--at least for the attentive reader--is the knowledge that your dead mother can be neither a horse nor a fish.  Rather than a \\"shape to fill a lack\\" (Addie's characterization of the word \\"love\\"), words contain the memories and possibilities that make all experience, including love, significant.  As for the power and \\"substance\\" of words, Faulkner's vivid description of the crossing of the river through multiple viewpoints--primarily Darl's--should be testimony enough.<br /><br />The novel's enduring \\"lesson\\" is that words are a curse and a blessing.  They threaten to isolate us from the \\"external\\" world of experience, but they are unavoidable in our attempts to represent--\\"re-presence\\"--the meanings that are always fading from our grasp.  Vardamon's deciding that Addie is a \\"fish\\" and Jewel's designation of her as a \\"horse\\" are two versions of the childish, elemental and perfunctory uses of language by human beings who seek simple solutions to life's problems and challenges--from suffering and death to complex, parasitical relationships to the binary evil vs. good categories embraced by neo-conservative political and religious leaders.  By contrast, the artist's solution, though resisted by those who reduce experience to the most accessible and self-serving terms, is to match actual experience with language, and by doing so to express and define the uniquely human.a \\"fish\\" and Jewel's designation of her as a \\"horse\\" are two versions of the childish, elemental and perfunctory uses of language by human beings who seek simple solutions to life's problems and challenges--from suffering and death to complex, parasitical relationships to the binary evil vs. good categories embraced by neo-conservative political and religious leaders.

Even some of us who swear by the Great American Songbook might opt for \\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction\\" if the alternative is listening to several hundred different versions of \\"Stardust\\" (as lovely as it is). Granted, a song biography has more going for it than, say, a performance history of Shakespeare's most popular plays, but still it's not exactly a compelling page turner.<br />Friedwald writes with hipness, esprit and engaging good humor, and he delivers provocative opinions, fascinating information, and a wealth of trivia. But the price of admission may be judged a bit excessive by some readers, mainly because the book contains no index, lists, or even discographies that would insure its value as a reference tool.<br />Every reader will no doubt find much to quibble about with a book such as this (admittedly no small part of its appeal). Frankly, I'm surprised the author makes no mention of the 1947 Lionel Hampton All-Star Concert recording of \\"Stardust\\" (with extraordinary solos by Charlie Shavers and Slam Stewart along with Hamp's introduction of the \\"Pretty Baby\\" motif, which Friedwald attributes to a later recording). And although a Paul Desmond version is mentioned, the Brubeck Quartet performance on the indispensable \\"Jazz at Oberlin\\" album (which evokes without stating the melody) is not. Finally, I'm surprised the author appears to accept \\"C\\" (as does Zinsser in his book) as the current standard key for the song. Any real musician I've known has balked at lowering the tune down half a step from the traditional Db, and for good reason: such a simplification drastically alters the character and feel of the piece, making stardust little more than prosaic morning dust.<br />No doubt no reader will be completely satisfied with the song selections--including this one. How can you possibly leave out as durable, beautiful, ingenious a tune as \\"All the Things You Are,\\" especially given its many permutations? Which is simply to say that some of us would have preferred shorter chapters, more songs, and an index.ble, beautiful, ingenious a tune as \\"All the Things You Are,\\" especially given its many permutations?

But it has its uses: readers who don't plan to read more than 3 of Faulkner's best novels may find some of Cowley's excerpts a reasonable consolation; Cowley's chronological ordering not only clarifies Faulkner's fictional world but exposes its organic unity; with the exception of &quot;Barn Burning,&quot; most of the essential short fiction (including the frequently excerpted &quot;The Bear&quot;) can be found here; the concluding commentary and genealogy which Cowley elicted from Faulkner himself is both helpful and a kind of Faulknerian literary piece in its own right.<br />A slight &quot;down side&quot; (apart from some questionable excerpting and over-emphasis on chronological at the expense of &quot;narrative&quot; time) is Cowley's somewhat &quot;dated&quot; aesthetic judgements (though at times refreshing, since the author was applying them to a &quot;non-canonical&quot; writer).<br />As for &quot;Burn Burning,&quot; it's readily available, free of charge, on the Internet.	2003-02-17

Readers entirely new to Faulkner may benefit from the general introduction as well as the interpretations (basically sound, \\"widely-received\\" readings) of individual novels. Others may understandably take a pass on the first two sections in favor of the third, which provides a breakdown of the narrative order as well as the \\"actual\\" chronology of each of the chapters in Faulkner's novels. Included are scene descriptions based on compiled evidence from the chapter as well as verbal clues that alert the reader to scene shifts in a narrator's consciousness.<br />A downside:  Like most other commentators on Faulkner, Volpe often takes too seriously the seriousness of Faulkner.  This is especially apparent in discussions of \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\"  Unquestionably, it is apocalyptic, tragic, visionary narrative, but it is also supreme farce.  Readers need to know that it's OK be bemused by the first chapter and to laugh out loud at the second.  Critics have done a grave disservice to Faulkner by representing the novel with such unrelenting sobriety.  (Reading Robert Browning's \\"Caliban Upon Setebos\\" might be the first step to a cure from much insensitivity to the playfulness of Faulkner's discourse.)<br />Finally, the page references to Faulkner's novels have not been updated to agree with the current Vintage editions. And the decision to ignore all of the short fiction might have been more palatable had the author not cast aesthetic judgement upon it, in effect \\"ranking\\" it beneath the novels. Faulkner's short fiction is not only of the same high order as his long narratives but is inseparable from them.	2003-02-14

A major disappointment of these brief discussions is the failure to include a timeline summary--of either the narrative or the actions it contains.  As a consequence, the usefulness of the commentary is limited to readers who are fresh from reading the novel.<br />All the same, Bolland brings lots of welcome information, helpful clarification, and fresh critical perspective to Ondaatje's major achievement.  Moreover, his frequent reference to postcolonial theory and Foucault post-structuralism proves to enhance rather than obfuscate his discussion of the novel.  Somewhat disappointing, however, is the author's decision to afford no more than 4 pages to the film, especially given its critical reputation and Ondaatje's keen interest in the project.	2003-01-28

This book is a cut above much self-help gup because the author discusses the structure of the brain and theorizes about the relationship between certain neurotransmitters and personality types (extroverts get off on dopamine and need to work hard to produce it; introverts, on the other hand, suffer from dopamine overload but are efficient processors of acetylcholine).  Most of the book, however, is devoted to overly simplistic generalizations about the two personality types and to lots of admonitory language (do this, do that, don't do this).  Moreover, the author's suggestions tend toward redundancy, describing rather than addressing the very behaviorisms an introvert might wish to alter (e.g. the advice to think ahead of each social encounter or to limit the number of such potentially stressful events would seem merely to enforce existing behaviors).<br />The author might have avoided some of the reductive generalizations by focusing less on \\"introverts\\" and more on \\"introversion\\" as a common human experience (not the least of the reasons that \\"Hamlet\\" remains the world's most popular play).  By insisting on two personality types, Laney creates a profile that is likely to be unrecognizable to many readers who may have considered themselves candidates for the \\"introvert advantage.\\"  For example, she asserts that introverts are overwhelmed not only by social gatherings and meetings but by public places such as malls and casinos.  But is the latter aversion due to introversion or is it a \\"phobia\\"?  As enervating as an introvert may find public performance or thinking on his feet, he may find the \\"anonymity\\" of crowds, ballparks and the like energizing if not exhilarating.  (The author explains how she stayed in her hotel room while her extrovert husband prowled the casino downstairs.  On the other hand, while my extrovert spouse remained in her hotel room reading a math book, this shy introvert made the rounds of every casino on the strip.)<br />The author seems to think that the greatest challenge an introvert might confront is attending a social party, while overlooking the more real concerns of the introvert: fear of judgment, fear of failure, fear of being \\"seen through\\" (the \\"J. Alfred Prufrock\\" syndrome).  More case studies, more examples, more attention to the work of \\"existential\\" psychologists such as R. D. Laing or Kierkegaard himself (\\"truth is subjectivity\\") would certainly seem preferable to the do's and don'ts.  On the other hand, the book may be helpful to readers who have not as yet connected there \\"tiredness problem\\" with their personality type.hink that the greatest challenge an introvert might confront is attending a social party, while overlooking the more real concerns of the introvert: fear of judgment, fear of failure, fear of being \\"seen through\\" (the \\"J.

Nevertheless, he offers 3 defenses for another biography such as the present one: there is more to be known; there are misunderstandings to be corrected; his book is more a \\"meditation\\" than a bio or musical study. Yet he also decries biographies that \\"fill in the blanks,\\" \\"heat up the significance,\\" and turn the \\"biographer into a novelist.\\"  It doesn't seem to occur to him that blanks communicate their own significance, that the narrator's decision about what materials to use and how to order them is in itself an \\"interpretation.\\"  There is no way to resolve his contradictory roles as \\"mediator\\" and \\"meditator,\\" but had he at least acknowledged the difficulty we might have had greater faith in his narrative voice.<br /><br />To the reader familiar with the Miles' literature, the first 300 pages are bound to seem much like recycled material, leavened occasionally by a quote from an acquaintaince of Miles heretofore not on the record.  Moreover, it's hard not to experience impatience at yet another explanation of \\"bebop,\\" at the gratuitous introductions of jazz giants (e.g. to learn that Sonny Stitt played alto saxophone and sounded like Bird), and at yet another extended description of Miles' major recording sessions (\\"Kind of Blue,\\" \\"Sketches of Spain,\\" \\"In a Silent Way,\\" \\"B's Brew\\").<br /><br />Close to a quarter of the book's representation of Miles' 65 years is devoted to the years 1969-1971.  The \\"Silent Way\\" recording session is afforded 24 pages whereas the author finds 8 pages sufficient to handle the \\"Kind of Blue\\" session.  Wayne Shorter receives considerably more space than John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock gets more attention from the author than Red Garland and Wynton Kelly combined.<br /><br />The author's implicit criterion when it comes to Miles' music is that it's all good, and that each change is an innovation requiring little more than description of what was going on with Miles' choice and deployment of musicians along with his editing of the raw recorded product.  In place of specific musical or aesthetic analysis, he constantly sets up \\"straw men,\\" then refutes them with general sociological-cultural arguments as a way of defending Miles' accomplishment.  For example, virtually any critic readily acknowledges that Miles was a better musical complement to Bird than was Diz.  By suggesting otherwise, the author is able to \\"argue\\" what should be a given.  Or he uses Martin Williams' unfavorable response to \\"Bitches Brew\\" to portray all such responses in terms that he can attack: \\"Many critics had an investment in being adult, in resisting the rising tide of rock.\\"  His counterargument is to draw on parallel developments in the arts (Eisenstein's theories of film montage to justify Miles' post-production shaping of his records) and the forces of change in popular culture,<br /><br />Wynton Marsalis, of course, comes off as a misguided bully, shrewd capitalist, and even hypocrite who \\"understood the social costs of innovation and bohemianism in the arts\\".  Never mind that Miles himself had once heaped abuse on the likes of Louis Armstrong and tapped into the \\"bank\\" of pop culture, if not the treasury of commercial trends.  Earlier, in fact, the author suggests that Miles is quite capable of playing his audience: \\"He knew how far not to go.\\"  In the absence of footnote numbers, the constructions beginning \\"he knew\\" or \\"he thought\\" become problematic, raising questions about the author's disavowals of intrusion.<br /><br />Perhaps most readers will find the final 100 pages the most fascinating part of the book as they recount Miles deterioration.  Still, it's hard not to experience some incredulity at the reportage of the apparently indiscriminate, non-stop consumption of uppers and downers, injected street drugs and prescribed medications, beer and hard liquor bya 150 pound specimen (at his peak) who along the way is reported to have diabetes, broken and rebroken ankles, hip replacements, a heart attack, a stroke, while maintaining a prolific love life.  (The rumors of Miles having AIDS are simply repeated, along with the observation that he was once treated with AZT.  Does anyone bother to check medical records?)  The author tends to pass over the psychological effects of these events, individually or their cumulatively--and he's apparently reluctant to address the question of Miles' physical addiction or withdrawal in his final years.<br /><br />If the book is intended to de-mythologize Miles the icon, it rather succeeds in doing quite the opposite, creating a superhuman phenomenon whose energies, appetites, capacities exceeded even Bird's.  By treating the death of Miles' father as just another of many events, it fails to offer the reader a \\"Rosebud\\" that might help us see into the soul of the artist, whose own denial of the past need not block our own attempts at understanding its connection with the artist's present.  Nevertheless, \\"So What?\\" succeeds in sustaining the Miles myth (not a pejorative term) and, in keeping with the interrogative title, in provoking more questions for future generations to ponder about a man who was arguably the Pablo Picasso of America's most vital music in the 20th century.a 150 pound specimen (at his peak) who along the way is reported to have diabetes, broken and rebroken ankles, hip replacements, a heart attack, a stroke, while maintaining a prolific love life.

But the book's uniqueness and value is not easily summed up.  Sheed's accomplishment is to take the reader into a place where all of the counselors, physicans and self-help gurus rarely arrive, and he does so without a trace of self-pity, moralizing, or exhibitionism.  He uses his own experience to dissect addiction with an acute awareness, concentrated focus and indeed critical objectivity that practically make the book required reading for the layman and medical professional alike.<br />The writing is crisp, precise and direct, always nibbling at the edges of irony and paradox and capable of surprising in every sentence.  Admittedly, some addictive personalities might not recognize themselves in Sheed's ironic, commonsensical narrator and consequently be put off from playing his game. Other readers will find it hard to put the book down, even though their own experiences may bear little resemblance to the narrator's. Rather than take us through the valley of despair, Sheed practically acknowledges depression as a \\"given,\\" indicating that a writer like William Styron (\\"Darkness Visible\\") has already covered this territory. Sheed's focus, rather, is on the \\"other side\\" of the illness, where the narrator's wit and dogged perseverance are more than a match for the worst that life can deal him.<br />Not that Sheed takes depression lightly or, thank God, his own competencies very seriously. But he wants his reader to know that even apart from religious faith and popular therapies \\"depression ends\\" and \\"if you can just hang in there, avoiding downer-uppers and upper-downers, whether you're addicted to them or not, life will eventually make it up to you.\\" Pronouncements such as this come off not as glib advice but as eloquent and \\"earned\\" observations based on the evidence of the narrator's meticulously represented experiences.<br />Whether due to his non-American birthplace, his residual Catholicism, or his initial encounter with an \\"external\\" foe like polio, Sheed's narrator has few regrets about anything--wasted time (30 years of alcohol and pills), neglected friends and relatives, or even any of his afflictions (a word he would probably resist--\\"challenges,\\" maybe). The closest thing to an \\"antagonist\\" in the book is A.A., whose absolutist pronouncements and homogenizing practices could not help but rub an independent mind and feisty spirit like Sheed's the wrong way.<br />The result is a book that neither the author nor those close to him need have any morning-after regrets about. For the reader it's an experience guaranteed to produce no tears--unless from laughter over the narrator's numerous predicaments and felicitous verbal counterpunches. The book offers not only a celebration of life (and of writing) but a character you would love to meet and chat with--about baseball, booze, broads, Duke Ellington, or just about anything else that comes to mind.<br />(In the new edition Sheed's afterword indicates that on the day of his book's publication he was subjected to removal of part of his jaw. Apparently the game is in extra innings, but count on this combative player to get at least three good cuts at the ball.

His name appears constantly on CD liner notes, his voice is regularly heard on NPR, and his face appears on television whenever an assessment of a recently expired pop star or jazz great is called for.  It stands to reason that his opinions wield influence, so as a champion of the music that is the subject of his discourse, I can only hope that his pronouncements are for the better.<br />In most instances, his judgements seem sound, and he usually expresses them with a directness and verve that make for engaging reading.  Among the better moments in the book are his dismissal of a Michael Feinstein, a Johnny Mathis, or an Andy Williams as subjects worthy of discussion in a serious book about American popular music.<br />The musicians he devotes chapters to are all deserving, and he provides no small amount of insight into the historical significance and unique talents of his subjects.  Still, he can strain a bit too hard to make a case for a singer such as Bing Crosby, proclaiming him a better all-around musician than Sinatra and insisting that the man, if anything, got better with the passing of time.  I get the sense that Friedwald knows quite a bit about music, but perhaps not quite enough.  And it's not clear that he's ever had much experience performing music.  If he had, he'd be more aware of the differences in vocal production, say, between a stand-up singer and a pianist-singer.  Or of the kind of risk that is present not only in Sinatra's persona but in the approach to a lyric and its elocution that are part of his music.  Bing may have a good ear and good time, but even on his noisy (thanks to Bregman's orchestration) Sinatra-style 1950's session, his time is leaden.  He's thinking two-beat instead of 4/4 swing, and he plops his syllables right on top of each beat in order to be able to &quot;think&quot; the 2nd beat that characterizes his Dixieland approach.<br />But if there's any genuine disappointment with the book, it's with what's been left out.

D. dissertation--muted claims and qualifiers, allusions to the Frankfort School, periodic summaries--but it's a lucid, jargon-free beginning of a conversation that's long overdue.  Many great American texts (literary as well as cinematic) have been excluded from academic canons and college reading lists on the grounds that they don't belong in the ironic, modernist tradition.  By showing that melodrama is modernity's child, not its antithesis, Singer invites us to pay serious attention to texts whose only crime may be full disclosure of meaning and undeniable influencing of the witness.	2002-11-13

At a time in history when most Americans place as their highest priority &quot;safety,&quot; the church is looked to as a protective sanctuary and the preacher as a minister of comfort and assurance.  As a &quot;PK,&quot; I can attest to the pressure of pleasing parishioners while witnessing to a faith that is real.  It has destroyed many a preacher.<br />Danielson manages to locate a place of equilibrium and, though his account may produce discomfort in readers who recognize themselves among the church community, it is primarily about the preacher's own quest.  He's part Don Quixote, part Sancho Panza, constantly negotiating between competing interests in the visible and invisible church, in the world at large and the world within.<br />The prose has an exactness, a directness, a measured balance not always found in chronicles of faith.  Its readability offers the non-ordained an opportunity to gain a glimpse of the odyssey of the parish pastor as well as an opportunity to see in the author's quest striking similarities with the journeys of all of us who try to believe.	2002-11-09

Eliot's poetry as testimony to his possibly being the greatest poet ever.  Such an evaluation practically proves Eliot's insistent point about the cultural impoverishment of the present.<br /><br />Indeed, Browning's masterwork may very well be the ultimate poetic epic in the English language, rivaled certainly not by Spenser, Wordsworth, and Pound but only by Chaucer and Milton.  The fact that even the \\"trial of the century\\"--the O. J. Simpson case--did not produce widespread renewed interest in its literary predecessor and equivalent would produce surprise and disappointment were I not so aware that, outside of Shakespeare, the academic canon has been foreshortened (and engendered) to a tradition that begins with Virginia Woolf and ends with Sylvia Plath.<br /><br />In \\"Ring and the Book\\" Browning takes the sordid event of an enraged husband murdering his helpless bride--the daughter of a prostitute and rescue project of a priest--to \\"explain the ways of God to man.\\"  The reader of the poem becomes, in effect, a \\"privileged\\" juror in the trial of the murderer, positioned through Browning's protean and powerful rhetoric within the consciousness of each of the principals before finally being enabled to glimpse the \\"truth\\" that affords meaning to human mutability and suffering.<br /><br />The poem no doubt will remain in dust closets, largely unread even by literature Ph.D's.  But there's little chance of its ever becoming lost.  Like the priest-hero of the poem, a few priests of the imagination will ever so often make the poem's discovery and be lured into the quest of pursuing its singular meanings.<br /><br />[A reader recently wrote asking me about this edition, which led to the discovery that Amazon often uses the same review for any and every edition!  (Be careful about ordering used editions for the same reason.)  I was referring to the Penguin edition, which is now out of print.  Beware of the \\"Kessinger Edition,\\" which is really no edition at all but a bootleg, an uncredited reprint.  Moreover, it's the version that a search of the title is apt to take you to.

Eliot: Collected Poems, 1909-1962 (The Centenary Edition)	Books	5	23	36	N	N	Overrated (but deservedly so)	The most discussed, frequently invoked 20th-century poet in both American as well as British literature academic arenas (the advantage of a St. Louis birth place and brief Harvard education), Eliot offers toe-holds, certainties, and assurances to readers even as he satisfies their need to proclaim their own latter-day modernity. Compare Eliot to his immediate predecessor, Mathew Arnold, the man-of-letters, poet, and cultural critic of his time. Like Eliot's, Arnold's poetic output was relatively modest, and his cultural criticism, like Eliot's, exposed the barrenness, fragmentation, excessive subjectivity and self-consciousness of the present while proclaiming the triumphant unity, objectivity, and visionary perspective of an earlier poetry.<br />But whereas Arnold lays upon the reader the onerous project of reclaiming Greek epic and tragedy, Eliot asks us merely to make touch with the archetypal landscape of the unconscious self and to reclaim the concrete and clever poetry of Shakespeare's immediate descendants, the \\"Metaphysics.\\" And whereas Arnold in his poetry struggles to overcome his own romanticism, more often than not demonstrating an inability to produce poetry capable of rising above repetitious elegy and brooding despair, Eliot's offers us a body of work that is remarkably coherent, whole, of a piece.<br />In the poetry from \\"Prufrock\\" through \\"The Wasteland\\" and \\"Hollow Men,\\" the themes and patterns of the collective unconscious provide a solid, dependable substratum to the motifs, the repeated cultural \\"fragments,\\" the objective correlatives which occur and recur until, more than in any other poetry, they lodge indelibly, memorably in the reader's consciousness. In the poetry from \\"Ash Wednesday\\" to \\"Four Quartets\\" the seemingly unconnected images and objective correlatives achieve grammatical order and thematic coherence through their elevation to the sacramental, to a vision of the \\"word\\" not as the product of the self's struggle with the deep regions of the unconscious but as the incarnation of meaning descending from higher realms of purification and grace.<br />As the foremost representative, even prototype, of literary \\"modernism,\\" Eliot's work is at the same time as neat and tidy a body of poetry as that produced by any other poet--orderly to the point of being anal. It's little wonder that he retains his interest and popularity.

Michener is far more than a captivating storyteller, collector of colorful characters, painter of vivid natural imagery, and documentor of the orchestrations of world warfare. Each of the \\"tales\\" comprising his carefully-constructed epic narrative is at once thematically and stylistically related to the other smaller narratives and at the same time artistically whole in itself.<br /><br />If the reader has expectations of a single-minded patriotic paean to the fighting men of the South Pacific, a close reading of the early chapter, \\"Mutiny,\\" should dispel any such illusions. Here, as throughout the book, Michener uses nature and the ocean as a test, a touchstone, and a foil--exposing the folly not just of warring nations and military campaigns but of arrogant, imperialist civilizations and many of their prideful citizens. Tony Fry, his anti-authoritarian, compassionate \\"hero,\\" commits a subversive act that links him with the mutineers on board the Bounty and casts the American command in the role of Bligh and Hitler! In the next story, \\"Cave,\\" Fry emerges as a war-time philosopher whose meditations on courage move him to acts of selfless, Christ-like charity.  In \\"Boar's Tooth\\" Fry is able to overcome his resistance to a primitive religious ritual involving pain and sacrifice as he contrasts it with the empty and self-serving practices of modern religion.<br /><br />The American fighting men and women who come to the South Pacific bring no small amount of baggage from a flawed social order back home, and Michener's heroes are not simply the individuals who perform fearlessly in combat: they're just as likely to be the narrow-minded Americans who are transformed by their experiences in the South Pacific into better human beings. \\"Our Heroine,\\" the story of Nellie Forbush, is a shocking expose of racism, delivering a reeling blow comparable to explosive moments in Flannery O'Connor or Faulkner. When Nellie learns that her fiance's former lover is dead and rejoices not because a rival has been removed but because a black person has been eliminated, she would seem to be beyond the redemption experienced even by O'Connor's most degenerate souls. But in an earlier story about \\"the Remittance Man\\" Michener's narrator has constructed a definition of heroism based on courage and an exclusive vision of the sacred status of all human life, allowing us to see how Nellie's eventual change of heart qualifies her for inclusion among the company of true heroes.<br /><br />The famous Bali Hai chapter (\\"Fo' Dolla\\"), far from an escapist love story, is at once romantic tragedy in the tradition of \\"Madame Butterfly\\" and tragicomedy in its portrayal of accessory characters who recall the nurse and friar in \\"Romeo & Juliet.\\" And once again the narrative's definition of the \\"heroic\\" allows us to see the tragedy play out not merely as a tale of star-crossed lovers but as a drama of choices and their painful consequences. In each case the act precedes and produces illumination: Joe Cable's venture into Bali Hai and the Dionysian produces self-discovery because ultimately it becomes a \\"shared discourse\\" with his dark-skinned, native lover, who turns out to be a \\"real person\\" with a history of her own.<br /><br />Michener is as likely to locate the heroic away from the war as on island battlefields or the Pacific main, because his real subject is human nature and the courage to live in the face of obstacles both natural and human. To their credit, Rodgers and Hammerstein detected (and partially, if unevenly, captured) the strength in Michener's novel: Each of us has a Bali Hai, and our failures to reach it can be traced as much to failures of courage and vision as to the ironclad circumstances of existence.rable to explosive moments in Flannery O'Connor or Faulkner.

Much work remains to be done to rescue from academic dismissal on the grounds that it is &quot;melodramatic&quot; not just a significant body of film but of literature and music as well.  But the author of this book-polemic ignores the aesthetic while politicizing the theoretical.  His representation of gender roles in the &quot;world at large,&quot; moreover, is no less Manichean than the narrative worlds that are the subject of his discourse.  Women suffer under &quot;patriarchy&quot; (mainly because Lacanian theorists and the likes of Catherine McKinnon say so), and the oppressive power relations evident in cinematic melodrama should make us want to address life's gravest problems, which can all ultimately be traced to the rule of patriarchy.<br />This book may prove useful to a few readers as an introduction to some major currents in 1980s French post-structuralist theory, but it falls far short in addressing the aesthetics or pleasures of the texts it examines let alone the challenging field of &quot;music drama.&quot;	2002-10-28

It's true that Ferber plays out the emotions of her characters, but she's equally adept at keeping those emotions in play.  Her voice is so vital and strong, her narrative so multilayered in its social-psychological-cultural-archetypal meanings, that an open-minded reader cannot fail to become swept up in the force of her storytelling.  Moreover, in her characterization of Magnolia, who defends her unstable marriage against her daughter's staid one and who prefers the tenderloin districts to the churches and parks of Chicago, Ferber reveals the subversiveness of a true artist, making the reader question common assumptions about the dual gods of \\"success\\" and \\"progress.\\"<br /><br />The river and the theater are not only Ferber's favorite settings but her metaphors for exploring the life of consciousness and explaining the forces that shape personality.  Even when Gaylord and Magnolia abandon the river and take up residence in Chicago, the river lives in them, exposing by its constantly-felt presence what is alive and dead, what is enduring and transitory. Magnolia's daughter and her husband, the \\"new\\" American theater of New York, the \\"reformed\\" Chicago--all these are condemned less in the surface narrative than in the energy Ferber brings to the subjects that are closer to her heart: characters and places whose life traces its wellsprings to the river.<br /><br />This is melodrama (\\"music drama') in the best sense of the word--Ferber's prose evoking the musical elements that invest the narrative with fullness and necessity. The African-American spirituals and folk songs that provide Magnolia's education in turn inform the reader of her values and understandings through the course of her life's journey.  Moreover, the narrative's movement matches the river's: it creates unexpected channels, moving forward in time, then backward, a device that enables the narrative to provide a perspective on the past as something familiar, as a place we already know and treasure, a \\"spot of time\\" we've been missing and to which we wish to return.<br /><br />But the melodrama also works here because Ferber constantly blurs the line between theater and life, letting us in on the \\"backstage\\" action that goes into playing a role and preparing a face. Magnolia blossoms only when she is on the stage, and Gaylord is never closer to authenticity than when he becomes an actor long enough to woo and marry Magnolia. Because Ferber presents her characters as deliberately assuming melodramatic parts, we don't see them as stereotypes as much as fellow beings taking on the roles required of us all to deal with life's changes as symbolized by the river.<br /><br />The musical version has a happy ending, with no deaths, no permanent damage. The sentiments in Ferber's original, on the other hand, are at once higher and deeper--equal parts elegy, stoicism, endurance, resolve. Ferber's last sentence describing Magnolia is a replication of an earlier sentence describing her mother: \\"The river, the show boat, the straight silent figure were lost to view.\\" By this time Ferber's words have become such an integral part of the reader's consciousness that there's little chance any of these three images will be lost to view.erber's prose evoking the musical elements that invest the narrative with fullness and necessity.

The sketches, retrospectives and evaluations in this collection are guaranteed to inform as well as provide fresh perspectives on things already known.  Perhaps Feather and Hentoff are better at providing some of the first-hand personal information that helps a reader join the music to the musician, the musician to the human being.  The making of this music does not come without great physical risks and costs, and it's always fascinated me how jazz artists have come to terms and compensated for weakened chops (Diz), altered timbre (Sarah), or a foreclosing mortage on one's time (Duke).  Perhaps it's to his credit that Giddins avoids the merely anecdotal along with amateur psychologizing, though such details can often spell the difference between the glimpse that is insightful and the one that is memorable.	2002-08-14

But the success of writers like Tom Brokaw and Ann Coulter has not escaped him, for in his comfortably, accessibly titled &quot;What's So Great About America,&quot; his thinking process has been calcified into the ideological nuggets and bromides that are sure to be snapped up not so much by the thinking conservative as the mainstream consumer who flies an American flag on his SUV.  D'Souza certainly understands that the strength of the American community lies not in its superiority to Moslem or Communist nations but in its religious tolerance, protection of civil liberties, and free exchange of ideas.  Yet in this book, the first that is unworthy of his abilities, he jumps on the 9-11 bandwagon with a chauvinistic &quot;love it or leave it&quot; theme that he no doubt hopes will put him on the road to the material &quot;greatness&quot; that apparently even the best confuse with the American dream.	2002-07-29

Their \\"literary personae\\"--of themselves as well as their characters--are not necessarily identical with their own or their characters' actual selves. In \\"The Final Days\\" Barbara Olson creates, on the one hand, the picture of an arrogant, wildly irresponsible, yet strangely fatuous president and, on the other, an \\"omniscient\\" narrator passionately devoted to exposing his carefully guarded inner core. Mr. Clinton does not eat food but \\"wolfs\\" it down; he does not hear applause but \\"basks in public acclaim\\"; he doesn't give a farewell speech, he \\"does a George Washington\\"; even the evidence of a photo of his resigned features misrepresents the \\"fact\\" of his internal ambition. And should we have any doubts about the actual extent of his hubris, the narrator compares the seventh day of the God of Genesis with this president's Sabbath: \\"the Baptist president decided he [in italics] was not going to waste his [in italics] final days.\\"<br />As an example of much present-day political writing, of so-called inside-the-beltline brawling, \\"Final Days\\" delivers the goods, creating memorable, bigger-than-life portraits of its two main characters--a deceiving yet self-deceived emperor and an undeceived narrator determined to show there are no clothes. True, it's acrimonious prose that probably makes no fewer assumptions than it accuses its subject of making--in fact, the fire and passion is reminiscent of the famed gloves-off, verbal sparring matches for which writers like Milton, Dryden, Pope, and even Dr. Johnson himself were renowned. Whether the book deserves high marks as \\"history\\" or \\"reportage\\" I leave to the scholars and political scientists.  But Washington books seem to belong to a different genre requiring different criteria.	2002-06-27

This work, along with James Baldwin's short story, \\"Sonny's Blues,\\" is as good as any I've read about the jazz life, its creators and innovators, and the high cost of such terrible beauty. I had the advantage of being present while Lester was lost on stage in an alcoholic stupor; Monk was dancing around the piano, knocking over cymbals, rather than playing the instrument; Chet Baker, unable to stand, was expending his last breaths on \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\"; and Duke was waiting for Harry Carney to swing by with the car to chauffeur him through the wintry night from Kenosha, Wisconsin to Kansas City.  But how a young writer like Dyer managed to capture these moments before his time, freezing them unforgettably in a literary living moment, I can't imagine.<br />Dyer knows that the foremost responsibility of a music critic is not to critique but to verbalize his non-verbal subject, bringing it to life for the reader. He does so admirably, creating believable, recognizable, fascinating portraits in unlabored, unpretentious prose.<br />His portraits of the artist ring completely true to the ears of this fellow observer--penetrating glimpses of the creative child trapped in a man's body now reduced to fighting a losing battle against physical and mental entropy.  Yet his faith in the living tradition of jazz is  refreshing, as is his characterization of the jazz musician's struggle as a valiant contest with the precursor, not unlike that of the strong poet's.<br />Though there's an elegaic tone throughout the book, it's never ponderous or depressing. In fact, its human portraits are more likely to interest newcomers than the many text books that catalog styles and names.<br />This is not to say the book is without shortcomings. The author is much better at capturing the musicians for us than their music. And his appreciation and understanding of Duke Ellington's music seems somewhat limited. Too bad he didn't give at least as much attention to the colorful cast of characters on the band bus as to the private conveyance preferred by Duke.<br />Yet any listener who has the slightest interest in jazz and its makers simply cannot afford to pass this one up.

Still, I find myself making more use of this book than any other about Old Blue.	2002-06-10

Far too often in this book I sense that the author's instructions to the user about \\"how\\" to do things are counterproductive to what the program practically forces you to do all by itself.  Rather I would have preferred more explanation of \\"what\\" the program does.  For example, music files used by iTunes appear in 3 places--the iTunes folder, the iTunes library, the user's playlist.  But it still isn't clear to me what the exact distinction is among them.  Also, since the program permits multiple compression settings as well as no compression, can a user decompress and recompress without affecting audio quality of a given file?  And the author, like many Mac users, touts \\"Toast\\" but without clearly explaining the advantages of a relatively expensive software program that essentially duplicates iTunes. Then there are questions about whether to burn with virtual memory on or off, along with questions about how many files a hard drive can support before performance is affected, that are neglected or only partially addressed.<br />The author makes a few good points--for example, most web sites promising MP-3 downloads simply aren't worth the bother--but not enough to justify the cost of the book, especially now that both iTunes version one and Napster are history.	2002-06-06

I have to wonder if the impressive endorsements on the back cover (by Sammy Cahn, Steve Allen, Michael Feinstein) are from musical celebrities who actually read the book.  The author deserves praise for bringing concentrated focus to and careful analysis of the lyrics of America's best wordsmiths, but this is not a book that seduces the reader into staying with it for extended stretches.  There's historical context, learned analysis of prosody with lots of concise examples, and pithy scholarly prose.  But when all is said and done, the chapters devoted to individual lyricists, as well as the book as a whole, are quite bloodless.  I don't sense any clear thesis, any driving passion, even any strong personal preferences from the author.<br />The author's justification for such a book--that composers of melody are given credit at the expense of the lyricist--strikes me as a bit of a straw man.  How many listeners can immediately associate a familiar popular standard with either its composer or lyricist?  Also, the analysis of prosody and technique often overshadows consideration of the thematic integrity, or meaning, of a song.  Moreover, the analyses pay too little heed to melody and harmony to make a persuasive case for the poetic power of the lyrics themselves.  Finally, with song lyrics how can you separate the dancer from the dance?  Were it not for Billie Holiday, Mabel Mercer and, above all, Frank Sinatra, most of these songs would be long forgotten.  Certainly some consideration of the actual performance of the lyrics would seem requisite to any demonstration of their continuing vitality and importance.<br />Most of the above challenges are met by a book to which the author frequently alludes--Gerald Mast's &quot;Can't Help Singin'.&quot;  Any reader interested in the art and lives of the composers and the songs, not to mention the lyricists and lyrics, cannot afford to pass by Mast's singular achievement.  In the neglected, taken-for-granted field of the American popular song, it remains the one &quot;must read.&quot;can popular song, it remains the one &quot;must read.&quot;	2002-06-04

Nevertheless, far from being exhaustive, the book is a starting point--one, moreover, that will inevitably soon be dated information.  For example, the authors' publication date doesn't permit them to consider the latest generation of flat-panel iMacs in their discussions.<br />Despite the book's length, I'm surprised that some additional paragraphs weren't devoted to matters such as converting analog audio and VHS tapes to video files suitable for burning, or copying, through use of the iMac.  The authors begin by assuming you'll be using \\"Sound Studio\\" to create audio files, but since their subsequent discussion soon promotes the advantages of using Roxio's \\"Toast,\\" it's unclear what the advantages of Sound Studio, if any, might be.  My question about how to equalize audio frequencies before burning was not addressed.  Moreover, it's not explained if either program is capable of automatically creating individual files from a multiple-track analog LP, as is the free shareware \\"Coaster.\\"<br />The discussion of \\"iTunes\\" is surprisingly brief, containing nothing not immediately observable from using the program.  Most disappointingly, the authors do not address the question of memory and disc space.  Is it important  that virtual memory be turned \\"off\\" while recording? More importantly, how many MP-3 audio files can be imported to the iTunes library or stored on the iMac's hard drive without affecting the machine's speed and performance?<br />As for digital video, I would have appreciated some discussion of converting VHS tape to digital files.  One school of thought says to use a \\"bridge\\" such as the Hollywood Dazzle; another says the job can be accomplished just as well if not better by most camcorders.  Which is right?  And if the latter, what particular camera is recommended?<br />Less talk about how to shoot a good movie and more about the hardware and software would have measurably enhanced the book's usefulness as far as this reader is concerned.ot a good movie and more about the hardware and software would have measurably enhanced the book's usefulness as far as this reader is concerned.	2002-05-30

Morath lays it on line--American popular standards constitute a body of classic, timeless musical literature composed between 1920 and 1960, songs that outshine anything that has been written since or will be in the foreseeable future.<br />The author defends his position persuasively, drawing a distinction between those performers who interpreted a shared musical literature vs. today's performers who compose and produce their own material.  He also explains how the theatrical contexts of songs from the so-called &quot;Golden Era&quot; led to material of uncommon craft, lyricism, depth and dramatic urgency.  Finally, the author makes it clear that the longevity of the songs owes as much to the performers as to the composers or original contexts.  From Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald to Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, Morath touches on virtually all the bases essential to understanding the art of American Popular Song and the lasting appeal of the &quot;standards.&quot;<br />Morath's book is a &quot;fast read&quot; and not especially useful as a reference work for anyone who knows the field.  The most informative, fascinating, and revealing account about American popular songs and their composers is still Gerald Mast's &quot;Can't  Help Singin',&quot; a largely unheralded work that easily outpaces the field.	2002-05-29

Unquestionably, Noonan has confronted the demons of depression, and this book in great measure is testimony to his valor, his candor, his good intentions to help others--not only through his own autobiographical account but through the exhaustive research to which it led him.<br />But while Noonan's narrative is self-confessional, it is also frequently self-serving.  His narrator leaves no doubt that he has experienced the worst that clinical depression has to offer and that \\"cure\\" is, at best, metaphoric for the day-by-day battle of coping, drawing upon every human and medicinal resource currently available.  He does not, however, register the utter, existential \\"despair\\" that can also accompany the disease, leaving its prey with no doubt whatsoever about the complete and total isolation of the self, about its insignificance and irrelevance to anything or anyone outside its own boundaries.<br />Noonan apparently has many friends, and they pop up all over the place, practically on very page.  They're there to listen to him, implore him, counsel him, shower him with unwanted gifts, and shower him with cold water to insure he makes it through his day.  And he has many transparent narrative \\"defenses.\\"  He's bright and disciplined enough to accomplish a lifetime of research on depressive illness, yet is capable of characterizing an incident of unprotected sex in which he was the active, not the passive, partner as no less than a voluntary act of suicide!  Subsequent encounters, like the first, find the narrator as the one solicited, not the solicitor.  He is quick to assure us that these incidents for him contained no pleasure.  And when he finally decides to stop them, the decision is characterized as a noble gesture of concern for those he may be infecting.  First, the reader cannot help but wonder if the unmistakable note of self-justification is any less self-serving than the disavowal of self-gratification. Second, when the narrator consults a friend who, as an expert on HIV, informs him that his behaviors are not of the sort to guarantee infection, we have to question this author's reliability as a spokesperson for the far more complex disease of depression.  Apparently he's capable of researching and presenting all of the scientific information about the psychopharmacological interactions within the neurotransmitters of the brain but is unaware of common, pamphlet knowledge that would have indicated his was not even moderate-risk, let alone suicidal, behavior.<br /><br />The above, granted, is but one instance, but there's something self-serving about this book, written by the son of a major entrepreneur in the antidepressant drug industry, that limits its value.  The author has constructed an elaborate edifice, fortified by generous amounts of research, annotations, and footnotes.  No doubt it serves him well, but to be served equally well, the reader may need to qualify some of the claims.  It's not a matter of sincerity (one senses the author very much believes his own narrative) but of integrity, albeit a relatively small matter.  For the discriminating, selective reader this is a book one might profit from.  Or, to quote Harold Bloom's endorsement on the back cover, it's an immensely readable, potentially useful \\"work of benign intelligence.\\"pert on HIV, informs him that his behaviors are not of the sort to guarantee infection, we have to question this author's reliability as a spokesperson for the far more complex disease of depression.

The genius of Winchester is his ability to keep the reader's focus on the object of the discourse even as he is delighting in the properties of his own discourse.  Readers who might be suspicious of the \\"overly\\" clever, self-referential and self-congratulatory language of a Joyce or Nabokov, a Roland Barthes or Umberto Eco, are less likely to have any hesitation about investing their trust in this author's direct and reliable narrator.  He's a storyteller of the first order, supplying all the corroborating, \\"factual\\" evidence we require to take him at his word.<br />But make no mistake about it: this author understands and plays the language game with the very best semioticians and post-structuralists, albeit without the literary fanfare. First, he understands the \\"arbitrary\\" connection between words and meanings, as his own virtuosic lexicon demonstrates along with his impressive historical research and his insistence on making it all cohere (e.g. the cause-effect connection he practically forces on Minor's tropical birthplace and overly active hormones). But 2nd, and more importantly, Winchester's gift is to be fully aware of, and receptive to, the other property of language: \\"serendipity.\\" The birthplace of Minor, for example, leads the author linguistically from \\"Ceylon\\" to \\"Sri Lanka\\" to \\"Serendib\\" to \\"serendipity,\\" just as the meanings associated with Victorian words soon lead to references to Ezra Pound and John Hinckley! The central action in the London slums that leads to Minor's imprisonment in turn leads the author back opportunistically to an earlier action of Minor's on the battlefields of the American Civil War.  It's Minor's branding of an Irishman that causes Minor to feel branded for the rest of his life, another of the author's many demonstrations that the naming of a thing can be as important to any writer's view of \\"history\\" as the thing named.<br />Winchester not only writes circles around most \\"historians\\" but writes \\"truer\\" as well. He compels us into believing every word of his story while finally commanding our respect both for his literary dexterity and the inexhaustible potential of language itself. And in the end, in the last paragraph of the book's \\"Acknowledgements,\\" it isn't Winchester or Murray or Minor or the OED that's singled out for the final bows: rather it's language itself or, as the author puts it, the \\"serendipitous moment\\" that only it can provide.ry\\" as the thing named.<br />Winchester not only writes circles around most \\"historians\\" but writes \\"truer\\" as well.

For teachers looking for something between a comprehensive collection of the dialogues and a photocopied hand-out, this little edition nicely fits the bill.  It's an extremely user-friendly translation with a generous introduction and copious but clear and concise endnotes.  The editor admittedly errs on the side of verbosity in the introduction, going to excessive (not to mention gratuitous) lengths to argue that the &#34;Crito&#34; is not inconsistent with the &#34;Apology.&#34;  Also, rather than substituting &#34;defense&#34; for &#34;apology&#34; and &#34; goodness&#34; for &#34;virtue,&#34; he might have accomplished the goal of a clear and accessible edition by giving the reader a bit more credit.

I found those but, in addition, some things I hadn't counted on. The book is, above all, a rite of passage of the artist, a deep and dark psychological journey into a landscape not merely of memory but of pained consciousness, scarred emotions, and lost but not entirely relinquished innocense.<br /><br />Younger readers are unlikely to understand fully, or even make much sense out of, the novel's two juxtaposed, climactic chapters.  In \\"The Monkey Garden,\\" the archetypal playground of innocence becomes a violently contradictory semantic playing field in which words and meanings dissociate, contradict one another, then break down completely somewhere in between the narrator's death wish and her \\"savior\\" complex.  Then, without giving the reader a respite, the narrator transfers her hurt from thwarted rescuer of the innocent victim to angry accuser of the presumed victim as in fact betrayer--the same friend whose name (\\"Sally\\") resonates, shrilly and eerily, obsessively and unremittingly through the grotesque carnival that replaces the violated garden.  The narrator's imagery in this chapter, entitled \\"Red Clowns,\\" suggests literal rape, though the preceding contradictory emotions and sonorous language argue more for a metaphoric interpretation.  Either way, her rage over the betrayal of her childhood garden of innocense by her close friend makes the imagery of ravishment at once less distant and more horrifying for its violation of our own linguistic space: once implanted, the narrator's language can't be dislodged from our consciousness.<br /><br />Have we experienced an odyssey of the artist's self or a traumatic event represented metaphorically as a harrowing ride on a carnival tilt-a-whirl?  In the novel's last chapter, the narrator admits, \\"I like to tell stories. I tell them inside my head.\\" Then she proclaims her escape from the house on Mango Street to a Woolf-like \\"house\\" of her own.  And, by the way, she will return to Mango Street one day. I'm sure she will--whether as a welcomed celebrity or as an artist haunted by her past. But that statement sounds to this reader more like \\"forced\\" conclusion than \\"earned\\" closure.  It's one of the few notes in this brief but provocative novel that doesn't ring true.them inside my head.\\" Then she proclaims her escape from the house on Mango Street to a Woolf-like \\"house\\" of her own.

I've enjoyed Pettinger's unpretentious study of Evans' life and music as much as any comparable jazz title that comes to mind.  The British author admits that he never met Bill Evans and has little to offer in the way of exclusive, privileged information about a subject whose personal habits might tempt lesser writers to manufacture salacious prose along with much amateur psychoanalyzing.  Having lowered the expectations, Pettinger proceeds to give a personal biography of the man and chronological account of the musical career that is ultimately a remarkably illuminating portrait of a jazz artist.<br />Admittedly, the book is essential reading primarily for the listener who already counts himself among Evans' admirers and is aware of the pianist's artistry and influence.  More than likely, such a reader will find many of his suspicions validated--from the pianist's rigorous classical training to his self-effacing personality to his discomfort as a member of Miles Davis' Quintet to his creative rejuvenation during the last year and months of his life.  In addition, he will undoubtedly discover, on practically every page, something unexpected--Evans' affinity for Russian language and culture (clearly demonstrated on the pianist's brooding, darkly dramatic, extended introductions to &quot;Nardis&quot;), his curious attraction to garish '70's clothing styles, his strange personal and musical relationship with &quot;speed&quot; buddy Philly Joe Jones.<br />Pettinger knows enough about music, pianos, and piano playing to insure that his discussion of the music is accessible and instructive without becoming erudite or pedantic.  Although it would be, in my opinion, impossible to overstate the influence, sophistication, and singular beauty of Evans' music, Pettinger wisely does not try to do so.  The definitive work on the extraordinary moment in music history for which Evans is responsible remains to be written.  But Pettinger's book is certainly a worthy start.  And the plentiful discography is clearly presented and annotated--in itself worth the price of the book to any collector of Evans'  extraordinary recorded legacy.lentiful discography is clearly presented and annotated--in itself worth the price of the book to any collector of Evans'  extraordinary recorded legacy.	2002-01-28

I didn't even find the book of much use when I wanted some reminders of plot sequence and characters' names.<br />Perhaps I expected too much for my money as a result of reading this same series' &quot;The Birds&quot; by Camille Paglia (who obviously immersed herself in an exhaustive research of the filmmaking process as well as the final product).

My son laughs at me for reading books about what everyone else does intuitively: use their computer. But I'm an old-fashioned, &quot;hard-copy&quot; kind of guy who reads manuals thoroughly and does a lot of underlining. Pogue's &quot;Dummies&quot; books have always impressed me as the best of the Dummies series as well as the most helpful Mac books, having gotten me through many a tight spot. But whatever possessed me to purchase this volume, which I frankly hadn't &quot;missed&quot; until reading it was &quot;missing,&quot; I'll never know.<br />After reading the first 20 pages, I confess I'm overwhelmed and out of patience. If you didn't already know, Macintosh operating systems permit you to execute the same function any number of a zillion ways--with the mouse alone, with the keyboard, with a combination of the two, with multiple other inflections and variations. Do I need this information? Will it same me time? As a musician, I'd compare it to picking up one of those method books that give you hundreds of ways of altering, voicing, substituting for a C chord.  I'd rather play music.<br />This book goes on the reference shelf. Skimming the table of contents, I don't see anything that isn't addressed in Pogue's other Mac books, but should I ever get out of a bind as a result of consulting the Missing Manual, I'll gladly change my rating to 5 stars. For the present, I hope the author has no plans of abandoning the reader-friendly style of the Dummies series.	2001-12-21

If there's one sure way to make money, it would seem be getting on board the financial information industry.<br />There was a time when money and finances were seen as a means to the good life; today the good life is one that offers you the luxury of tweaking your funds, stocks and finances on a daily basis.

Marlowe makes it clear that the real horror exists within the human soul and that failure to recognize and enunciate its existence is the difference between being saved or damned in a world whose bright shining lies continually lead us astray.<br />In reading the story the first time, it's probably best to go for &quot;content,&quot; extracting as much plot and characterization as possible from Conrad's multi-layered, impressionistic narrative. Marlowe says his mission is to make us &quot;see,&quot; perhaps the motivation for Coppola's film adaptation, &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; which like Marlowe's narrative is hung on three stations that mark Marlowe's trip up the river, his journey into the heart of darkness.<br />When reading the narrative a second time, ignore the plot as well as the &quot;sights&quot; Marlowe provides. Listen very hard to the words of Marlowe's narration. Notice the &quot;tone.&quot;  Marlowe will vary it, even in a single sentence, from amusing understatement to biting irony to sarcastic overstatement.

This was an impulse purchase.  The slimly-stocked bookstore I occasionally patronize (when I'm not online) had it prominently displayed on the counter.  After reading the blurb on the back cover--&quot;most honest, well-researched, informative book about total health&quot;--I felt as though I must be the only consumer on the planet not benefiting from its wisdom.<br />Now that I've read the book's 400+ pages (many of them taken up with recipes), I'm having difficulty recalling a single fresh insight, useful bit of information, or well-turned phrase about overly familiar, commensensical lore.  Nor is there enough information to justify the book's taking up space on my shelf as a reference book.<br />Dr. Taub's mantra is &quot;Everything in moderation, including moderation.&quot;  The phrase certainly fits the easy-reading approach of the book, which touts the usual virtues in general, conversational, flaccid prose--eat healthy, supplement with vitamins, exercise regularly, meditate away stress and keep a positive attitude.<br />In retrospect, two of Dr. Taub's points stand out.  First, he's strongly pro-breast feeding and adamantly opposed to anyone of any age drinking cow's milk (&quot;Consumers Reports&quot; has since investigated this issue and exonerated the dairy industry); second, he acknowledges the role of &quot;entropy&quot; in the life cyle of every human being.  Comparing human development to the seasons, the stages of human beings to the natural cyles of the physical world, Dr. Taub is able, at least in the early pages, to disabuse readers of any illusions about the extent to which it is possible to turn back the clock.  In this respect, perhaps the book distinguishes itself from many competing titles in the cluttered, frequently exploitive, universe of consumer health information.	2001-10-10

Hepinstall can construct a suspenseful plot, draw sharply distinct characterizations, turn many a colorful phrase. The novel should spark the imagination of younger readers, but as a female coming-of-age story, &quot;The Absence of Nectar&quot; may disappoint readers with more sophisticated literary tastes.  The theme of the intruding father-figure is not simply a subconscious Freudian archetype but a literal, actual experience for large numbers of young people in American society. Hepinstall's story foregrounds such a family dynamic, drawing up familiar battle lines of child vs. adult male competing for the mother's love, trust and approval. But the resolution of the conflict is more wish fulfillment than a realistic, insightful or genuinely therapeutic portrayal.<br />Admittedly, the novel will rate higher with readers requiring no more nor less than an engaging read.  This is the kind of fiction that hooked many of us on literature in the first place, leading us to narratives whose difficulties could be resolved only in the reader's imagination.	2001-09-29

I'm always looking for a hip, current, female coming-of-age narrative to complement &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; in some of my classes. The most impressive story I've come across so far--Deborah Eisenberg's &quot;What It Was Like, Seeing Chris&quot;--is a bit sophisticated and elusive for younger readers to handle on their own.  But &quot;Carousel&quot; is accessible as well as rewarding at the level of descriptive and metaphoric language (the carousel of the title, which refers to the old Disneyland ride, also symbolizes the narrator's leaving behind childish ways and even resonates with the carousel near the end of Holden's quest).<br />Initially I gave the novel 4 stars.  Impressive as it is, it's no match for a dazzling debut such as Donna Tartt's &quot;The Secret History.&quot;  But when I look at the lists of current best-sellers, when I read nothing but pages and pages of plodding plot summary from college-age students, and when I see a literary landscape increasingly cluttered with &quot;fantasy&quot; fiction, it's easy to develop a fuller appreciation for a literary talent like Tennant's.<br />This is &quot;authentic&quot; imaginative literature.  It's less about &quot;captivating&quot; (i.e. capturing) the reader's imagination than educating, or liberating, it.  The author's narrative style leaves room for genuine &quot;interpretation,&quot; for &quot;making&quot; as well as &quot;receiving&quot; meaning from the evocative patterns of imagery.  Readers of &quot;Carousel of Progress&quot; are, like the novel's protagonist, challenged to abandon infantile carousels and cultivate, rather than surrender, their imaginations.<br />For the attentive, creative reader the novel holds many rewards--the love/hate relationship between mother and daughter, the portrayal of a double rite-of-passage (mother's as well as daughter's), the touching brother-sister bond, and the tensions between the teen-age Meredith who is the subject of the narration and the considerably older Meredith who tells the story.<br />Admittedly, the narration occasionally takes on a one-sided quality. More often than not, it is Meredith who plays parent to her childish, self-absorbed parents. And her account contains no small amount of male bashing, with Meredith's father being the first of a succession of male figures distinguished by their immaturity, egocentricity and flagrant disregard for the sensitive female protagonist. As a result, the climactic moment at which Meredith tells us she loves her father seemed &quot;forced&quot; to this reader--perhaps more reflective of the mature narrator than the 16-year-old who is the subject of her story.<br />These minor reservations aside, &quot;Carousel of Progress&quot; is a promising debut and an engaging work of literature. Like Holden, Meredith has a real nose for what's phony as well as a creative capacity for fabricating various roles in her search for identity and belonging. The novel is full of Meredith's humorous snapshots of friends and family as well as explicit sexual description that reflects the importance of these matters in young people's lives without gratuitous exploiting of the subject (in fact, I'd welcome the opportunity to defend the novel's treatment of sex before some PTA group). For the present, at least, I'm quite satisfied to be a matchmaker for the always stimulating Holden.older Meredith who tells the story. <br />Admittedly, the narration occasionally takes on a one-sided quality.

Since there's less difference between post-structuralism and post-modernism than between the two &quot;comic books&quot; this series devotes to the two terms, readers may wish to know which one to purchase. I found Powell's book on postmodernism considerably more readable than its cousin, partly because of the subject (&quot;postmodern&quot; entails an era as well as a theory and, moreover, is inextricably bound up with popular culture) but also because of Powell's style and approach: The book's narrative, map, and examples not only steer the reader through the potential clutter but keep him sufficiently interested and entertained to become informed. Moreover, Powell covers (with the exception of Jacques Lacan) the major thinkers dealt with in this same series' introduction to post-structuralism.<br />The author manages to maintain sufficient detachment from his subject to provide perspective and levity while at the same time taking it seriously enough to provide a substantial explanation of the causes and symptoms of postmodernism, a decoding of its formidable jargon, and a lucid explication of difficult writers such as Baudrillard and Jameson. He also addresses key questions such as the difference between modernism and postmodernism, post-structuralism and post-modernism (let me put it this way: the former &quot;reads&quot; the text of verbal signs, or words; the latter reads the text of visual signs, or images).<br />A couple of caveats: Deconstructionists, post-modernists, etc. tend to take themselves very seriously, ironically adopting reactionary positions and political ideologies no less rigid than the &quot;logocentric&quot; views they originally challenged. Also, in many respects the media culture changes so quickly and unexpectedly that even &quot;pomo&quot; gurus like Baudrillard can suddenly look quaintly old-fashioned and dated.<br />Finally, post-structuralism, deconstruction, postmodernism are primarily words of the academy; their value as currency, moreover, rapidly diminished after the 1980s.  But because so many young academics, graduate students, and sophomoric philosopher-dilettantes invested so much of themselves in learning French theory (often at the expense of studying the objects of inquiry), they tend to overestimate its importance on the present-day scene, imposing it upon bewildered young students having difficulty weighing its actual importance. The author's plan does not include a critique of &quot;postmodernism,&quot; but had he room for an additional chapter, he might well have considered providing one.moreover, rapidly diminished after the 1980s.

The themes are predictable, repetitious, derivative. So the value of the text largely comes down to a question of the author's rhetoric.<br />Though a practitioner of the Alexander technique, Bacci is open to numerous complementary systems, most particularly those Eastern views of self that emphasize &quot;being&quot; over &quot;doing,&quot; that locate success and failure in personal consciousness, not in individual performance or in the products of the Western Puritanical work ethic. Through numerous engaging examples, illustrations, explanations she manages to be an effective and inspirational &quot;coach-teacher.&quot; While making it clear that living effortlessly requires the effort of concentration and practice, she makes the goal seem both worth while and accessible.<br />Besides stressing and suggesting ways of heightening personal consciousness, Professor Bacci incorporates many elements from what used to be called &quot;transactional analysis.&quot; Once we stop trying to prove our worth through our accomplishments, we can began to approach human relationships from a more mature, less exasperating perspective. More often than not, her points strike home. And when she comes up with an occasional lame illustration, she almost invariably follows it up with a real &quot;zinger.&quot; I can attest that I felt energized and empowered after reading some of the chapters.<br />While Professor Bacci's approach strikes me as a valuable counterbalance to the present-day obsession with measuring success and failure in the materialist terms of society at large, the reader may at the same time feel compelled to qualify some of her own positions as extreme. For example, focusing on what we feel in the moment can certainly lead to heightened consciousness and increased self-awareness. At the same time, happiness is as likely to be a by-product of the pursuit of a goal external to the self as the object of pursuit itself. Also, while it is true that confronting, or &quot;being with,&quot; the experience of pain can paradoxically release constricted nerve centers in the body (here Bacci sounds a bit like an Eastern-trained massage therapist discussing &quot;chi&quot;), there are other situations where being pain's silent witness does not necessarily assure its removal (think of an exploding bladder or acute gastric distress).<br />Finally, the reader should not lose sight of the &quot;effort&quot; preceding Bacci's own discovery of effortless living. Sensing that being an academic and a wife forced her to live &quot;roles&quot; at odds with her authentic self, as manifested in crippling physical illnesses, the author simply abandoned both roles in favor of the genuine, healthy person she now is. Others may not find a change this radical either so practical or so effective as the author apparently did.ect of pursuit itself.

The present-day tendency of calling numerous human problems &quot;diseases&quot; can, as Breggin asserts, discourage human solutions. On the other hand, if the problem is &quot;hereditary,&quot; it may not be so amenable to common-sense, willful, &quot;humane cures&quot; as Breggin claims. Moreover, the assertion concerning brain damage places him on relatively safe ground, since the widespread use of Prozac is scarcely more than 10 years old.<br />Breggin touches on but fails to develop some important points. He suggests, for example, that the AARP is more interested in serving the big drug companies than helping its members but then drops the point. Certainly just as disturbing as the numerous prescriptions of antidepressants to patients motivated by a television ad to seek instant happiness is the indiscriminate prescription of antipsychotics to the elderly, especially in nursing homes where &quot;behavioral problems&quot; are an issue.<br />In short, Breggin has covered this ground before. He's David going up against Goliath, a brave Lilliputian challenging the likes of Eli Lilly, and he doesn't let us forget it for an instant, reminding us of his credentials and past battles at every opportunity. Many of the &quot;facts&quot; he provides in this book are no more than the warnings of side-effects that are listed in the instructions coming with the medication. In fact, Breggin frequently quotes them, as though by doing so he has made his case.<br />In short, this book will be of little value to the reader who has not been taken in by the extravagant claims and shameless promotions of the pharmaceutical industry or who has taken the time to look up information about a medication. On the other hand, for anyone who imagines that these medications do what they claim to do and that they are without side-effects potentially as disabling as the condition they are purported to treat, the book should be required reading.by the extravagant claims and shameless promotions of the pharmaceutical industry or who has taken the time to look up information about a medication.

This little collection of profanity isn't quite what I expected.  The English language is so full of inconsistency, irregularity, and paradox, that I was prepared for a work ridiculing our Puritannical attempts to purge it.  The language has a perverse life of its own; anyone who presumes to control it will not only fail but look foolish in doing so.<br />Instead, Johnson takes a quite literal (though no less humorous) ESL (English as a Second Langage) approach, offering the sexual and scatalogical words that any stranger to the language will require to understand it (including the &quot;unsayable&quot; words that once got George Carlin a night in a Milwaukee jail).  Had he expanded the lexicon to include some of the &quot;taboo&quot; sexist, racist, ethnic, group-specific words (and their euphemistic substitutes) of the present-day politically-correct environment, Johnson's little book could have taken on a note of provocative satire.<br />One quibble: In his introduction Johnson uses a quote by Shakespeare's Caliban (&quot;The Tempest&quot;) to support his project.  Bad choice.  Shakespeare never lost an opportunity to expose the language's obscene possibilities, but the quotation is meant to ridicule Caliban for assuming that's all language is good for.	2001-08-22

But you cannot &quot;give&quot; someone their own death. Death is a &quot;gift&quot; because it insures our irreplaceableness in God's eyes; it is ours and ours alone. No one can die in my place no more than I can die in theirs. Our willingness to acknowledge this relationship with our own deaths (which above all requires &quot;responsibility,&quot; a term Derrida seems to prefer to &quot;faith&quot;) in turn unites us with God and the self, with the giver and the receiver.<br />I'll admit I hadn't expected a deconstructionist to use terms like &quot;absolute,&quot; &quot;transcendant,&quot; &quot;God,&quot; &quot;self&quot;--in profusion and in earnest. But perhaps Derrida has sufficiently exposed the instability, metaphoric basis and deceptive play of language to be able to employ it without qualifiers, disclaimers, and tedious textual self-referentiality. As is his custom, he represents his own work as a critique of others' works--Plato's &quot;Phaedo,&quot; Nietzsche's &quot;Genealogy of Morals,&quot; Kierkegaard's &quot;Fear and Trembling,&quot; and the contemporary, politically executed Polish philosopher Jan Potocka. While he establishes his distance from Plato and Nietzsche, his re-visioning of Kierkegaard offers new angles without questioning or challenging the great Dane's existential reading of the Abraham-Isaac story. And his alignment with Potocka is so complete as to suggest more an apologia than a critique of the latter's work. Add to these texts numerous references to Heidegger and to both the Old and New Testaments as well as to stories by Poe and Hawthorne, and you'll have some idea of how richly allusive, not to mention dense, Derrida's discourse can be, even in a brief work such as this.<br />The primary requisite for reading &quot;The Gift of Death&quot; is some knowledge of its precursor, &quot;Fear and Trembling.&quot; Like Kierkegaard, Derrida defines religion as access to the responsibility of a free self, which in turn is defined as a relationship consciously and secretly experienced by the individual subject who sees him or herself in the gaze of God. Truth is separated from Socrates' truth by its interiority, by its replacement of reason, ethics, and aesthetics with the sheer horror of the abyss. Compared to Kierkegaard, however, Derrida's account is less romantic, less inspiring, more disturbing. The leap of faith involves not a sacrifice of Isaac but of oneself, a secret and senseless meeting with one's own death. Derrida interprets the absence of woman in the Abraham and Bartleby stories as proof that the &quot;knight of faith's&quot; quest is not the &quot;tragic hero's&quot;. Instead, it is beyond all knowledge, a confrontation with the abyss that marks the Absolute singularity of the self. (This latter observation is reminiscent of Marlowe's inability, or unwillingness, in Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; to share the &quot;truth&quot; of Kurtz' final words, &quot;The horror, the horror,&quot; with Kurtz' fiance.)<br />In the latter part of his critique, Derrida offers a paradoxical criticism of the technological, modern age. Far from becoming quantified or de-naturalized, we have returned to the demonic and orgiastic from which religion arose. Modern man has fallen into inauthenticity, becoming not a self or person but assuming the mask of a &quot;role.&quot;  Present-day democracy, in turn, is not about the equality of individuals but of roles. Hence the importance of discovering and accepting the gift of death that determines human uniqueness. Responsibility is the criterion; freedom is the result.<br />This is a work not to be read quickly or only once. Derrida moves slowly, taking two steps backward before moving one step forward, but his method insures the communication of his meanings.  If it's any inducement to the reader, I would suggest that the fourth and final chapter, &quot;Tout autre est tout autre,&quot; is anticlimactic and unhelpful. By then the attentive reader will already have located the gift.limactic and unhelpful. By then the attentive reader will already have located the gift.	2001-08-18

Her prose is jargon-free and perpetually potent; her subject range reveals perhaps the singlemost interdisciplinary mind of our generation. Unfortunately, her political &quot;incorrectness&quot; gives those unwilling to be challenged by her insights an excuse not to read her.  The mere mention of her name in academic or women's studies circles is enough to insure condemnation of the offender--merely adding substance to her critique of the present state of these two institutions.  She is both a shibboleth and a pariah.  (I was publicly spanked for invoking her name at a national symposium; then later congratulated privately by several younger women.)<br />Paglia has many personae. &quot;Vamps and Tramps&quot; may be a suitable introduction for some but it is actually more appropriate for the initiated Paglia-ite.  &quot;Vamps&quot; is the &quot;rap-music,&quot; &quot;performance-artist&quot; Paglia; &quot;Sex, Art, and Decadence&quot; is the frequently provocative and compelling popular essayist; &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; is the prolix, Nietzschean original thinker; her study of Hitchcock's &quot;The Birds&quot; is the disciplined yet passionate and provocative scholar.

Depression is a serious illness, especially for those who have not been helped by antidepressants or who have possibly even experienced an exerbation of their symptoms following a regimen of SSRI meds. Sadly, Dr. Hedaya's book raises questions about his sincerity in helping those with depression, not to mention suspicions about his understanding of the disabling features of the disease or his compassion with those afflicted by it.<br />What you will find here is an overwhelming miscellany of recommendations, directives, and advice--from diet to exercise to meditation to testing for thyroid and endocrine functioning to social and psychological counseling.  He may as well have told the depressed reader to stop being depressed, as any individual capable of carrying out Dr. Hedaya's program would practically have to be an energized, focused, motivated Olympic athlete to begin with.  Any author who in the year 2000 demonizes &quot;processed,&quot; &quot;unnatural&quot; foods, suggesting that whole wheat, &quot;natural&quot; products will help alleviate depression is not only trivializing the illness but exposing his own ignorance, arrogance, and greed.<br />Perhaps there is a reader likely to profit from this book: a patient who has been successfully treated by antidepressants but who is experiencing some reduction of sexual desire and who now wishes to employ his or her newfound energy in a dietary/weightlifting/positive thinking program to take therapy to a higher level.<br />If you are genuinely depressed, if you are concerned about side-effects other than a diminishing of libido, if you wish to learn anything specific about the chemistry and effects of a complex array of various antidepressant medications, look elsewhere.	2001-08-06

Incredibly, there appear to be no comparable books in print about the man Giddins defensibly characterizes as  America's Everyman and the King of Popular Culture during the first half of the 20th century.  Consequently, this 728-page book certainly amounts to an impressive achievement and fills a gaping hole.  But in attempting to cover all bases--biographical, cultural, musicological--the book risks pleasing no one in particular and being consigned to the shelf of pop musical reference works.<br />Frankly, I had expected Giddins, a familiar face after the recent PBS series on jazz, to focus more specifically on musical analysis, following the exemplary study by Will Friedwald (&quot;The Song Is You&quot;) of Frank Sinatra's artistry.  But since he went a more comprehensive, autobiographical route, I would have expected him to take on a responsibility as important as scholarly objectivity, viz. reveal the &quot;real&quot; Bing Crosby to the reader.  Giddins acknowledges the paradoxes of the man as well as the complexity and inscrutability.  Then he proceeds to give his subject the Joe Friday treatment, presenting the record of the career in a logical, chronological, highly readable manner.  But we rarely get inside the mind of the subject or experience the sensibility that might enable it to come alive for the generations born after Bing.  Some readers might like it this way, but others will argue that a biographer's task is to construct a thesis and develop it.  The great biographers seem to be part historian, part critic, part psychologist, part novelist, poet, and painter.<br />In any case, were it not for this book I would not have returned to the Crosby recordings before 1940.  Indeed, they are frequently eye-opening and captivating.  The mellow, relaxed crooning sound that I had dismissed as negligible when I heard it in the fifties and later, has body, expressiveness, drama, and charm, practically making the author's case all by itself.<br />The discography, filmography, and bibliography are exhaustive, though I find it somewhat disappointing that the author did not attempt to identify recorded collections of Crosby music that are still in print.filmography, and bibliography are exhaustive, though I find it somewhat disappointing that the author did not attempt to identify recorded collections of Crosby music that are still in print.	2001-07-05

Let's face it.  We often need quick and handy data (sort of like physicians and the P.D.R.), and no one manages to be faster and more to the point than Maltin.  From there, if I choose, I can go to the Internet Movie Data Base or a review by Pauline Kael.  Although I don't attach much importance to Maltin's star ratings, I'm surprised at how responsible they tend to be.  He's as likely to heap deserved praise upon a neglected classic as to trash a latter-day pop phenomenon.  But the ratings are not the reason to buy the book.  Regard them as a bonus, frequently provoking disagreement with the author or a more careful look at one's own assumptions about a particular film.	2001-07-02

If someone gets their own pulpit in which to pontificate upon Shakespeare, we may as well be grateful that it's Harold Bloom.  His judgments constantly provoke a &quot;Right on!&quot; response--when he demonstrates the interpretative inadequacies of the Marxist or gender theorists, for example; or when he celebrates Hamlet and Falstaff as opposite sides of the same coin, together constituting Shakespeare's supreme creation of character.  (How sad that so many of today's students find Falstaff nothing more than a disgusting, cowardly man whose only function is to vindicate the Prince's dismissal of him.)  And though Bloom's case about the &quot;invention of the human&quot; is overstated he, for the most part, is successful in exposing the modern, existential sensibility and dynamic, complex life of the consciousness that is the hallmark of Shakespeare's best character creations.<br />But he disappoints when he takes his sights off of Shakespeare in favor of addressing the bad (ie. political) readers of Shakespeare.  In fact, one wonders if he isn't creating a number of straw men--the readers who find &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; a shamefully sexist play, for example, or who champion Caliban as a post-colonial hero-rebel.  Moreover, this need to represent and address his critics--real or imagined--is especially irritating when he falls short of a counterargument to an interpretation he holds up as &quot;wrong.&quot;  For example, he quotes Kate's entire &quot;women are simple&quot; speech and then, without offering any intepretation of it, simply suggests anyone who doesn't find it ironic has got to be a fool.  With Caliban, he goes a bit further to discredit sympathetic readings of the character, even quoting a generous section of Robert Browning's &quot;Caliban Upon Setebos.&quot;  But why not go further yet, showing us what Caliban actually is (perhaps the naive, idealogical readers Bloom has in mind, the scholars who go more by the &quot;book&quot; than the &quot;imagination&quot;).<br />Bloom has all of the right instincts about Shakespeare (&quot;It's not about politics, stupid.  It's about language as a uniquely human attribute.  And Shakespeare manifests its workings more fully than any other author.&quot;)  But I'm afraid he unwittingly reveals that  a large ego can be just as much an obstacle to interpreting Shakespeare as French critical theory or party-line academic politics.  This book is frequently insightful, well-written, and useful, but it could have been much better, especially in view of the general audience for whom it is aimed, had its author been more consistently mindful of his own calling as teacher.  Unfortunately, Bloom seems to have misread Chaucer's description of the clerk: For &quot;Gladly would he lerne and teche,&quot; substitute &quot;Gladly would he lerne and speche.&quot;ot;imagination&quot;).<br />Bloom has all of the right instincts about Shakespeare (&quot;It's not about politics, stupid.

And its evolution is one, thanks to Pinker's lucid prose and familiar illustrations, we can appreciate and marvel at.  But the question of how we can make our evolved minds better, not to mention prevent them from getting worse, is one Pinker's work persistently overlooks.  Understandably, Pinker's sanguine style and fundamental optimism are received well by numerous readers, but if a mapping of the human mind becomes so broad it fails address the pot-holes and shifting grounds upon which the journey is made, its usefulness becomes dubious.  Perhaps it's time for linguistics to move beyond its academic complacency into the realm of cultural criticism and the influence of the postmodern landscape on human consciousness.	2001-05-27

This is a curious, compelling study that is likely to generate as much controversy for its style as for its amalgamation of historical, cultural, literary, operatic, biblical and theological traditions.  Rougement traces the &quot;courtly love&quot; tradition from its orgins among 12th century troubadors in southern France through the high Romanticism of 19th century opera to the modern-day consequences of a love that is based on Eros, delusion, and selfishness--a passion that lives for passion, and whose only consummation can be death (for were it to endure, to be exposed to the glaring light of day, it would no longer be romantic passion).  Rougement's scholarship is solid, his interpretations provocative, and his proximity to his subject  uncomfortably &quot;close&quot; for someone bearing the mantle of cultural critic and scholar.  In fact, it's impossible not to feel the conflicted emotions of the author himself.  On the one hand, he presents himself as the enemy of &quot;Eros&quot; and proponent of &quot;Agape,&quot; as the critic of immature, romantic passion and the defender of mature relationships based on a realistic &quot;dialogue&quot; between two unique, complex individuals.  On the other hand, he reveals the heart and soul of an incurable romantic, someone who has been love's thrall, who has been swept up in the dark rapture and sublimely lyrical death wish that is Wagner's &quot;Tristan und Isolde.&quot;  But far from being a liability, that underlying tension provides the book's argument with an energy, vitality and, yes, &quot;passion&quot; that is lacking in similar studies of this fascinating topic.  At times I was suspicious that the author might turn out to be an idealogue, tedious moralist,  or Christian &quot;fundamentalist,&quot; given the zeal and curiously evangelical flavor of many of his sentences.  Not to worry.  His intellectual kinship is with Kierkegaard, though he finally falls short of the &quot;leap of faith&quot; and spiritual &quot;marriage&quot; achieved by the melancholy Dane.  As proof of the foregoing, I defy any close reader of this text to leave the book more repelled than enticed, entranced, and ultimately entrapped by the Tristan and Isolde myth.

This is a potentially useful book to the student writer who discovers it on his own and therefore has no reason not to buy into its solid, commonsensical advice.  There's nothing new here--Strunk&amp;White directives, concisely expressed tips about brainstorming and revising, admonitions about cliched language and ignoring the conventions of grammar, punctuation and citation form.  The strength of the book is the author's personal voice, logical reasoning disguised as irreverent defiance of the academic establishment, and invocation of countless examples from pop culture (the Simpsons to Monica Lewinsky), literature (a definite bias toward Melville), philosophy (Derrida and the post-modernists), and theology (Luther--the source of the book's title).<br />While most of the author's points are on target, some may question his failure to distinguish between &quot;opinion&quot; and &quot;idea,&quot; especially in the context of exhorting student writers to use the medium to trust and express their opinions (&quot;Here I stand&quot;).  It's one thing to &quot;sin boldly,&quot; the better to experience a state of despair and to be open to divine grace.  But the gain in writing flagrantly bad somehow eludes this reader.<br />Certainly the text is too spare to be of any use as a &quot;Handbook,&quot; but as a &quot;Rhetoric&quot; it succeeds remarkably well in its first half in addressing the constant student refrain: &quot;Is this what you want, Professor?&quot;  (I want what you want when you might have cause to be proud of yourself for having wanted it in the first place.)  By so overtly taking the student's &quot;side,&quot; the author conveys a responsible writing instructor's agenda in a manner that allows the student to view it as privileged information.<br />In the latter half of the book, I'm afraid the author grinds a few too many personal axes--taking on the deconstructionists and postmodern types, for example--and strays too far from the matter at hand to hold, let alone influence, his audience.  In some respects, the author's purpose becomes suspect (cf. David Foster Wallace's &quot;display&quot; piece on grammar and usage in Harper's, 4/2001).  And the book ends in an eerily preachy style.<br />The loud, naughty cover and penchant for scatological language (admittedly a potential turn-off for delicate sensibilities) help atone for the book's didacticism and moralizing as do the moments of refreshing candor (Ronald Reagan didn't know what he was talking about, George Will can at least write effective essays, etc).

As a &quot;descriptive-linguist-observer-scientist,&quot; Pinker makes a number of observations about human development and language that are of interest but few that seem all that penetrating or edifying.  (Tell me things, Stephen, that I didn't already know or couldn't easily have figured out for myself.)  Moreover, he never, to my mind, establishes a clear distinction between thought and language (assuming there is one), so that in effect he seems to be saying little more than all human beings are born with the capacity to &quot;think,&quot; to interpret their own experience.  Finally, one wishes he could complement his scientific curiosity with a &quot;theological&quot; or critical one as well.  The Gospel of John asserts that in the beginning was the &quot;Word,&quot; which became human.  If language, then, can be claimed as a &quot;gift,&quot; as our spiritual inheritance, then it follows that language is capable of being &quot;abused,&quot; possibly even wasted.  What counts equally as much as the phenomenon of language is the way it is organized, codified, and reinvented by humans.  If all cultures and civilizations have had the same access to &quot;language,&quot; not all have exhibited the same responsiveness  (as Shakespeare's, for example) to &quot;rhetoric&quot; and its potential to the fullest realization of the world of self.  I wonder why this is--but I doubt that Pinker, for all his enthusiastic descriptivism, gives the question much thought.	2001-04-08

If you want to understand deconstruction, I was told, &quot;Of Grammatology&quot; is the singlemost important text.  Then I read the excellent introduction by Christopher Norris, went back and re-read Pirsig's &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,&quot; went back and read Plato's &quot;Phaedrus,&quot; which Pirsig deconstructs in &quot;Zen.&quot;  Finally, the pieces came together and it became possible to appreciate Derrida for the genuine philosopher/philologist/phenomenologist/existential thinker that he is.<br />In reading Derrida I find it useful to keep in mind several key ideas: first, language, spoken or written, is subject to the movement of &quot;real&quot; time.  Any &quot;now&quot;utterance is necessarily a past &quot;trace&quot; and a hypothetical future.  2nd, language is not the expression of thought; rather, language &quot;is&quot; pure consciousness.  All ideas are words, all words are &quot;interpretations,&quot; meanings made by human minds.  Hence, there is no escaping the &quot;text.&quot;  We can &quot;know&quot; nothing beyond the interpretations of the thinking (language-using/meaning-making) human subject.  3rd, the text, while &quot;intranscendable,&quot; is necessarily inexhaustible, since every signified must in turn become a signifier.  Hence, the awesome (dis)play of language by a thinking subject such as &quot;Shakespeare,&quot;  whose metaphors never attempt to posit a reality beyond the human world of language (there are no &quot;truth claims&quot; in Shakespeare's sonnets: every meaning can be &quot;proven&quot; by the words which create it.  4th, any &quot;opposition&quot; is more a trick/trope of language than an actual &quot;event.&quot;  Speaking vs. writing. male vs. female, white vs. black, life vs. death, ideal vs. mundane, the center vs. the margin are all &quot;provisional&quot; metaphors, more complementary than exclusive: the one term always depends upon the other for completion of its meaning.<br />Finally, just as it is unwise to conflate Christian and biblical understandings about anything, it's mistaken to confuse Derrida with the &quot;liberal, radical fringe&quot; often accused of dismantling the canons and foundations of Western civilization.  In fact, Derrida's respect for language has more in common with more &quot;traditional&quot; critics such as Bloom and Kermode than it does with the academic activists, political reformers, socialist zealots who have attached themselves to &quot;positions,&quot; alliances, causes.  These latter groupings violate the very nature of language and thought.

I confess that after examining 5-6 of the top-selling complete Shakespeares I tried not to like the Norton.  There are less expensive editions, there are editions with glossy pages and colored photographs, there are editions that are half the weight and bulk of this leviathan, which is far more Shakespeare than the average reader--perhaps, even  scholar, for that matter--would ever require.  But despite its bulk and unwieldyness, its 3500 (!) thin, flimsy pages, its sheer excess, I couldn't ignore its advantages.  The small print enables the publishers to squeeze in contextual materials--in the introduction and appendixes--that in themselves amount to an encyclopedic companion to Shakespeare's works; the introductions to the plays are written not in &quot;textbook prose&quot; but in an engaging style worthy of their subject; and perhaps, best of all, this is the only edition that places the glosses right alongside the &quot;strange&quot; Elizabethan word instead of in the footnotes.  You can read the plays without experiencing vertigo of the eye.  So this is the edition, though you may wish to go with the smaller, bound portions that Norton publishes of the same edition--especially if you can't afford the cost of a personal valet to carry this tome from home to office. On the other hand, the complete edition is excellent for doing crunches and other aerobic exercises--activities many of us who read the Bard are abt to ignore.	2001-03-03

At the outset Vendler claims that any comment on Shakespeare's sonnets that could be applied to a prose paraphrasis is not worthy of the name &quot;literary criticism.&quot;  From this position she proceeds to give a jargon-free, yet exceedingly dense and technical, linguistic analysis of the sonnets.  Her readings are informed by post-structuralist as well as formalist criticism.  The latter critics, however, always sought to demonstrate how meaning is a function of form, whereas Vender's commitment to structuralist and deconstructionist positions about language forbids her to talk about the &quot;meaning,&quot; or content, of the poems.<br />And therein lies the problem.  What if a film critic elected to talk about a favorite auteur with no reference to the material that could be gleaned by reading the script as opposed to viewing the film text?  Imagine the result--an abundance of observations about shots and countershots, angles and focal distances, camera set-ups and lighting with no reference to anything but to the patterns and symmetry created by the combination of these signifiers.  Without acknowledging the &quot;metaphoric,&quot; &quot;tropic&quot; role of &quot;content,&quot; a tool that enables us to talk about language in ways that make &quot;sense,&quot; the critic is in danger of producing a study of language that is undermined by its own failure to accept the semantic and rhetorical uses of language.<br />I'm cheered by a work of criticism that attempts to rescue art from the &quot;sociological&quot; and &quot;political.&quot;  But Vendler's book fails to rescue Shakespeare from tedium and irrelevancy.  While the book is useful for occasional &quot;dipping&quot; (provided the reader knows both Shakespeare and post-structuralist theory), it could do more harm than good if the intent is to help younger and less-informed readers bring the sonnets to life.	2001-02-13

Having read Winchester's book for the second time, I'm far more impressed by its achievement.  In the final pages the narrator refers to his account of the making of the OED as a &quot;yarn&quot;.  And indeed it is an entertaining as well as edifying story, especially considering the potentially dull if not lethal nature of the subject matter.   But there's also a subtext running through this docu-novel that is more about the nature of language itself than about the creation of the world's most famous dictionary.  Discretion bids me not to give away the real hero of this text but, contrary to my first impression, it's neither of the story's two main characters.  Suffice it to say that Winchester's favorite word is &quot;serendipity,&quot; roughly equivalent to the &quot;jouissance&quot; that was so dear to the French semiotician/post-structuralist, Roland Barthes.  Read the book to its very last page (including the bibliographical material and acknowledgments we normally dismiss) and not simply to the end of the &quot;story proper.&quot;  Now look at the first page preceding the title.  At this point I experienced my epiphany about the life of the &quot;word&quot; and fully appreciated Winchester's clever game.	2001-01-27

As a teenager I reveled in the picaresque, occasionally perverse,  peregrinations of Fielding's &quot;Tom Jones.&quot;  Hours of watching Laurel and Hardy and The 3 Stooges had convinced me that literature was incapable of affording the same intensity of pleasure.  But Fielding's writing showed me otherwise.  Nevertheless, I had never experienced the power of literature to induce uncontrollable physical laughter, akin to the audible response resonating throughout a movie theater, until reading &quot;Small World.&quot;  Never mind the parody of the Parsifal legend or grail quest, the rewriting of &quot;The Fairie Queen&quot; and &quot;The Wasteland,&quot; or the send-up of not merely current literary criticism but many of its celebrated gurus.  My wife had none of this background, and yet when I read the novel out loud to her, she was no less incapacitated by the force of the farce than I had been during my first reading (no, I don't think she was laughing at my recitation).<br />One caveat: I thought the novel would provide college students with an excellent introduction to numerous archetypal themes, canonical works, and schools of literary theory.

This book was written before Prozac and its many imitators (Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Wellbutrin, Remeron, Effexor, etc.) revolutionized the treatment of anxiety and depression in the 1990s.  Nevertheless, Sheehan's text is of interest on at least two counts: its analysis of the relationship between anxiety and depression; its survey of the drugs--primarily MAO inhibitors and tricyclics--that preceded the SSRIs and more recent drugs.  Moreover, most studies suggest that while the widely prescribed drugs of today are &quot;safer,&quot; they are no more effective than their predecessors.  In fact, in some cases the earlier drugs may be superior.  Nonetheless, most readers will probably prefer a comprehensive, up-to-date text to this one.	2000-12-29

After giving this book to my daughter upon her graduation, I found I couldn't resist buying another copy for myself.  Whether you're interested in a &quot;refresher&quot; or in a quick briefing on an academic area you never had time for--film studies, for example--or structuralist and post-structuralist criticism--you're likely to find the field treated in this lively, fascinating, edifying volume.  The authors provide definitions, canons of the essential works, profiles of major contributors to the field, and judicious evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of each major thinker or artist.  When an individual, text or movement is overrated or becoming passe, the authors are not afraid to say so.  And unlike similar collections--the &quot;Dummies&quot; books, for example--this text is far more than an accumulation of trivia.  The authors manage to provide narrative continuity to each academic area and, above all, a sense of perspective.  Since their judgements strike me as on target in the areas with which I'm familiar, I'm inclined to trust them in those disciplines I don't know much about.

This is a book for the highly-motivated student who wants to know the most frequent words on the SAT and GRE exams and is willing to work his or her tail off to learn them.  It has  several other things going for it: the authors recognize the inseparability of language from thought; they caution against mistaking a large or esoteric vocabulary for knowledge; they provide some tips about etymology and the uses of Latin and Greek roots and affixes but they do not overrate this occasionally helpful tool (word meanings are dynamic and frequently arbitary, having little to do with the original word form).<br />The downside of the volume is that it doesn't provide a &quot;programmed&quot; approach capable of engaging the less-motivated reader in a progressive series of fun yet educational exercises.  For this purpose, the Norman Lewis books are a better bet, even though the latter author tends to overemphasize esoteric words and  overrate the importance of etymology.	2000-12-23

I purchased the first edition of &quot;My iMac&quot; and found it useful even though it was no longer fully applicable to the 2nd generation of iMac computers.  With the appearance of a 3rd generation of iMacs in the summer of 2000 and with OS X on the near horizon, this 2nd edition, released  Dec. 16, 2000, is definitely the one and only book worth owning.  Not only is it the most current, but the writing style has become more accessible and consumer-oriented than the first.  The language is somewhere in between the reassuring, nurturing approach of Robin Williams' &quot;My Little iMac&quot; and the hip, irreverent style of David Pogue's &quot;Dummy&quot; books.  It's clearly organized and could be used as a tutorial if the reader wishes; it's lively without thinking too highly of its humor.  The team of authors speak as a single voice and provide some history of the iMac as well as possible future directions while at the same time being eminently practical.	2000-12-22

As refreshing as the &quot;Dummies&quot; series can be, its limitations often become readily apparent when its reductive approach is applied to the arts and humanities.  I purchased this text planning to give it to a friend who does not share let alone understand my passion for jazz.  Now I wish I'd exercised more judicious consumer restraint.  This is a book for those who are curious about some of the many &quot;names&quot; of jazz as well as a brush-up on historical periods and musical styles.  But it's of little help in explaining how to listen to this difficult, challenging music, or even what to listen to.<br />With respect to the latter criticism, one or two examples should serve.  Duke Ellington, arguably the greatest American composer and all-around American musician, is represented by a couple of off-beat recordings in which he agreed to perform with Charles Mingus and John Coltrane. And the most beloved, revered, inarguably influential recording of the last 50 years--Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;--is not even included among the authors'  list of essential recordings.<br />From years of experience, I've learned that it's insufficient to overwhelm jazz neophytes with hundreds of names of musicians.  Nor does it help younger listeners to learn that a bebop tune is based on Gershwin's &quot;I Got Rhythm.&quot;  Even playing a Charlie Parker solo for most listeners simply makes no impression.  Great thoughtfulness, selectivity, and ingenuity are required to communicate the essence of this profound, beautiful American art form.<br />For those who want all the names, check out Leonard Feather's &quot;Encyclopedia of Jazz.&quot;  For those who want a clearer perspective on the 5-6 musicians who count most as well as better understanding of musical form, improvisation, and stylistic distinctions, try Mark Gridley's &quot;Jazz Styles&quot; (or catch a lecture by Wynton Marsalis).

There are 2 main reasons for purchasing one of the books in this series: you're a &quot;dummy&quot; with respect to the subject, or you're knowledgeable and either wish to test your smarts against the author's or to acquire some ideas about how to communicate your knowledge to others.  If I may be so presumptuous as to place myself in the latter category, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this book.  It provides comparatively brief summaries of each of the plays, but little perspective on what makes one play more profound, more respected, more &quot;required&quot; reading than another.  A reader might just as easily conclude that *Titus Andronicus* is as important as *Hamlet*; that *Romeo and Juliet* is no less a tragedy than *Lear*; that *Henry 6 or 8* is as well written as *Henry's 4 and 5*.  Moreover, the book-cover blurb promises to teach the reader how to read the Sonnets (totalling 154), yet the authors provide no more than 2 glib paragraphs about the sonnet cycle.<br />The authors' recommendations about films and editions are too succinct or limited to be of much help.  (Only the Arden Complete Edition is recommended, an edition with numerous problems.)  And there's the question of just how much justice you can do the Bard with language that, unlike his, is unremittingly &quot;flip.&quot;  But if you enjoy this style, I'd recommend reading first the section on Shakespeare in *An Incomplete Education* to get a better sense of which readings are truly indispensable and most worthy of a reader's time.  And if you want more detailed summaries of plays, try SparkNotes, the website created by Harvard students.	2000-12-15

Campbell's writing, though less genial, can be more persuasive than his spoken discourse. First, he doe not succumb to the need to give something to everyone, the assurance that every story is worthy of inclusion in the &quot;monomyth.&quot; Instead, he frequently assumes the mantle of cultural critic, like T. S. Eliot dismissing the fragmented &quot;stories&quot; of a society that has lost touch with its authentic ritualist traditions. Second, he writes in the form of paradox and metaphor not easily reduced to the formulaic schemes his popularizers and followers seem so anxious to apply to pop-culture texts and pet projects.<br />Perhaps the reader's greatest challenge in understanding Campbell's archetypal scheme, not to mention his own odyssey, is comprehending the difference between the &quot;innocence&quot; the child emerges from in his circular journey and that to which he returns. Apparently each of us must break free of an infantile egotism and selfishness, continue to struggle against the regressive cathexes that bind us to it, but then seek to return to the same place with a heightened consciousness uniting us to our first god minus the selfish impulses. Campbell's explanation is both Jungian and Freudian, mystical and rational, logical yet paradoxical--never as &quot;tidy&quot; or accessible as his popularizers suggest.<br />Somewhat disappointing is the relatively little attention Campbell gives to Western myth and literary archetypes. But 50 years ago the author's emphasis on Hindu and Buddhist traditions may have seemed more conclusive evidence of his positions--at least to readers for whom Western traditions were not as unfamiliar as Eastern. Regarded dismissively by many modern academics as a sponsor of mushy, &quot;new-age&quot; thinking, Campbell is best seen as a unique, courageous and compelling voice among the numerous Marxist, post-structural, post-colonial critical voices that emerged with Barthes, Derrida, Foucault, making deconstructionist thought the academic rage of the 1970s and 80s. His identification of universal myths and his rhetorical representations of them were reactionary reassurances in the midst of much skepticism and intellectual arrogance.hought the academic rage of the 1970s and 80s.

As good as this translation is, it should be used in conjunction with a reading of the original poem in Middle English verse.  And the reader who is too impatient to deal with Chaucer's language should, at the very least, try a modern verse translation before reading this version in prose.  There's something to be said for prose translations of epic verse, since the translator need not make compromises between precise meaning and poetic form.  Homer's &quot;Odyssey,&quot; for example, is so much like a novel that  there's little justification for requiring the translator to format the language in metrical hexameters.  But Chaucer's poem is a different matter--a lyrical, romantic drama, or subtle, psychological &quot;melodrama,&quot; that almost demands a poetic translation for its genial musical qualities to come through.  For the reader not planning to read the poem in the original language, I'd suggest checking out &quot;Chaucers (sic) Troilus and Cressida,&quot; translated by James Donohoe.  It may not be the easiest book to locate, but it's worth the reader's effort to do so.	2000-12-10

This particular version retains all of the humor, subtlety, complexity of Chaucer's original text.  Moreover, whereas I almost prefer prose translations of epic texts such as &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; Chaucer's poem should be formatted as poetry.

Appleton looks at many promising drugs awaiting approval as well as the vast number of touted herbal remedies.  The author has no agenda.  He provides balanced information about the percentage of consumers who are likely to be helped and to what degree.

For those of us who see \\"rhetoric\\" as a good and not a bad word, Paglia is certainly a most worthy practitioner of the art of persuasive, compelling language, putting many of her pedantic contemporaries to shame.  This anthology does her more justice than the hit and miss collection, \\"Vamps and Tramps.\\"  In fact, the essay \\"Junk Bonds and Corporate Raiders\\" strikes this reader as at once the strongest critique of the current academic scene and the most persuasive and powerful prose launched by any writer in recent memory.  Granted, sensation and effect often take priority over dialectic and reason, but since when are emotions, including righteous indignation, forbidden notes for the prose musicians gifted enough to play them?  And since when have academic critics been forbidden to delve outside their \\"specialty\\" or to ignore the often arbitrary, dubious distinctions between \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" culture?  If Paglia doesn't always \\"get it right,\\" shame on her.

She's not only a powerful and original rhetorician but an interdisciplinary thinker of singular daring and brilliance.  Small wonder that the book was banned from certain woman's studies' programs and that Paglia became at once a shibboleth and pariah.  But this dazzling literary  performance needs no defense.  Even if the reader disagrees with half of her positions, Paglia makes stylistic music and scintillating connections that leave other critics--especially the narrow specialists, jargonish post-structuralists, and politically-correct careerists of today's academic scene--in the dust.  Who's written a better essay on Byron or Wilde?  Her chapter on Wordsworth, while very unsatisfying, should at least clear her of the charge of &quot;essentialism&quot; (Wordsworth is condemned for his passive &quot;femininity,&quot; the Cthonian component of the Apollonian/Dionysian tension that drives her argument).  My only surprise, if not disappointment, is that Paglia fails to look at Robert Browning, the one poet whose creation of dramatic personae--often sado-masochistic characters at that--should have placed him at the top of her list of artists whose energies are channeled into deviant characters.  (Count Guido is O.J.; Andrea del Sarto is decadence personified.)  In her omission and stereotyping of mainstream Victorians, Paglia simply enforces the dominant, misguided view of their actual importance and accomplishment.	2000-10-19

This is an eminently teachable book, probably the singlemost read text by students at my school over the past ten years.  The supernatural elements, ghost story trappings (compare the basic plot to &quot;Poultergeist&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist&quot;) and sensational (but tastefully presented) sex and violence make for instant accessibility for most students.  As for the Faulknerian stream of consciousness and shifting points of view, students seem to have little difficulty once they are shown how to read it.  But at other levels, the work fails to measure up to the greatest literature.  The characters are types--good or bad, oppressed or oppressors; the themes are often obvious and paper thin (eg. Baby Suggs' revision of the Sermon on the Mount into a black pride message); the male characters, including Paul D., are objects of female fantasy; the imagery (water, corn, trees, characters' names) is contrived and repetitious.  Two things of value emerge from the reading experience: the coming of age story of Sethe's daughter, Denver, and the use of Beloved as a metaphor for the holocaust that was the pre-emancipation African-American experience.  But there is more complexity, depth, and fidelity to that experience and its transformation from suffering into art in James Baldwin's short story, &quot;Sonny's Blues.&quot;	2000-10-13

D. Laing's recognition of a  &quot;schizoid personality,&quot; or a disembodied self, in his seminal work &quot;The Divided Self,&quot;  promised a new approach to the integration of body and mind in the whole and healthy human being.  Caldwell builds on this idea, using the body as a starting point for diagnosing addictions and suggesting treatments.  But the book soon becomes predictable.  The addictions are frequently the result of an abusive parent (isn't this theme getting a bit threadworn by now?) and the treatments are more commonsensical than insightful (meditation, exercise,  re-prioritizing life's demands).  Moreover, the material echoes much similar popular wisdom on the subject.  Readers of John Bradshaw, Sam Keene, Deepak Chopra are likely to find this book somewhat repetitious and familiar.  And though user-friendly, the writing style rarely attains the sustained rhetorical power of the former works.	2000-10-12

Estes'  argument seems to accept the premise but with a positive spin.  But what's  the intellectual gain?  Influenced by post-structuralist thought, the  academic feminists of the seventies and eighties deconstructed the notion  of an &quot;essential&quot; female identity, especially of a unified,  universal, archetypal sort.  As human beings, each of us has  masculine/feminine, animus/anima, Apollinian/Dionysian elements regardless  of our &quot;biological&quot; sex.  Moreover, these elements are found in  the characters of stories told by men as much as by women (consider Homer's  Calypso, Athena, Nausicaa, Circe and Penelope or Virgil's Dido and  Camilla). But if these books (I'm including the Iron John archetype as  well) provide some readers with a sense of personal identity and  self-affirmation that daily individual experience does not,  perhaps they  have some practical value.	2000-08-16

If the author is to be believed, a long-time habit of taking as little as 5mg of Valium per day is sufficient to make one addicted, depressed, and highly miserable. Her claim is that growing tolerance to any benzodiazapine places the individual in &quot;withdrawal&quot; even while he or she is taking the drug. Since many of us can relate to the profiles of depression and mysterious illnesses that the author provides, it's not hard to accept her thesis. But is it true? How's one to know without first increasing the use of the drug beyond the &quot;withdrawal&quot; phase? And is this something I really want to do? Apparently the book has been influential enough to inspire support groups. The question remains, how valid is her thesis?<br />In short, this is a provocative book that should be read by virtually anyone who takes benzodiazapines, regardless of amount or frequency.  The reader is likely to experience initial relief and empowerment, and if good health is sustained after termination of medication, fine.  If, on the other hand, termination of the medication does not seem to help, the reader will certainly question the author's rather basic and simple cause-effect thesis.<br />To take another example, it's highly likely that &quot;Chronic Fatigue Sydrome&quot; has produced sufferers in excess of the actual presence of the disease.  Whether it's better to regard some forms of fatigue as a disease or as depression is debatable.  People can spend as much time and money treating a mysterious virus as depression.  Tricket's book  provides the same sort of room for controversy.  If Valium indeed is your problem, you'll be most grateful to her.  If Valium is simply addressing symptoms of anxiety and depression, you could become needlessly alarmed about that 5 mg daily tablet, increasing the amount of anxiety you already are experiencing.	2000-08-07

But the  ultimate book about the century's ultimate vocal artist will be one that  manages to account for the apparent paradoxes: the brazen and controversial  lifestyle alongside the sheer beauty and fragile emotional depth of the art  ; the relation between the screen actor and the introspective &quot;saloon  singer&quot;; and above all the relation between the inimitable  individualist who made every song his own and the respectful storyteller  who, more often than any other interpreter of these classic musical texts,  surrendered himself to the composer's intentions and &quot;got it  right.&quot;  Even in the interviews he gave following Sinatra's death,  Friedwald mentioned these two apparently opposite qualities without  grasping the contradiction let alone explaining it.<br />But Friedwald's  instincts about what counts as quality in musical art are unassailable,  even if they lead him to unnecessarily vicious attacks on Bono (It's only a  joke, Will) and Carly Simon (listen to the recording again--she does not  sing in unison with Sinatra on &quot;When I Hang My Tears Out to  Dry&quot;).  Just as his zeal to dissociate Sinatra from banality leads him  to demonize the opposition, his determination to vindicate the returning  king leads him to ignore the embarrassment of &quot;The Main Event,&quot;  the one time when the &quot;voice&quot; simply wasn't there, and when it  counted most--before a national television audience.  Sinatra's return to  form following this quasi-disaster, therefore, was all the more remarkable.  Yet Friedwald gives the opposite impression, suggesting that this concert  was a highlight preceding a precipitous decline in Sinatra's vocal power  and aesthetic judgement.  Nothing could be further from the truth--at least  as far as the concerts were concerned.  I know.  I was there.aster, therefore, was all the more remarkable.

Pirsig's narrator relates a picaresque intellectual  narrative interweaving 3 metaphoric journeys with his main quest-- coming to terms with his own identity and the meaning of existence.  In the present tense,  it is his broken marriage and troubled relationship with his teenage son  that occupy his thoughts.  In the past, he is consumed by his failure as a  graduate student at the University of Chicago, which found him at odds with   Aristotelian, &quot;logocentered&quot; philosophical traditionalists.  At  a more timeless level, it is his identification with Phaedrus, the  rhetorician whom Socrates discredits in the Platonic dialogues, that  consumes him.  Against the weight of all Western philosophy, with its  influence on &quot;dialectic,&quot; the narrator affirms and finally  celebrates his unique identity as Phaedrus, whose search affirms  &quot;rhetoric,&quot; the power of the individual to create his own  existential truths and construct a sense of identity.  In the thrilling  climax, the narrator reaches his geographical destination along with the  hope of  constructing a bridge with his son--not because of the discovery  of some ultimate or transcendent truth but because of his own empowerment  as &quot;Phaedrus&quot; to create such a truth.  Pirsig reviews and  critiques the whole history of Western philosophy, then like Nietzsche  &quot;deconstructs&quot; it in order to celebrate the constitutive,  creative role of the individual in determining the nature of world and  self.   The book is an unforgettable intellectual journey on many levels,  into past, present, future, but  don't expect much Zen.  It's final  affirmation of the individual quest, of the poetic vision of Phaedrus,  belongs more in a Western Romantic, than Eastern, mystical tradition.	2000-07-12

This is a convenient, nicely-sized reference book, not to be read but  consulted from time to time.  But after paging through it, I'm thinking of  sending it back in exchange for the frequently humorous and reassuring  &quot;voice&quot; provided by the &quot;Dummies&quot; series.  My main  disappointment is that the author provided so little information on the  formatting of a research paper.  For example, how can I make the  bibliography appear after, rather than before, the endnotes that the  program has converted from footnotes?  How can I have the program create  the bibliography while I'm typing my text and citations?  How can I create  an index of key words while I'm composing my ideas?

The author's familiarity with Paul's letters and evangelical fervor are undeniable, but his knowledge of film is quite another matter.  With the exceptions of &quot;Babette's Feast&quot; and &quot;The Edge of the  City&quot; he elects to treat Hollywood hits of the nineties.  Since only  &quot;Babette's Feast&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; pass the author's  &quot;Pauline test,&quot; it's unclear what his basis for selecting the  other 8 films was.  Moreover, his attachment to his thesis, one suspects,  blinds him to the shallowness of &quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; unless he really  believes that this new-age, feel-good, self-esteem builder targeted at the  troubled baby-boomer generation represents a '&quot;triumph of love.&quot;  Given the author's preoccupation with the triumph of grace over shame,  wouldn't it have made more sense to choose &quot;classic&quot;  but not  necessarily &quot;popular&quot; films that address this subject--for  example, Bergman's &quot;Shame&quot; or Lynch's &quot;The Elephant  Man&quot;?  Or if he elected to stay within the popular field, why not take  a highly-respected &quot;auteur&quot; such as Alfred Hitchock, whose  identity is stamped on virtually each of his &quot;texts&quot; by his  focusing on the themes of guilt and shame? The author's assumption that  popular films are the reflection of deep spiritual currents connecting with  Biblical texts is narrow if not naive.  Apart from the selection of films,  the treatment is limited primarily to the narratives, or scripts, of the  films and gives little consideration to the art and technique of the film  or the actual experience of the spectator.  Although he has consulted some  popular reviews, there is virtually no evidence of film theory, aesthetics  and history, of the &quot;language&quot; of cinema and the ways in which  viewers, vicariously and voyeuristically, make meaning out of  that  language.  Finally, since the author argues that film brings scriptural  truths into concrete, human experience, it's surprising that his  discussions of the theological meanings of films fails to draw upon  &quot;existential&quot; theological thinkers such as Kierkegaard, Tillich,  and Buber.  As for the author's style, it includes numerous first person  references (&quot;I think,&quot; &quot;I believe&quot;) and indefinite  pronouns (&quot;this&quot;), suggesting that the discussions would be a  good basis for conversations on the meaning of Paul's letters in the daily  lives of present-day Christians.  For an audience as specialized as the  latter, perhaps the leader of a Bible study group, the book may have  greater value than it does for this reader.oncrete, human experience, it's surprising that his  discussions of the theological meanings of films fails to draw upon  &quot;existential&quot; theological thinkers such as Kierkegaard, Tillich,  and Buber.

Humphrey Bogart's line to his secretary in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; could as easily have been addressed to Jane Austen. Long before the woman's movement of the 60s and women's studies courses of the 70s, perceptive and  discriminating readers were in agreement about Jane Austen as the supreme  master of her craft.  In her characterizations, plotting, and language she  is the model of exactness and efficiency.  There simply is no gratuitous  business, no room for sentiment, no place for self-indulgence or personal  fantasy.  Elizabeth's world is a microcosm of the complex society we habit,  each of us making daily compromises, negotiations, and decisions that allow  us the maximum degree of self-expression within the limitations of our  social communities and of the human condition itself. The rewards of  identifying with Austen's heroines are as accessible and satisfying to male  as to female readers. Above all, Austens' novels are tributes to the power  of language--to create plausible worlds, to capture the meanings of the  heart, and to construct the rhetoric of the &quot;self.&quot;  Where lesser  writers require battles and orgies to get a rise out of readers, Austen can  elicit profound emotions from the most stoic readers through the  description of a raised eyebrow.	2000-06-25

As a teacher who has had to use this book for the past 2 years, I would be rather sorry to part with it--from my personal library.  After all, it contains an almanac, a six-year calendar, the U. S. Constitution along with  all sorts of pointers about how to succeed in college and life.  Moreover,  for teachers unexperienced in teaching composition, the text breaks down  the writing process in both a short, simplified sequence and an extended,  more detailed one.  And lengthy chapters are devoted to writing every kind  of discourse--from literary essays to science reports to business letters  and essay exams.  When I discovered that most of my students who had  purchased the book for a previous course never used it, I tried mightily to  incorporate it into my classes, and there was the rub.  The lengthy and  repetitious sections on the writing process are unwieldy and no substitute  for doing it, and the &quot;handbook&quot; section is minimal and of  limited practical value.  In fact, there's no convenient way for student  writers to connect correction symbols with related discussions in the text.  A student writer would not find out how to punctuate a compound sentence  containing a conjunctive adverb, but he would discover that success in  college requires &quot;determination, curiosity, and self-reliance&quot;  (p. 544).  Perhaps it's just as well that the parental, if not preachy,  tone of much of the text assures students will not make use of it: The  authors caution students against change, reminding them it's smart  &quot;to stick to your values and beliefs&quot; (547).  As an educator, I  would have to disqualify the book from serious consideration on the basis  of that sentence alone.	2000-06-20

On  this level alone, the book succeeds in being one of the most accessible and  reliable treatments of the field.  But the text is also a critique of the  whole Western &quot;logocentric&quot; tradition, with its emphasis on  reason, or &quot;dialectic.&quot;  Like Kant (&quot;Critique of Pure  Reason&quot;) or Kierkegaard (&quot;Concluding Unscientific  Postscript&quot;), Pirsig uses reason to expose the limitations of reason.  And what does he replace it with?  Not Eastern mysticism or Zen riddles but  rhetoric.  More than the classic rhetoricians that Pirsig exhalts or the  20th-century structuralists and post-structuralists (Barthes, Derrida,  Foucault) for which Pirsig's narrative is practically an illustration,  &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; makes the case for  language as the basis for all reality, for all that we think, experience  and perceive.  It's this conflict between dialectic and rhetoric that  drives the narrative, realized in plain yet compelling prose that's capable  of staying with the attentive reader for the rest of his or her lifetime.  After reading the book twice, I was unable to look at the self, the world,  at all things constructed by language in quite the same way.  The least  successful parts of the book, it seems to me, are the narrator's protracted  discussions of the nature of &quot;reality&quot; as a moment inaccessible  to human intellect and his somewhat naive, 1960's-style musings on the  nature of &quot;quality.&quot;  Supposedly his English composition students  were immediately able to know it when they saw it, thereby making it  unnecessary for him as a teacher to talk about &quot;standards&quot; or to  establish criteria.  (The suspicion arises that Pirsig hasn't had a great  deal of experience teaching students how to write.)  Nevertheless, even  when a cylinder occasionally misfires, this is a book worth reading  carefully and more than once. Unfortunately, because of its  &quot;cult&quot; status, many people seem to purchase the text but never  finish it.  Robert Redford owns the screen rights, but a reader would be  ill-advised to wait for the movie version.  The &quot;visual&quot; elements  of the text--the motorcyle odyssey and troubled father-son  relationship--are minor metaphors compared to the ambitious and largely  successful intellectual quest.e teaching students how to write.)

However, if readers hope  to get beyond the &quot;trivial pursuit&quot; question of the source to  which Eliot was indebted and to a genuine understanding of the &quot;Fisher  King&quot; myth, they will need to read that source for themselves.  Though not a quick and accessible read, the book repays the reader's  patience.  Not only does it help bring Eliot's poem to life but it  illuminates the poetic tradition from Chaucer to Eliot and makes more  meaningful the numerous adaptations of the myth in modern culture--from  David Lodge's &quot;Small World&quot; to Robin Williams' &quot;The Fisher  King.&quot;  Not for a sophomore survey course, but definitely for any  upperlevel course on Eliot or Arthurian legend.	2000-06-16

Not that the book is misleading or unreadable.  But in the post-Wynton era, the most constructive efforts have been toward taking  jazz beyond the obvious, overly familiar, acceptance of its place in an  oral cultural tradition.  (Homer's &quot;Iliad&quot; and  &quot;Odyssey&quot; were improvised, oral poems delivered in a culture that  had no written alphabet, but where does this take us?).  To get a keener  understanding of why jazz is not simply a folk tradition but an art form,  about what makes jazz different from rap and hip-hop, the reader should  attend to the analyses of Gunther Schuller, Wynton Marsalis, Billy Taylor.   For penetrating and provocative insights into the oral basis of the music,  the reader should examine Leroi Jones' &quot;Blues People.&quot;  Or for an  &quot;oral history&quot; of the music itself, the reader couldn't do better  than Shapiro and Hentoff's &quot;Hear Me Talking to Ya.&quot;  Were it not  for the author's reknown as a popular performer, it's doubtful this book  would remain in print, at least not without substantial revision and  expansion.	2000-06-14

Because it's easy to read but hard to interpret, Achebe's masterwork has become a fixture thoughout secondary and higher education.  Unfortunately, its current status as a &quot;classic text&quot; as well as a multicultural icon threatens to make it merely another institutional artifact rather than  the genuinely provocative text it is capable of being.  Achebe does not  gloss over the apparently savage, cruel, sexist practices of the Ibo people  before the arrival of the white missionaries.  Yet students are quick to  overlook these tensions in the narrative, preferring to go for the  &quot;platitudes&quot; about imperialism that they know are expected of  them in the classroom devoted to assuring &quot;diversity&quot; is in the  curriculum.  The other &quot;tension&quot; that is often overlooked is one  outside the text: respecting the autonomy and identity of an African  country by staying out of its affairs vs. intervening to bring an end to  mass genocide (Rwanda), starvation (Ethiopia), and  enslavement of children  (Sudan).  Why is it a &quot;moral imperative&quot; for the West to  interfere in Kosovo but not in Rwanda?  If these tensions are not  confronted, the novel is a well-crafted folk tale about a tragic hero, and  also another occasion for student apathy.  Achebe himself has invited  strong moral judgements about his text by applying the same to Conrad's  &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot;	2000-04-27

My students suddenly  became interested in the OED and the history of words at the same time they  were seduced into traveling from brothels and prisons in Victorian England  to America's Civil War battlefields to questions of human psychopathology  and brilliance.  The author has taken someone prosaic bits and pieces of  history and created an impressive imaginative edifice, call it what you  will--docu-novel, new journalism, creative history.

It's reported that, shortly after publication, Tartt received a million  for the screenplay rights.  Scott Ridley, the director of  &quot;Shine,&quot; was supposed to have been shooting the film two years  ago.  What happened?

Especially noteworthy is the portrait of Bunny, the novel's victim and  perhaps the most self-indulgent yet recognizable intellectual fraud ever  captured in literature. (Is this why so many students love the book--its  unmasking of their overrated, supposedly gifted classmates?)  In addition,  the book is an incredibly effective black comedy on the American way of  death and dying. Tartt is exceptionally reserved in giving any details  about sex and Dionysian orgies, and she fails to deliver a Hitchcockian  resolution. Her avoidance of these conventions helps insure the literary  quality of novel, though some additional attention to the Dionysian  currents that lure and then damn the story's student-protagonists would  have improved the credibility and narrative effectiveness of the whole.	1998-09-02

It contains every virtually aspect of what it means to be human while presenting us with the most complex character ever created.  The fact that his only equals are women should recommend the book even more strongly to today's readers.  Since *The Odyssey* is in many respects the first novel, I prefer prose translations, which also have the advantage of greater accuracy and literalness.	1998-05-29

That's all Siegel has to say.  At least he deserves credit for extending it to 288 pages--even if doing so requires big print, multiple type fonts and lots of pictures.  He's the John Tesh of literature	1997-08-20

One hopes Chopra's penchant for the prolific does not dilute the forcefulness of his ideas.  This book is a perfect antidote to the &quot;just say no&quot; approach to addictive behaviors.  The style is friendly, inspirational, delightfully allusive (references ranging from John Milton to Charlie Parker).  Still one wishes for more specifics and comprehensiveness.  Chopra treats alcohol, tobacco, illegal drugs.  What about legally prescribed yet abused drugs	1997-07-21

Carlson's book, on the other hand, is nothing more than new-age, feel-good pablum minus any lasting benefits.  I defy the reader to recount its &quot;thesis,&quot; or even recollect any specific points.  Save your money.  The author hasn't earned it	1997-07-21

Should anyone like to share impressions about this story, I'd love to hear from you	1997-07-21

Tannen represents herself as an objective linguist but<br />does little more than rail against men and make a biased,<br />self-serving case for women.  Thankfully, most women with<br /> whom I've discussed her work see through it and its reductive<br /> claims about report talk (men) vs. rapport talk (women).<br /> Not only is she an obvious, cliched, reductive thinker but<br /> an impoverished stylist as well.  If the reader had a dollar<br /> for each time she uses the word &quot;hierarchical&quot; (to men's<br /> discredit, of course), he'd probably fare as well as Tannen<br /> did on the royalties for this nonsense.  Women will only lose<br /> in the competitive real world by following Tannen's advice.	1997-01-11

Quite simply, Paglia is the best literary critic of the past two decades.  Her prose is jargon-free and perpetually potent; her subject range reveals the most interdisciplin  ary mind of our generation.  Unfortunately, her political  incorrectness gives those unwilling to be challenged by her  difficulties an excuse not to read her.   She is both a   shibboleth and a pariah.  The mere mention of her name in  either feminist or academic circles is enough to insure  condemnation of the offender--merely adding proof to her  critique of the present state of these two institutions.  &quot;Vamps and Tramps&quot; is the &quot;rap music,&quot; &quot;performance artist&quot;  Paglia, just as &quot;Sex, Art, and Decadence&quot; is the frequently  provocative and compelling popular essayist and &quot;Sexual Per-  sonae&quot; is the prolix, Nietzschean original thinker.  Paglia  has many personae.  &quot;Vamps and Tramps&quot; may be a suitable  introduction for some but it is actually more appropriate  for the initiated Paglia-ites.  Either of the first two  volumes would be preferable as a starter for the reader  who is serious about the Paglia who can claim the top  position among current literary scholars and cultural  critics.	1997-01-01
