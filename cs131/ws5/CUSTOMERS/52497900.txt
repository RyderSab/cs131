It contains half-tones of the twenty monuments erected for that purpose, and also full description of the position of the various organizations on the field.  It is the history of the Ohio Regiments at Gettysburg.  The proceedings upon the formal dedication of the monuments are given in full, as well as the speeches delivered upon that occasion.

Day's A True History of Company I was published by the Enterprise Job Office, a commercial printing arm of the Newton, N.C. newspaper The Newton Enterprise. The pamphlet was apparently printed in a limited press run and, over the years, it has become forgotten testament to the 49th North Carolina. Billy Day joined the 49th North Carolina at age 18. The regiment's initial colonel was Stephen Ramseur. By May 1862 the unit became part of Ransom's Brigade. The 49th North Carolina saw action at Malvern Hill and Antietam in 1862. It was then transferred to the North Carolina/southern Virginia region where it saw action in the battles of Boone's Mill, Gum Swamp, and New Bern. In May of 1864, the regiment returned to Petersburg and participated in the defense of the Confederate lines. Perhaps the best portion of the book describes the siege--the life in the trenches and the crucial battle of the Crater are particularly detailed. Day was captured at Five Forks and was incarcerated at Point Lookout, Maryland until June 1865. Day wrote this book with the purpose of keeping alive for fellow veterans the memories of the war. He succeeded not only in doing this. He also provided subsequent generations a vivid view of the war from a private's viewpoint.	2001-02-16

Upon the breaking out of the Civil War in 1861, Ide enlisted as a corporal in Co. F on September 14, 1861. He served throughout Banks' Shenandoah Valley Campaign and the beginning of Pope's campaign until he was captured on July 16, 1862. After being exchanged in December, Ide was promoted to sergeant. He continued to serve with the unit throughout the Gettysburg and Rappahannock campaigns until he was wounded at Buckland. Returning to the unit, by May 1864, Ide was promoted to first sergeant, fighting in the Wilderness, Yellow Tavern, Haw's Shop and Wilson's Raid. In August, Ide was again wounded and did not return until December, at which time he discovered that he was promoted to first lieutenant. He rode as commander of Co. D and was at the front of his company when Lee surrendered at Appomattox. Ide was again promoted to captain on May 9th and was mustered out on June 21st.<br />The book includes three chapters written by Hoffman, covering those periods when Ide was away from the regiment; either wounded or as a prisoner: July 1862-December 1862; September 19, 1864-December 1864. Hoffman has relied on other letters and diaries to keep the primary source focus.

Today we better understand that the huge, untrained armies of both sides required extended skill and leadership because of their vast size. Major-General Darius Nash Couch was one of those lesser-known leaders who, by his determined example and discipline, inspired his troops to action, while frequently contending with a unique wartime influence, American politics. In addition, Couch constantly battled a debilitating case of dysentery, contracted during the Mexican War.<br />   Born in Putnam County, New York, in 1822, Darius graduated from West Point in 1846 with George B. McClellan and Thomas J. Jackson, men he always admired. Over the next five decades, the enigmatic Couch was also destined to leave his personal mark on America's budding business and scientific communities. It was the military however, and the Civil War in particular, where the deceptively quiet commander would render his most valuable contributions. Leading his First Division in the bogs of Seven Pines to Malvern Hill, Couch then commanded the II Corps at bloody Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. After Chancellorsville, Couch refused command of the Army of the Potomac and was assigned the pathetic Department of the Susquehanna during the Gettysburg Campaign, and endured the ignominious burning of Chambersburg a year later. In 1864, Couch was sent to Nashville and then off to the fields of North Carolina. During all of these assignments, the General maintained a diary, which became the primary reference for following his trials and tribulation. This biography directly confronts the General's failures and triumphs, like his absence at Crampton's Gap and his reasons for not participating at Antietam, plus the warm relationship he enjoyed with General Ambrose E. Burnside, despite the latter's failure at Fredericksburg.<br />   A passionate, analytical, fiery and sometimes impulsive officer, Couch was completely committed to the Union. He won the admiration of many and disdain of a few, including praise, respect and stinging sarcasm from President Lincoln. When the war ended, Couch spent 25 years in Connecticut, and became active in local and national politics, business, the Nutmeg State militia, the healing of the war-torn nation and for his beloved veterans. On a cold and dreary February day in 1897, Major-General Darius Nash Couch died from a combination of natural causes and his constant enemy, dysentery. Soon after, he was eulogized by his friend and compatriot, General William \\"Baldy\\" Smith, who appropriately characterized the quiet commander as \\"Sans peur et sans reproche.\\"<br />   &quot;General Darius Nash Couch, a member of the famous West Point class of 1846, had a notable Civil War career. He distinguished himself as a combat commander during the early days of the Army of the Potomac and at the 1864 Battle of Nashville. As commander of the Department of the Susquehanna, Couch had the thankless task of defending the State of Pennsylvania during two destructive Confederate incursions. Although he led an interesting life, he has been largely overlooked by historians until now. Al Gambone's well-researched and readable biography changes all that. Utilizing many sources on Couch never before published, this work will long stand as the definitive biography of the general.&quot; Ted Alexander, historian at Antietam NBP	2001-02-16

Poised to tip the balance in favor of his infant country, Gen. Robert E. Lee moved his Southern army into Maryland knowing expectant European eyes were riveted on him. Should he successfully defeat or at least embarrass Union forces on their own soil, British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston was prepared to call a cabinet meeting early in October to implement interventionist policy backed by British arms. The international climate would never be more conducive to Southern independence. <br />The finding of Lee's \\"Lost Order\\" arguably marked the war's great turning point. With it Gen. George B. McClellan deftly moved to interpose between the widely separated halves of Lee's army via Crampton's Gap, a conspicuous though little understood declivity in South Mountain, there to drive a fatal wedge that would prevent reunification of Lee's forces above the Potomac River. This, McClellan's sole brilliant counter-stroke-and the havoc it wrought in Confederate ranks-constitute the very spine of the campaign, the \\"aperture to Antietam,\\" and an end to the wildest possible opportunities for both belligerents. Though conventional wisdom routinely tells us that great battles beget even greater results, it then becomes difficult to accept oversight of this comparatively small engagement that came astonishingly close to destroying Lee's army and ending the war in the east, the arena under anxious scrutiny by Great Britain and France, superpowers of that era eager to sustain Southern independence for their own ends.<br />While it is far more satisfying and simplistic to attribute such a great national turning point to the  monumental clash at Gettysburg, the prosaic truth is that history inevitably decides such matters through the timely alignment of political stars, abetted by the misalignment of military plans. In September, 1862, the world was indeed watching and, when the skills of Lee, McClellan, and Lincoln had spent themselves, European powers prudently opted to let the American belligerents settle it among themselves. And so war's outcome had become inevitable. In the aftermath, neither Lee nor McClellan found cause to dwell upon Crampton's Gap in concealing deep mutual disappointment, belying the essential truth that this mountain top shoving match had become, in microcosm, the pivotal battle of the pivotal campaign of America's most pivotal conflict.	2001-02-16

E, 4th Texas Infantry. Only one man from the Waco area responded--John C. West. Soon after enlisting, West not only began his trip to Virginia but also began a diary. That diary and his letters home form the basis of this personal account in the ranks of one of the finest fighting outfits in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. West saw action at two of the bloodiest battles of the war--Gettysburg and Chickamauga.<br />&quot;Although never a significant proportion of its soldiers, troops from Texas played important roles in many of the Army of Northern Virginia's battles.  John C. West's A Texan In Search of a Fight is an excellent account by a man who fought with the Texas Brigade at Gettysburg, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Knoxville.  A combination of diary and letters, West's book includes valuable information about the battles in which he took part, attitudes and concerns of soldiers in the ranks, and the nature of travel between the trans-Mississippi and the eastern Confederacy at the mid-point of the war.&quot;  Gary W.

Corbin served with the Army of Northern Virginia for only the last nine months of its existence. His letters describing Confederate service made a book of fewer than one hundred pages in the original edition, and more than one-fourth of that volume covered Corbin's interesting and arduous trip from Europe to Virginia. Despite the author's relatively short tenure with the army, and the slender extent of the resultant book, Corbin's Letters of a Confederate Officer to His Family in Europe During the Last Year of the War of Secession stands out as an important item in Confederate bibliographical annals for several reasons. It is one of the meager handful of Confederate books published in France; the only published Army of Northern Virginia account by a French emigrant (albeit of Virginian blood); among the half-dozen rarest Army of Northern Virginia books; the most important single source for the curiously unrecorded military career of General Charles W. Field; and, in my admittedly subjective judgment, the best written and most literate book by any Confederate.&quot;  Robert K.

Fromed in 1862, the regiment saw action in some of the fiercest campaigns and battles of the war; Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Petersburg, Peebles Farm and Five Forks. It also was present at Antietam, Chancellorsville, Mine Run, North Anna, Bethesda Church, Gravelly Run and Appomattox, where it had the distinct honor of being of the regiments to formally receive the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.    Originally commanded by Colonel Adelbert Ames, leadership of the regiment soon fell upon the shoulders of the most famous civilian soldier of the war--Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. At Gettysburg, Chamberlain and the 20th Maine anchored the Union line on Little Round Top and helped to save the day, and the battle, for the Federal cause. The regiment fought with excellence in several later campaigns but will always be known for its brilliant and gallant performance at Gettysburg, July 2, 1863.    After the war only one veteran of the unit attempted to chronicle the exploits of the 20th Maine Infantry. In 1882, Reverend Theodore Gerrish published &quot;Army Life&quot;. Although there are brief, scattered accounts written by other veterans of the unit's wartime exploits, this remains the only full-length book, purposely published by a 20th Maine veteran.	2001-02-06

Though the veterans are long gone, many of the debates continue to captivate Gettysburg enthusiasts. One such little-described polemic involved men of Colonel Samuel Sprigg Carroll's Second Corps brigade, the Gibraltar Brigade, a \\"western\\" unit composed of regiments from Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana. The hard-bitten veterans of the Gibraltar Brigade had little time to relax after their hard march to Gettysburg. Early in the evening of July 2, three of Carroll's regiments were ordered from where they lay near Ziegler's Grove toward East Cemetery Hill which was under Confederate assault. The tired Ohioans, Indianians and West Virginians arrived at the Evergreen Cemetery Gate on the Baltimore Pike to find part of General Howard's Eleventh Corps line retreating up the east slope of the hill. The fiery Carroll deployed his men into line of battle and drove more than 50 Confederates from Captain R. Bruce Ricketts' Pennsylvania battery thereby securing this part of the Federal line. Or so it seemed, for unbeknown to those involved, disparate opinions of what actually happened in the July 2 gloom were soon to erupt into a sometimes caustic feud that pitted Second Corps veterans against General Howard's men and partisans. The dispute over who actually saved the Federal batteries on East Cemetery Hill commenced before the start of the Spring 1864 Campaign and endured into the twentieth century. Though such debates as the Meade-Sickles and Hancock-Howard controversies have received extensive coverage, little has been written on the Carroll-Howard quarrel. More than anything else, the protracted disagreement between the Second and Eleventh Corps veterans recounted in The Gibraltar Brigade on East Cemetery Hill reveals how comrades in battle could differ on specifics of that fighting and for such a long time. It also demonstrates how fervently these veterans contended for the honor of their regiments and corps.	2001-02-06

Zook (Army of the Potomac)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Book Description	From the ranks of some of America's most passive people, the Mennonites, sprang the intrepid Union general, Samuel K. Zook. Raised in the very cradle of freedom, Valley Forge, Sam Zook was a good friend and subordinate to another area hero, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock. While these two men came from similar and tolerant religious backgrounds, Hancock out of the Quaker tradition, they also enjoyed an uncommon areligious talent with their verbal oaths. Zook was a citizen soldier who found military strictures to be virtually second nature to his personality. Afforded only a modest education and raised in an agrarian atmosphere, he was introduced to the military by the local militia, which he joined as a young man. From his rich Teutonic heritage, Zook was inculcated with a strong dedication to detail and discipline, which aided his impressive technical ability, as witnessed by his noted accomplishments in the budding telegraph field. These were demanding traits that he carried directly into his ranks and onto the battlefield. But some aspects of his life, both civilian and military, were frequently dotted with important and consuming controversies which continued well after his untimely death. Zook's contribution to the Union cause was as great as anyone could demand or expect from any soldier. Leading the 57th New York and later, the Third Brigade, First Division of Hancock's Second Corps, his crowning military moments were at Fredericksburg, where the record lets us vividly relieve his horrible agonies of battle with all of their cruelties and passions. Then to Gettysburg with its ironies, confusion and human madness. Despite all of those trying conditions, there never was a finer moment for Sam Zook. Decisively defying orders on the second day of Gettysburg, he led his exhausted brigade across the open farmlands to aid the suffering ranks of the Third Corps, onto a small patch of lonely ground known only as the Wheatfield. While standing tall in his stirrupsand positioning his men amidst a hail of shot and shell, Zook was brought down by a single bullet that would close the book on his brief life of only 41 years. Laid to rest in Montgomery Cemetery in Norristown, where he would ultimately be joined by Generals Hancock, Hartranft, McClellan and Slemmer, Zook was regrettably lost to the annals of history and the hearts of the nation. Today, our responsibility is to save the memory of all those who fought that horrible war and paid the sad, ultimate price. To further the knowledge of his contributions and to the impressive memory of Brigadier-General Samuel K. Zook, this volume is solemnly devoted.	2001-02-06

Former soldiers were encouraged to submit articles describing their wartime experiences and thousands of these personal accounts were published. Contributors, primarily Union veterans, ranged in rank from privates to generals, and their material covered a wide array of topics. Gettysburg was an especially popular theme. Scores of men who saw action in that epic battle used the National Tribune as a forum to explain their parts in the battle or the roles of their regiments. These writings were often detailed accounts and included material not found elsewhere. Frequently, debates erupted that ran their course through several issues of the paper. Included in this compilation are 142 of the best articles that appeared in the National Tribune. They encompass the entire campaign, from Ewell's success at Winchester to Lee's recrossing of the Potomac. This book presents the battle of Gettysburg through the eyes of the men who were there. From the accounts of these participants, today's readers can more fully appreciate and understand the men who fought and the events that transpired during those three, crucial, deadly days in July 1863.	2001-02-06

The outfit saw its first action at Ball's Bluff. From there, the battery eventually accompanied the Union army to the Peninsula and was engaged at Fair Oaks, Savage Station, Glendale and Malvern Hill. Next, the battery fought at Antietam, and then, at Fredericksburg, the outfit followed the infantry in close support in front of Marye's Heights. At Gettysburg, the battery was part of the artillery that held Cemetery Hill. The intensity of the action in the battery's front can be noted by the fact that one Confederate cannon ball struck and lodged in the muzzle of one of the Rhode Islander's guns. After Gettysburg, the battery continued to serve with distinction at Mine Run, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and the siege of Petersburg.	2001-02-06

Certain that war was imminent and desperately eager to prove his mettle in battle, he impulsively left his home in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, and traveled to Charleston, walking a good part of the way. His presence in Charleston as the first Virginia volunteer for the South attracted the attention of prominent citizens who, in an effort to edge Virginia toward secession, publicized his deeds in South Carolina and Virginia newspapers. After the surrender of Fort Sumter, Rawlings returned home a hero and joined Company D of the Thirtieth Virginia Infantry Regiment. His experiences during the rest of the war were at times heroic, comic, pathetic, and outrageously foolhardy. Rawlings saw the war begin at Fort Sumter and was one of but a few men in the Army of Northern Virginia who also were present at Appomattox. Those moments of fame which came to Rawlings in Charleston remained with him throughout his life. His Virginia contemporaries always ascribed to his persona the mystique of his journey to Charleston and his dash and daring throughout the Civil War. He was forever clothed in the \\"glories and garments of war.\\" Ben Rawlings' story is based on his Reminiscences, family scrapbooks, letters, and other documents which comprise Rawlings Family Papers.	2001-02-06

Black's Civil War letters, which begin with Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862 and end with Jubal Early's Valley Campaign of 1864, discuss climactic battles like Second Manassas, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg.  Literate and perceptive, Black had interesting things to say about figures like Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, Jubal Early, and Thomas Rosser.  The Second Corps Field Hospital was the site of the amputation of Jackson's arm at Chancellorsville, and Black was one of three surgeons who assisted Dr. Hunter McGuire in the operation.  In addition to Harvey Black's letters, the book contains three letters of his wife Mollie, all that have survived.  They poignantly reveal the trials Southern women faced during the war, fending for themselves and their families.  The small town of Blacksburg in Appalachian Virginia also plays an important part in the story.  An appendix transcribes and analyses the free and slave schedules for the 1860 Blacksburg census.<br />  Black was a significant figure in the Civil War and postwar Virginia medicine and education. After the war, Black helped found what is today known as Virginia Tech.	2001-02-06
US	52497900	R138VQW3VNY353	0935523383	13446764	The Life and Letters of General George Gordon Meade (2 Volume Set)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Book Description	George Gordon Meade served ably as a Fifth Corps commander through June, 1863. Then he was suddenly thrust into the difficult role of commanding the Army of the Potomac only days prior to the Battle of Gettysburg. For the rest of the war, Meade served capably as commander of the Federal army in the East. Supplementing this important two volume set is a grouping of 76 photographs. These images were taken from scrap books organized by the general's son after the war. Many of the men who served on Meade's staff are shown here, as are scenes of the 1864-65 campaigning.<br />&quot;The essential title for any study of Meade is The Life and Letters of George Gordon Meade, Major-General United States Army, 2 vols. (New York:  Charles Scribner's Sons, 1913), edited with connecting text by his son George Meade. Understandably favorable to its subject, this work nevertheless offers innumerable insights into Meade's personality, his opinions on a range of subjects, and his service during the war with Mexico as well as the Civil War. He emerges as an honest, patriotic officer increasingly concerned with a lack of public recognition for his contributions after Gettysburg. Life and Letters may not transform all readers into enthusiastic supporters of George Gordon Meade. It will give them a better understanding, however, of the war in the East, the internal dynamics of the Army of the Potomac and the contributions of one of the Union's most important soldiers. Happily, the set has been recently reprinted, with an excellent introduction by Richard A. Sauers and dozens of new illustrations, as part of Butternut and Blue's &quot;Army of the Potomac Series.&quot; Generally available for the first time in many years, this basic title on one of the Union's leading soldiers and its most important army should find an appreciative audience.&quot;  Gary W.

It met its first trial by fire at Yorktown. Later, the regiment suffered tremendous casualties at Gaines' Mill. The regiment, part of the Fifth Corps, was engaged at Malvern Hill, Shepherdstown, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. At Gettysburg, the 22nd Massachusetts and the 2nd Company Massachusetts Sharpshooters, which was attached to the regiment, were engaged in the wheatfield, near the Rose woods. In 1864, the regiment served in the Wilderness and Spotsylvania battles, losing a large portion of its rank and file. Due to its heavy losses throughout the war, the 22nd Massachusetts Infantry earned the distinction of being one of Fox's &quot;Fighting 300&quot; Union regiments. Included is information about the 2nd Company of Massachusetts Sharpshooters and the 3rd Light Battery, both of which were attached to the 22nd Massachusetts.	2001-02-06

This is unfortunate, for this volume stands as one of the most important published sources on Georgia troops in the Army of Northern Virginia. Included in Heroes and Martyrs are eighteen detailed histories of infantry, cavalry, and artillery units, most of them written in the summer of 1864 by Confederate officers in the trenches at Petersburg. The author of Heroes and Martyrs, James M. Folsom, originally intended on issuing multiple volumes that would chronicle the service of every military unit raised in Georgia during the Confederacy.  Wartime exigencies, including the destruction of his manuscripts at the hands of Sherman's men, and postwar poverty prevented Folsom from ever completing his project.  The one volume he was able to publish through the firm of Burke, Boykin, and Company of Macon, Georgia, appeared for sale in the spring of 1865, only weeks before Appomattox. Today fewer than a dozen original copies of Heroes and Martyrs are known to exist in public repositories. This new edition of Heroes and Martyrs of Georgia contains a new introduction and index prepared by Keith S. Bohannon, a doctoral student in the history department at Penn State University and a seasonal historian at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park.	2001-02-06

And few families were closer to that war than the Daniel Hite family of the Shenandoah Valley. Three of four soldier sons died fighting in the Stonewall Brigade, while Isaac, the survivor, served in Robert E. Lee's bodyguard. The family story is told in some eighty wartime letters to and from these soldiers plus a year's diary by one of them, published here for the first time. In a retrospective article, the weekly county newspaper once called the Hites \\"A Family of Heroes,\\" but we read little here of fearless valor. Rather, there are the discomforts of camp and campaign, problems of farm management in wartime, teasing and flirting between young men and women, and a family steadfastly coping with hardship and tragedy. The transcribed letters and diary are faithful to the original spelling and punctuation, while the editor's brief commentary describes the historical context and identifies the many Page County friends, cousins, and comrades named. With each soldier's death the correspondence decreases, and family material is then supplemented by excerpts from unpublished diaries of other \\"Page Grey\\" comrades. Indexes of names and topics help the modern reader to connect to these not-so-distant ancestors. And their great-grandchildren, Civil War devotees, and general readers can share the experiences of these ordinary people in most extraordinary times.	2001-02-06
US	52497900	R3GUQUHK2H074R	093552309X	250513412	From Gettysburg to Rapidan: The Army of the Potomac July 1863 to April 1864	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Book Description	Andrew A. Humphreys served with distinction in the Army of the Potomac, holding such positions as staff officer under McClellan, Divisional commander, Meade's chief of staff, and finally Second Corps commander.  His role as chief of staff for General Meade immediately following the Battle of Gettysburg made him extremely familiar with the maneuvers of the Army of the Potomac. Humphreys originally wrote this material to be included in his Volume XII of Scribner's Campaigns of the Civil War.  However, due to the size of his volume, the material prior to the 1864-1865 Virginia campaigns was excluded.  Hence, the book was published separately under the title From Gettysburg to the Rapidan.... In his preface, Humphreys acknowledged that &quot;the information needed for the preparation of these chapters was fuller and more readily obtained than that required for Volume XII.&quot;  In this book Humphreys detailed Lee's retreat from Gettysburg; Lee's abandonment of the Valley; the movement to Centreville; the Battles of Bristoe Station (14 October  1863), Kelly's Ford (7 November 1863), Rappahannock Station (7 November 1863); and the Mine Run Campaign (26 November-2 December 1863).  Very little has been written on the Virginia Campaigns between Lee and Meade during the fall and winter of 1863.  Humphreys's account gives a succinct and clear overview of the maneuvers and fighting that preceded the bloody 1864 campaigns.	2001-02-06
US	52497900	R6GA54IF6TSI	0935523707	231670081	Gettysburg, Day Two: A Study in Maps	Books	5	35	38	N	N	Book Description	Depicting the ebb and flow of troop movements on the battlefield is always a difficult task for an author. Words are helpful tools, and those scribed by capable historians frequently offer a fair representation of action. But in military history, it is the map that best unlocks the mysteries of the battlefield. John Imhof has provided Gettysburg affecinarios with a tremendous reference. Through the use of over 50 sequential maps, he has depicted the progression of the battle during the fateful afternoon and evening of July 2, 1863. Rather than presenting small maps of individual pieces of the battlefield, Imhof has focused on the battlefield as a whole, thereby providing the reader with a more complete vision of the interrelated events that occurred. John's research was based on participant accounts drawn from the Official Records, Bachelder Papers, the Southern Historical Society Papers, regimental histories, memoirs, the National Tribune, and much more. Maps, rather than chapters, form the divisions of each section of the book. Each map is followed by a heavily footnoted body of text that interprets them. The detailed commentary following each map is excellent. It is my opinion that there are few, if any, other battle histories that offer such a valuable and precise display of unfolding events.	2001-02-06

Dunaway was studying law at the University of Virginia. He promptly enrolled in the 47th Virginia Infantry and, after a non-eventful first year, participated in the 1862 battles of Seven Pines, Mechanicsville, Gaines's Mill, and Frayser's Farm. Due to the regiment's heavy losses in these encounters, Lieutenant Dunaway served as a company commander during July and August of 1862. He then assumed the post of regimental adjutant, a position that he held until March 1863 when he became captain of Co. I, 40th Virginia Infantry. Soon thereafter, Dunaway joined the staff of Brockenbrough's Brigade. Dunaway's memoir was characterized by one reviewer as \\"brief and bright\\"; another wrote that his recollections were \\"even-tempered\\" and that they \\"avoid the unreliability of more detailed narratives.\\" This book serves as one of the only substantial sources on Charles W. Field's Virginia brigade.	2001-02-06

White, First Sergeant of Company F, 2nd United States Sharpshooter Regiment, 1861-1865	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Book Description	The 2nd United States Sharpshooter Regiment was one of the elite units of the Army of the Potomac. Composed of expert marksmen, this regiment served throughout the war, distinguishing itself on every battlefield on which it fought. Wyman White joined a New Hampshire company of the 2nd U.S.S.S. in November 1861.  He served in every battle in which the regiment was engaged with the exceptions of South Mountain and Antietam. These memoirs, written after the war, provide a vivid picture of army life and battle action. His recall of detail suggests that these reminiscences were based on diaries he kept throughout the war. Wyman White's manuscripts is loaded with personal insights, humor, and superb detail of events, personalities, equipage, uniforms, and soldier life. The feisty White provides an important look at the 2nd regiment of U.S.S.S.--most other accounts of sharpshooters were by members of the 1st U.S.S.S.  Virtually all aspects of soldier life are covered, from snowball battles to burials. This book is sure to become one of the most important sources not only on Berdan's Sharpshooters but also on the Army of the Potomac.	2001-02-06
