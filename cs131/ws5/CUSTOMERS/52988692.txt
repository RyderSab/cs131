Their favorite author combines several of their well-known characters in one book?  That's what A Darkness More Than Night by Michael Connelly proposes to do.  I have to say that the title is just great and every book I've read by Connelly is both well-written and also one of those books you want to read as quickly as possible to find out what's going to happen.  Often his books aren't about solving the mystery so much as delving into the motivations and inner demons of the detective solving the mystery.  This book, more than any of his others, is more about what the two detectives, Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb, are thinking and feeling.  But since the book shifts back and forth between the two of them, the tone is uneven and a bit disorienting.  Still, it was a great read, but I found that there were a few dangling characters and ideas in this book, things that are introduced and then discarded.  The book does raise interesting ethical questions about legal procedure versus punishing the guilty.  I would highly recommend that you read the other Harry Bosch works and the Terry McCaleb book (Blood Work) before you read this one, since it reveals a lot of the plot details from previous novels.	2002-08-15

I felt that the original Shopaholic did stand out because it was almost over the top ridiculously funny.  Being American, it's good to know that there are people in other countries who are as obsessed with materialism as we are.  This sequel is even funnier.  Becky Bloomwood goes to New York and gets caught up in the Manhattan lifestyle.  I love the whole thing about her not understanding the exchange rate so thinking that &quot;dollars don't count.&quot;  What I really loved about this book was the ending, how she really found the right career for herself and was able to exist on her own without anyone bailing her out.  None of the characters was as interesting as Becky herself, but as most of the book is about her, that's not a problem.  A very entertaining read and I felt like it also had a very empowering message at the end, but wasn't preachy or over the top.	2002-08-15

I went on a tremendous reading spree in the last month and had to read all of Sharyn McCrumb's Elizabeth MacPherson books.  After reading all of these amusing mysteries, I have to say that Missing Susan was the funniest.  While some mysteries have the person dying in the first chapter and you spend the whole book trying to guess who the murderer is, Missing Susan is the absolute opposite.<br />...<br />This book has so many amusing scenes, particularly when the tour participants are participating at one of those mystery house weekends or the fact that the tour participants are more interested in shopping than seeing the historic sites.  I highly recommend all of the other Elizabeth MacPherson books, but this is definitely the most amusing.	2002-05-22

I'm not usually that interested in biographies of writers, often the biographer does not relate their life to their literature in a way that interests me, but Nabokov is one of my favorite writers, so I thought I'd give this book a try.  First you should note that it is a huge book that spans a large time frame, but you shouldn't be put off by the size, because Boyd's prose is very succinct and the chapters are manageable.  It's clear to me that he appreciates Nabokov's works, as the best chapters are the ones detailing the periods of time when Nabokov is writing his works.  There is so much great background information to be found here, that Nabokov wrote on index cards, the road trips that influenced Lolita, and Nabokov's relationship with his wife, Vera.  This is what literary biographies should be  like.  I highly recommend this to any fans of Nabokov who want to learn more about his life and his writing.	2001-12-21

I can understand the appeal to some people, because of how introductory it is; if you've never been exposed to Zen at all, this is a good introduction.  I didn't feel like the book really enlightened me, and reading it didn't change my life and/or my attitudes to food.  It's a good idea, to remove yourself from desire, but I think that overeating and bad eating habits are so complicated and ingrained for so many people, that it would be hard to read a short book like this and suddenly be &quot;cured.&quot;  Obviously, when you are changing your life, there is usually some sort of catalyst, and if this kind of book works for you, great, but I didn't personally find it that useful or revolutionary.	2001-12-21

For a book published by an independent press, I was very impressed with the physicality of this book, how it is put together, the cool illustration on the front from \\"The Girl Detective.\\"  Kelly Link is really different from just about every modern writer out there.  As well, each story in this collection is different from each other.  Her style is really diverse, and impossible to really describe fully, but she always takes you in new directions that you wouldn't expect.  Some of the stories affected me more than others, but there was not one in the collection that bored me.  And for those of you who grew up on Nancy Drew like I did, the last story will really amuse you.  If you are sick of all those books now that all seem as if they've been written by a computer or a room full of random monkeys (...), you should definitely check out Kelly Link.	2001-12-10

Maybe I'm just a jaded reader living in a later age, but reading about her affairs with women men and her drinking and pill-popping didn't really seem that audacious to me.  There definitely were a lot of interesting aspects to this book, however.  The author really did a tremendous amount of research and I really felt like I knew Susann's family and friends after reading the book.  The author delves into Freudian territory, surmising that Susann had a lot of issues with her father that ended up in her works.  I think the part I liked best of the biography was the discussion of Susann's works and how she published them.  Susann had an amazing drive to be famous and this books shows how tragic it is that she died so young before she could really enjoy her fame.	2001-09-07

Tales from Watership Down is more a book of short stories, some loosely connected together, some not even related to one another.  All the stories in this book are as fun to read as the short stories of El-ahrairha in the original book, but while those stories served mostly to further the plot and personify the rabbits by showing their mythology, these stories are just entertaining.  I could understand how some readers would be dissapointed if they thought this book was a true sequel, but it does work nicely as a companion piece to the original.<br />I didn't quite find the stories at the end that continued the life of Hazel and the rabbits at Watership Down quite on par with what I remembered from the original.  One of the great things about the original was how he characterized the different rabbits personalities, but they didn't seem quite as lifelike in this book.  Still, if you loved Watership Down, how could you not want to read this book?	2001-09-07

Whereas this Weight Watchers cookbook that I just got for my birthday in May, I have used many times.  This cookbook has a lot of basics like descriptions of difference spices and techniques to cook with less fat and more flavor.  It also has a huge range of recipes, all with the POINTS breakdown.  A lot of the recipes are classical updates using less fat, but there is a section of different ethnic foods that is fantastic.  This is a great cookbook for anyone who likes traditional food and is trying to eat more healthy with less fat and more fiber!  The hardcover edition makes it easy to open up and leave out on the counter while you are cooking.	2001-08-15

As a previous reviewer pointed out, many of the ingredients that the recipes called for were not common household items.  However, the instructions in this book are clear and concise and I particularly liked the description of all those various aromatherpay oils and what they do.  I think I was expecting this book to be a little larger in size, more like something nice I could stick out on my coffee table.  It does have a very good variety of various treatments for different hair and skin types.  I think something like this would appeal to someone who is more of a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot;-er.  It is interesting for me to learn about what would go into a lotion, but hard to picture myself actually assembling all the ingredients to make all these things when I could buy the equivalent at the drugstore.	2001-08-15

King created two amazing original series, the Kate Martinelli and Mary Russell books, but she has written this riveting book as well.  She is a master at creating suspense, not in a cheesy John Grisham way, but deliberately leaving you hanging at the end of the chapter so you can't wait to turn the page and find out what happens.  This book has a lot of interesting psychological discussions of people involved in cults and shows the mentality of the leaders, and the followers.  I think King is a very fair and balanced leader and doesn't make the mistake some writers would make with this subject by showing all cult leaders as amoral, or all cults as harmful.  The book keeps you hanging until the ending, which is concise bordering on  abrupt.  I could see how some people were dissapointed with the ending because it was so curt, but in a way, that's more interesting than books with a long drawn out conclusion and typical &quot;happy ending.&quot;  King leaves it ambiguous and more up to the reader's imagination (or maybe open to a sequel, I'm not sure).  Once again, Laurie R. King shines in the world of shallow popular fiction, outstanding among her peers.	2001-08-15

It was interesting, mostly easy to read, and the characters are engaging and somewhat believable.  I did find a few problems with reading it, as the book would jump in time frequently (flashbacks and flashfowards) without warning, so it was a bit hard to tell where I was.  I liked a lot of the characters and found them very believable, particularly Judy the protagonist, but I felt like some of the characters like her sister didn't seem to make much sense.  The author did a lot more telling than showing in descriptions of Judy's sister and you never really were quite sure what was going on (and I felt like it was crucial to the plot).  I didn't find that this book really brought me into the South in any way, and could have taken place anywhere, perhaps because the story is universal.  This is like a lot of the books featured by Oprah, a woman who has marital and/or family problems, has some really dark moments, finally has an epiphany, and then goes on to rise above it all and rebuild her life.  If you like that kind of thing, you'll like this book.  I did as well feel like there were some predictable parts in this book, particularly since I have read many books in this genre.  You will probably enjoy reading this, but will not find it earth-shattering or mind-blowing.	2001-03-06

One or two of the stories in this book, I remembered reading from the online column, but they were surprising and entertaining in a second read.  A book of short stories by various authors should be diverse and each story should be somewhat different, but still cohesive enough to hold together under a single theme.  This book manages to do that excellently through it's theme of wanderlust.  The concept of wanderlust, of desiring to go on a journey that puts you outside your everday life and opens your horizons, is thoroughly elucidated in this work.  Reading this book will make you want to travel to distant lands.  I highly recommend it.	2001-03-02

This guy I was interested in had told me that this was one of his favorite books and better at describing his life as a Jewish man than Portnoy's Complaint.  Now, I had read Portnoy's Complaint in college, thought it was funny, touching, but it definitely had moments of misogyny.  My Life As A Man, however, seems mostly sad with more unrealistic portraits of women.  Obviously, I don't know Philip Roth personally, so it's not for me to say if it's autobiographical or not, but there is a lot of pain that comes from male-female relationships gone wrong in this text.  The women in the book are crazy, neurotic &quot;shiksas&quot; who go out of their way to drive Peter Tarnapol to a breakdown.  On one hand, Peter has his lying, manipulative wife, and the other, his neurotic, needy girlfriend.  I always feel that Roth's female characters do not represent real women, and although I dislike labels, I put this book down when done and thought &quot;what a bunch of misogynistic crap.&quot;  A good study of dysfunctional relationships, but I don't feel like Peter ever really reaches into his soul to figure out why he gets involved with the wrong women.  Obviously not something to structure your life around, nevertheless, this book was a interesting read.  Roth has an excellent command of the English language.	2001-02-16

It goes through some of the emotional/mental issues that a woman might face in starting out in this sort of scene/lifestyle.  It does address the mental issues and reservations that some women might have with beginning to find their dominant nature.  The book goes on to lay out a very basic scene to get you started as well, in great detail.  I found this book to be very short, well-written, and easy to read, but it made me want to read more.  I found the Mistress Manual by Lorelei to be a little more detailed in helping me decide what sorts of scenes interest me, so I would recommend that book in addition to this.  This book has an excellent focus on safety and safe sex.	2001-02-08

Without getting too personal, I was drawn to buying this book because of some personal growth and realizations about myself and my sexuality.  The fantasies and thoughts in this book, some of them already existed somewhere within my subconscious, but reading this book gave them some release.  This book is well-written and very detailed.  The first chapters deal with the psychological/emotional aspects of wanting to be a dominant woman or having feelings of domaninance as a woman in society.  (Nice girls don't want to hit men, right?)  The book details the five archetypes of dominating women (Nurse, Teacher, Queen, Amazon, and Goddess) and how each has different fantasies and scenes.  The scenes in this book are excellent, and I would recommend that you take a little bit from each and tailor them to suit your (and your partner's) needs.  I would definitely recommend this book to any woman who is drawn to the BDSM lifestyle and wants to learn how to top effectively.	2001-02-08

The seduction techniques are funny and sexy, and there is a lot of insight into what turns different people on.  I haven't tried many of the techniques, but I definitely use the personality sections in figuring out how to attract people and spark their interest.  Also, this book enables you to figure out what sort of person who would interest you.  Highly recommended whether you know much about Astrology or not!	2000-12-09

But Downtown is a different and more complicated book.  This book details many of the civil movements in the 60s like the Vietnam war, the African-American quest for equality, and the changing of society.  The different types of characters in this book are fascinating, from the upper crust society types to the people living in projects and slums.  The narrator, Smoky, is a sort of tabula rasa, a blank slate who records many of the changes around her, as she herself changes.  Not having lived through this period in history, I found that reading this book gave me a lot of insight into the lives of people in the 60s.  It was a very engaging read and I would highly recommend it.  And the ending is somewhat surprising, which should keep you tuned in until the last page.	2000-12-05

The first three chapters start defining the character Cat and her husband Joe, who live in a college town on a mountain and have a &quot;beautiful&quot; life.  If the novel had been about Cat's life story or life at this college town, it would have been an entirely different novel, and probably more interesting.  There could even have been more of a story about their daughter Lacey who is blind and has traveled all over the world.  But instead Cat and Joe end up going to Italy to see two friends get married.<br />I think the descriptions of Italy are beautiful and fascinating and reading this book really made me want to go there.  But most of the characters were not well-developed or that complicated, and since the rest of the book is about their interactions, I found it a little difficult to be that interested.  For instance, Cat meets a painter who wants to paint her, but she seems fairly naive about the whole thing.  The painter is described as being very rough and macho, and also very sensitive, but it seemed to me that he just wants to get Cat into bed and wasn't very complicated at all.  Cat keeps saying that her husband Joe becomes like a stranger, but he wasn't even developed that much before they went to Italy, so it's hard to know.  The book seems to lumber on for long periods of time and then ends abruptly and somewhat predictably.  A good read, but nothing earth-shattering or life-changing.	2000-10-30

The World of the Ptavvs was Niven's first novel, and I think one of his best.  His short stories in Tales of Known Space are also excellent.  Niven at his best is an imaginative science fiction writer with good character development and a gift for storytelling.  He creates new worlds and populates them with sometimes interesting, sometimes annoying characters.  This book is an excellent introduction to his writings and his style, and a huge bargain as well.  I guarantee that if you read this book, you will want to go on to read his other works.	2000-10-23

I have read many of his novels, some are more interesting than others.  Occasionally I found he would get into obsessive detail describing something that I couldn't really visualize, and I would skip ahead.  (As much as I love the Ringworld series, parts of that book fall into this category.)<br />This book was much easier to read than many of Niven's works because it was mostly plot driven.  And what a plot it was.  It features the  adventures of Jeremy Bloocher who lives on the partly terraformed planet Destiny.  Through his eyes, we see several different societies on this planet, and how men and women interrelate, and the differing types of economy.  There were many gripping moments of adventure that made it hard to put the book down.  But the ending of the book was fairly anti-climatic.  Niven leads up to a big revelation, but it's not a huge surprise.<br />I would recommend this book to people who are looking for a fun science fiction book that talks about economics and sociology.  There is even an interesting alien race, the Otterfolk, and Niven doesn't mention that their females aren't sentient like he does with many other alien races he has created!	2000-10-23

For those of you who live in the SF Bay area, you will also be excited by the locations that are described in this book.  I had read many of Laurie King's other books before reading this one and I will say that it was one of the most interesting and best written.  The novel is based on the mystery surrounding the murder of a homeless man, but the story actually told is of Brother Erasmus, a Fool, who only speaks in quotes from Shakespeare and the Bible.  The real mystery is who Brother Erasmus really is, what he is hiding, and why he speaks only in quotes.  There are some other homeless characters in the book who are also well characterized.  This book has a lot of metaphysical discussion on those who live outside society in this way.  And there is a lot of suspense and mystery involved in finding Brother Erasmus's secrets.  Eventually the detective Kate Martinelli founds out who the murderer was, but she is more interested in the life of the characters she meets.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes your mysteries to be a bit more literary.  King has been compared a lot to PD James, and I think that comparison holds true.	2000-10-02

The poor Baudelaire orphans who seem to court bad luck at every turn end up living with their distant relative who is a tycoon industrialist who makes them work in his mill.  Instead of getting paid, the mill workers get coupons, and they only get one meal a day (but lots of gum for breakfast).  Lemony Snicket's books are all wonderful, and this is the cream of the crop.  Count Olaf returns in attempt to once again steal the Baudelaire fortune, this time using hypnosis to achieve his evil gains.  This book is full of so many clever moments, and the mill setting will scare and entertain the reader.	2000-10-02

I went on to read  the Deptford trilogy and the Cornish trilogy as well as other assorted  works.  These three books are definitely a great introduction to his style.  One thing that Davies excels at is characterization, and these books  (particularly Tempest-Tost) are full of amusing and interesting characters.  Tempest-Tost is the story of an amateur group putting on a Shakespeare  play, and the plot is amusing and entertaining.  I would say Tempest-Tost  is the most humorous of the three, particularly with all of Freddy  Webster's dialogue and the drunken choir master.  Leaven of Malice involves  a mysteriously submitted incorrect newspaper announcement which somehow  involves an interesting twist of fate.  Leaven wraps up very neatly and you  will appreciate the ending of it.  Mixture of Frailties is sort of a  domestic novelistic story and quite different from other Davies I have  read.  I think that buying all three books of the trilogy together is a  good idea, because you will definitely want to read each proceeding book.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has heard of Robertson Davies but  isn't sure which of his books to read.  These three novels are very  accessible to all levels of readers.	2000-09-08

I bought the paperback editions and  they were just as a remembered, with maps in the beginning, etc.  Titan is  the most sci-fi of the three, beginning with many details of the interior  of a space vehicle and the journey to the moons of Saturn.  Titan most  resembles an adventure story where the heroine (Cirocco Jones) goes on a  quest to discover the nature of Gaia (which they call Titan when they first  encounter it).  This book introduces some of the characters to be found in  the other two books, and begins to hint at some of the deeper plots found  in the other two books in the trilogy.  If you're going to order this book,  you'll want to get Wizard and Demon as well, so you can read the whole  trilogy.  I highly recommend this book!	2000-09-07

So  when I picked up this book, I thought it was another Dagliesh mystery.  But  it was actually narrated by Cordelia Gray who was introduced in An  Unsuitable Job For A Woman.  Cordelia is a somewhat inexperienced private  detective who is wryly intelligent and humorously self-deprecating, a good  contrast to Dagliesh who seems pompous and too tragic on occasion.  Cordelia sort of flounders her way through some of the plot, but she is  always entertaining.  The other characters in this book are mostly  interesting, though the murder victim is a bit too vapid to be believed.  The setting of this book is the &quot;mysterious castle&quot; and James is  excellent at creating suspense in this setting.  James also keeps the  reader trying to figure out who the murderer is up to the end of the book.  A great read!	2000-09-07

Having read just The Wide  Window, I would say that I now want to read the rest of the Lemony Snicket  books.  As an adult, I found this book charming and humorous.  The  Baudelaire orphans are amusing, particularly little Sunny of the  super-sharp teeth.  This book was not a long complicated read like Harry  Potter books, but it was full of great humor and some suspense.  I think  that this type of book would delight most children who enjoyed books with a  sly sense of humor.  As well there is an education value as this book uses  some &quot;vocabulary words&quot; that kids might not know, but then  immediately defines these words.  After reading this one, I now want to go  out and get the whole series so far.	2000-09-01

I got this book right after I went to  Las Vegas for the  first time and planned all my future trips around it.  Admittedly,  everything in Las Vegas changes every six months, but there are a lot of  websites and references to find more information at the end of this book.  The subjects covered in this book include how to get there, where to stay,  where to eat and drink, basic gambling, and most importantly, where to  shop.  They do a lot of categorizing of hotels and entertainment which is  good, for example, telling you which activities are good for children and  which are fun for wild party people in their 20s.  This book also hits on  some of the lesser known attractions, and gives you a good idea of what  kind of things you'll enjoy seeing (and what things will be a waste of your  time).  There is also a lot of invaluable advice found in these pages.  Despite the &quot;idiot&quot; title, this a smartly written and well put  together book that will appeal to a variety of people.  Don't leave for Las  Vegas without it.	2000-08-18

For starters, it's not very long and the language is not  challenging.  Jung uses a lot of interesting stories to explain his  theories of synchronicity, when unrelated things seem to happen together at  the same time with a purpose.  The first time I read this book, I found  that while I was reading it, I would experience synchronicity.  For  instance, I was reading it on my lunch break from work and I ran into one  of my coworkers that I had a crush on.  Maybe that's just a coincidence,  but maybe there are greater forces at work.  I would say that if you are  intimidated by reading huge books by Jung, this is a good book to get  started with, and it will definitely give you something about which to  think.	2000-08-18

Even though you know the basic elements of the plot from reading about it on Amazon, about how Flannery Culp kills the &quot;big man on campus&quot; the  book is still unpredictable and fascinating.  This book is almost entirely  diary entries, yet so well-written that they really convey the mood, scene,  and plot.  While I was reading it, I was trying to figure out why I hadn't  heard more about Daniel Handler; he is a very talented writer and brilliant  at conveying tone.  The book is at turns sexy and violent, but mostly  sarcastic and somewhat snide.  All and all, very funny and a great read.  After I finished reading it, I wanted to pick it up and reread it again.	2000-07-31

Even though I'm in my 20s and come from a different generation, I was able to empathize Mira's struggles of trying to be a good wife in the  50s and 60s, and then rebelling in the 70s to reclaim her identity and  role.  At the time this was published, these ideas were probably more  revolutionary than they are today, but I still think they are just as  important.  There were many moments in this book that were happy, many more  that were sad, and it was always touching.  I recommend this book to many  of my women friends of all ages, and always consider it to be one of the  best books to read if you're frustrated with your life and need to think  about going in a new direction.	2000-07-24

I would definitely say that I saw myself a lot in the characters.  This book talks a lot about the different roles of men and women in a love  affair, and how the woman somehow always ends up doing more of the work.  I  think some people might say this is outdated, but there are some truths in  this novel.  But despite her cynicism, the female protagonist still embarks  in this love affair and falls deeply in love with this man.  This book is  at turns didatic, romantic, and sad, and very enjoyable to read.  I would  definitely recommend it to anyone who just got out of a relationship as I  think that's the best time to read it.	2000-07-24

Well, it really is an interesting and captivating book that draws you in as you read it.  Journeyer is the story of Marco  Polo and his journeys to Asia, supposedly the other half that he did not  actually tell the scribe who recorded his journeys in real life.  I am not  familiar with the history of that period, so I cannot vouch for the  historical accuracy, but I will say that this book made me want to read up  on the history.  There is danger and adventure on every turn as Marco and  his father and uncle make their way to China.  The book is at turns  violent, sexy, and dramatic, but also enlightening and fascinating.  I  found it very hard to put down, once I had picked it up, even moving  quickly through some squeamish parts.  Jennings really knows how to get the  reader's attention and keep it.	2000-07-24

I bought this book after some period of inactivity when I just didn't feel like doing anything at all athletic.  But this book was definitely a catalyst for changing my life for the better.  Through careful research,  Dr. Nelson shows that just lifting weights a few times a week helps women  increase their metabolism and start losing weight.  Well, I  didn't follow  her diet plan and just started doing some of the arm exercises.  But that  was enough to motivate me to start working out with videos (by The Firm) at  home, and now five months later, I'm working out 5-6 days a week.  I've  lost weight, but more importantly, I feel stronger and healthier.  The diet  plan that she describes in this book seems very sound as well.  This book  is clear, easy to understand, and is not spouting some crazy fad diet which  avoids particular food groups.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants  to start feeling better and more active and needs an easy to follow plan.	2000-07-24

The story was gripping, the characters were somewhat believable, and it was a real page-turner.  Aztec Autumn, on the  other hand, was completely dissapointing and sort of felt like it had been  strung together by a computer program which pulled out elements of Aztec  and then strung heavy-handed plots around them.  Very little in Aztec  Autumn seemed surprising or inspiring, and the narrative voice did not  capture my attention the way it did in the original.  It's hard to tell if  a sequel like this, actually written by the author, is worse than one of  those sequels written after the author died, by some hopeful writer  obsessed with making a quick buck.  One of the things that was great about  Aztec was that it told a finite life story, but this book just dragged the  story on in an unoriginal manner.	2000-07-24

This book has many stories which flow together with varied narration, and  in a few of them, the narrator rises out of the page to tell his own  stories.  Kundera is undoubtedly a post-modernist, but there is something  fascinatingly easy to read about all of his stories.  It's clear from  reading this how he loves and obsesses about his characters.  This book is  a fantastic read that really makes you think a lot about the relations  between men and women, and also about life in a (former) Soviet controlled  country.  I think in America we feel very removed from what went on in  Eastern Europe, but much of Kundera's writing based on the horrors he  experienced bring you in touch with that world.	2000-07-21

I think I read it the first time around 10, when I was mostly reading stupid romance novels or &quot;teen&quot; books.  This book is somewhat aimed at  kids in tone, but there are a lot of things you will pick up as an adult  reader.  What child stuck on earth couldn't sympathize with Kip and his  desire to go into space?  What child who feels ordinary and average  wouldn't like to find out that they have extraordinary genius parents?  This book works on a lot of levels and is very fun to read.  And plus there  is the fun tip of how to remember the order of the planets, which is still  useful today.  If I have a kid some day like Kip, I'll definitely encourage  them to read this book.  It's a great introduction to Science Fiction and  Heinlein's works.	2000-07-21

I have to say that this book is the most impressive that he's  written.  It covers the lifetime of a man who sees war, poverty, great  riches, violence, sex, and most importantly, his whole world change.  I  don't think I ever learned half as much in school about the people who were  here before Columbus &quot;discovered&quot; America as I did when reading  this book.  Yes, it is a fiction book, and no, it doesn't bore you down  with tons of historical details.  The narrator draws you in so you feel  like you understand his world and are living in his century.  This book  does depict a lot of Aztec violence, some of which is very disturbing and  not for the faint-hearted, but it also depicts the violence of the  colonizers from Spain who destroyed much of the beautiful cultural aspects  (as well as the horrific ones).  This book is haunting from Chapter One  until the end.  The sequel on the other hand, is nowhere near as  fascinating.	2000-07-21

I was so excited to get my copy of Goblet of Fire on Saturday (thanks Amazon).  I was not disappointed with this book at all.  In the style of the previous books in the series, it was engaging and entertaining and a  real page-turner.  I read the whole 700+ page book in a weekend because I  was enjoying it so much.  Many of the beloved characters from previous  books are back, and the new characters added are very entertaining,  particularly the new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher.

The Fifth Business is a clever biography of a man who lives in the shadow of the supposed main plot  (&quot;Who Killed Boy Staunton&quot;).  I think Davies at his best is when  he is writing a biography like this one.  The Manticore is very  interesting, an abrupt departure into the world of Jungian analysis.  Its  narrator shows the previous narrator in a different light.  World of  Wonders lives up to its name, a richly textured tale with mystery and  twists at every turn.  In reading all three together, each narrative  illuminates the other two.  What I liked the most about these novels is  that they are written in a very literary way, but full of humor and jest.  The characters are sometimes likeable, sometimes challenging, but  at the  end you feel like you have progressed an intellectual and/or spiritual  distance and really learned something.  I would recommend this to anyone  who wants to sit down and read something very well-written and fascinating.	2000-06-26

I haven't read the other two yet, but I have to say that this book is excellent and one of the most entertaining books I have read this  year.  This book chronicles the odd adventures of Francis Cornish in a  sweeping story which moves from Canada to Europe.  Francis Cornish is just  enough unlucky that you sympathize with his trials and tribulations, but  his fantastic artistic skills and his many riches make him someone the  reader might envy and not understand.  Davies is an expert at telling this  sort of life story, and I think this one is even more enjoyable than Fifth  Business.  He has a sense of what it is like to have characters at the  hands of fate; in this novel, the daimons quite literally command and shape  Francis's destiny.  Reading this book definitely wanted to make me read the  rest of the trilogy.	2000-06-26

It's tone and  plot were a bit of a departure from the usual, which might be related to  the &quot;exotic&quot; setting and, as another reviewer said, it's not  really that much of a mystery.  I felt like the book was loaded down with a  lot of action that made it less interesting to me, because it was hard to  figure out what the story was going towards, and hard to figure out what  exactly was going on.  One of the things I did find interesting was the  beginnings of the romance between Holmes &amp; Russell.  I would say this  book was well-written and evocative, but if you are looking for a  page-turning mystery, this is not the book for you.	2000-06-23

Neither being in my sixties or male, I still found Duane's struggles interesting to read.  This book is about a man who  wakes up one day and decides to walk away from his life, literally, and  push forward in a new direction.  I think anyone of any age can relate to  that kind of story, where the character is questioning his existence and  wondering what it's all about.  I would say in some ways this is a  philosophical book, but it's also very entertaining and easy to read.  I  was glued to turning the pages, wanting to find out what would happen next.  A great read.	2000-05-05

Reading  this book encouraged me to stop eating meat, dairy, and sugar, and make  changes in my food intake.

The style of this book is the opposite, a lot of jerking back and forth between subplots that sort of come together in the end.  I took  this book on a trip and was going to give it to my mom when I was done  reading it, but I wasn't sure if she'd like it or even if I liked it.  I  also couldn't really say what it was about, but it suggests things like  racism, police brutality, high school violence, without ever coming to a  real point.  I like the characters Hammer, West, and Brazil, but I felt  like any development of them was confusing and conflicted a bit with my  impressions of them from Hornet's Nest.  I think  PC's strong points as a  writer are her ability to make you want to turn the page and finish the  book in one sitting, but this book made me want to put it down and walk out  of the room.	1999-12-15
