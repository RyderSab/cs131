Written in clear concise language, the author shares her extensive knowledge of horse pedigrees with the reader.  She explains the influence of the pedigree  (especially the sire,  the dam, and the dam's sire) on racing performance, including stamina, speed, and the secret of the \\"hidden turf\\" factor. <br /> <br />Whether you bet frequently, or only occasionally on popular races such as the Kentucky Derby and Breeders Cup, this book is a valuable resource and MUST READ for every horseplayer and aspiring horseplayer.

All Kinds of Heroes is a thought provoking and gripping page turner, with heartwarming undertones throughout the 300 plus pages.  Get the Kleenex ready, because  this is definitely a 5 Star and 5 hanky book.  Since the story occurs around the holidays, this would be an ideal stocking stuffer for X-mas!  Or, a great gift for any occasion. <br /> <br />The terroristic premise hits a little too close to home for my comfort level, since Carol Kern's writing is realistic enough to grip us in its confines.  We become enmeshed in the story, unable to put down the read, with no relief in sight until completion.  Although a work of fiction, the places are real, and the characters continue to develop into  very real people, as we follow their plight.  While reading certain passages, my  heart begin to pound with anticipation and fear, and I literally forgot I was sitting in the safety of my own home.  To me, that is one of the essential ingredients of a truly outstanding novel.  It transports us out of our mundane existance, into another world.  And, Ms. Kern certainly accomplished that task with this terrific book!  <br /> <br />The bonus, \\"Buddy Book - Home at Last\\" is quite enjoyable,lending a heartwarming touch to this futuristic highly probable story.  I really loved the Buddy Book.  Tragedy mixes with joy, and the final result is more uplifting than terrifying.  I am hoping there will be more books created by Carol Kern's talented imagination.  She can count on me as one of her many ardent admirers. <br />Arlene Millman <br />author of \\"Boomerang - A Miracle Trilogy\\" (The tale of a remarkable Boston Terrier)	2004-11-05
