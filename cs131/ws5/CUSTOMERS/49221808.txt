I picked up this one to see what it had to say. To my surprise the book is loaded with all kinds of affirmations to get you through all walks of life. It explains why they work,and why it takes 21 days to sink in the sub-concious. Well I never tried  affirmations before so I gave it a shot on this one. Well I must say I started two and I am at about the 21 day mark and they seem to be working. So if you stay positive focused and motivated this should work. If you go into it with an attitude that this is garbage but I will try it you probally wont get anywhere. I am happy to say I have seen some changes in my life from the affirmations. Thanks Ruth.	2004-04-06

The first half of this book is the authors struggles held in a Nazi prison camp during the second world war. No matter how many times we here these stories they still hit you hard. But to survive the atrocities commited in these situations takes a mental attitude of the most extreme strength.<br />The second half of this book is a term called logotherapy. The Doctor decribes this as how are thought patterns can make us or break us in intense situations. How some prisoners lost all hope and eventually died or got sick. And how some just continued to hope and made it. It tries to describe the meaning of life that man is always asking himself. The doctor actually says that the meaning of life is the meaning that you give it in any certain situations. I like that philosophy. Other than that the basic concept I got from it is you think your way to happiness or gloom.	2004-02-03

What I mean by that is there is a lot of refrences to how athletes can slow down time. As in slow down a hundred mile and hour fastball,or how time stands still when you come into that final lap neck in neck with another competitor. So perfect timing is now referred to &quot;get into the zone&quot; in modern day sports.<br />There are some good tips also on astral projection. Healing at a distance. Meditate. And what I mean about good tips is,there is no beating around the bush. It gives you practical methods and tells you dont get frustrated with practice it will come. Practical meaning easy to follow.

Then the murder.Now like anybody else you can usually figure out who dunnit before the end but with dead famous I kept saying to myself \\"I know who did it\\" but I had five suspects in my head. So Elton keeps you on your toes.<BR> The dramatic climax straight out of a classic who dunnit movie or book was when the detective had everyone together (including the millions of people on the telly)and gave the motives and alibi's of all the suspects to the conclusion of the fingering of the murderer.

Dyson has put together a collection of short stories on the verge of brilliance and maybe trying to be a bit to clever.The book kicks off in good form with \\"we who walk thru walls\\" with left you thinking wow I did not expect that,but with \\"love in the time of Molyneux\\" I had to re-read it cause I just missed the point. The darker side of the collection with \\"City Deep\\" which will give you a paranoid feeling everytime you ride the underground rail. An A-level art professor gets an underachieving new art student with very little talent but when the boy paints a picture of the story title \\"a slate roof in the rain\\" little does the Professor know how much he'll get to know the drawing. My favorite story was \\"the engine of desire\\" which happens to be the longest story of a mercenary hired by a prince who has a collection of oddities,to find a mechanical woman with the ability to satisfy sexually. This story was sheer genius.<br />On a lighter note \\"the cash oracle\\" was pretty funny.The story of a timid feeble man who is afraid to ask a beautiful woman out on a date,resorts to his ATM machine when he discovers that along with cash it also dispenses advice. This story made me laugh thinking of the people behind him cueing up to make a with draw and this nervous sweaty individual hogging the machine just to have the machine tell him what would happen tonight. Pretty funny stuff.<br />So all in all not a bad collection a couple fillers \\"the maze\\" and the last story in the novel are not worthy of a mention cause they were just dull. I would like to read a full novel from Dyson,for it seemed the longer the story the better. A good collection,I recomend it.	2003-05-09

His recipes are precise, being which he tells you how many carrots, how many apples, and tells the reader what the possible prevention tips of the particular juice are. My favorite is the juice for the sinus. And it does help.Also the energy and feeling you get from juicing is amazing. A pot of coffee could not get you going this good.<BR>Now dont get me wrong there are good books on juicing out there but as stated above they want you to add other health ingredients (herbs and spices,soy milk etc...).Thats not the reason I wanted to juice.I wanted the benefits of juice and juice alone not something I can buy as a pill from the GNC and skip all the juicing.

I was so looking forward to this book. It actually turned out to be a big let down. It gave great details of the Greyfriar cemetary and the atrocities that led to the suppose hauntings. Which is why I gave three stars. But I must say the accounts of the victims were just not convincing. All we got here are stories of how people fainted or felt themselves being grabbed or pushed. No sightings or apparitions,just some loud poundings on walls. Also the persons being grabbed had red marks were  the poltergeist touched them,but when they were filming the documentary on greyfriars, the tour guides tried to call the camera man over to film such markings,the markings mysteriously disappeared. One more thing the title of the book had nothing to do with Greyfriars &quot;The ghost that haunted itself&quot; was about a fairy tale ghost from Canada and they even put that in the book.<br />Now dont get me wrong it is interesting stuff just very inconclusive-like everything in the spiritual world.

If he does not get custody a bomb will go off every hour for tne next seven hours with a major blast in the final hour.

Doyle is a ruthless S.O.B.! He tell's it like it is and takes his mission orders to heart. I recomend Hutson to followers of Lee Child, Mack Bolan.

Seeking means:to have a goal; but finding means:to be free,to be receptive,to have no goal.&quot;<br /> That quote sums up for myself what we all strive for. Nirvana.	2003-01-29

Hung by the tongue deplicts the rise and fall of a person just by the words they speak. By taking quotes from the bible and putting them into perspective,Martin shows that success and defeat is born in the mind. We as humans tend to speak what we believe. Martin shows that what we speak can bring on failure or victory. Very inspirational read.	2003-01-21

Then he moved up east and became a super legend. Reading this book was like replaying the whole scene on a television set in my mind. The interview with Frankie Williams, rock n wrestling,the coconut,the steroid scandel and on and on! I could not put the book down. I even took a little extra time to read this slower than usual,taking every bit of it and letting it soak in. I loved the old W.W.F. days and all my favorite wrestlers are all talked about in this book.<BR>  Also it was cool to read about the dropout piper making a living of wrestling and how the old school wrestlers took him under there wings. Great Job Roddy!	2003-01-04

Was Paul gonna let his true feelings about his replacement the great Bruce Dickinson spew forth? Well the answers to these questions were no and yes. If your looking for dirt on Steve Harris and the boys your not gonna find it here. And Paul's thoughts on Bruce? He is an excellent singer.<BR>  What you will find in this book is a story of a troubled man. It makes ya laugh and it pisses you off and even a little sympathy for the guy. But I am sure Paul would be the first to tell you he don't need your sympathy. This is Pauls way of excercising demons. <BR>  Fighting,boozing,drugs,women,smacking wives(Paul had 5 wives in his time)kicking band members in the face,diffrent musical projects,blowing all your doe,it goes on and on and on. It made for a very good read. <BR>  I was surprised to see Paul was so violent. I actually thought he was just making good fictional stories until the end were we get confirmation from friends,bandmates,and managers. These little quips are hilarious in them self.<BR>  So if your looking for dirt on Maiden. Forget it! There is none. Iron Maiden are a band that is always about the music.That is a major factor in there success. Paul didnt go into to much detail about his ousting/quitting of the band. For the bottom line was look we/I dont like want your doing and it's time to move on. That is both sides thinking,Paul and Maiden. But life after Maiden was some good reading. Good job Paul.	2002-08-15

But the tv show did get many of its episodes from this book. From arterial transplants to make shift clamps these Doctors opened many new doors to the medical world. Chapter 6 \\"In the O.R.\\" is pretty gruesome. Details of intestinal wounds abdominal wounds and pretty much everything a war could destroy on a body. <br /> But its not all blood and guts. D.R. Apel talks of the korean's who helped around the camp. The use of the white rocks in the compund. Plus his first day at the MASH was spent on his feet for 72 hrs. operating. Amazing.<br /> I would have ggave the book a five star rating but there was a section on a paper the D.R. wrote on arteral repair which IMO took away from the book. It might have worked better at the end of the book.<br /> Nice pictures of procedures and Korea. This book is a must for people who like the TV show and would really like to see what went on in a real MASH outfit during the real Korean war.	2002-06-09
