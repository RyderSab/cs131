A good selection of both natural and human-caused dangers are considered here, though not in a great deal of depth.  <br /> <br />There is a focus on space related dangers (and other space topics like interplanetary colonisation as a safeguard against disaster on Earth), which is not at all surprising given the author, and while I would have preferred to have had more coverage on other topics, it was probably a good decision by Rees to focus on those areas he knows best. <br /> <br />One particularly thought-provoking topic is the idea that technology is rapidly reaching a point where individuals (or very small groups) can cause catastrophic global damage, a very new phenomenon. While we generally find the idea of a society with no privacy distasteful, monitoring every individual may become necessary as the only real way to combat this danger. We all may have to seriously start considering how much privacy and freedom we wish to retain, versus how much danger we are willing to accept for the human race.	2004-11-18

Social opinion can often be like science without peer review, and a critical (perhaps even cynical) mind is often the only real defense. <br /> <br />Some parts of this book flow quite nicely, where the author has a clear point to make and sticks with it, but other parts feel a bit more rambling, and seem to lack focus. Also, sometimes it feels as though the author's opinions are being presented as facts, without really being backed up. This should not be taken as too heavy a criticism, as the book still contains lots of great food for thought, and I think most critical thinkers would find a lot of valuable content here, but the negatives are enough that I wouldn't put this one on my 'must-read' list.	2004-11-14

However, while all of these cases show failure, I don't think that they all show mistakes. By 'mistake', I mean that the company made a foolish decision that they could reasonably be expected to have made differently at the time. <br /> <br />A lot of these failures we can see in hindsight were because of certain decisions, but it many cases, based on the information provided in the book, it doesn't seem that the decision was wrong given the knowledge and information at hand at the time.  <br /> <br />In the end, this book is definitely a fun read for the most part, but most of the time the 'lessons learned' presented at the end of each case seem to be contradicted by some other company somewhere that made the same sorts of decisions and succeeded. Because of this, the only real lesson this book can teach is that there are no absolute rules to successful branding, and while there are certain guidelines that can usually be followed, there are always exceptions to the rules, and quite often the biggest successes have been the companies that defied conventional wisdom. <br /> <br />On a different note, I'm not sure how reliable the information in this book is, since two of the examples provided, the Chevy Nova, and Gerber's baby food in Africa, are regularly repeated examples, however they did not fail for the reasons presented in the book (which are the same reasons usually given by people who tell these stories). These may be exceptions, but they do make me question just how much research was put into the cases presented in the book.	2004-11-14

Despite its relatively short length, a very large range of topics are covered, and while none of them are covered in the sort of depth that a scholar of the language would desire, the coverage is just the right amount so that no chapter becomes tedious. <br />There may be some minor errors here, or some possibly inaccurate generalizations, but on the whole, I think that Bryson has done his research, and since he lists sources, the reader is free to verify anything they disagree with.<br />Some reviewers have called this a funny book. While it is highly enjoyable, and amusing in places, it is not the sort of book that will have you laughing out loud. I think this is a good thing, since it indicates that Bryson is not trying to score cheap laughs at the expense of the language (he does in fact do this on the odd occasion, but when he does, it's well deserved).<br />This book has taught me more about the English language than all of my years of schooling, and I think that this book should be read by everyone, but students in particular will probably save themselves a lot of grief by reading this. I would be curious to see what people who speak English as a second language think of this book, since I believe it would be quite helpful to them.	2000-11-21

The Kendalls have definitely created a comprehensive book on systems analysis. Virtually every aspect is covered here, and in plenty of detail. There are plenty of review questions and problems, hypothetical consulting situations, an ongoing case-study, and even an associated web-based case study.<br />While being well written, I feel that this text may be a bit overdone. Most sections are longer than neccessary, over-explaining fairly obvious concepts. So although the reader can never complain about being short-changed, I would be amazed if any reader needed ALL of the explanations to understand what was being discussed. <br />I have also noticed a few cases of dated information creeping through from previous editions. One example is a discussion on groupware that talks about features of Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT, and mentions the 'upcoming' Chicago release. Chicago was the working name for Windows 95, which was hardly 'upcoming' for a text published in 1999.<br />It feels as if the Kendalls have been adding new information to their revised editions, but not revising thoroughly enough to remove old or out of date references. If a really good job of revision was done here, I think this text could be reduced by at least a hundred pages or so without any real loss of useful content.<br />Since it emphasises practice more than theory, it may not appeal to all types, but for anyone who needs to know HOW to be a systems analyst, this is probably the book to read.	2000-11-08

However, Lewontin's depth of coverage makes these essays more centered around the book topics than the books themselves. The fact that some of these reviews are 10 to 20 years old doesn't pose much of problem either, since they are usually still relevant and informative, and he provides updates discussing advances since they were written.<br />Lewontin has taken several topics of biology that are very much in the public eye lately, and tries to dispell misconceptions, usually to good effect. He clearly has opinions worth airing, and to have so many different topics covered here is a great bonus. It's also nice to see that he's not afraid to print criticisms of his reviews.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in controversial topics like cloning or the usefulness of the Human Genome Project, but those with a little scientific background will probably get the most out of this.	2000-11-06
US	48992384	R31EMD59WKUL20	0806906189	834247464	Lateral Logic Puzzles	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Mostly good	Not just a book of lateral thinking puzzles, some of these are more logical, which adds freshness and variety, since the 'find a rational explanation for a seemingly impossible situation' type-puzzles can get a bit repetitive after a while.<br />There are some very clever puzzles in here, which frustrated me until I read the answer. There are also some fairly easy ones here too, mixed in with the others. Unfortunately, there are also quite a few bad puzzles. By bad, I mean that either there is more then one solution that works (a good lateral thinking puzzle should have one obviously best answer), or the answers are so convoluted that no one but the author could ever possibly guess them. These answers required the addition of a lot of new information, neither stated nor hinted at in the puzzle. <br />Like Sloane's lateral thinking puzzle books, this is a good book for reading in groups, with one person knowing the answer, and leading the others along.	2000-11-06

However, some of the puzzles have not an ingenious answer, but an implausible one. It works, but it makes no sense. The best way to back this up is to demonstrate. This is on of the easy puzzles taken from the very start of the book, so giving the answer away is no big deal (but stop reading if you don't want to know it):<br />One night during the Second World War, an allied bomber was on a mission over Germany. The plane was in perfect condition and everything on it worked properly. When it had reached its target, the pilot ordered the bomb doors opened. They opened. He then ordered the bombs released. They were released. But the bombs did not fall from the plane. Why should this be so?<br />Some clues are given, and the eventual answer is that the plane was flying upside-down. Now, lateral thinking it might be, but it makes no sense that a plane flying a mission during a war would order its bombs to be released over a target while it was flying upside down. A good puzzle encourages thinking, but anyone who seriously tries to answer that puzzle would discard the given answer as making no sense.<br />There are still some very clever puzzles to be found here, and the book is worth buying if you want a collection of lateral thinking puzzles, but beware that sometimes Sloane crosses the fine line between ingenious and implausible.	2000-10-31

The first section covers the absolute basics of what OOD is. The middle portion teaches the reader how to use UML to depict their designs. The final section is a set of instructive essays, warning the reader of the problems and pitfalls that often occur in OOD, and how to avoid them.<br />Page-Jones has an excellent sense of humour, and his engaging style makes this an incredibly enjoyable book to read. You won't even notice that you're actually learning something! I also like the fact that he doesn't use a single programming language for his examples, instead trying to be generic, or alternatively, giving examples from C++, Java, Eiffel, and Smalltalk in turn. This makes the book accessible for all OO designers.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book to an experienced OO designer who wishes to learn UML. That's not the intended audience. For a new comer, who wishes to learn good design techniques from the start, this is the book for you.	2000-10-29

Although this book covers a great deal of topics regarding operating system designing, it is largely a book about the Unix OS, and its derivatives, particularly Minix. This is not at all bad, since it does cover a lot of general topics, but for a person interested in MS-DOS/Windows (or any other non-Unix OS for that matter), it can get boring.<br />The most important point to make about this book is: If you don't plan on messing around with the Minix source, you are probably wasting your money. This book may be 900+ pages, but the back 400 pages are a (reduced) listing of the Minix source code, and a lot of the main text is special sections that walk through this source code, describing how it works. This means that, in the end, you have about 250 pages of actual operating system text. <br />This is definitely a well written book, and the coverage of the trade-offs that an OS designer must make are very insightful, but if you don't plan on hacking Minix, you should probably look elsewhere.	2000-10-15

How can you pack an entire introductory course in linear algebra into under 200 pages AND make it enjoyable to read? Janich knows how. There is virtually zero fluff here. This is both good and bad, however. Janich teaches you what you need to know, and doesn't waste time explaining the same thing 10 different ways. The down side is that if you don't get a concept straight away, you'll feel lost. <br />There is a distinct lack of examples and exercises, and the exercises that are given have no solutions provided. This means that it is very hard to rectify any misunderstandings you may pick up.<br />This book makes for an excellent companion text, and serves admirably for review purposes. But if you need to learn how to apply the abstract concepts, you will want a second text that contains plenty of examples and exercises. As a lecturer once told me: Mathematics is not a spectator sport. You have to do it, not just read about it.	2000-10-10

An enjoyable writing style combined with a wealth of interesting facts makes this a book that few would dislike. Every story that glorifies engineers is matched by one showing their shortcomings or failures, providing a book that seems to have a well balanced perspective on the impact of technology on science, not the biased view one might anticipate in a book by an engineer about engineering.<br />The huge volume of assorted facts borders on random trivia, but it is always organised in a logical fashion, and enthusiastically written, so the end result is hardly tedious, but rather a very compelling read.<br />I would love to have access to his radio program if it is anywhere near as good as this book.	2000-10-10

I disliked the movie (which I saw first), but having read and enjoyed much of Sagan's non-fiction, I figured that it was the usual case of a good book being badly translated into movie form. There are definitely a lot of differences, and the book is far superior to the movie, but the same thing that I really hated in the movie is present in the book also.<br />I can't be really specific with what I disliked about the story without giving everything away, especially since it is at the end of the novel. The problem is basically the reams of implausibility, with regards to both logic and science, that take place in the last 50 pages or so. Things just simply couldn't have worked out the way they did. There was too much evidence. I can't understand why Sagan would ruin an otherwise excellent novel with such a badly thought out ending, especially given the quality of all his other work.<br />This is a mostly excellent novel, well written, and with some very thought-prevoking discussions in it, but the ending is simply unforgiveable.	2000-10-02

Very rarely, I come across a book so enjoyable that I have to put everything else on hold until I finish reading it. This is one of those books. It combines fanscinating information, intriguing analysis, and a thoroughly enjoyable writing style.<br />The book is divided into two major sections: an extended prologue, and the book proper. The prologue is nearly half of the book, and it describes twelve definitive moments in medicine in the past 50 years. This section is informative and enjoyable, and the book is worth reading for this part alone.<br />The second section is even better. Le Fanu believes that medicine experienced its Golden Age during the fifties and sixties, and is now in decline. He provides compelling evidence in support of this claim, and his discussions on the false hopes brought about by genetics, and the falsity of the Social Theory (the theory that most of our health problems are caused by environmental factors) are great, and probably largely correct.<br />This is a book that I would recommend to anyone. It is easy enough for the layman to understand, and I think that those in the medical profession will get a lot out of it, whether they agree with the author or not. READ THIS BOOK!!!	2000-09-28

Ruse claims to write for both the professional and the general reader, but if you aren't a professional philosopher, this book is NOT for you. Trust me.<br />The idea is great, and I would like to see more books like this. The execution, however, leaves much to be desired. Ruse seems to get constantly sidetracked on what, to me, seem to be obscure philosophical discussions. Maybe they are actually quite pertinent to his argument, but if so, I didn't see it, and he didn't explain it. That's the problem. There is no explanation as to why he is following certain reasoning paths. The professional philosopher will probably pick it up, but the general reader is left lost and bored.<br />There are some interesting ideas here, and Ruse does come to some useful conclusions, but there is not nearly enough in here to justify the read. He spends too much time trying to reconcile his philosophical view with the views of past philosophers like Kant and Hume. This seems to have very little to do with what the book was actually supposed to be about, and once again is of interest to the professional philosopher only. I honestly feel that this book could have been reduced to a quarter of its size without losing any original content. And at under 300 pages, that amounts to not much worth reading.	2000-09-26

I was initially sceptical that a book on software engineering written twenty-five years ago could still be relevant today. It is.<br />This short, concise book contains a handful of highly insightful essays, each focusing on one main topic, usually  a problem area in software engineering, and possible ways to solve it. Brooks doesn't waste pages of space in excess verbosity. He just says what he thinks, and why he thinks it. It's a very underrated writing technique.<br />The new chapters in the anniversary edition serve to acknowledge changes that have occurred since the original edition, and while there have been some, on the whole, most of the original text still stands. If you are in the field, or want to get into it, read this book. Simple.	2000-09-25

As one of the most fascinating characters in twentieth-century physics (not to mention one of the most brilliant), it is always enjoyable to read anything by, or about, Richard Feynman. This book, a collection of some of his best works (interviews, lectures, essays), is an obvious must for any Feynman fan.<br />While some of these works will probably be familiar to most readers, the majority will probably be new. The topic range is very broad, and while some works will appeal more to some than others (for instance, technical pieces versus anecdotal ones), they are all enjoyable, and I could not say which was my favourite, or, for that matter, list any that I didn't enjoy.<br />Scientists like Feynman help to capture the public's attention, and hopefully, encourage more interest in science. It would be good for high-school students to be exposed to books such as this one, not overly technical, but exciting enough to transmit that love of learning that Feynman embodies, and seems to be so lacking in the youth of today.	2000-09-24

Clement has obviously thought this part of the book out well, and although the plot line is fairly simple, and the character development minimal, if you like hard sci-fi, you will like this book.<br />The flight sequences tend to get a bit repetitive, and in such a short book, they shouldn't have taken up such a large portion of it. Also, I have trouble accepting the premise of all of these terminally ill people being sent of a space mission. Since two of them are healthy, surely a full complement of healthy people could have been assembled. We are not given any reason why this particular group was chosen for the mission. Besides these two faults, the book is great reading.	2000-09-21

Having read quite a few of Gribbin's books, I tend to find that they rehash the same information quite often. Given the number of books he has written, this is not surprising, but it's still annoying. This book came as a pleasant surprise, since there was quite a lot of new content.<br />As a collection of essays written over the past 20 years, some are not surprisingly out of date, but not badly so. Gribbin has gone to the trouble to arrange the essays in a related fashion, and so the book reads almost as a continuous volume, with each essay flowing nicely to the next.<br />I was starting to feel as though Gribbin had nothing new left to tell me, but he obviously has plenty of good insights and interesting information still up his sleeve. Definitely one of his better books.	2000-09-21

Most people either misunderstand what math is all about, or see it as a collection of rather disjointed areas collected together under a single  name. Devlin does an admirable job of re-educating us all, and showing how  the different areas of mathematics are linked together, often in rather  surprising ways.<br />This book is simply brilliant. The amount of information  Devlin has managed to cram between two covers is amazing. Having spent  years studying this stuff, it's rather depressing to see that most of the  important things I've learned can fit into a 350 page book, but then this  is surely a testament to Devlin's skill.<br />Although this book makes no  formal educational expectations of the reader, I feel that a true beginner  would have trouble following a lot of parts, although they would still get  the general idea. This would be better then nothing, but I think that this  book would be best appreciated by those with some formal math background. I  would be curious to see what a high school student would make of this,  since I really wish I'd had this book back then.

This is another one of Clancy's epic novels which, as usual, means that if  you can get past the three or four hundred pages of not terribly exciting  build-up, you can hardly put it down for the remainder.<br />While this book  is excellent in places, it suffers from some problems. So much so, in fact,  that I'm not sure whether to give a 3 or a 4 star rating. The biggest  problem is that it's all been done by him before. This book is virtually a  collection of all of the best bits from his other books, all thrown  together into a giant, multi-faceted story. On one hand, this is good,  because there are lots of good bits. On the other hand, it's nothing  new.<br />Another problem is simply that Jack Ryan cannot be developed any  further. We've seen him go from a government lackey to president, and  that's really as far as you can go. I thought Clancy was going to end the  Jack Ryan focus with Executive Orders, and from Rainbow Six on, stick with  John Clark and Ding Chavez. I guess not.<br />One major plot gripe (not  wanting to spoil here, but it happens near the start anyway) is the ease  with which Chet Nomuri obtains his agent. I mean, we are told constantly in  the book how no other countries have agents in China because they're so  hard to get there, yet Nomuri turns his first attempted target after two  dates. He must have been an ABSOLUTE demon in the sack, methinks!<br />Is this  the end of the line for Ryan? I don't think so. There are several  indicators in the book of another one to follow, and I predict that the  next one will be based around a civil uprising in the USA itself. Of  course, given that there's no-one else left to fight, this is not that  tough a prediction to make!	2000-09-17

There is little more fascinating then reading the thoughts of great minds.  Dyson has seen and done much in his lifetime, and the chance to receive  some of his wisdom should not be passed up. <br />This is a collection of  ideas and thoughts (taken from a set of lectures), that cover a lot of  ground, but are loosely based around the impact of science on society, how  it can be abused when misused, but more importantly, some of the  opportunities it offers us for the future if we use it well.<br />My only  criticism on this book is its shortness. At just over two hundred rather  spaced out pages, there is sadly a shortage of content, which is a great  shame since Dyson clearly has a lot of ideas worth sharing. But I suppose  that these are the ideas he wants to share the most, and by keeping it  brief, he allows us to focus on them better, without being sidetracked by  less important information.<br />While readable by just about anyone, those  with some basic familiarity with science will get more out of it, while   scientists will probably appreciate it even more. This book is more about  the application of science then science itself, so understanding the  science in it allows the reader to concentrate on what Dyson really wants  to say.	2000-08-30

Another case of two groups  kiling each other for no good reason. Reading this book shows me just how  wrong I was, and how misleading the media of the time was.<br />What we are  shown here is a clear case of genocide, and some of the things that were  done by one human being to another are so staggeringly awful, it makes you  sit back and readjust your opinion on what we humans are capable of.<br />The  standout feature of this book is the way that Gourevitch doesn't just  present tragedy like we are onlookers at a motor accident. He is trying to  discover how normal people can do things like this. Because, after all,  this wasn't an act by a small group of insane people. This was thousands of  ordinary people butchering their neighbours. It was not a moment of  insanity, but a slow and deliberate plan. What can drive so many people to  do such things, for days on end? By providing a wealth of background,  Gourevitch helps us to understand, not fully, but at least better than when  we started, how this tragedy occurred. <br />This is an important book, which  deserves to be widely read, because it shows just how much we have left to  learn if we ever wish to become a peaceful society. Some people like to say  that we humans were barbaric in the past, but we are becoming much more  civilised now. Events like this show just how wrong that point of view is.	2000-08-29

The  first half is too drawn out, and the second half, when it starts to get  interesting, is too short. Also, a large part of the plotline feels  incredibly similar to the Stephen King story The Langoliers (from Four Past  Midnight). Unfortunately, as far as that bit is concerned, King did it  better.<br />The ending is quite clever, but it feels incredibly rushed,  especially given the slow, rather laid back first half. It's almost as if  Haldeman intended a much longer book, but quickly finished it off for some  reason.<br />Ultimately, what really let this book down is that it doesn't  have much to do with the Forever War. Really. The storyline is quite  unrelated, and this book could have been written with totally different  characters and still worked fine. I get the impression that Haldeman had a  cool story idea, and due to requests for a FW sequel, decided to write the  story in the FW universe. <br />If you are a Forever War fan, read Forever  Peace. If you are a Forever War and Joe Haldeman fan, then you might want  to consider Forever Free. Then read Forever Peace.	2000-08-28

Without a doubt my favourite SF novel, Haldeman takes Starship Troopers,  gives it a better storyline, and throws in a heap of well thought out  physics, to create a novel that is virtually impossible to put  down.<br />There are plenty of other reviews here that detail the storyline,  so I won't do more of the same. Haldeman has a gift for providing just  enough description so that the reader can fill in the rest of the details  themselves, and this allows for a great deal of plot in a relatively short  book. Add in his Vietnam War experiences, and obvious science background,  and it's pretty hard to go wrong. Some of his other books may be a bit  below par, but Forever War totally deserves the 'masterpiece' tag it is  often given. If only they would make a movie...	2000-08-27

Having been born 10 years after the time setting of this novel, I can't  comment as to whether or not it accurately portrays the general mind-set of  that year. However, I do think that this is the sort of novel that people  of my generation should read, since we are too young to have experienced  the horror of a real war, besides in the often-glorifying portrayals of the  movies. Above all else, I feel that Haldeman managed to communicate vividly  how war changes the lives of everyone involved, and how in the end, there  are no winners. I hope my generation won't have to learn that lesson the  hard way.	2000-08-23

Could the entire universe be described with just six numbers? To an  extent, that is what this book proposes. Another addition to the marvellous  Science Masters series, this book looks at six important numbers that  describe various aspects of our universe, and how the present state of the  universe is largely describable by just these numbers.<br />Rees actually goes  further, by showing us also that these six numbers MUST not vary by much if  a universe where intelligent beings can emerge is desired. He describes,  for each number, what the universe would look like if that value was more  or less than the observed one, and the consequences for intelligent life.  Given that these six numbers require values within such a small range, does  this mean that there must be a creator to explain how such precise values  can come about? Not really. Some people prefer the Anthropic Cosmological  Theory, which simply states that if these values were any different, we  wouldn't be around to ask the question, so the values simply have to be  what they are. Rees puts forward a different spin on this idea, which is  his preffered explanation: There are several ways in which the universe may  in fact be a `multiverse', an infinite number of disjoint universes, each  with different starting configurations, and thus different values for the  six numbers. This means that we do not need to find a special explanation  for the values we see in this universe, since all possible values will  occur in some universe.<br />This is an all-round excellent book, covering a  great deal of information in a very accessible manner. It is also a great  way to get up to date with the latest findings and ideas in astronomy. It  is possibly a bit difficult for the newcomer, but for anyone who's read a  pop science book or two, it should be smooth sailing the whole way.	2000-08-23

This version of the Canterbury Tales (Everyman) contains all of the tales  (including the rather tedious prose tales), and is in the original  language. As anyone planning to read the Tales will be aware, old English  is not easy! This book takes a lot of time to read. Is it worth it?<br />Yes.  But a qualified yes. As an insight into life during this time in history,  and particularly as a demonstration of how little humans have changed over  the centuries, this book is very useful. Many of the tales are quite  amusing and interesting. On the other hand, many tales are filled with  rather drawn out, tedious sections, and a couple are just plain boring.  <br />For a person who wishes to read most of the major English classics, this  book must be read, and I think the only way to really appreciate it is in  its original form, not in modernised English. For this purpose, the  Everyman version is excellent, as it features convenient gloss on each  page, so looking up difficult words can be done at a glance, which disturbs  the flow a lot less. I would highly recommend trying to read the book in as  short a space of time as possible, though, because you do get used to the  grammar and vocabulary, and while it is fresh in your mind, it allows you  to read the rest of the book with a lot less glossing.<br />Be aware that I  read this book for personal interest, not as part of any particular course,  so I am reviewing from the point of view of a general reader, not a  literary scholar.	2000-08-22

Books	4	8	11	N	N	Rendezvous with Arthur	Any fan of Clarke doesn't need to read this, or any other review of this book; they will already own it. However, I think that anyone with an  interest in the progression of scientific thought over the last 50-60 years  would find much of interest here. It is fascinating to read what Clarke  thought about particular issues over this period, particularly the way his  predictions on astronautics changed over the years. This kind of  information can only be learned by reading literature of the time, and this  book is a great way of doing so without spending time on large numbers of  now hopelessly out of date books.<br />Although this book covers a lot of  non-science material (particularly the essays on skin-diving), I found them  a refreshing change, and quite enjoyable. Coming from Australia, where we  are taught to be wary of sharks, I was amazed by some of the things Clarke  did around them.<br />The only real criticisms I have with this book are the  redundancies of information in various places (the virtual doubling of an  essay is a shocking display of editing), and a few essays seem to have been  truncated, which was a shame. In particular, the essay on fractals just  kind of stops, at a really interesting point too. Admittedly, it was  nothing that he hadn't already covered in Ghost From The Grand Banks, but  it should have been left complete anyway, or at least ended properly.	2000-08-16
US	48992384	R19O1IB1AMBFXI	046502596X	462653247	The Pattern On The Stone: The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work (Science Masters)	Books	5	21	23	N	N	Henceforth, computers shall tremble before me!	In this book, Hillis has managed to cover all of the basics of how  computers operate, from theory like Boolean algebra and finite state  machines, up to applications of the theory like multiprocessors and their  limits. He even manages to find space to discuss Turing's Halting Problem,  and Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.  <br />To fit so much information into  such a small book, Hillis has minimised his explanations, to the point that  I think a true newcomer to these concepts would have difficulty in  following a lot of the details. The text has been designed so that not  understanding parts of it will not greatly affect the understanding of the  rest, however I believe the reader would have much less appreciation for  how all of the ideas mesh together in this case.<br />Hillis has crafted a  beautiful book, one that provides excellent insight into the workings of  computer technology, and a slightly different approach to that taken by  standard textbooks. While I don't think this book would serve as a  substitute to a standard text, it makes an excellent companion book for  anyone who is already partly familiar with the concepts covered.	2000-08-07

There are many important theorems in mathematics, and a great number of  them were discovered in the twentieth century. To whittle these down to the  five most important ones is no easy feat, but this is exactly what Casti  has done. He admits that there is no group of five which are clearly more  important than the others (after all, he has written a sequel, Five More  Golden Rules!), and that this selection is no doubt very subjective, with  any other prominent mathematician likely coming up with a very different  selection. <br />Casti is primarily an applied mathematician, and his choice  in theorems reflects this. Because of his expertise, he has been able to  see the bounty that each theorem has created, as far as new ideas is  concerned. While some of these theorems may seem rather abstract and not  terribly useful, it is all of the follow-up work that these theorems  created and inspired that makes them so special.<br />I found this book  difficult in places to follow, and I'm no beginner in mathematics. This is  probably no fault on the part of Casti, who has done a great job of making  these theorems as accessible as possible to the layman. I believe that it  is the difficult nature of some of the theorems that makes it difficult to  understand. For instance, 40 pages is very little in which to distill the  basics of topology, and explain the relevance of Brouwer's Theorem. And  given that a large portion of the information in `Godel, Escher, Bach' has  been compressed into the 40 pages covering Turing's Halting Problem, it is  no surprise that the going is not easy. However, for a good insight into  some important areas of twentieth century mathematics, this book is hard to  beat.	2000-08-07

What we know about cancer has increased dramatically in the past 20 years,  and the author has played a part in many of the major discoveries that have  occurred. Weinberg goes through the path of discovery in a largely  chronological order, showing the initial theories on the workings of  cancer, and then bringing in the revisions to these theories, revealing  aspects of cell biology at the appropriate times, so that the reader does  not become overwhelmed by excess information at the start of the book, a  fault that seems to be common in many popular science books.<br />Overall, I  feel that this is one of the best books in the Science Masters series, and  a must read for anyone interested in cancer. I feel that it would also make  valuable reading for anyone whose work relates to the health sciences in  any way, since after reading this book, you have a rather thorough  understanding of cancer in a general sense, without all of the technical  details which would only be of interest to a researcher or doctor  specialising in cancer. There is also the possibility that this book would  be of value to a cancer sufferer, since understanding an illness can often  help a person to better cope with it, and this book would really let the  patient understand what was happening in their body, and why, and  understand why various treatments work for some types of cancer, but not  others.	2000-08-07

The Forever War is my favourite SF novel, so to discover that Haldeman had  written a companion novel was no small matter. While Forever Peace is not a  sequel (it's not even set in the same `universe'), it is a companion novel  in the sense that it explores the same issues, with the benefit of the new  technology and ideas that have surfaced in the last twenty years, when  Forever War was first published.<br />Being a big fan of futuristic war type  stories, I liked the way this novel started, and there was a very similar  feel to Forever War. However, Forever Peace goes into much different areas,  and the story line becomes rapidly unlike the original. This is not a bad  thing at all. I didn't want to read the same story again, or roughly the  same ideas. This novel is about a man caught up in war, and how it affects  him, and this is the common thread between the two, but beyond that, they  are more or less totally different.<br />A very clever narrative device in  this novel, which I haven't seen elsewhere, is the constant change between  first and third person perspectives. We see sections of the novel through  the eyes of the main protagonist (a la Forever War), but these are  interspliced with third person narratives, sometimes involving the main  character, but other times not, allowing us to learn of events that the  main character is not witness to. I liked this style of writing a lot, and  I hope to see it done more often.<br />Overall, this was a very enjoyable  book, and I recommend it to any fan of the genre.	2000-08-07
