I did, however, believe that he was providing a comfort to those suffering from grief due to the loss of a close loved-one.   <br /> <br />So, regardless if he was truly communicating with the spirit of one passed-on or whether he was only communicating from within himself, he was still providing a service to those suffering. <br /> <br />This book is inspirational in that John tells how the Rosary has helped him in the loss of his Mother, Aunt, and Granmother and how it centers him in his work.  Now that I have read this book, he has me believing that he is a true blessing. <br /> <br />The book comes with an audio CD which has the rosary spoken by Roma Downey and another version by John Edward.  This is truly wonderful. <br /> <br />If this review has helped you, please vote.	2005-04-19

I have the amount of experience that Hank had at the mid point of his story.  I am gathering from this story that it might be that neither Nainoa or Hank were in control of the experiences. <br /> <br />I truly valued the mystical aspect of the story in which Pele, the Leopardman, and the guardians provide lessons and assistance.  The interactions between the various spirits and Hank or Nainoa is enlightening.  Hawaii is truly a place which inspires the mystical experience. <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed the story.  I am not here to debate the actual reality of this story.  Regardless of the classification of fiction or non-fiction, this book is extremely entertaining and is a very good read.  My only complaint is that the version I read was published in 8 pt font so it was straining to read such tiny print.  If the print of this volume is as depicted in the Amazon preview, then it is a different edition that the edition that I read.  Amazon's version appears to have at least a 10 pt font. <br /> <br />On a personal note, I enjoyed it since I have had random occurrences such as visions of the Leopardman (and of a stern owl), the pulsing when transitioning, the buzzing, the paralysis, some of the geometric visions, etc.  I have never tried to control or expand on these.  This story comforted me in that I know that I do not have an illness or disorder.  It was very enlightening to know that this is a common spiritual occurrence that has been happening throughout the millenia. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book and I must say that it has inspired me to read additional books written by Hank Wesselman.   <br />	2004-08-31

Books	5	34	35	N	Y	This is a handbook to change your life for the better!	- <br />Raymon is an absolute God-send. <br /> <br />My new favorite motivational snippet comes directly from Raymon.  I now tell my students that thoughts are the basis of all that come to them and use Raymon's analogies.  Raymon gives an absolutely great analogy of the creation of blue-jeans to the importance of thoughts.  Raymon, I am quoting you left and right! <br /> <br />For you, I could quote from the book but I won't.  I believe that everyone can benefit from this book and I hope that you buy this immediately. <br /> <br />I am continually dismayed when I read fellow new-agers giving tips on how to create a parking space and the like.  The selfish reality creation of directing your immense power on the creation of a parking spot is just so un-spiritual in my opinion.  That is just me.  But, if parking spot creation is what raises your soul to the Source, then go for it! <br /> <br />I feel that creating one's own reality should have spiritual and uplifting self-improvement and reality creation.  Raymon held a job in which he so empowered public-assistance recipients that the government agency employing him had to release him.  He was making their bureaucracy unneeded through his classes.  That is what I call effective! <br /> <br />I am one of Raymon's newest and most grateful fans!  <br />	2004-08-26

It was an absolute joy to read.  It gives you three different views on each of the 7th pathways proposed.  James Twyman, Gregg Braden, and Doreen Virtue each explain concepts from their knowledgebase to enable the reader to understand. <br /> <br />I received a spiritual boost from this tome.  I especially appreciate the prayers of peace from the twelve major religions and James' condensation of each. <br /> <br />This is truly a tool to guide the planet Earth toward peace.

Nichols explains his awakening to the fact that he was involved in the manipulation of history through time travel.<br />I know... it sounds a bit odd, but once you have read his story (this is a non-fiction book), you start contemplating the ramifications of time travel.<br />So here is one of my questions: If you can go back in time using the times of August 12th 1943, 1963 and 1983, does that mean the the next massive entry to manipulate time is in 2003?<br />If not, then are there folks in a circuitous rut of constantly manipulating 1943, 1963, and 1983 and the tunnel times connected to these moments?<br />These are just some of things that will start you thinking after reading this. I highly recommend this book if only for the intellectual exercise of running through the possibilities!	2003-06-11

The first time I heard about the Abilene Paradox was back in the early 1980's when Jerry Harvey made a video for use by the government in training management.<br />I had run into a recent management situation in which our Director wanted only agreement with her.  I immediately began to search a reference on \\"Abilene\\" and management.<br />So, immediately, you can see how much this little video lecture influenced me.  Over twenty years later, I still remembered the reference that was needed now in 2003, and it was called the road to \\"ABILENE\\" or something similar.<br />A quick search on my favorite reference site \\"Amazon.com\\" and voila: I found a book called the \\"Abilene Paradox\\".<br />Jerry writes likes he speaks but *OH* he speaks in such an amazingly entertaining way.<br />Jerry gives a lot of examples of things that can happen in the workplace that will bring you down a path to disaster.  He is amazingly accurate in pointing out the potholes to avoid.<br />Although, he is a bit shy on things you should do, I highly recommend this book.  If all you get out this is that \\"Yes\\" men or \\"Yes\\" folks are not conducive to good business, then you have learned one gem of management that you will value forever.	2003-06-11

If you bite, she'll even do a reading for you ... very costly!<br />Listed as non-fiction... but it would be difficult to discern if it is another marketing tool or truth.<br />This book gave me the distinct impression that it is more about profitting Sylvia and less about giving me truth.	2001-10-29

This book provides a possible explanation.<br />If you have never had a paranormal experience (specifically ghosts, spirits), you may not find this credible.  But, if you have had one of those odd experiences such as seeing a ghost, being touched when someone is not there, or just having that creepy feeling of someone watching you, then this book makes the next leap in those experiences.<br />What if that ghost/spirit liked you enough to hang out with you forever?  Well, this book provides a method to get rid of entities that just &quot;love you to death&quot;.<br />Dr. Fiore tells you how she handles the &quot;Unquiet Dead&quot; in her clinical setting.<br />This book is a great read and I would highly recommend that you also read the book, &quot;Remote Depossession&quot; by Dr. Irene Hickman.	2001-10-29

But I am sure that you can give you money to this author because he is following the new trend:  Give the most absolute basics of common sense in book form and millions will buy it.<br />I truly wish someone had written this review for me before I had purchased this.  If you really are curious as to why this is a best seller:  get it from your library.	2001-10-23

He takes all the consistent reporting and analyzes them.  <br />He forms his theory from decades of case analyses.  He did not discard portions which did not fit his theories (as many other noted Ufologists).<br />I highly recommend this book.  It gives a more complete and concise summary of mutliple decades of UFO research.	2001-08-17

When the verdict first came to the public, I felt that it was highly probable that the jury returned the correct verdict. I am not for Jury nulification... nor any other cause other than the jury's true charge: to find the truth.<br /> My entire problem with the media's lynching of OJ was that OJ was a great athlete but not that great! How did he execute someone by beheading and not get oceans of blood everywhere? He had only 15 to 30 minutes. He had to get to Nicole's home and back to his in that time, AND behead Nicole and fight with and then kill Ron.<br /> He could have done the old &quot;Lizzie Bordon&quot; theory where he performed premeditated murder while naked. But the neighborhood in which all of this activity occurred was not rural nor even suburban. It was a neighborhood full of single and multiple family dwellings. People would notice a naked Hertz Man running and vaulting through the streets and sidewalks.<br /> Mr. Dear gets the answer with no remaining unanswered questions. I highly encourage anyone who had ever formed an opinion on this crime to read this book. <br /> I especially would like to see every single media reporter read this. Once you read this, you may rethink your opinion of whether or not the media &quot;reports&quot; or &quot;creates&quot; news.	2001-08-17
US	51144163	R3L9OA5GMATZUH	0915689081	631349488	Remote depossession	Books	4	13	13	N	Y	Excellent content but needed some spellchecking	The content of this book is very valuable in that Dr. Hickman addresses a very unique approach to therapy.  Dr. Hickman hypnotizes an assistant who then reads a remotely located patient/person, and then the assistant removes spirits or dark entities to the light.<br />I appreciate the fact that she mentions St Michael and his helpers.  St Michael is critical to this work.<br />The only reason that I gave only 4 stars is that Dr. Hickman must have written this on a manual typewriter and failed to have a spell/grammar check done by an editor.  There are glaring errors in every chapter.<br />I highly recommend that one also reads Dr. Edith Fiore's book, The Unquiet Dead.	2001-07-20
US	51144163	R2CTGX24ITAUZO	1931055440	86345558	The Facade	Books	5	16	18	N	Y	Must read for anyone wanting an answer to UFO who, what, why	This is the most thought provoking book that I have ever read on the subject of UFO's.<br />Michael Heiser uses actual official documentation, quotes from actual historical figures, and translations from ancient texts. In this context, he writes a fictitional accounting of a group of folks abducted by our &quot;government&quot; to assist in the UFO problem. He provides some of the most obvious lies given to the Americans by the U.S. government and a possible explanation as to why the G-men lied.<br />Even if you never had an interest in UFO's, this is one of the best written mystery, horror, and/or conspiracy novels.<br />After having read a lot of Jacques Vallee works, this is the next step in that line of thought. I would review more, but I really wish for you to read this book and I don't want to give away the story.<br />The author has a website at which you may find all the places which carry this novel for sale.	2001-05-31

If one takes this work as fictional approach to secret societies and intrigue therein, then the book is entertaining.  BUT this individual wants us to take his work as a piece of non-fiction. Luckily (if this is truly non-fiction) I read this so that I now I know for sure than no woman of any intelligence would want to follow this man. I give two stars just for the look into his belief of secret society workings.	2001-01-03

If you can only afford one book on Edgar Cayce, then this is the one to purchase.  I have read every book in the library on the sleeping prophet.  This book was publishing orignally in the 1940's and is written by a person who actually knew Edgar Cayce.<br />This book provides a history of Mr. Cayce from birth to death and provides the essentials for understanding who, what, when, and where of the sleeping prophet.  Once you have that basic history of the man, then you can more easily concentrate other areas that he addressed such as healing, Atlantis, Egyptians, prophecy, etc.	2001-01-03
