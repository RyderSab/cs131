The Corrected Text	Books	5	6	7	N	N	My First Foray into Faulkner - Wow	I probably would never have touched any book by Faulkner - the sentiment that seems to be unconsciously passed down from generation to generation is that Faulkner is dense to the point of impenetrability (is that a word?) - if I hadn't had to read &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; for a class on American literature.  I'm glad I took the class; this book was a wonderful surprise.  It brought me back to the pure joys of reading, the delight I feel any time I tackle something truly meaty.  Admittedly, &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; is confusing, even schizophrenic, in its multiple narrators and its page-long sentences.  You can't read it half-heartedly; I had to turn off the stereo and retreat to the quiet of my room to give it my full attention.  And I was blown away.  There is so much here for a literature lover to delve into.  I won't even bother offering a synopsis - it wouldn't make much sense, and you should just read it anyway.  I've heard people say that one shouldn't read &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; for their first Faulkner experience, and I can see why: this book is hard work.  Still, it has inspired me to explore the rest of Faulkner's bibliography.  And to read other books I was hesitant to read before.  And it reminded me why I love to read.  Not bad for a book I was dreading.	2004-03-20

These details are rendered in lovely, deliberate prose, and the book is a pleasant one for curling up on the couch on a particularly lazy afternoon.  Lahiri has a distinctive voice - no small accomplishment - and she is a very talented writer, but not yet a great one.  \\"The Namesake\\" - like \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\", Lahiri's slightly better short-story collection - is very good, but lacks the passion that makes good works great.  The Gangulis are well-drawn, multi-dimensional characters; they just need a dose of passion to bring them to life.  Lahiri's writing describes, it narrates, but it lacks vibrancy and any hint of danger.  When it becomes less inhibited, it will be truly great.	2004-03-15

I was pleased to discover that Franzen's novel lives up to its accolades; it is a sad, funny, ultimately very HUMAN story, one in which you can really lose yourself among the characters.  The Lamberts might be an exaggeratedly disfunctional family, but getting to know and understand them is a wonderful, if occasionally bittersweet, experience.  I've enjoyed Franzen's short stories and essays in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and after reading &quot;The Corrections&quot;, I am further convinced of his talent.  Don't miss out on his work.  It's a real treat for one who enjoys an engrossing read.	2003-08-27

As a student of literature and culture, I think it's an absolutely brilliant satire; as a sarcastic person with an odd sense of humor, I find it immensely pleasurable to read and re-read.  The first time around, it can seem pointlessly bizarre, and it's easy to lose sight of the fact that satire is an extremely difficult genre to pull off well.  And &quot;Catch-22&quot; pretty much wrote the book (no pun intended) on satire.  What's frightening is how prescient it is, how uncomfortably close to truth satire is.  Re-reading &quot;Catch 22&quot; during the war with Iraq is a supremely creepy experience.  But I guess that speaks to how important it is as a work of literature.  If you haven't read it, you should.  If you have, you should read it again.	2003-06-20

That was my junior year of high school.  Flash forward a few years to college, and it's on the reading list again.  &quot;Why, oh why?&quot; I moan.  Then I read the thing.  And you know what I discover?  It's a masterpiece.<br />Chinua Achebe describes &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; as a response to Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, which is, comparatively, a denser, perhaps less accessible read.  The parallels are there: the ominous drumbeats Marlow describes as mingling with his heartbeat are here given a source and a context.  We, as readers, are invited into the lives of the Ibo clan in Nigeria.  We learn their customs, their beliefs, terms from their language.  Okonkwo, the main character, is the perfect anti-hero.  He is maybe Achebe's ultimate creation: flawed, angry, deeply afraid but outwardly fierce.  To have given us a perfect hero would have been to sell the story of these people drastically short.  Achebe's great achievement is in rendering them as humans, people we can identify with.  So they don't dress like Americans, or share our religious beliefs.  Who's to say which method is correct, or if there has to be a correct and incorrect way.  Achebe provokes thoughtfulness and important questions.  His narrative is easy to read structurally, but the story itself is painful and frustrating.  It is worthy of its subject.<br />&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; provoked some of the best classroom discussions I've ever experienced.  As a reader, it has enriched my life.  My thanks to Achebe for his marvelous contribution to literature.  This book has a permanent place on my shelves.	2002-09-14

It's a leviathan, that's for sure.  You truly have to tackle this thing and never look back.  And when you're done, you'll feel exhausted.  Maybe a little disappointed.  I don't know.  On one hand, I'm really impressed by Danielewski's (frightening) imagination.  Few people could think up a project (it seems like more than a book) like this.  The design is very impressive, if at times overwhelming.  And I definitely stayed glued to the page.  Yet I stopped just short of being completely drawn in.  &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is pretty in love with itself, and the overall effect, for me, was one of pretension.  That leaves me a bit cold.  Still, this thing is quite an experience and I'd recommend giving it a try.  You'll never come across anything like it again.	2002-07-26

Massie has written two other fine histories on the Romanovs, &quot;Peter the Great&quot; and &quot;The Romanovs: The Final Chapter&quot;, but &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; remains his masterpiece.

Reading this memoir, I was swept up in her powerful and evocative language; I could see everything unfolding very clearly in my mind's eye. I can think of few authors who have such a gift for taking the complex subjects of life and reducing them to such simple and, well, truthful statements. Karr has a brilliance indicated by the fact that 'Liars' Club' is such a simple read. It's a stroke of luck, too, for it could make the most reluctant reader believe in stories again.

I was thirteen the first time I read it, sixteen the second time. I don't say this to brag; rather, I want to encourage more people to read this astounding book. I think people are afraid of it because of its size. But if I can read it, you can! Russia comes alive through Tolstoy's pen in the most amazing way. He paints the vast landscapes, the passionate Russian people, the historical events of the times (the early 1800s) like a master painter. &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot; is, in effect, art, a massive collage of images, textures, and colors. It is soap operatic in that it has several threads woven together within the narrative. Occasionally, it is difficult to keep them apart, but does get better if you just stick with it. I understand that there are some parts many people find boring, such as Tolstoy's philosophizing and his lengthy descriptions. Yet those, to me, make this novel even more vivid, the characters and Tolstoy himself more alive. Tolstoy has a gift with characters; you feel transported back to the nineteenth century drawing rooms of wealthy Russia, with the silken swish of ladies' skirts and the haze of cigar smoke. &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot; is not for everyone. Yet those who make their way through it will be rewarded many times over.	2001-06-05

Instead, it starts with her mother and grandmother, and her father and uncles. In doing so, Leaming allows the reader, throughout the course of the book, to come to a better understanding of Hepburn psychologically, as opposed to just presenting facts related to career and private life. The bulk of the biography is devoted to Hepburn's relationships, including those with Howard Hughes, John Ford, Leland Hayward, and, of course, Spencer Tracy. For one more interested in details of Hepburn's historic career, this is not the most insightful book. But for those wanting a peek into the mystique that is the Great Kate, Leaming's biography is tantalizing and absorbing.	2001-06-03
